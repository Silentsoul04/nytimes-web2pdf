It's 2015, and one Brooklyn middle school is about to receive a huge
influx of new students.

In this episode, Chana Joffe-Walt, a reporter, follows what happens when
the School of International Studies' 6th grade class swells from 30
mostly Latino, Black and Middle Eastern students, to 103~--- an influx
almost entirely driven by white families.

Everyone wants ``what's best for the school,'' but it becomes clear that
they don't share the same vision of what ``best'' means.

\textbf{Up next: In Episode 2, Chana digs into New York City's Municipal
Archives to trace the complicated history of integration at the school
--- and across the city.}

White parents in the 1960s fought to be part of a new, racially
integrated school in Brooklyn. So why did their children never attend?
