Over a million New York City students and teachers are still unsure of
when and how they might return to school this fall. Their classrooms are
capsules of those panicked final days in March, when schools abruptly
shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

As a parent, it feels impossible to keep up with the politicized debate
over reopening schools. I wanted to bring the focus back to the
classrooms and the voices of the people that occupy them, who care for
and educate our children. In July, I visited schools around the city to
photograph the spaces that children like mine abruptly left.

“It feels like walking into Pompeii — everything frozen at a precise

“There was a great sense of urgency, and we had to be nimble. We had
kids grab their personal belongings from classrooms, lockers, and
cubbies, and tried to get computers and iPads into the students’ hands,
too.”

Overnight, principals and administrators had to negotiate between
anxious parents, city officials and teachers. They were forced to become
experts in personal protection equipment, conduct health screenings, and
support students through loss and grief.

At P.S./M.S. 5 public school in the South Bronx, Principal Danielle
Keane was asked to visit a young student, after her mother died from
Covid-19.

“Do you know what passed means?” Principal Keane remembers asking the
girl.

“Well, my brothers are crying,” she said, “so it can’t be good.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It means Mommy died.” Ms. Keane said, her voice breaking as she told me
the story. “Never in a million years could I have imagined that was a
role I’d be taking on as a principal. Schools are central to the
community — we’re the first call.”

As infections continue to spike nationwide, President Trump
[threatened](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280853299600789505?s=20)
to cut federal funding for districts that defied his demand to resume
classes in person. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos
[claimed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/23/devoss-claim-that-children-are-stoppers-covid-19/)
that children are “stoppers” of the virus, despite health officials
saying there’s no evidence of that. Public health and the well being of
our children appear to run a distant second to getting the economy
moving.

But at the schools I visited, the administrators are working on the
practical issues and facing an uncertain future.

“The pandemic has, by a long shot, been the greatest challenge of my
career,” said Bo Lauder, who has been the head of school at Friends
Seminary for the past 18 years. “We’ve never encountered a situation
like this, with details changing almost daily, and serious danger to our
community’s health seemingly lurking around every
corner.”

the largest experiments in human history: How to reopen safely?

“This was an epicenter of the virus. We have a lot of teachers that lost
family and got sick themselves, and they’re scared to death to come
back,” said Principal Keane. “I basically cried at my budget meeting on
Friday — I’ve got teacher salaries and that’s pretty much it. I keep
asking where the tape is for the floor, to measure six feet, but it’s
not here. We might have to furlough cleaning staff though we only have
two now. We only have one nurse. We need more of these people, not
less.”

At schools throughout the New York City, preparations are taking place
around the clock. Classrooms are being mapped out for social distancing;
ventilation systems are being reconfigured; windows are being
retrofitted to open; in upper grades, students will be cycled between
in-person classes and distance learning. At public schools, entire
buildings have been deep cleaned, with custodians working throughout the
pandemic and the summer
break.

Administrators work on strategies and multiple alternate approaches, all
