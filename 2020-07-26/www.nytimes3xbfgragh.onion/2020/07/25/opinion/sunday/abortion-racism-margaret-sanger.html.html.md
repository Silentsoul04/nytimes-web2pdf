<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This week, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced that [it
would remove Margaret Sanger’s
name](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/us/margaret-sanger-planned-parenthood-trnd/index.html)
from its Manhattan Health Center. The grounds were Sanger’s eugenic
ideas and alliances, which for years have been highlighted by
anti-abortion advocates and minimized by her admirers. Under the
pressures of the current moment, apparently, that minimization isn’t
sustainable any more.

This is an interesting shift from just a year ago, when Clarence Thomas
faced a wave of [media
scorn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/31/clarence-thomas-tried-link-abortion-eugenics-seven-historians-told-post-hes-wrong/?utm_term=.0c5106b1bcd7)
when he took note of Sanger’s eugenic sympathies. But Thomas was citing
Sanger’s writings to suggest that abortion in America *today* reflects a
kind of structural racism — an inherited tendency, which persists even
without racist intent, for pro-abortion policies to reduce minority
births more than white births. Whereas the removal of Sanger’s name,
presumably, was intended to drive home the opposite point — to establish
a clear separation between past and present, between racism then and
abortion rights today.

But the difficulty is that according to current thinking on how
structural racism lingers and what anti-racism requires, Thomas still
seems to have a reasonable case.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That thinking emphasizes, first, the persistent influence of
formerly-institutionalized racism even in the absence of conscious
racists, and second, the importance of assessing every policy based on
its effects on racial equality. “There is no such thing as a nonracist
or race-neutral policy,” writes the best-selling theorist Ibram X.
Kendi. “Every policy in every institution in every community in every
nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now apply these frameworks to the history of Planned Parenthood. The
organization had eugenic ideas close to its root, and while Sanger
herself was pro-contraception rather than pro-abortion, her successors
championed both abortion rights and [global population control
policies](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674034600)
that were racist by any reasonable definition.

Then when abortion was legalized in the United States, with Planned
Parenthood’s strong support, its initial effect was a sharp decline in
minority births. According to the Wellesley economist Phillip Levine,
white births dipped only slightly after legalization, while the nonwhite
birthrate dropped by 15 percent. Fifty years later, the abortion rate is
[five
times](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/abortions-racial-gap/380251/)
higher for African-Americans than for whites.

So in this story, a worldview with racist antecedents wins a major
policy victory that immediately has a disproportionate effect on
minority birthrates. And then there is the further twist that over the
longer run, Roe v. Wade and the sexual revolution probably changed
family structure as well, as George Akerlof and (future Fed chair) Janet
Yellen [argued in a 1996
paper](https://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/),
by creating a wider space for men to expect sex without commitment and
to behave irresponsibly toward pregnant woman: “By making the birth of
the child the physical choice of the mother,” they wrote, “the sexual
revolution has made marriage and child support a social choice of the
father.”

Like the abortion rate itself, this trend — the long rise of
fatherlessness — has been steeper in poor and vulnerable communities. So
it, too, has helped to sustain racial inequality, by reserving to [the
whiter upper
classes](https://douthat.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/01/29/social-liberalism-as-class-warfare/)
the socioeconomic advantages that two-parent families enjoy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Keep following this logic, and you might conclude that if Planned
Parenthood really took anti-racism seriously it would repent of its
support for abortion, and devote itself exclusively to helping support
African-American pregnancies instead.

Are you convinced? I expect not. Maybe you think the decline of the
two-parent family is strictly about de-industrialization. Maybe you
believe the benefits of abortion access for minority women outweigh
whatever power lower birthrates cost the African-American community writ
large.

Maybe you think the nuclear family was itself a form of white or Western
oppression, and any anti-racism that requires its revival isn’t worthy
of the name. (This appears to be the position of the official [Black
Lives Matters](https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/)
organization.) Or maybe you simply think abortion is an absolute human
right, which must be defended even if, as policy, it appears to have a
disparate racial impact.

Each of these claims could spin out another column in response. For now,
I just want the skeptical reader to consider, through the case of
Planned Parenthood’s history and abortion’s social consequences, just
how complicated the questions opened up by concepts like structural
racism and the racism/anti-racism binary can become.

Followed rigorously to their conclusions, they may lead to surprising or
inconvenient ideological conclusions, to intersectional dilemmas no
doctrine can resolve, or just to a deep uncertainty about the best path
to racial redress.

Or they might even lead to a creeping sense that Clarence Thomas has a
point: that at the very moment that America finally granted
African-Americans full citizenship, it also embarked on a separate
social revolution, whose most ruthless feature — the belief that
equality and liberty require removing protections from unborn human life
— left a specific stamp on the African-American experience, just as the
most ruthless features of our history always do.
