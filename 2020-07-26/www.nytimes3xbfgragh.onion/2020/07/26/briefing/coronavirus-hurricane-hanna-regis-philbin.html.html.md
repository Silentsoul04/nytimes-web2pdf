soar.

[Eighteen states set single-day case
records](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?#link-67763577)
in the past week, pushing the country closer to breaking the national
single-day record for new cases, set less than two weeks ago. More than
73,500 were reported on Friday and more than 66,300 coronavirus cases on
Saturday. The record is 75,697. [Here’s the latest map and case
count](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?a).

With more than 4 million known infections and nearly **146,300** deaths,

climb](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/23/us/coronavirus-hospitalizations-us.html?).

**2. The Amazon River,** South America’s essential life source, is
unleashing the virus on the entire region. We spent weeks on the river
documenting the toll.

Brazil has the second-highest death toll in the world — behind only the
U.S. The six cities with the [highest coronavirus exposure are all on
the Amazon
River,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/25/world/americas/coronavirus-brazil-amazon.html?)
according to researchers. Nearly everyone there relies on the river and
the boats that travel along it — for transportation, food, medicine.
Researchers say they are behind the spread of the virus.

The region’s ability to confront the pandemic has been further weakened
under President Jair Bolsonaro, who has publicly mocked it, even though
he tested positive himself.

The U.S. still has by far the largest outbreak in the world, while much
of Europe and Asia has flattened the curve. [This
chart](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/23/us/coronavirus-hotspots-countries.html?)
shows how the U.S. compares with other hot
spots.

**3. We’re tracking Hurricane Hanna** as it bears down on southern
Texas, a region that is struggling to contain the pandemic.

The Category 1 storm, [the first hurricane of the Atlantic
season](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/hanna-storm-texas.html),
brought harsh winds and rain to Corpus Christi, above, and the
surrounding area. Winds could reach up to 110 m.p.h., the National
Weather Service warned. A storm surge warning reached as far north as
about 75 miles south of Houston. Hanna’s eye made landfall on Padre
Island, about 60 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border with winds of 90
m.p.h.

Nueces County, which includes Corpus Christi, has had nearly 2,000 new
virus cases and 47 deaths in the past seven days alone. The spike was
[fueled in part by visitors who flocked to the beach
city](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/us/coronavirus-texas-corpus-christi.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)
because of its low case
count.

**4. Federal agents are venturing** blocks from the buildings they were
sent to protect in Portland. Oregon officials say they are[illegally
taking on the role of riot
police](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/portland-federal-legal-jurisdiction-courts.html).

“I think it’s absolutely improper,” Oregon’s attorney general, Ellen

What began as a movement for racial justice in the wake of George

forces](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/portland-protests-explained-protesters.html),
who arrived this month to help control protests. Ostensibly there to
protect federal property, the agents have made dozens of arrests for
federal crimes.

Each night, for nearly 60 days straight, a “[Wall of
Moms”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/americas/protest-moms-power-police.html)
has formed; they’re now joined by a “Wall of Vets,” who have [banded

**5. Nearly 100 days from Election Day,** the fight over free and fair
elections — and faith in the outcome — [has become a cornerstone of the
race](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/politics/2020-election-voter-fraud-interference.html).

President Trump has claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting leads
to fraud and pre-emptively cast doubt on the credibility of the final
results, while Joe Biden has warned of foreign interference and
cautioned that his opponent might seek to disrupt the election.

And then there are the hazards of voting in a pandemic-challenged
election year. Take Georgia, for example, where, as one poll worker put
it, [a “complete meltdown” took place during the state’s June
primary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/politics/georgia-election-voting-problems.html).
Voters waited for hours, only to be met with malfunctioning equipment.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A Times examination found that Georgia’s top elections official, the
secretary of state, remained passive despite repeated warnings about the
rollout of a highly complex voting system. Questions have also emerged
about the accuracy of the vote count. Above, the State Farm Arena in
Atlanta is an early-voting site for the August primary runoff and for
the general
election.

**6. Sports are … coming back.**

The M.L.B. and
[W.N.B.A.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/sports/basketball/wnba-season-preview.html)
returned to play this week after a long hiatus because of the pandemic.

[Breanna
Stewart](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/sports/basketball/breanna-stewart-seattle-storm-wnba.html)
and the Seattle Storm won the first game of the season against [Sabrina
Ionescu](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/sports/basketball/wnba-eastern-conference-preview.html),
above, and the New York Liberty. The season is [dedicated to Breonna
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/sports/wnba-seattle-storm-new-york-liberty.html),
who died in a police shooting.

There may have been cardboard cutouts in the seats in place of fans, but
the return of baseball “was so much better than nothing,” [our columnist
writes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/sports/baseball/mlb-opening-day.html).
He wasn’t alone: Opening day was the [most-viewed regular-season
game](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29532370/mlb-opener-was-most-viewed-regular-season-game-2011)
since 2011.

The N.B.A. and N.H.L. will restart their seasons next weekend. Our
basketball reporter says [LeBron James looks as dominant as
ever](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/sports/basketball/nba-lebron-james-lakers.html).

**7. Regis Philbin,** who regaled America over coffee for decades and
introduced the hit “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” died. He was 88.

Universally known as Regis, Mr. Philbin climbed to pre-eminence
relatively late in life on talk and game shows, with patience,
determination and folksy, spontaneous wit. He co-hosted alongside Kathie
Lee Gifford and Kelly Ripa in the mornings for decades, and at night he
turned “Millionaire” into the highest-rated prime-time game show in TV
history.

[In a 2011
interview](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/11/15/arts/television/regis-philbin-looks-back-at-a-long-unscripted-career.html),
Mr. Philbin said that for a long time he felt a certain insecurity about
what his talent really was. But then he eventually figured it out:
“Spontaneous conversation,” he said. “Spontaneity is everything to me,
working without a
net.”

**8. A different way to hang out the laundry.**

Chang Wan-ji, 83, and Hso Sho-er, 84, have become Instagram stars in
quarantine. The Taiwanese couple pose at a place they know well — their
laundromat — and [their funky fashions are curated from customers’
forgotten
garments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/world/asia/taiwan-octogenarian-couple-instagram-laundry.html).
They are naturals in front of the camera.

“I had no idea so many foreigners would take interest in my
grandparents,” said their 31-year-old grandson and unofficial stylist,
who came up with the idea for the [Instagram
account](https://www.instagram.com/wantshowasyoung/?hl=en).

Mr. Chang said he hoped his and his wife’s experience would inspire
other seniors to be active. “It’s better than sitting around watching TV
or napping,” Mr. Chang
said.
