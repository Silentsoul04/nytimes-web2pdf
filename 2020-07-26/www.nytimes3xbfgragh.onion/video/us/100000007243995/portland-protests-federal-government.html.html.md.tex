  Federal officers in military gear \ldots{} \ldots{} clouds of tear gas
  \ldots{} \ldots{} crowd control munitions \ldots{} {[}shots fired{]}
  \ldots{} and locals who want those officers gone. ``What are you guys
  protecting?'' ``Get the {[}expletive{]} out of our city!'' In just
  over a week, the chaotic scenes in Portland grabbed the nation's
  attention and raised questions about whether the U.S. government is
  exceeding its authority and violating civil rights. The officers came
  because of an executive order signed by President Trump in late June
  to protect federal property from destruction. ``If we didn't take a
  stand in Portland, you know, we've arrested many of these leaders. If
  we didn't take that stand, right now you would have a problem like ---
  they were going to lose Portland.'' So what's going on here? And what
  methods are the officers using to protect federal sites? Crowd:
  ``Breonna Taylor!'' The protests against racism and police brutality,
  which started in May, had largely been peaceful and were held across
  Portland. But after federal officers arrived in the city on July 4,
  demonstrations became centered around this U.S. District courthouse
  and this building housing federal agencies. Both are property of the
  U.S. government. The buildings have clearly been vandalized, and the
  Department of Homeland Security has a mandate to protect them. That's
  usually done by officers from the Federal Protective Service. But on
  the ground in Portland, we have seen a new task force, including U.S.
  Marshals \ldots{} \ldots{} BORTAC, a unit of Customs and Border
  Protection \ldots{} \ldots{} and a special response team from ICE, the
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. According to a government
  memo leaked to The Times, these units are insufficiently trained to
  perform crowd control. But that hasn't stopped them from trying. Night
  after night, videos show these officers emerging from the two federal
  buildings as protesters draw near. Hundreds of videos reviewed by The
  Times show that although protesters were antagonistic, officers often
  responded with disproportionate force. {[}shouting{]} They blanketed
  streets with tear gas. ``Are you OK?'' They struck protesters with
  batons \ldots{} \ldots{} and used flash bangs, pepper balls and other
  less-lethal munitions to clear the streets. {[}chanting{]} Their
  actions often appeared to escalate rather than de-escalate matters.
  And in some instances, they attacked when there was no apparent
  threat. On July 11, protester Donavan La Bella was at the federal
  courthouse when an officer appears to have fired at his head in
  retaliation for tossing a spent tear gas canister. ``{[}expletive{]}
  you!'' {[}shot fired{]} La Bella's mother told local media he suffered
  skull fractures and needed surgery. Later that night when field medics
  sought officers' help for a wounded protester, they were aggressively
  cleared away. On July 18, a Navy veteran was batoned and
  pepper-sprayed in another unprovoked attack. His right hand was
  broken, and he needs surgery. Sometimes members of the press were hit.
  ``He got shot in the back, obviously, and he's wearing press ---''
  This photographer, Mathieu Lewis Rolland, told The Times that a volley
  of 10 projectiles were fired into his back. ``Ow, ow, ow!'' In the
  middle of all this, protesters were detained in ways that alarmed
  civil rights advocates and former Homeland Security officials. ``Can
  your people identify themselves as law enforcement?'' On July 15,
  several federal officers were filmed driving in unmarked vehicles in
  the blocks around the courthouse. ``How are we supposed to know who
  you are? How are we supposed to know you're not kidnapping us and
  you're civilians kidnapping us?'' One protester was detained at this
  location nearby. ``What are you doing?'' Federal officers wouldn't
  identify themselves \ldots{} ``Use your words!'' \ldots{} but patches
  on the right and left sides of their uniforms match those used by
  members of BORTAC, the tactical unit from Customs and Border
  Protection. They drove the protester away in an unmarked car. D.H.S.
  says federal officers have made 43 arrests since July 4. Agents do
  have the authority to make arrests if they believe that a federal
  crime has been committed, like damaging federal property or attacking
  officers. Crowd: ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, these racist cops have got to
  go.'' In recent days, the controversy mobilized a larger and more
  diverse crowd of protesters. {[}chanting{]} A so-called wall of moms
  led marches through Portland's streets and to the federal courthouse
  where officers cleared them away. The federal presence has also
  inflamed tensions. Some demonstrators damaged paneling on the
  courthouse and tried to set them alight. Others threw water bottles
  and fired fireworks toward the building. On Wednesday, July 22,
  Portland's mayor joined the protests and was caught in a cloud of tear
  gas. ``This is a egregious overreaction on the part of the federal
  officers. This is not a de-escalation strategy. This is flat-out urban
  warfare.'' At around the same time, a Customs and Border Protection
  plane was spotted circling overhead. C.B.P. officials told The Times
  it was sending a live video feed of the crowd to law enforcement on
  the ground. Crowd: ``No justice, no peace! Protesters and local
  officials say this is all a case of federal overreach. Oregon's
  attorney general has sued the federal government to stop arresting
  people. ``Gas! Gas! Gas!'' The president has doubled down, promising
  to send more federal officers to cities governed by his political
  rivals. ``Because we're not going to let New York and Chicago and
  Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore, and all of these --- Oakland is a
  mess --- we're not going to let this happen in our country. All run by
  liberal Democrats.'' The results could look like a national police
  force acting under presidential orders, able to ignore local demands
  and arrest residents. In Portland, it has been a recipe for chaos.
