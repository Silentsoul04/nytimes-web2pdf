I’ll make an easy prediction about [Wednesday’s congressional
hearing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html)
into the power of big tech companies: Members of Congress will say dumb
things.

But please don’t believe that these people are too old or too clueless
to exercise effective oversight of tech superpowers.

This idea, which is prevalent inside of tech companies, lets the tech
giants off the hook for what they do. It shows a smug superiority that
is not a good look. And it ignores that tech companies are built around
software that is designed not to be understood by outsiders.

*(*[*Follow The Times’s live coverage of the
hearing.*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony)*)*

After Mark Zuckerberg’s [first turns in the congressional hot
seat](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/12/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html)
two years ago, people inside of Facebook thought that [their boss had
completely dominated those old
fogies](https://www.wired.com/story/sigh-of-relief-inside-facebook/).
I’ve heard this from Facebook executives. Their conclusions have
worried me.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Members of Congress were fairly blamed for not understanding Facebook,
but Zuckerberg didn’t get enough blame for failing to make Facebook
understood. He
[dodged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/10/technology/zuckerberg-elections-russia-data-privacy.html),
[occasionally
misled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/04/13/fact-checking-mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-on-facebook-and-data-collection/)
and essentially [tried to say as little as
possible](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-04-12/mark-zuckerberg-refuses-to-admit-how-facebook-works)
about how Facebook works. At points, he didn’t seem to know how Facebook
worked, either.

Executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple at [a hearing last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html)
likewise seemed to intentionally deflect or dismiss what were generally
excellent questions from lawmakers. (Seriously, I could have stared at
C-SPAN for many more hours.) No one inside the big tech companies should
have felt like they “won.”

To be fair, that is part of the theatrics of all congressional hearings.
Members of Congress grandstand and witnesses generally try to be
inoffensive or run out the
clock.

Yet it’s in everyone’s interest to complete this set of hearings [and
effectively address these central
questions:](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/technology/google-antitrust.html)
Are these big technology companies cheating to get a leg up over
competitors? If so, does that hurt all of us and what — if anything —
should the government do about it?

If members of Congress are confused about how to ask and answer these
questions, that’s partly because big tech companies *are* confusing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Few people on the outside can truly understand how Amazon influences the
prices of products we buy on its site or [at other
retailers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-05/amazon-is-squeezing-sellers-that-offer-better-prices-on-walmart);
assess fears that Google [funnels people to its own
websites](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors)
or that Apple [steers people to its own
apps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html);
or peer into Facebook’s [strategy to squash rivals in their
cribs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/05/technology/facebook-emails-privacy-data.html).
All of this is, by design, shrouded in secrecy and mystery.

Even many of the big tech companies now say that there needs to be more
federal oversight and rules regarding areas like protecting elections
and what constitutes appropriate speech online.

That means everyone — the tech companies, lawmakers and you and me —
have a vested interest in getting under the hood of these big companies
and seeing how they work.

This is a worthy goal — just as it was to assess the big banks after the
2008 financial crisis. Those banks also thought Congress was too
clueless to question them effectively. Maybe so, but [regulation came
anyway](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/07/16/business/16regulate.html).

## Don’t fall for these distractions at the hearing

Me again, taking another moment to talk about Wednesday’s hearing —
Sorry\! Not sorry\! — to explain what it is NOT about.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**How big the tech companies are compared with the planet Jupiter:** In
his [prepared
testimony](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20200729/110883/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-BezosJ-20200729.pdf)
for Wednesday’s hearing, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos cited competition from the
grocery delivery service Instacart and mentioned the fast sales growth
of Walmart’s online shopping operation.

Sure, but online sales at those companies are a minuscule fraction of
Amazon’s. There will be a lot of slicing and dicing of data for
misdirection like this. Please ignore.

The assessment of tech company power is not solely about their size or
that of rivals. It is also about their *behavior*: Do big tech companies
tilt the game to their advantage in a way that creates less competition?

**Whether these sites show political bias:** We’ll hear a lot about this
today, because some conservatives and Republican politicians argue that
big tech companies habitually [squash
information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/15/us/donald-trump-twitter-facebook-youtube.html)
reflecting conservative perspectives.

There’s little credible reporting to support this, but a root cause of
the concern is what I mentioned above: Outsiders can’t see or assess the
software that determines what information we see online. Black boxes
naturally create suspicion.

How tech companies influence what information we’re exposed to, and how
they fairly police what people say online, are complicated topics worthy
of debate. However, I’m not sure that there’s a direct connection
between those topics and the central question at Wednesday’s hearing: Do
big tech companies cheat to win?

**How many American jobs they create:** In [a letter to
Congress](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20200729/110883/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-PichaiS-20200729.pdf),
Google’s chief executive touted a (delicious sounding) brownie shop in
New York that drums up business from buying ads on Google. Bezos [talked
up](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20200729/110883/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-BezosJ-20200729.pdf)
Amazon training programs to pay for warehouse workers to move into
higher-paying careers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This is great\! We want American companies to create jobs and contribute
to economic growth. But companies that create jobs and support small
businesses can still break the law by unfairly exercising their power
and influence.

## Before we go …

  - **How to support alternatives to Big Tech:** My colleague Brian X.
    Chen tells us how we can [help tech’s little
    guys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/personaltech/big-tech-power-how-to-fight.html)
    if we’re concerned about having choices. Brian suggests trying the
    search engine DuckDuckGo, the social network Mastodon and other
    alternatives to Big Tech products; advises us to buy used
    electronics to help repair shops and resellers; and asks us to
    consider paying for software we like from smaller companies rather
    than taking freebies from the tech giants.

  - **That coronavirus video was tailored to go wild:** My colleagues
    Sheera Frenkel and Davey Alba walked through [the stagecraft of a
    viral
    video](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html)
    that promoted an unproven coronavirus treatment as a miracle cure.
    With ingredients including an official-looking setting, people in
    white medical coats and the ability to clip the video and share it
    on social media easily, the video had been designed to appeal to
    those who don’t trust public health officials and want quick fixes
    to get past the pandemic.

  - **Can facial recognition technology be effective, unbiased and do
    more good than harm?** Those are questions raised by [this Reuters
    investigation](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-riteaid-software/)
    into the use of the technology at 200 Rite Aid drugstores in the
    United States.
    
    Facial recognition systems that were intended partly to notify store
    workers about potential shoplifters were more likely to be installed
    at stores in neighborhoods with a large share of lower-income or
    Black or Latino residents, and shoppers were not generally told that
    their images were being captured and analyzed. At times the facial
    recognition software also misidentified people. Rite Aid told
    Reuters it had suspended use of the cameras.

### Hugs to this

This [dancing duet of a woman and
cat](https://www.tiktok.com/@bizqueen/video/6852740756692569349) is just
plain weird. (Thanks to the Bloomberg columnist [Tae
Kim](https://twitter.com/firstadopter) for bringing this TikTok video
into my life.)
