## That’s a lot of money

“It’s certainly been a busy week, and I’m glad to be here,” Sundar
Pichai told investors, as he presented Alphabet’s latest earnings. The
day after he and his counterparts at Amazon, Apple and Facebook faced a
[five-hour congressional
grilling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/dealbook/tech-hearing-highlights.html),
the tech giants all unveiled better-than-expected profits — much, much
better than expected.

**Combined, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook earned more than $28
billion.** In after-hours trading, the companies [added $250
billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-30/a-day-after-congress-grilling-big-tech-stocks-add-250-billion)
to their market caps, according to Bloomberg, pushing the total value of
the firms above $5 trillion, or about a fifth of the entire S\&P 500.

**Talk about good timing.** Focusing on [the bumper
haul](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
was a relief for the executives, who were on the defensive in front of
lawmakers. It was also probably better to unveil such gaudy numbers
*after* answering pointed questions about their [outsize
power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/big-tech-ceos.html)
and the potential for abuse of their dominant positions. The earnings
awkwardly followed a series of grim economic statistics released earlier
in the day — more on that below — showing a steep drop in U.S. economic
output and millions of workers struggling to find jobs.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• **Alphabet** reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue,
hurt by a slowdown in advertising, but its $7 billion profit comfortably
beat analyst forecasts. Mr. Pichai was the most forthcoming with
investors about the regulatory scrutiny that Big Tech faces. “We
realize, at our scale, that’s appropriate,” he said.

• **Amazon** had warned investors to expect profits to be wiped out by
$4 billion in coronavirus-related costs. Although the firm spent as much
as promised, sales grew so fast that it turned a $5 billion profit for
the second quarter, double the result of the year before. Its
second-quarter sales of $89 billion were $8 billion more than analysts
expected.

• **Facebook** reported that profits doubled, to $5 billion, as its
monthly active users rose by 12 percent, to 2.7 billion. A boycott by
big advertisers could hurt its bottom line, the company warned, but it
said that sales so far are holding up in the current quarter.

• **Apple** said that its profit rose by 12 percent, to more than $11
billion. Its service business performed particularly well, including
sales from the App Store, a particular focus of antitrust interest. The
congressional committee investigating the tech giants released a trove
of internal emails this week, including [some from the Apple co-founder
Steve
Jobs](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller)
dating to the early 2010s about how to prevent Apple users from buying
e-books via Amazon’s apps.

common? They’re all around $195 billion.

## Here’s what is happening

**President Trump stokes outrage by suggesting a delay to the
election.** On Twitter, he questioned whether the elections on Nov. 3
should proceed as planned, [drawing
condemnation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-delay-election.html)
even from allies in Congress. Here’s why [he has no
power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-postpone-election.html)
to make that happen.

**Vaccine makers race to build supply lines.** Drug companies face
pressure not just to test their coronavirus vaccines quickly, but also
to [produce them in huge
quantities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/drugmakers-race-to-build-covid-19-vaccine-supply-chains-11596101586).
Separately, Gilead said it hopes to produce enough remdesivir, its
Covid-19 treatment, to meet global demand [by
October](https://www.ft.com/content/64572a4a-3237-4d62-9928-d90ba49d8c8d).

**Corporate America can’t quit buybacks.** While share repurchases are
expected to drop this year, S\&P 500 companies are [still buying back
shares](https://www.ft.com/content/1c924be0-5bc0-4eba-a088-b98b13080c04)
in the second quarter, in some cases more than in the first, The
Financial Times reports.

**Basketball is back.** The N.B.A. [resumed its
season](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/basketball/clippers-lakers.html)
yesterday from its bubble at Walt Disney World with a pair of
nail-biters. (And all the players, coaches and referees [took a knee
during the national
anthems](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-players-referees-all-kneel-as-national-anthem-plays-before-jazz-pelicans-bubble-tipoff-225215284.html).)
The question now is whether the league’s quarantined approach will spare
it the problems bedeviling Major League Baseball, as [more games were
postponed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/baseball/phillies-blue-jays-postponed-coronavirus.html)
after team employees tested positive for the coronavirus.

**SpaceX faces its next test.** The two astronauts who traveled to the
International Space Station on the company’s rocket are [scheduled to
return to
Earth](https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-live-spacex-crew-dragon-returns-to-earth-august-2-2020-7)
this weekend. (Assuming Tropical Storm Isaias doesn’t force a
postponement.) Elon Musk has said that the Crew Dragon’s re-entry into
the atmosphere is his biggest concern. You can watch the journey live

## Five years of growth vanishes in months

The U.S. economy recorded one its [most severe declines in
history](https://twitter.com/jimtankersley/status/1288846477448617985)
in the second quarter, as the pandemic erased years of growth with
terrifying speed. Output [fell by nearly 10
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)
in the three months to June; during the 2008 recession, G.D.P. fell by
“only” 4 percent over an 18-month span.

**It could be worse.** Aggressive stimulus programs have cushioned the
blow, as reflected in this extraordinary chart showing how programs like
extra unemployment insurance and payroll support have bolstered incomes
during the downturn, breaking the usual relationship between income and
economic
output.

**It might get worse.** U.S. lawmakers have [been unable to
agree](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/senate-virus-aid.html)
on an extension to supplemental unemployment benefits, which expire
today. More than a million people have submitted new jobless claims for
19 consecutive weeks, with signs that the recovery in the labor market
is stalling as coronavirus cases rise. Without extra stimulus,
[economists
warn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/30/economists-favor-big-stimulus/),
the shock of the pandemic could do permanent damage to the economy. In
other words, the blue line in the chart will follow the red one
downwards, feeding an economic spiral.

## ‘Innovation on steroids’

The pandemic has disrupted life as we knew it, and the Trump
administration has upended American policies along with it. The Times
foreign affairs columnist Tom Friedman joined us for a DealBook Debrief
call with readers to make sense of it all. ([Here’s the
recording](https://youtu.be/4SykcA8jKhQ), if you missed it.) Some
highlights:

**• “I think he’s out for regime change.”**

President Trump has broken countless norms of political life, both at
home and abroad, in ways that Tom said worried him greatly. One area of
particular concern is China policy, where Mr. Trump’s hard-line approach
is both too headstrong and counterproductive. Of Beijing’s leaders, Tom
said, “they know as long as Trump is president, he can never galvanize
the global coalition” against them.

**• “We are going to see innovation on steroids.”**

Not all of the upheaval of recent months has been bad. While
acknowledging the toll of the pandemic on lives and livelihoods, Tom
said that changes brought about in response to the coronavirus have set
us up for “one of the most massive, amazing, creative and destructive
periods of human history.” Innovative thinking, aided by advanced and
cheap technology, could bring major changes to how we live and work.

**• “It’s flatter than ever.”**

Has the pandemic wiped out the idea of globalization? Tom — whose book
“The World Is Flat” examined the increasing interconnectedness of the
21st century — doesn’t think so. “It’s flatter than ever because when it
comes to globalization, I am a technological determinist,” he said,
pointing to the ubiquity of smartphones. “Technology is not just
interconnecting the world,” he added. “It’s actually making the world
interdependent.”

## Weekend reading: A world without friction

One thing that the pandemic has imposed on many businesses is friction.
From sourcing supplies to serving customers, everything has become
harder, for public health-related reasons. Perhaps, then, it’s not the
best time to publish a book titled “[Frictionless: Why the Future of
Everything Will Be Fast, Fluid, and Made Just for
You](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/frictionless-christiane-lemieuxduff-mcdonald).”

The co-authors, Christiane Lemieux and Duff McDonald, are undeterred.
Ms. Lemieux is a designer, entrepreneur and former creative director of
Wayfair; Mr. McDonald is familiar to DealBook readers as the author of
books about [Jamie
Dimon](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/books/review/Barrett-t.html),
[McKinsey](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/in-a-new-book-mckinsey-co-isnt-all-roses/)
and [Harvard Business
School](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/business/dealbook/11-andrew-sorkin-harvard-business-school.html).
So what can a book with case studies about “companies that thrive in the
world of frictionless commerce” reveal about the friction-filled time we
now live in? We asked, and they answered:

> When Covid-19 hit, the concept of frictionlessness was battled-tested
> in the biggest possible way. Everyone was at home. Could that website
> handle the increased traffic? Was it able to adjust to a disrupted
> supply chain? Could it communicate with customers worried about
> getting crucial items like toilet paper or food? The companies that
> have been up to the task already understood the centrality of the
> concept before this national nightmare began.
> 
> Why? Because those companies were ready for Covid-19, even if no one
> could have predicted it. They were already in the flow, making all the
> right and thoughtful moves. They were institutionalizing the concept
> of community. They were building diverse — and dispersed — workforces.
> They made respect for each other a condition of employment, not an
> afterthought.
