The scale of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic shutdowns it
caused set in motion a series of debates and questions about what the
world may look like once its stranglehold on society loosens: Will we
travel less? Will we work at home more? Will norms in schools and at
large-scale public events be changed for years?

Less noticed, but just as important, is the potential that the
coronavirus could be a catalyst to overhaul the global economic order. A
debate on the failures of the global economy had already started before
the pandemic, born of a sense that capitalism and corporations had
become parasites on the planet.

In the aftermath of the pandemic, the world’s rich countries should do
more than just wait for corporations to change. They have to overhaul
their monetary policies, the forms of private investment they
incentivize and the attitudes of their antitrust enforcement.

Until now, monetary policy has rewarded holders of financial assets over
those who have stock in real assets like land, factories and labor.
That’s because the world’s most powerful central banks have
prioritized controlling inflation over expanding industrial capacity and
employment in what’s called the “real economy.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This status quo in central banking, which has been dominant for four
decades, has encouraged corporations, especially the largest publicly
traded companies, to focus on short-term financial gains and share
prices at the expense of pursuing longer-term investments that would
reap more broadly shared rewards. Compounding the gains of those who
already own plenty of capital has resulted in the entrenched income
inequality and stagnant wages that citizens in dozens of countries
bemoan.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve is expected to operate under
its dual mandate to promote “maximum employment” and stabilize prices
(by limiting inflation). However, while central banks like the Fed have
explicit inflation targets — typically aiming to keep the rate at 2
percent — they do not have explicit unemployment targets.

The Fed, could instead put new policies in place that make a very low
unemployment rate — or more aggressively, underemployment rate — the new
trigger for whether it decides to stimulate or hit the financial breaks
on the economy. This shift would avert the risk of depressing wages and
be helpful to groups in the work force who are discriminated against and
often “first fired, last hired.” And crucially, it would reward
companies for longer-term investments that promote real economic growth.

How else can the financial markets be encouraged to prioritize real,
productive investment? Governments can begin to issue higher taxes on
dividend payments to large shareholders of big, publicly traded
companies and pair that with tax reductions on long-term investments.

It’s not surprising that investors — who for years looked at a landscape
of sluggish-to-moderate global growth — have been looking for quick
financial returns rather than productive, but sometimes risky, long-term
investments. Guided by shareholder demands, for the past decade
businesses have focused on delivering returns quickly and predictably to
investors instead of investing in longer-horizon infrastructures — like
research, plants and machinery that would ultimately lead to innovation
and drive economic growth.

According to a 2019 report, “[American Investment in the 21st
Century](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9f25139a-6039-465a-9cf1-feb5567aebb7/4526E9620A9A7DB74267ABEA5881022F.5.15.2019.-final-project-report-american-investment.pdf),”
led by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, net private domestic investment
in fixed assets like equipment, machinery and property has shrunk in
half since the mid-1980s.

Higher taxes on large dividend payments and federal subsidies for
long-term investments could help America reverse course.

We also need to address concentration of corporate power. To overhaul
the prevailing global economic architecture, the globe’s leading
governments will need to address the fact that many sectors — airlines,
banking, technology — have become oligopolies dominated by just a few
multinational corporations. These Gilded Age style markets reduce
competition and concentrate the pricing power of large, well-connected
corporations.

There have been calls to break up technology companies or to limit their
scale and monopolistic tendencies. However, dozens of national
regulators are pitted against global corporations that can use their
multiple bases to evade rules inconvenient to them. So international
regulatory cooperation will be needed to rein in the increasingly
unfettered power of these multinational behemoths.

At a time when many governments seem steered by nationalism, effective
cross-border cooperation is hard to imagine. However, feats of global
cooperation from the past — like the post-World War II establishment of
the Bretton Woods system’s new world order — offer examples of leaders
eventually meeting the moment even amid formidable challenges.

The pandemic is not just giving us a chance to rethink how to best live
and work. It is also providing an opportunity to reconsider the way that
the very structures of our world economy operate.
