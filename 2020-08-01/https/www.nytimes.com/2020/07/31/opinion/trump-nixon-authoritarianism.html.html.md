President Trump has been comparing himself to Richard Nixon, tweeting
[“LAW &
ORDER,”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267227396341669889)
and claiming he [learned a lot from
Nixon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY12Llo847I). Others have been
comparing [Mr. Trump’s handling of civil disorder to
Nixon’s.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/floyd-trump-nixon-coronavirus.html)
No one will ever tag me a Nixon apologist, but in Nixon’s defense these
claims are hooey.

I worked for our last authoritarian president, Richard Nixon — a man who
experienced violent protests and demonstrations throughout his political
career. In 1968, he ran as the “law and order” candidate, for it was [a
time of
tumult](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/trump-nixon-1968-law-and-order-america):
assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert
Kennedy. Riots ripped Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis,
Washington and other major cities. Civil rights and antiwar protests
closed down campuses large and small. There were nightly news reports of
endless death from the killing fields of Vietnam, including the Tet
offensive and the My Lai massacre.

Nixon was running on credentials established long before the 1968
presidential contest. As vice president, Nixon and his wife [traveled
though South
America](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v05/comp4),
where they frequently were confronted by protesters. Nixon used those
protest situations to brandish his I-am-fearless image by walking among
the protesters to make clear that he was not intimidated, nor would they
influence American policy.

On becoming president in 1969, Nixon inherited a global anti-Vietnam War
protest movement that had contributed to the decision of his
predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, not to seek re-election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From his first day in office, Nixon faced [huge
demonstrations,](https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/nov-15-1969-anti-vietnam-war-demonstration-held/)
which he instructed his White House counsel to monitor closely. When I
was appointed to that post 18 months into his presidency, I discovered
that all of the key intelligence agencies reported domestic and related
foreign intelligence about disruptive protests, demonstrations and civil
unrest occurring throughout the country to the counsel’s office, where
we digested and shared it with the president and senior staff.

For some thousand days I had an exceptional overview of what was being
done by Nixon and his aides to deal with often violent unrest,
particularly that provoked by those strongly opposed to the war in
Vietnam. Nixon’s behavior was [vastly different from Mr.
Trump’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/trump-nixon.html).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Never once did I hear anyone in the Nixon White House or Justice
Department suggest using United States military forces, or any federal
officers outside the military, to quell civil unrest or disorder. Nor
have I found any evidence of such activity after the fact, when digging
through the historical record.

It is well known that on unique occasions presidents had used federal
forces for limited purposes before Nixon, as in 1877 when President
Rutherford B. Hayes used federal troops to end [the railroad
strike](http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877);
and in 1894 when President Grover Cleveland dispatched troops to end the
[Pullman railroad
strike](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1029.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Presidents have also sent federal forces to uphold court orders, as in
1957 when President Eisenhower sent troops to [Little
Rock](http://crdl.usg.edu/export/html/dde/ddetimeline/crdl_dde_ddetimeline_130.html),
Ark., and in 1962 when President Kennedy sent federal forces to [Oxford,
Miss.](http://crdl.usg.edu/events/ole_miss_integration/?Welcome), in
both cases to enforce court orders to desegregate schools.

Mr. Trump, assisted by Attorney General Bill Barr, has assembled [a
mongrel federal law
enforcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/politics/trump-chicago-portland-federal-agents.html)
operation from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug
Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals, and other federal agencies to
proceed to cities throughout the country: Portland, Ore.; Chicago;
Memphis; Oakland, Calif.

Neither governors nor mayors have requested these attack weapon-wielding
federal soldiers, a few hundred men with minimal identification dressed
up in battlefield camouflage. This unprecedented action is way beyond
Nixon’s authoritarianism. And it raises serious questions.

Most conspicuously, for Donald Trump it creates optics he believes he
can [exploit in his re-election
campaign.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-portland-federal-agents.html)
Indeed, Nixon successfully used images of disorder in 1968, and falsely
charged demonstrators in 1972 as working for his opponent when he was
running for re-election. But Mr. Trump is provoking disorder by using
federal forces, which is quite different.

The reason Attorney General Barr is backing this action is that he
believes the president should, in fact, be able to do most anything he
wishes, whenever he wants. Mr. Barr is using 200 federal officers here
and there today, so tomorrow he can dispatch 2,000 or 20,000. He is
making the unprecedented precedented.

Richard Nixon closeted his authoritarianism behind closed doors, and
only because [he taped himself](http://nixontapes.org/)do we have a good
understanding of it. Donald Trump, however, has paraded his
authoritarianism in the Rose Garden and at rallies. He wants to be seen
as a demagogue.

Nixon did not have an authoritarian Republican Party to support his
imperial presidency and was forced to prematurely resign. Mr. Trump has
a G.O.P. that seeks to expand his authoritarian presidency. Militarizing
federal forces to perform state and local police functions is merely
another norm-shattering example.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s latest threat is that he will not leave the presidency if he
loses. He is making Nixon’s authoritarian behavior look tame.
