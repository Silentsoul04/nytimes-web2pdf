world as it unfolds.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190705115727-leonardo-dicaprio-divestinvest-large-169.jpg}

Actor Leonardo DiCaprio is one of thousands of investors who have
pledged to divest from fossil fuels.

(CNN)Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish
lifestyles than the rest of us -\/- they also have bigger carbon
footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels
are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the
atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving
supercars -\/- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has
\href{https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/mb-extreme-carbon-inequality-021215-en.pdf?cid=aff_affwd_donate_id78888\&awc=5991_1558106971_e9c67e275814af69c365ae4eb8875943}{estimated}
that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1\%
could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10\%. Studies also
show that the poor suffer the
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/31/africa/poorest-hit-the-hardest-climate-change-mozambique-intl/index.html}{most}
from \href{https://www.cnn.com/specials/world/cnn-climate}{climate
change}.

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate
crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

\hypertarget{spend-wisely}{%
\subsubsection{Spend wisely}\label{spend-wisely}}

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against
climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate
Impact Research
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0402-3}{estimated} that
the typical "super-rich" household of two people (which they defined as
having net assets of more than \$1 million, excluding their main home)
has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons
of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers
are illustrative. "Probably our estimates are even lower than the true
emissions of millionaires," she said.

"Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot," said
Otto. "For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses.
They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided
flying."

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint
of a super-rich couple.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150302114259-aktivhaus-2-large-169.jpg}

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy
as it consumes.

\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/18/health/climate-change-google-questions-answered/index.html}{\textbf{Climate
change: Do you know the basics?}}

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

"A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more
climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers," said Tom
Bailey, who contributed to a new
\href{http://c40-production-images.s3.amazonaws.com/other_uploads/images/2233_WITH_FOREWORDS_-_Main_report__20190611_\%281\%29.original.pdf?1560286287}{report}
that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

"High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources
to trial new products, services and solutions," he explained, adding
that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable
goods.

\hypertarget{divestment}{%
\subsubsection{Divestment}\label{divestment}}

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what
industries to invest in -\/- or not to invest in.

Oxfam
\href{https://www-cdn.oxfam.org/s3fs-public/file_attachments/mb-extreme-carbon-inequality-021215-en.pdf}{estimates}
that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business
interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015,
and the size of their fortunes expanded from over \$200 billion to more
than \$300 billion.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190628144356-coal-power-plant-germany-large-169.jpg}

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in
climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets
totaling \$8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels
through the online movement
\href{https://www.divestinvest.org/}{DivestInvest}.

Among them is Hollywood actor
\href{https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/leonardo-and-ldf-join-more-than-400-institutions-pledging-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels/}{Leonardo
DiCaprio}, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his
environment \href{https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/}{foundation} -\/- as
well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who
\href{https://gofossilfree.org/nl/press-release/affluent-dutch-individuals-divest-200-million-in-personal-wealth-from-the-fossil-fuel-industry/}{pledged}
to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal
companies.

climate change worries the world's largest companies}}

"You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some
car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the
financial flows," said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. "We did some
simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need
everyone to divest," said Otto. "If the minority of investors divest,
the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because
they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no
environmental concerns."

\hypertarget{wealth-means-power}{%
\subsubsection{Wealth means power}\label{wealth-means-power}}

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have
political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns
and have access to lawmakers.

\href{/2019/05/13/health/carbon-dioxide-world-intl/index.html}{}

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190513112654-carbon-dioxide-climate-01-large-169.jpg}

\href{/2019/05/13/health/carbon-dioxide-world-intl/index.html}{There is
more CO2 in the atmosphere today than any point since the evolution of
humans}

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to
instigate positive changes to climate policy.

"Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency
to change something," said Otto. "There's so much research about the
poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable
development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and
sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because
they are busy surviving.

"But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -\/- it's a completely
different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they
also have the social networks," she explained.

\hypertarget{fund-climate-research}{%
\subsubsection{Fund climate research}\label{fund-climate-research}}

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft
founder Bill Gates committed \$2 billion of his fortune to fund research
and development into clean energy.

\href{/2019/06/13/world/land-coral-farm-reefs-climate-change-scli-intl/index.html}{}

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190613100639-coral-reef-mexico-large-169.jpg}

\href{/2019/06/13/world/land-coral-farm-reefs-climate-change-scli-intl/index.html}{Can
coral farms save our reefs?}

In May, a group of scientists
\href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48357351}{wrote} to
100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an
"extraordinary increase" in funding for environmental and
climate-related issues.

"We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent
further ecological catastrophe -\/- whether through your personal
investments or your philanthropy," the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A
recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the
world's top companies \$1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

\hypertarget{role-models}{%
\subsubsection{Role models}\label{role-models}}

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon
emissions.

"High status in our societies remains associated with high material
wealth," said Otto. "It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy
and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like."

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich.
This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among
Europe's top 10 emitters.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190628145728-ryanair-plane-large-169.jpg}

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to
EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and
aviation.

"We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives
that are independent of material wealth," said Stephanie Moser, of the
University of Bern, in Switzerland, who
\href{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916517710685}{found}
that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income
than their environmental beliefs.

"We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a "good
life" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions," she said.
