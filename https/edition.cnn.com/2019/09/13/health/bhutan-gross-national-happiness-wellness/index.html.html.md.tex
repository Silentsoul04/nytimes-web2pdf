CNN Vital Signs Bhutan Trailer 00:30

(CNN)On the eastern edge of the Himalayas, nestled between India and
Tibet, lies the tiny nation of Druk Yul, better known as Bhutan. In
Bhutanese, the name means "Land of the Thunder Dragon," a nod to the
violent storms that pound the rugged mountain peaks and flood the lush
valleys.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190304143013-best-hiking-trails---bhutan-blue-poppy-large-169.jpg}

Bhutan is known as "the last Shangri-La" -\/- a remote Himalayan nation,
rich in natural beauty and Buddhist culture, where national happiness is
prioritized over economic growth.

Fiercely proud and protective of its traditions, Bhutan has been closed
to outside influences for centuries. The nation only opened its doors to
tourism in the 1970s and has decided to take a unique approach to
westernization, creating a concept known as the "Gross National
Happiness Index."

Don't be fooled by the name. This is not just a measure of how much
people smile and laugh. It's a holistic approach to sustainable
development that gives as much weight to human flourishing as it does
wealth.

"We in Bhutan are very unique; our democracy is very, very unique ... in
the sense we all are grounded very strongly by our national values,"
said Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering, who took office in
November 2018. "We do not put personal interest ahead of national
interest.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190830172445-cnn-vital-signs-bhutan-00001614-large-169.jpg}

Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering in his office.

"When we say Gross National Happiness, it is not the celebrative 'Ha ha
-\/- Ho ho' kind of happiness that we look for in life," Lotay
explained. "It only means contentment, control of your mind, control of
wants in your life. Don't be jealous with others, be happy with what you
have, be compassionate, be a society where you can be more than happy to
share.

"Our king rightly calls Gross National Happiness as development with
values," Lotay continues. "If the policy does not have a good amount of
happiness index, if the policy is not every environment friendly, if the
policy will not be able to ensure that it will result in the well-being
of Bhutanese, that policy will never be approved in the country."

\hypertarget{gross-national-happiness}{%
\subsubsection{Gross National
Happiness}\label{gross-national-happiness}}

The \href{https://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/}{Centre for Bhutan and GNH
Studies} is responsible for administering Bhutan's Gross National
Happiness surveys. They ask questions such as "How happy did you feel
yesterday?" and "How often do you practice meditation?"

They measure nine key areas of happiness every five years -\/-
psychological well-being, health, education, good governance, ecology,
time use, community vitality, culture and living standards. Two surveys
have been conducted so far, in 2010 and 2015, with another one due next
year.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181009163459-farm-in-mountains-of-bhutan-large-169.jpg}

The house of a working farm sits in a valley nestled in the mountains
near the eastern Bhutanese town of Paro.

The 2015 survey sampled more than 7,000 Bhutanese from across the
country. It yielded some interesting results.

"The harder components like living standard, health, access to health or
access to education and so on, they're improving in Bhutan," said Tshoki
Zangmo, a researcher at the Centre.

"But the softer components like psychological well-being or the trust
indicator that we have in our community vitality domain, those were
deteriorating," she added. "The trust indicator within urban areas in
the country, they were deteriorating."

That's right. Bhutan is not the happiest country in the world. It
actually ranks **** 95th out of 156 countries **** in the
\href{https://worldhappiness.report/}{2019 World Happiness Report.} Much
of that has to do with the nation's poverty, and the challenges of
bringing economic and social equity to a predominately agricultural
society.

Much of the rural population relies on subsistence farming in a
high-mountain environment that is vulnerable to climate change. Rugged
terrain, frequent floods and landslides hinder development; urban-rural
connectivity is poor. Television was only introduced in 1999 and there
are still no traffic lights in the capital city.

"There's another misunderstanding ... that Bhutan has claimed that we're
the happiest country," said Tshoki. "I don't think we're the happiest
country.

"But what sets Bhutan apart from the other countries is that our vision
is clear," she added. "Our vision is to reach a state where societies
have all the enabling conditions intact, not only the economic aspects
but the other aspects as well, such as the environment, the community,
having access to health and education and so on."

\subsubsection{Dr. Prime Minister}\label{dr-prime-minister}}

One only needs to follow 50-year-old Lotay to see the Bhutanese way in
action. He exercises daily, but one day is special. Every Thursday he
steadily pedals up a steep hill outside Thimphu, Bhutan's capital city.
His goal is the 169-foot-tall Buddha Dordenma statue, one of the largest
in the world. His mission is two-fold: exercise to strengthen his body,
and prayer and meditation to strengthen his mind.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910175238-04-bhutans-leader-large-169.jpg}

Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering prays outside of Buddha Dordenma.

"When we say stronger, it just does not mean the muscle strength," Lotay
says. "It means the mental strength, the strength of your neurons. So
those are the ingredients to help your neurons to be very strong."

After his bike ride, the Prime Minister makes his way to the hospital
for rounds. As a urologist and surgeon for more than 20 years, being a
doctor is an integral part of what makes him happy. Therefore, he makes
time on Thursdays and Saturdays to pursue his passion, which just
happens to reflect his values.

"Since I come from a traditional family, I always thought we should help
others," Lotay says. "I thought being religious is the way forward, so
on that note I really wanted to be a monk. My mother said why not be a
doctor so that you can be really of help to the needy ones and so ... I
decided to be a doctor."

As he makes his hospital rounds with residents and interns, Lotay tries
to instill the same values he has practiced, values he says he tries to
bring to how he approaches two of Bhutan's top goals: universal
healthcare and education.

"Health and education are the most powerful social levelers," the Prime
Minister says. "So based on that, we have free health and free education
in our country. While it is free, it is not easily accessible, easily
available for everyone that needs the service.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910175217-03-bhutans-leader-large-169.jpg}

Tshering visits with a patient on hospital rounds.

"I thought we could improve the accessibility of health care services to
especially the needy ones, those who are based in the villages," he
said, adding that "this pair of hands can only do so much. A surgical
blade can only operate a patient at a time.

"I joined politics to see mainly if I can bring in some policy changes,"
he added, "so that with the stroke of my surgical blade, I treat one
patient. With the stroke of a pen I can treat the whole nation."

\hypertarget{bhutans-future}{%
\subsubsection{Bhutan's future}\label{bhutans-future}}

The country may not rank highest in happiness, yet, but it has made
\href{http://habitat3.org/wp-content/uploads/Bhutan_Habitat-III-National-Report.pdf}{major
gains.} Thousand of kilometers of roads have been constructed and phone
lines installed. Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity accounts for the
largest share of its economy.

Water flows through tunnels at the site of the Punatsangchhu
hydro-electric power project in Wangdue, Bhutan.

The \href{https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bhutan/overview}{World
Bank} calls Bhutan a developmental success story, with decreasing levels
of extreme poverty and improvements in gender equality, as well as a
stable political and economic environment.

"Just over the last three to four decades our life expectancy at birth
has increased from near 50 to over 70," said Lotay. "With modernization,
with decent access to good health care, more nutritious food and health
awareness being better day by day, so many Bhutanese now live longer."

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170801112210-visitng-bhutan---taktsang-monaster--tigers-nest---bhutan-tourism-large-169.jpg}

Bhutan places a tight control on tourism, including visits to the
Tiger's Nest, a sacred Buddhist site on a cliffside.

Due to the country's natural beauty and native culture, ecotourism is
huge. To manage it within the country's Gross National Happiness
mandate, Bhutan imposes an ecotourism tax of \$250 a day per person,
which they use to offset the environmental impact of thousands of
visitors. It's been so successful that Bhutan says it's not only
carbon-neutral, it's carbon-negative.

The country has long partnered with the
\href{https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/bhutan-wwf-and-partners-announce-deal-to-permanently-secure-bhutan-s-extensive-network-of-protected-areas}{World
Wildlife Fund} to protect native wildlife in numerous parks. Plastic
bags have been banned since 1999. Tobacco has been banned since 2005,
making Bhutan the world's first smoke-free nation. The Bhutanese
constitution mandates that at least 60\% of the country remain under
forest cover. Right now, said Lotay, they are at 70\%.

off-limits to tourists until 2002.

Despite the need for economic growth, the Prime Minister is confident
those priorities will not change for the Bhutanese people.

"When we know that monetary wealth and material wealth will not
translate to what you actually want in your life ... peace of mind and
happiness ... then why should we target that as our main objective?

"We have to think about the next generations to come," he added. "So,
these are the values of Gross National Happiness that we practice.
That's why economically we may not be doing very well because all those
checks and balances will ensure that whatever we initiate will be
sustainable, will be for generations to come."
