Also known as "rainforests of the sea", coral reefs offer spectacular
sights, as well as supporting wildlife, providing food, jobs and coastal
protection for an estimated 500 million people.

But human activities are threatening their survival. Scroll through the
gallery to see how our actions are putting coral reefs at risk.

Photos: How are humans harming coral reefs?

Rising temperatures: Man-made greenhouse gas emissions are making oceans
warmer.\\
In hotter water, corals lose their algae coverings and turn white or
"bleached". Bleached coral are not yet dead -\/- but without their algae
they eventually starve.

Photos: How are humans harming coral reefs?

Overfishing: The coral reef's inhabitants are its first line of defense.
Fish eat some of the creatures that eat coral, while crabs and shrimp
use their pincers to protect their coral homes. Fish also graze on
seaweed and algae so that they don't grow to cover the reef.

Indiscriminate overfishing can disrupt these ecosystems, leaving the
coral more vulnerable to predators. Fishing boat anchors can also scar
and break the corals below.

Photos: How are humans harming coral reefs?

Invasive species: Over the past 25 years, lionfish have colonized
Atlantic coastal regions, from their native Indo-Pacific waters. It's
thought they were released into the Atlantic by owners who no longer
wanted them as aquarium pets.

With fewer natural predators, the species' new Atlantic populations are
growing rapidly. They can eat and out-compete native coral reef
creatures. Aquarium releases, aquaculture and fishing boats can all
unwittingly introduce invasive species to delicate coral environments.

Photos: How are humans harming coral reefs?

Acidification: Seawater absorbs our carbon dioxide emissions, which
makes the oceans more acidic.

Corals, like many marine species, protect themselves with skeletons made
from calcium carbonate. More acidic seawater makes it harder for corals
to build new skeletons, and can even decompose existing skeletons.

Pollution: Oil spills, septic waste and pesticides can also disrupt
coral reef ecosystems.

Researchers at the University of Queensland, Australia, found that when
corals are exposed to chemical pollutants over long periods, their
resilience to other stresses - including higher temperatures and ocean
acidification - may also decrease.

Great Barrier Reef (CNN)Andy Ridley is shivering in a wet T-shirt on the
deck of the Dreamtime after coming up from a dive on the outer edge of
Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

The tourist boat had run out of wetsuits, but Ridley jumped in anyway to
give his latest ambassador, conservationist and explorer
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/08/world/david-de-rothschild-modern-explorers/index.html}{David
de Rothschild}, a demonstration of his latest project.

Ridley has form when it comes to asking people to perform simple tasks
for the environment. In Sydney in 2007, he started
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/30/us/earth-hour-explainer-trnd/index.html}{Earth
Hour} -\/- the global "lights out" movement which asked whole cities to
turn off non-essential lights for an hour on a designated day -\/- that
has since spread to 188 countries.

Now, he and local scientists are asking people to take photos for the
"Great Reef Census," the biggest ever communal effort to map the world's
largest reef system, that stretches 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) down
the Queensland coast.

David de Rothschild gets up close to a turtle on the Great Barrier Reef,
June 2019.

"It is about reminding the world that this inspirational place is here
and we need to do everything we can to keep it in the best shape
possible," said Ridley, CEO of the non-profit
\href{https://citizensgbr.org/}{Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef}.

The Citizens team has been testing the logistics of the census, and hope
to finalize details in the next few months.

"It's got a lot of momentum," Ridley said. "But it's still a crazy idea
-\/- you know that, right?"

\subsubsection{Crisis meeting}\label{crisis-meeting}}

The idea for the census came in 2017. Ten severe tropical cyclones in 12
years had smashed parts of the reef, while the ravages of climate change
-\/- rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification -\/- had left once
vibrant coral communities bleached and fragile.

At a conference in the northern city of Townsville, delegates were told
the
\href{http://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/bitstream/11017/3203/1/GBR-Summit-proceedings-and-outputs-report.pdf}{reef
was in "crisis."} They agreed "dramatic" change was needed in the way
the Great Barrier Reef was managed if it was to survive.

The race to save the Great Barrier Reef 03:49

Ridley chatted with Peter Mumby, head of the Marine Spatial Ecology Lab
at the University of Queensland, and Roger Beeden, the director of the
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. They needed to know more about
the state of the reef, **** but were coming up short.

Long-term scientific monitoring had only collected detailed information
on a small number of reefs -\/- not enough for marine park managers to
form a cohesive response to climate change.

"If you want to understand where there are opportunities to respond
after bleaching events, or to actually look after key areas, then we
need to have information from a much greater number of reefs," Beeden
said.

"To try to get that information ... you need to mobilize a huge
workforce," Mumby said. "(Scientists) don't have the resources and time
to do that kind of survey."

Ridley was looking for a project, Beeden and Mumby needed people, and so
began discussions for the Great Reef Census.

\hypertarget{how-it-will-work}{%
\subsubsection{How it will work}\label{how-it-will-work}}

For several weeks late next year, anyone -\/- locals, tourists,
fishermen, superyacht and other boat owners -\/- will be asked to take
photos of the reef and upload them to an app. **** Then, anyone in the
world with internet access will be invited to log on to help identify
what's there.

You don't need to be a coral expert to become involved. Scientists say
some of the most recognizable coral species are also the most important
for reef restoration.

"That includes reefs that are dominated by these big plate-like corals,
which are really important in stimulating recovery," Mumby said. "Also,
reefs that have what we're describing as monumental corals -\/- coral
monuments -\/- which are exceptionally old, long-lived corals that have
survived being damaged for one reason or another."

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191208181603-01-great-barrier-reef-plate-coral-large-169.jpg}

"They're like the long, slow, old growth forests that we see in
rainforests, the enormous trees," Beeden explained.

If scientists can identify the location of corals that naturally work to
regenerate the reef, they can help protect them to give the reef the
best chance it has to survive the climate crisis.

"As a reef manager, there's not much you can do to stop things warming
up. (But) not everywhere warms up at the same rate. If you can map where
that variation exists, and find those areas that are really important
for recovery ... then you're strategically managing that recovery
process as best you can," Mumby said.

\hypertarget{the-reef-is-not-dead}{%
\subsubsection{'The reef is not dead'}\label{the-reef-is-not-dead}}

Ridley's Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef has been trying to get as
many ambassadors onto the water as possible. Along with David de
Rothschild, they've hosted model Jarrod Scott and the Australian
Dolphins Swim Team.

Mumby bristles at the suggestion that the census is some kind of a
publicity stunt.

\href{/2019/12/09/africa/kenya-devil-cactus-intl/index.html}{Kenyan
'devil's cactus' is spreading out of control -\/- but tech is fighting
back}

"There's a very genuine scientific need for this information," Mumby
said. "We unashamedly want to have a different conversation about the
reef globally, because at the moment the prevailing global conversation
seems to be the reef is dead."

News reports about the reef's demise spread worldwide in 2016 after
Outside Magazine published a
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/14/us/barrier-reef-obit-trnd/index.html}{satirical
obituary}, horrifying scientists and creating a false perception that
they've spent years trying to fix.

"It's deeply frustrating on a couple of fronts," Ridley said. "When you
get people believing that we've lost one of the world's greatest natural
icons it doesn't inspire action, it actually inspires more apathy."

\hypertarget{space-the-size-of-italy}{%
\subsubsection{Space the size of Italy}\label{space-the-size-of-italy}}

Maps of the reef are already being created using satellite images that
can see to a depth of 20 meters in clear water. But they only provide a
rough outline of the reef.

Details -\/- like the types of coral that are growing in a particular
area -\/- are added later, when scientists refer to notes from field
trips, or take an educated guess based on environmental conditions.

"From satellite imagery you can derive water depth. Water depth and wind
creates waves and waves influence where coral types like to grow,"
explained Chris Roelfsema, co-director of the
\href{https://sees.uq.edu.au/remote-sensing-research-centre}{Remote
Sensing Research Centre} at the University of Queensland.

This year, Roelfsema's team produced the first ever geomorphic map that
shows the entire Great Barrier Reef system -\/- all 3,000 individual
coral reefs.

Photos from the reef census will be useful, he said, to help validate
the geomorphic maps, and to fill the gaps where no data currently
exists.

throwing away a fortune in plastic every year. This company is cleaning
up}

Scientists are under no illusions about the size of the task ahead.

"The reason why this hasn't happened before is because it's a very large
thing to do," said Beeden. "A space the size of Italy with 3,000 reefs,
many of which are actually very remote, presents some very substantial
logistical challenges."

Funding is required if the project is going to fulfill its potential to
reach parts of the reef that have never been explored before. Ridley is
talking with potential sponsors and hopes to announce a deal in January.

He's confident the logistical challenges will be overcome and, by this
time next year, scientists will have a much better idea of the state of
the reef -\/- and most importantly, how to save it.

"If we give up on something as amazing as the Great Barrier Reef," he
says, "and we think it's gone, and we're OK with that, what are we not
OK with losing?"
