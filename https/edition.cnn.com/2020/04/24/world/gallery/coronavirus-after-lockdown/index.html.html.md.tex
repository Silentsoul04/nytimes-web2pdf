Around the world, governments are starting to relax some of their
coronavirus restrictions.

Most countries have taken measures to protect against the spread of
Covid-19: enforcing stay-at-home orders, closing nonessential businesses
and advising people to wear protective gear and keep a safe distance
from one another.

Many of those guidelines still apply. But beaches are beginning to
reopen, some students are returning to classrooms, and businesses are
opening their doors for the first time in months.
