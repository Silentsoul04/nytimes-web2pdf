Some places across the globe
\href{http://www.cnn.com/2020/04/24/world/gallery/coronavirus-after-lockdown/index.html}{are
beginning to ease their coronavirus restrictions.} Businesses are
reopening, as are some schools and sports leagues. But everything looks
much different than what we are used to.

Many of us are still working from home. Others have lost their jobs and
are looking for new ones. We continue to keep our distance from one
another, whether it's in a park, out shopping or in our places of
worship.

Meanwhile, the death toll continues to climb as the world rushes to find
a vaccine. Even the way we mourn has been affected, as many funerals
limit the number of people who can attend.

These images show just how much our daily lives have changed because of
Covid-19.

Travelers arriving from abroad wait to be tested at a Covid-19 testing
station set up at Hanover-Langenhagen Airport near Hanover, Germany on
August 8. Today is the first day that the German government is requiring
people arriving from high-risk designated nations to take a Covid-19
test.
