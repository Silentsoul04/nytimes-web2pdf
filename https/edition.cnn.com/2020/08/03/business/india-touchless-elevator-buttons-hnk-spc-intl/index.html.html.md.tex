Bhavin Ahir started working on the touchless elevator buttons during
India's coronavirus lockdown.

(CNN Business)Before the pandemic, there were many reasons to be anxious
about taking an elevator --- from being crammed in a small space with
strangers, to getting stuck between floors.

Now, as coronavirus cases exceed 18 million worldwide, many people are
concerned about catching the virus, whether from someone else in the
elevator or via the buttons.

Software engineer Bhavin Ahir felt the fear in the apartment block where
he lives
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/24/asia/india-lockdown-coronavirus-intl/index.html}{in
March}, when the Indian government implemented what would become a
four-month lockdown.

Ahir lives on the 12th floor of a 13-floor apartment block in the
western state of Gujarat. The tower block is home to hundreds of people
who take the elevator multiple times each day.

"There is always fear to touch the buttons, so I decided to do some
developments from that side," says Ahir, the founder of Indian
electronics company, TechMax Solution.

People worldwide are finding ways to avoid touching elevator buttons.

Unable to leave his apartment, he set to work in his spare room,
creating prototypes for a product now known as "Sparshless" (sparsh
means touch in Sanskrit).

The system consists of a panel that is fitted alongside existing
elevator buttons. It allows users to select a floor by pointing their
finger at each button from a distance of 10 to 15 millimeters (0.4 to
0.6 inches), triggering an infrared signal which tells the elevators
where they want to go.

Sparshless units are also mounted at elevator entrances on each floor,
says Ahir. Users place their hands under the arrows on the unit to
indicate whether they want to travel up or down.

It's a completely contactless system designed for a world where people
have become cautious about everything they touch.

seat}\label{dirtier-than-a-toilet-seat}}

We've long known that elevator buttons are dirty.
\href{https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/level-bacteria-elevator-buttons-40-times-higher-public-toilet-seats}{Studies}
have found more bacteria on
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4242253/}{elevator
buttons than toilet seats}.

\href{https://twitter.com/CorsIAQ/status/1286100808589651969}{Modeling
shows} that the risk of catching the virus from people traveling in
elevators is
\href{https://twitter.com/CorsIAQ/status/1254523761790906368?s=20}{relatively
low}, as the cars are typically well-ventilated and passengers spend a
short time inside.

However, as the virus is believed to survive on some surfaces for
\href{https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces}{up
to 72 hours}, it's not surprising that people feel anxious about
touching buttons.

The pandemic has led to some creative solutions. In Thailand, a shopping
mall has
\href{https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid-19-coronavirus-thailand-mall-lift-foot-pedal-12753862}{installed
pedals} so patrons can choose their floor with their feet. And in Japan,
one toothpick company is marketing
"\href{https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/05/3f0d71e4dd83-toothpick-maker-releases-button-pressing-sticks-amid-virus-fears.html}{noncontact
sticks}" for pressing the buttons. In the US, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recommends that people avoid touching the buttons
directly and instead
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html}{"use
an object (such as a pen cap) or their knuckle."}

In India, Ahir sought more sophisticated technology.

At a shopping mall in Bangkok, a woman uses a foot pedal to choose her

\subsubsection{Making the product}\label{making-the-product}}

Ahir usually works from his company's office in the city of Surat, where
he employs 12 permanent staff. The 31-year-old entrepreneur started his
business, TechMax Solution, in 2009, straight after graduating from
college. The company's key products are security devices, but during
India's four-month lockdown, work dried up. During that time "we didn't
raise even one rupee," he says.

Ahir responded to the crisis by developing the Sparshless system,
testing the first prototypes on his neighbors. Early models were
adjusted when he discovered that daylight triggered false readings. The
system also needed to be installed in such a way that it didn't affect
the elevators' normal workings --- or warranty.

With those problems solved, the next step was finding customers. That
hasn't been easy during a nationwide lockdown, says Ahir, but so far,
the units have been fitted in 15 buildings in India.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200728161633-01-sparshless-contactless-elevator-panel---screenshot-large-169.jpg}

Users call lifts fitted with Sparshless by placing their hand under a
unit equipped with infrared transmitters.

Sumit and Sushila Katariya live in one of those buildings. Sumit is an
elevator consultant, and Sushila is a doctor at Medanta Hospital,
southwest of Delhi, who has treated hundreds of coronavirus patients
since March.

Sumit Katariya had the touchless buttons installed in the personal
elevator at his two-story housing complex to reduce the risk of this
wife infecting the family and their visitors, if she caught the virus.
He says the panel has been working "perfectly fine" since they had it
installed about one month ago.

Ahir says he has received inquiries from Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates and Brazil about the panels. He hopes to sell up to 1,500 units
by the end of the year, an ambitious target for a small company with one
manufacturing facility in the country with the world's third highest
number of coronavirus cases.

It's a "tough situation" he says, but "I always think positive."
