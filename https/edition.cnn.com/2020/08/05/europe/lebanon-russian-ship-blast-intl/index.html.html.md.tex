(CNN)As Lebanon's investigation into
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-qiblawi-analysis-intl/index.html}{the
devastating blast in Beirut} continues, officials have pointed to a
possible cause: A massive shipment of agricultural fertilizer that
authorities say was stored in the port of Beirut without safety
precautions for years -\/- despite warnings by local officials.

Documents newly reviewed by CNN reveal that a shipment of 2,750 metric
tons of
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-port-explosion-ammonium-nitrate-intl-hnk/index.html}{ammonium
nitrate} arrived in Beirut on a Russian-owned vessel in 2013. The ship,
named the MV Rhosus, was destined for Mozambique -\/- but stopped in
Beirut due to financial difficulties that also created unrest with the
ship's Russian and Ukrainian crew.

Once it arrived, the ship never left Beirut's port, according Lebanon's
Director of Customs, Badri Daher, despite repeated warnings by him and
others that the cargo was the equivalent of "a floating bomb."

\href{/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-blast-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html}{What
we know about the Beirut blast}

"Due to the extreme danger posed by this stored items in unsuitable
climate conditions, we reiterate our request to the Port Authorities to
re-export the goods immediately to maintain the safety of the port and
those working in it," Daher's predecessor, Chafic Merhi, wrote in a 2016
letter addressed to a judge involved in the case.

Lebanese authorities have not named the MV Rhosus as the source of
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/08/05/ammonium-nitrate-beirut-lebanon-explosion-sam-kiley-pkg-vpx.cnn}{the
substance that ultimately exploded in Beirut} on Tuesday, but Prime
Minister Hassan Diab said the devastating blast was caused by 2,750 tons
of ammonium nitrate. He added that the substance had been stored for six
years at the port warehouse without safety measures, "endangering the
safety of citizens."

Lebanon's general security chief also said a
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-blast-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html}{"highly
explosive material"} had been confiscated years earlier and stored in
the warehouse, which is just a few minutes' walk from Beirut's shopping
and nightlife districts. Tuesday's massive explosion, which rocked the
capital, left at least 135 dead and 5,000 injured.

On Wednesday, Lebanese Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad Najd said
there are papers and documents dating back to 2014 proving the existence
of an exchange of information about the "material" confiscated by
Lebanese authorities. She told Jordan's state-owned channel Al Mamlaka
that the exchange is being considered in relation to the potential cause
of the deadly Beirut blast.

Asked in a telephone interview if there are any early findings in the
investigations related to the cause of the explosion, she said, "There
are no preliminary results or clarification."

\subsubsection{'Floating bomb'}\label{floating-bomb}}

In 2013, the MV Rhosus set off from Batumi, Georgia, destined for
Mozambique, according to the vessel's path and the account of its
captain Boris Prokoshev.

It was carrying 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate, an industrial
chemical commonly used around the world as a fertilizer -\/- and in
explosives for mining.

The Moldovan-flagged ship stopped in Greece to refuel. That's when the
ship's owner told the Russian and Ukrainian sailors that he had run out
of money and they would have to pick up additional cargo to cover the
travel costs -\/- which led them on a detour to Beirut.

The vessel was owned by a company called Teto Shipping which members of
the crew said was owned by Igor Grechushkin, a Khabarovsk businessman
who resided in Cyprus.

Once in Beirut, the MV Rhosus was detained by local port authorities due
to "gross violations in operating a vessel," unpaid fees to the port,
and complaints filed by the Russian and Ukrainian crew , according to
the Seafarers' Union of Russia (affiliated with the International
Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF), which represented the Russian
sailors, told CNN.

It never resumed its journey.

The sailors had been on the ship for 11 months with few supplies,
according to Prokoshev. "I wrote to Putin everyday... Eventually we had
to sell the fuel and use the money to hire a lawyer because there was
not help, the owner did not even provide us with food or water,"
Prokoshev said in a radio interview with Echo Moscow on Wednesday.

They would eventually abandon the ship. "According to our information,
the Russian crew was later repatriated to their homeland... the salaries
were not paid," the union told CNN.

"At the time, on board of the dry cargo ship there were particularly
dangerous goods -\/- ammonium nitrate, which the port authorities of
Beirut did not allow to unload or transfer to another ship," it added.

In 2014, Mikhail Voytenko, who runs an online publication tracking
maritime activity, described the ship as a "floating bomb."

CNN made several unsuccessful attempts to reach Grechushkin on a Cyprus
telephone number.

\hypertarget{unheard-warnings}{%
\subsubsection{Unheard warnings}\label{unheard-warnings}}

According to emails exchanged by Prokoshev and a Beirut-based lawyer
Charbel Dagher, who represented the crew in Lebanon, the ammonium
nitrate was unloaded in Beirut's port by November 2014 and stored in a
hangar.

It was then kept in that hangar for six years, despite repeated warnings
from the Director of Lebanese Customs, Badri Daher, of the "extreme
danger" that the cargo posed.

But public court documents CNN obtained through the prominent Lebanese
human rights activist, Wadih Al-Asmar, reveal that Daher and his
predecessor, Merhi, turned to Beirut's courts to help dispose of the
dangerous goods multiple times from 2014 onwards.

"In our memos 19320/2014 dated 5/12/2014 and 5/6/2015 {[}...{]} we
requested that your honor order the responsible Port Authorities to
re-export Ammonium Nitrate that was taken off the Rhosus ship and placed
in Customs hangar number 12 in Beirut port," Daher wrote in 2017.

At points, he even offered to sell the dangerous cargo to the Lebanese
army, according to the court documents, but to no avail.

Daher confirmed to CNN earlier on Wednesday that his office sent "a
total of six letters to the legal authorities" but that the authorities
never responded to any of their letters.

"The Port Authority should not have allowed the ship to offload the
chemicals into the port," he said. "The chemicals were originally going
to Mozambique, not Lebanon."

On Wednesday, the Director General of Beirut Port Hassan Kraytem told
local television channel OTV: "We stored the material in warehouse
number 12 at Beirut port in accordance with a court order. We knew that
they were dangerous materials, but not to that extent."

Kraytem too said that the issue of removing the explosive material had
been brought up by State Security and Customs -\/- but that the issue
had not been "resolved."

"Customs and State Security sent letters {[}to the authorities{]} asking
to remove or re-export the explosive materials six years ago, and we
have been waiting since then for this issue to be resolved, but to no
avail," Kraytem said.

Maintenance was conducted on the warehouse door just hours before the
blast on Tuesday, he added. "We were asked to fix a door of the
warehouse by State Security and we did that at noon, but what occurred
in the afternoon I have no idea," he said.

\subsubsection{Ammonium nitrate}\label{ammonium-nitrate}}

Ammonium nitrate has been implicated in deadly industrial explosions in
the past, and is known to require careful handling.

"Poorly stored ammonium nitrate is notorious for explosions -\/- for
example in Oppau, Germany; in Galveston Bay, Texas; and more recently at
West in Waco, Texas; and Tianjin in China," Andrea Sella, Professor of
Inorganic Chemistry at University College London, told the Science Media
Centre.

"This is a catastrophic regulatory failure because regulations on the
storage of ammonium nitrate are typically very clear. The idea that such
a quantity would have been left unattended for six years beggars belief
and was an accident waiting to happen."

\end{itemize}

Perhaps the closest comparison to Beirut's explosion, in terms of scale,
is a blast in Texas City in 1947, which was caused by 2,300 US tons
(about 2,087 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate. The resulting fire caused
an explosion and additional fires that damaged more than 1,000 buildings
and killed nearly 400 people, according to the website of the Texas
Historical Association.

Previous disasters linked to the chemical have led to improved
regulations for its safe storage, Associate Professor Stewart Walker,
from the school of Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at
Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, told CNN said; such rules
mean it tends to be kept away from population centers.

"Both of these things will be questioned in the investigation into the
Beirut explosion, because they had such a large amount of ammonium
nitrate, which may not have been stored appropriately, and in an area
where there is a large number of people," he added.
