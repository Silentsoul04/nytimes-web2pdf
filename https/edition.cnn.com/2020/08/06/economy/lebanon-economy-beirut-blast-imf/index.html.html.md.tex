London (CNN Business)A cataclysmic blast in Beirut, Lebanon's capital,
is poised to send an economy already deep in crisis hurtling toward a
dangerous unknown.

On Tuesday, a massive explosion at the city's port left
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-port-explosion-ammonium-nitrate-intl-hnk/index.html}{at
least 135 people dead} and 5,000 injured. The number of deaths is
expected to climb as search-and-rescue efforts continue.

The blast, which also leveled huge swaths of Beirut and displaced
300,000 people, couldn't come at a worse moment.

In the past year, a breakdown in the country's banking system and
skyrocketing inflation had triggered mass protests. Even before the
Covid-19 pandemic hit, the World Bank projected that
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/04/28/middleeast/lebanon-hunger-aid-coronavirus-intl/index.html}{45\%
of people in Lebanon} would be below the poverty line in 2020.

"It's an economic crisis, a financial crisis, a political crisis, a
health crisis and now this horrible explosion," said Tamara Alrifai,
spokesperson at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees in the Near East.

European and Gulf countries have sent aid to help Lebanon manage the
fallout from the blast, and the country's central bank instructed
lenders to make zero-interest dollar loans to be repaid over the next
five years so people and businesses can rebuild. But it's expected to
fall far short of what the country needs to pull back from the brink,
and some donors may be deterred by widespread corruption and
mismanagement.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/06/middleeast/beirut-explosion-anger-intl-hnk/index.html}{mobbed
by angry crowds} during a tour of devastated Beirut neighborhoods on
Thursday, said France would provide medication and food, but not via
corrupt officials.

"This aid, I guarantee it, won't end up in corrupt hands," he told
Lebanese protesters, according to a spokesperson.

Macron told reporters later that France would help organize an
international conference to raise funds for Lebanon. He promised "clear
and transparent governance, whether it's French or international" to
ensure the money is "directly provided to the local population, the NGOs
and teams on site that need it."

\subsubsection{Economy in free fall}\label{economy-in-free-fall}}

The economic situation in Lebanon was grim before the explosion.

The International Monetary Fund last forecast that Lebanon's economy ---
beset by soaring food prices, a collapsing currency and Covid-19 ---
would contract by 12\% this year. That's far worse than the 4.7\%
average drop in output forecast **** for the Middle East and central
Asia.

The country defaulted on some of its debt in March. And **** last week,
Moody's cut Lebanon's credit rating to its lowest rank. It's now on par
with Venezuela.

"The country is steeped in an economic, financial and social crisis,
which very weak institutions ... appear unable to address," Moody's said
in a statement. The currency's collapse and the related surge in
inflation create a "highly unstable environment," it continued.

"People are really, really desperate," Mira Minkara, a Tripoli tour
guide, entrepreneur and activist told CNN. "What happened (Tuesday) is
an authentic reaction to the desperation, to the frustration and to the
pain that people are feeling. It's not normal pain. It's the pain of
when you're hungry, you're angry and you're sad that you can't pay rent
any more and you can't eat."

"Lebanese soldiers are Lebanese citizens," said photographer Diego
Ibarra Sánchez. "They are suffering as their families, too.~We´ve seen
army soldiers crying,~tearing up inside a military vehicle,~or hugging
protesters as troops moved in to reopen key highways a few months ago."
He said he has also witnessed what he thinks is excessive brutality.

Lebanon had been looking to secure a \$10 billion loan from the IMF, but
talks stalled last month.

On Thursday, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva **** called for "national
unity" to address the country's deep crisis, and she said the agency is
"exploring all possible ways to support the people of Lebanon."

"It is essential to overcome the impasse in the discussions on critical
reforms and put in place a meaningful program to turn around the economy
and build accountability and trust in the future of the country," she
added.

The explosion in Beirut, which has been declared a "disaster city," will
only pile more pressure on the economy.

"There is not one apartment in Beirut that wasn't impacted, not one
{[}business{]} that wasn't impacted --- whether the storefront {[}or{]}
**** the goods," Lebanon's Economy Minister Raoul Nehme told CNBC Arabia
on Wednesday.

The port where the blast occurred is the nation's main maritime hub, and
60\% of the country's imports pass through it. Nehme said it has been
"practically erased."

Tourism accounted for nearly a fifth of Lebanon's GDP in 2018, when two
million people visited the country. That sector has suffered another
huge hit.

"It's a disaster for Lebanon," said Pierre Achkar, head of the Lebanon
Hotel Federation for Tourism. He said occupancy rates at the hotels
still open had already slumped to 5\% and 15\% because of coronavirus
and political issues.

Achkar told the state news agency NNA on Wednesday that the explosion
damaged 90\% of the hotels in Beirut.
