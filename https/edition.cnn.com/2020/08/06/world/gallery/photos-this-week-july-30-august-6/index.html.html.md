Wednesday, August 5, shows the aftermath of a [massive
explosion](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/middleeast/gallery/beirut-explosion/index.html)

the city and could be felt as far as Cyprus, hundreds of miles away.
It's still unclear what exactly caused the explosion. Lebanon's prime
minister said an investigation would focus on an estimated 2,750 metric
tons of explosive ammonium nitrate stored at a warehouse.</span>
