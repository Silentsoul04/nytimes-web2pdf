Scientists digitally reconstructed the crushed skulls of Tanystropheus
fossils, which revealed evidence that these reptiles were
water-dwelling.

(CNN)For more than a hundred years, the fossil of the Tanystropheus has
puzzled scientists.

The strange reptile -\/- resembling a real-life Loch Ness Monster or a
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/world/footprints-ancient-two-legged-crocodile-scn/index.html}{prehistoric
crocodile} crossed with a giraffe -\/- was first described in 1852 and
first reconstructed in 1973.

Paleontologists have long known that the species once lived in
Switzerland's Monte San Giorgio basin during the Middle Triassic period
(about 242 million years ago). They also knew the bizarre-looking
20-foot creature had a remarkably long neck, which at 10 feet long was
half of its entire length.

\href{/travel/article/dinosaurs-utah-colorado-scn/index.html}{This is
the ultimate dinosaur road trip}

But the remaining details surrounding the Tanystropheus remained fuzzy
and have been much debated. Did these animals live on land or in the
water? What did their young look like? And how did they interact with
the other species in their environment? No one knew -\/- until now.

Scientists used computed tomography (CT) scan technology to digitally
reconstruct the crushed skulls of the fossils, which revealed evidence
that these reptiles were water-dwelling, according to new research
\href{https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fullt}{published today in
Current Biology*.*}

"For those people who are interested in Triassic reptiles, it's always
been not only an iconic fossil but also a matter of dispute and
discussion," said Olivier Rieppel, a paleontologist at the Field Museum
in Chicago and one of the study's authors.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200806102517-02-tanystropheus-reconstruction-illustration-large-169.jpg}

Researchers digitally reconstructed the crushed skulls of Tanystropheus
fossils which revealed new clues about how they lived, according to the
new research published today in Current Biology.

"I've been studying ** Tanystropheus ** for over 30 years, so it's
extremely satisfying to see these creatures demystified."

The digitally reassembled fossils show that the Tanystropheus' skull
anatomy and nostril placement had the characteristics of an aquatic
animal. Researchers also found evidence that the ** Tanystropheu\emph{s}
was an aquatic "ambush predator" that likely used its long, slender neck
to allow it to approach unknowing prey.

"That long neck wasn't very flexible, it only had 13 vertebrae and it
had ribs in it that further constrained mobility," Rieppel explained.
"But our study shows that this strange anatomy was much more adaptive
and versatile than we had thought before."

\hypertarget{a-second-mystery-solved}{%
\subsubsection{A second mystery solved}\label{a-second-mystery-solved}}

Scientists were also able to clear up questions surrounding different
forms of these animals -\/- one smaller and one larger -\/- whose
fossils are found in the same area of modern-day Switzerland.

\href{/travel/article/new-dinosaur-intl-scli-gbr-scn/index.html}{New
species of dinosaur discovered after decades in museum}

Previously, it was thought the smaller fossils were the baby version of
the fully-grown Tanystropheus. The smaller specimens looked very similar
but were only about 4 feet long compared to 20 feet. But researchers
were able to examine the growth rings in the cross sections of
Tanystropheus bones to determine that they are, in fact, two different
species.

"The small individuals are also fully grown, and that was surprising,"
said coauthor Torsten Scheyer, a research associate at the University of
Zurich. "It's like the growth rings of a tree -\/- from this you can
basically reconstruct the history of these animals."

That means two separate species of strange-looking, long-necked reptiles
lived in the same area.

However, the fossils also revealed the two species had different types
of teeth, which led to the conclusion that they used different
strategies to catch prey.

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200806103213-03-tanystropheus-reconstruction-ct-scan-large-169.jpg}

The digitally reassembled fossils show that the Tanystropheus' skull
anatomy and nostril placement -\/- on the top of it's snout similar to a
crocodile -\/- had the characteristics of an aquatic animal.

"Food resources in an ecosystem are limited, and animals that look
similar often develop different strategies ... It's called niche
partitioning," Scheyer told CNN. "So, they shared the same habitat, but
didn't get in each others' way too much."

Niche partitioning in such a highly specialized, extraordinarily
long-necked reptile reveals a less competitive side of evolution during
the Triassic period. Scientists said that's an important ecological
phenomenon that highlights the versatility of the Tanystropheus and the
complexity of ecosystems at that time.

"Darwin visualized the world as one where species compete and compete
and compete, but this habitat partitioning is one that's been known for
a while, and paints a different picture of nature," Rieppel said.

\hypertarget{triassic-period}{%
\subsubsection{Triassic period}\label{triassic-period}}

The Triassic period is far removed from modern-day existence, but
studying it can reveal a lot about the diversity of life on Earth today.

"The Triassic is a very interesting and amazing time in Earth history.
There are a lot of animals, even modern animal groups, that appeared
during this time or diversified during this time," Scheyer said. "That's
partly because of the layout of the land at this time, and because it's
the time period that follows one of the biggest mass extinctions in
history."

\href{/2020/05/08/world/marine-reptile-fossil-pebble-teeth-scn/index.html}{}

\includegraphics{//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200507150754-03-cartorhynchus-ancient-finds-large-169.jpg}

\href{/2020/05/08/world/marine-reptile-fossil-pebble-teeth-scn/index.html}{This
extinct marine predator started out as a small tadpole-seal hybrid with
weird teeth}

"All this enabled certain groups to diversify in these environments, and
among those are some really bizarre creatures -\/- one of those is the
** Tanystropheus," he added.

The time period these scientists are looking at occurred about 9 million
years after the mass extinction which wiped out about 96\% of marine
species on Earth at the time, according to a
\href{https://earth.stanford.edu/news/what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction\#gs.cou6am}{2018
study} published in Science. But
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/world/marine-reptile-fossil-pebble-teeth-scn/index.html}{marine
life} had a little time to recover by the Triassic period, making that
time frame rich in fossils, especially in Switzerland's Monte San
Giorgio area.

Nowadays, the area is forested and has nice hiking paths that take
visitors through the mountains of the Swiss-Italian border. The fossils
that the researchers are now examining with the latest CT scan
technology were actually unearthed in digging campaigns between the
1920s and 1950s -\/- and have long been held in museum collections and
university basements.

But those excavation sites would have looked very different 242 million
years ago.

\href{/2019/09/23/world/lost-continent-europe-scn-trnd/index.html}{A
lost continent has been found under Europe}

"Imagine something like the modern Bahamas today with an island dotted
landscape, shallow water, warm climate, a sea that was not too deep with
islands where some of the terrestrial animals that we find in these
localities come from," Scheyer explained. "It was a unique ecosystem
which we are basically lacking any modern counterpart, and all these
modern animals don't have modern representatives anymore."

Scheyer added that studying
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/06/world/tiny-bug-slayer-fossil-scn-trnd/index.html}{strange
forms of life} such as the Tanystropheus is important for understanding
our current ecosystems and biodiversity.

"It's important to be reminded that we have only a small percentage of
Earth's biodiversity present today, and of course it's diminishing,
partially because of our own actions and partially because of
environmental changes," Scheyer said. "It's important to understand
biodiversity and how biodiversity changes over time."

"Tanystropheus is an iconic fossil and has always been," Rieppel added
in a statement. "To clarify its taxonomy is an important first step to
understanding that group and its evolution."
