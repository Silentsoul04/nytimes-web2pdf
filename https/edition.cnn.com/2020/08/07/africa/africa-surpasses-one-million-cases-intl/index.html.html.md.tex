A patient takes a coronavirus test at a hospital in Nigeria. Some people
are treating the virus at home in Africa because of difficulties getting
tested and treated.

Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)More than one million people in Africa have been
infected with the novel coronavirus but health experts say the numbers
do not give a "full picture" of the outbreak on the continent.

As of early Friday morning, Africa had recorded a total of 1,008,154
cases, and more than half of these are in South Africa.

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, of the World Health Organization, said the cases
are a small fraction of the global count but low testing in many African
countries means infections have been under-reported.

The health agency said while testing facilities have increased in some
countries compared to when the outbreak began in February, Africa still
fell behind the global benchmark.

countries are still waiting for a surge in Covid-19 cases. Some public

In Tanzania, the government claims it has
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/09/africa/tanzania-president-covid-claims/index.html}{defeated
coronavirus} and has not released any official data since May, and in
Nigeria, the WHO is concerned that testing is not available at the
grassroots level.

"The challenge is how to decentralize these tests available in states
and in countries like Nigeria where we need to get to people in the
local governments," the agency's program manager for emergency response
for Africa, Dr. Michel Yao told CNN.

\subsubsection{Long test result turnaround
time}\label{long-test-result-turnaround-time}}

Nigeria, the African nation with the largest population, has tested less
than one percent of its 200 million inhabitants as of Friday, and some
in the country say getting a coronavirus test can be challenge.

While testing is free in state-owned laboratories, there are few of
these facilities and they are in major cities. And sometimes, health
officials have had to transfer
\href{https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/covid-19-20-states-yet-to-have-testing-laboratories.html}{samples
to other states to confirm results} due to a shortage of kits.

The state of Lagos is the epicenter of the virus in Nigeria, with
\href{https://twitter.com/ProfAkinAbayomi/status/1291669133118132226?s=20}{15,580
cases.} It has recently closed health centers specifically created to
treat Covid patients.

On Monday, the state's governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, announced that
worship centers can accommodate half their capacity during services and
restaurants are back in business, citing a steady decline in cases.

There are concerns that people there are self-managing their symptoms at
home. Lagos has tested 66,431 samples so far, a fraction of its 20
million residents.

One resident told CNN he waited for two weeks to get a test at a
government laboratory after he fell ill in June.

"I was going there many times, and it was not until my daughter made
many calls, and I ran into a doctor friend who was at the hospital that
day that I was able to do the test," Segun Bello-Osagie said.

Scientists at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of
Infectious Diseases in Nigeria analyse COVID-19 samples.

\hypertarget{patient-turned-back}{%
\subsubsection{Patient turned back}\label{patient-turned-back}}

Bello-Osagie said a nurse turned him back at the first hospital where he
sought treatment when he became sick.

"I was not allowed into the consulting area, and the nurse was shouting
that I should not come in even though I was wearing a face mask, and she
was dressed like an astronaut," Osagie-Bello told CNN.

"She said, 'We can't help you here, we don't attend to Covid people
here,' even though I hadn't even been tested."

She referred him to a government hospital in the city attending to
coronavirus cases. Osagie-Bello said he went home instead, fearing he
may not endure the long drive and traffic to the hospital.

He said he began using herbal therapies that many claimed had helped
them when they had similar symptoms while he self-isolated at home.

half of April's unexplained deaths in Nigeria's Kano state due to

Osagie-Bello says that even though the government has proactively
deployed measures to check the virus spread, the delays patients face
could discourage them from going to hospitals.

"I know some people who have had symptoms suspected to be Covid-19 gave
up on getting testing," he told CNN. He added that some hospital
officials may tell patients to come back the next day.

Chike Ihekweazu, director of the Nigerian Center for Disease Control,
acknowledged the slow turnaround time for testing and said the response
was partly due to the challenge the country faced initially trying to
repurpose its laboratories to test for the virus.

Ihekwaezu said South Africa in contrast, which has the highest numbers
of testing on the continent and the highest numbers of cases, was able
to easily do this.

Ihekweazu said the agency has been able to address problems sourcing kit
reagents. But he was forced to turn to Twitter in April to seek testing
material. He posted a message saying that the agency was
\href{https://punchng.com/coronavirus-nigeria-desperately-looking-for-test-kits-says-ncdc/}{"desperately"}
looking for more RNA extraction kits to expand testing in the country.

"We recognise that improving access to testing for COVID-19 is a major
priority. We will continue to work closely with other stakeholders and
partners to ensure that Nigerians can be tested in a timely manner that
will also contribute to the control of this outbreak," Ihekweazu told
CNN.

Another barrier to testing is cost, according to Mobihealth
International CEO Funmi Adewara, whose organization is among those
assisting laboratories with Covid-19 test sample collection, says.

Private facilities charge \$132 for tests in addition to the cost of
processing the tests. The fee, she says, is prohibitive for a majority
of Nigerians without health insurance. Many hit by the economic impact
of Nigeria's five-week lockdown to tackle the pandemic.

"How many people have that kind of money to pay for this test?" Adewara
said.

She add that Nigeria's testing model excludes asymptomatic carriers, a
critical data point that could give health officials a clearer insight
into the outbreak in the country.

"We haven't tested enough to the point that we have data to interpret
the pattern of infections if we're only testing those with symptoms, but
the good thing is that the mortality rate seems low going by official
figures," Adewara told CNN.

\subsubsection{Dealing with a new
virus}\label{dealing-with-a-new-virus}}

In the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, only two laboratories
-\/- one in
\href{https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3051422/who-sends-coronavirus-test-kits-african-nations-after-first}{Senegal
and one in South Africa} -\/- had the capacity to test for the novel
coronavirus. It took more than a week to confirm a positive case as
samples were taken from different countries to these labs.

There are now more testing facilities but Yao with the WHO said the
global demand for test kits has limited Africa's testing capabilities as
international suppliers prioritize requests from countries in Europe,
Latin America and the US with larger caseloads than most African
countries.

But the African Union in partnership with aid organizations, including
the WHO and the Jack Ma Foundation, has launched an initiative to
aggregate demand across African countries to mobilize suppliers to
produce more kits, according to Yao.

"We need to test wider and wider, not only those who are sick to be more
confident so we're not swimming in the dark," Yao said
