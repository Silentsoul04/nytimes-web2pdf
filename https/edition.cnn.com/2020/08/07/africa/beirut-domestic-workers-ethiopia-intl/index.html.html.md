(CNN)Like many domestic workers in Beirut, Hanna was laid off from her
job in recent months because of the country's deep economic crisis.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">

The 21-year-old lives in a small room in Lebanon's capital city with six
other Ethiopian women. When Beirut's devastating blast hit on Tuesday
evening, it blew out their door and all their windows.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">

"We weren't home at the time, so we are safe," Hanna said, speaking to
CNN on the condition that her full name wasn't used. But now, she said,
"anyone in the street can walk through the door and find us sleeping. We
are afraid."

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Hanna and her six roommates are just some of the thousands-strong mainly
African domestic worker population living in Lebanon. Some of them were
swept up in the explosion that left a 10-kilometer circle of destruction
in Beirut.

The treatment of domestic workers in Lebanon had already come under
intense scrutiny in recent months. Last week, CNN [reported multiple
allegations](/2020/07/28/middleeast/beirut-kenya-as-equals-intl/index.html)
of abuse by the top two officials at the Kenyan consulate in Beirut. The
assistant consul denied all allegations of wrongdoing at the consulate,
while the honorary consul did not respond to requests for a comment.

Lebanon's economic crisis was exacerbated by the onset of the Covid-19

Recently, a [video surfaced

of Nigerian women, in a room, making a direct appeal to the camera, and
pleading with their government to rescue them.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

The veracity of the video was confirmed to CNN by Abike Dabiri-Erewa,
who is the Chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, a
government agency that oversees diaspora affairs.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

She told CNN the women had been reached before the explosion and were in
a safe location.

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"We will be evacuating them on August 12," Dabiri-Erewa added. They will
be repatriated to Nigeria alongside another 150 others in Lebanon, she

For many migrant workers in Beirut, the destruction of Tuesday's blast
added one more reason to quit the country.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Aster Kidane, an Ethiopian migrant employed as a domestic worker in
Beirut, told CNN that she was sweeping the floor when the explosion
shattered windows. Glass shards left her cut and bruised but she was
treated at home because hospitals in Beirut are so overwhelmed.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"Glass cut my arm in two places, I was bleeding everywhere," Aster said.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"The blast destroyed a lot of homes, I'm not aware if I even have a home
to return to," said Tsigereda Birhanu, a domestic worker and member of
the Beirut-based Ethiopian migrant rights collective [Egna Legna
Besidet.](https://egnalegna.org/#about-us)

Tsigereda says she has been visiting hospitals to check up on wounded
domestic workers.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"They were bandaging people outside since the hospitals were full,"
Tsigereda told CNN. "I've met with injured Sudanese and an Ethiopian."

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

One Ethiopian has died so far following the explosion and nine others
injured including "one woman who is in intensive care fighting for her
life," Ethiopia's Consul General Temesgen Omer told CNN.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

### 'Endless stream of trauma'

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Egna Legna Besidet was founded by Banchi Yimer, a former domestic worker
who now lives in Canada.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

In April, Banchi started a crowdfunding initiative that has raised over
$125,000 US to help domestic workers in crisis.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Aster and Tsigereda are among more than 250,000 migrant workers who hail
from countries in Asia and Africa and live in Lebanon working in private
households, according to [rights group Amnesty
International.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/06/lebanon-abandoned-migrant-domestic-workers-must-be-protected/)

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

The vast majority of the migrant domestic workers with work permits are
females from Ethiopia, Amnesty said in a report citing 2018 figures.
Accurate figures for all workers are hard to come by as some of the
domestic workers, who are mostly women, are trafficked or brought into
the country illegally.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Many have been abused under the controversial kefala system, a form of
indentured servitude that ties the woman's immigration/residency status
to a live-in work contract.

</div>

<div class="el__embedded el__embedded--standard">

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Aster says under a previous employer, she wasn't allowed to eat more
than one egg a day. "The kefala system allowed them to treat me like a
pet or a toy. They could use me, beat me, and discard me when they
wanted," she said.

She eventually moved on to her current employer, whom she says treats
her better. Domestic workers often face prejudice in Lebanon, activist
groups say -- which can make it even harder to access help in a year
beset with crises.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"They live under racism and discrimination," said Farah Salka, of
Lebanon's Anti-Racism Movement. "They are running from one escalating
situation to the other and it is an endless stream of trauma. They have
faced Covid, economic crisis, airport closure, quarantine restrictions
in often hostile conditions and they want to go home."

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

### No easy way home

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

But for Ethiopian workers, finding a way home isn't easy. To be
repatriated, Salka says the women are required to pay $600 for the
flight plus $140 per night for 14 days of quarantine upon arrival in the
country.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

In some cases, the [total cost was as high as
$1450.](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ethiopia-lebanon-domestic-workers-pay-quarantine)

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"Who has this money? In this country that is in complete crisis?" Salka
asked.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

With prospects bleak and unable to afford return tickets home, many
domestic workers have chosen to work in homes for free to avoid
homelessness and starvation on Beirut's streets, according to Yimer.
Others were abandoned by their employers outside the doors of the
Ethiopian Consulate in Beirut.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted a message of condolences for
the Lebanese people on Tuesday and called on Ethiopian citizens to
contact the consulate for assistance.

CNN has reached out to the Ethiopian government for comment on the

Billene Seyoum, the Press Secretary for the Office of the Prime
Minister, referred CNN to the Ministry of Foreign affairs when reached
for comment on complaints about repatriation. The Ministry is yet to
respond to queries.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"There were no tweets when Ethiopians pleaded to be rescued nearly 11
months ago," said Yimer.

</div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">

"Most Ethiopians are in this predicament because the government refused
to evacuate its citizens."
