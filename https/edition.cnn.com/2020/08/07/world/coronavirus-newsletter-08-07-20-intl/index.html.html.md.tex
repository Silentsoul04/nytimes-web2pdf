(CNN)More than
\href{https://cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/}{19
million people around the world} have now been infected with the
coronavirus, and 715,024 have died. The number of new daily cases has
topped 200,000 -\/- a level not seen before July -\/- for 23 days in
row.

In India, the number of infections
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/07/asia/india-coronavirus-two-million-intl-hnk/index.html}{surpassed
2 million today}. The speed at which the virus has spread around the
country of 1.3 billion people is stunning. India reported its first case
on January 30. It took almost six months to reach 1 million cases, then
only three more weeks to add another million.

Meanwhile, there are now 1 million reported cases in Africa -\/- more
than half of them in South Africa -\/- although the World Health
Organization said the actual number of infections in the region might be
much higher because
\href{https://cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-08-07-20-intl/h_a189fc2d94d7d9b51b92fcdf1bdf664e}{testing
remains a challenge}.

And Brazil, the world's second worst-hit country, is fast approaching 3
million cases and 100,000 deaths.

But it is the United States that is seeing the
\href{http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html}{highest
numbers of infections and deaths}. More than 4.8 million Americans have
been infected -\/- approximately one in 75 -\/- and more than 160,000
have died.

The numbers could get much worse. Several US states are seeing an
increase in the percentage of tests coming back positive, and Dr.
Anthony Fauci said this was a predictor of trouble ahead. "It's a clear
indication that you are getting an uptick in cases, which inevitably, as
we've seen in the southern states, leads to surges, and then you get
hospitalizations and then you get deaths,"
\href{https://cnn.com/videos/health/2020/08/06/dr-anthony-fauci-birx-warning-trouble-ahead-newday-vpx.cnn}{Fauci
told} CNN yesterday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now projecting more
than 181,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by August 29. That
means the CDC expects almost 1,000 Americans to die on average every day
in the next three weeks.

Looking further ahead, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
at the University of Washington's School of Medicine foresees nearly
\href{http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html}{300,000
US deaths} by December 1. It doesn't have to be that way. The institute
said 70,000 lives can be saved between now and December, if only more
people started wearing masks.

"Starting today, if 95\% of the people in the US were to wear masks when
leaving their homes, that total number would decrease to 228,271 deaths,
a drop of 49\%," said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray.

\textbf{Q: Should I get a mask with a vent?}

\textbf{A:} No. The CDC does not recommend people use masks with valves
or vents during the pandemic. The one-way valves may provide more
comfort, since the valves allow air to escape from the mask and keep the
face cooler, but they also allow the virus to escape.

The CDC encourages people to wear masks so they don't infect others.
Covid-19 spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when a person
talks, sneezes, sings or coughs. Masks can help stop those respiratory
droplets.

\textbf{It's ok not to be ok}

"The idea that what this country is going through shouldn't have any
effect on us---that we all should just feel OK all the time---that just
doesn't feel real to me. So I hope you all are allowing yourselves to
feel whatever it is you're feeling."

The
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/06/us/michelle-obama-coronavirus-depression-trnd/index.html}{words
of former First Lady Michelle Obama} rang true to many across America
and around the world. Obama said she was suffering from a "low-grade
depression" caused by worries about the pandemic, race relations in the
US and the political strife surrounding it all.

A new report from the Commonwealth Fund into the impact of the pandemic
on mental health found that many adults reported experiencing stress,
anxiety, or great sadness that was difficult to cope with alone since
the outbreak started. But while there were people who were suffering in
every one of the 10 developed countries the researchers looked at, the
report found that
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-mental-health-problems-wellness/index.html}{Americans
were impacted much more}: 33\% of Americans have said they felt anxious,
stressed or sad. The countries with the next highest levels were Canada
and the UK, both of which reported 26\% of people feeling anxious or
stressed.

The country with the lowest levels of stress, anxiety and sadness was
Norway, where 10\% of adults reported these mental health concerns.

\textbf{Some teachers wrote their own obituaries as part of their
back-to-school prep}

In addition to all her usual back-to-school preparations this summer,
veteran teacher
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/06/us/iowa-teachers-coronavirus-obits-trnd/index.html}{Sarah
Backstrom wrote her own obituary} and sent it to Iowa Governor Kim
Reynolds' office. Backstrom said she was scared about returning to the
classroom after Reynolds released guidance that said at least half of
schools' instruction must be conducted in person -\/- and that schools
couldn't request online-only education unless their county's positivity
rate was 15\% or higher.

She is one of scores of educators across America dreading the start of
the school year. Teachers in Gwinnett County, Georgia are
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/07/us/georgia-teachers-protest-return-to-school/index.html}{protesting
the district's plan} for students to return to school even as hundreds
of district employees have tested positive for Covid-19 or are in
quarantine because of potential exposure. The teachers and their
families gathered -\/- in their cars -\/- in Suwanee yesterday, honking
horns and displaying signs to express their displeasure with the
district's recent decision to phase in face-to-face instruction.

And when a high school student in Dallas, Georgia shared a photo of a
hallway packed with maskless students at her school,
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/07/us/georgia-teen-photo-crowded-school-hallway-trnd/index.html}{she
got suspended}. "I was concerned for the safety of everyone in that
building and everyone in the county because precautions that the CDC and
guidelines that the CDC has been telling us for months now, weren't
being followed," Hannah Watters said.

\textbf{What's new on the vaccine front}

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged any nation that
eventually produces a viable
\href{https://cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-08-07-20-intl/h_ed9071aa4e540f3f320425d2f08a818e}{coronavirus
vaccine to share it} with the world. "Any country that was to find this
vaccine and not make it available around the world without restraint...
will be judged terribly by history," Morrison said at a news conference
today.

Meanwhile in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro said that the experimental
vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and biopharmaceutical
company AstraZeneca may be available to Brazilians from "December or
January" -\/- and that once that happens, the pandemic "would be
overcome" in a matter of weeks. The vaccine is currently under phase
three testing in Brazil.

In the US, President Trump said yesterday that he was "optimistic" a
vaccine would be ready around election day on November 3, even as
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/donald-trump-vaccines-election-2020/index.html}{his
own experts urged caution}.

As of this week, 26 vaccines are in human trials around the world and a
further 139 are in pre-clinical trials.

\textbf{US lifts 'Do Not Travel' advisory. But where can Americans go?}

After more than four months, the US State Department
\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/state-department-level-4-advisory-lifted/index.html}{lifted
yesterday its advisory} warning US citizens against traveling abroad.
The department issued the Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory -\/- the
highest level -\/- on March 19, urging US citizens not to travel
overseas due to the coronavirus pandemic.

But even though the advisory has been lifted, American travelers
continue to face severe restrictions in countries worldwide due to the
severity of the crisis in the US.

The
\href{https://cnn.com/travel/article/us-international-travel-covid-19/index.html}{European
Union has blocked entry to US tourists}, and the UK requires travelers
from the US to quarantine for 14 days.

There are also restrictions on non-essential travel between the US and
its neighbors to the north and south -\/- Canada and Mexico -\/- until
at least late August.
