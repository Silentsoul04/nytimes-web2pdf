A member of the Yanomami community gets medical attention on July 1,
2020 in Roraima, Brazil.

(CNN)Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday handed a partial victory to the
nation's embattled indigenous communities, who are struggling against an
insidious new enemy: the Covid-19 virus.

The court
\href{http://stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=448997}{affirmed}
an earlier court decision that required the federal government to
implement safety measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus,
which has swept through the many remote communities with deadly effect.

"It was a great victory," said Dinaman Tuxa, executive-coordinator of
\href{http://apib.info/apib/?lang=en}{APIB}, an indigenous group that
brought the lawsuit against the government along with six political
parties, describing the ruling as a historic reparation for injustices
against indigenous people even before the pandemic.

"If it wasn't for {[}the court{]}, this demand would be still in the
drawers of the Executive and the Legislative," he said.

But the indigenous groups' main demand was rejected: A deadline for all
outsiders -\/- including miners, developers and the military -\/- to
leave their lands.

Brazil's indigenous communities have been hammered by Covid-19. By early
August, more than 22,000 indigenous people had been diagnosed with the
coronavirus, and least 631 had died from it, according to APIB. But due
to limited testing, the real toll could be higher.

In a tragic coincidence, a prominent indigenous leader Chief Aritana
Yawalapiti of the Upper Xingu territory died of the virus on the day of
the ruling, according to his nephew Kaiulu Yawalapiti. "My heart is in
pieces, bleeding," Yawalapiti told CNN.

The chief, 71, was admitted to ICU on July 22 after suffering from
severe breathing problems. His son, Tapi Yawalapiti, told CNN that same
day that the Upper Xingu lacked medical supplies, testing kits, and
medical assistance to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Covid-19 spreads very fast, the whole community is sick, children, the
young, the elderly. We are being neglected by the Brazilian government,
they are not helping us enough and it seems that they want to decimate
us," he said.

Dinaman Tuxa of APIB said Yawalapiti's death meant much more than the
loss of a singular life. "Those elderly are the keepers of knowledge,
languages, traditions, festivities, rituals," he said. "We are losing
much more than people, we are losing our culture, our nation."

\href{/2020/08/07/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-amazon-fires-intl/index.html}{Fires
are raging in the Amazon, despite a Brazil government ban. The
destruction could be worse than last summer}

Some 800,000 indigenous people live in villages throughout Brazil. As
the pandemic has spread, many of the communities have echoed
Yawalapiti's complaint about government neglect.

As the coronavirus spread through Brazil this year, the country's health
ministry and local governments did install indigenous wards in hospitals
throughout the Amazon. In conjunction with the defense ministry, they
also sent medical equipment, supplies and personnel to military
hospitals in remote areas such as São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Tabatinga,
and Javari Valley.

But some key initiatives to protect indigenous Braziliana have been
stymied at the very highest levels of government.

On July 8, President Jair Bolsonaro
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/americas/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-intl/index.html}{vetoed
parts} of an emergency bill that would have assured access to drinking
water, free distribution of hygiene products and the distribution of
cleaning and disinfection materials to indigenous communities, citing
the cost. He also vetoed a proposal ensuring mandatory emergency funds
for indigenous people's healthcare and has argued that legislating
mandatory expenditures does not "account for the respective budgetary
and financial impact, which would be unconstitutional."

The vetoes fit into a larger pattern for the pro-business, right-wing
leader, who has a historically antagonistic relationship with indigenous
Brazilians. Many rights activists have protested the increase of illegal
mining and logging on their lands which followed Bolsonaro's rise to
power.

The judge who wrote the
\href{http://www.stf.jus.br/arquivo/cms/noticiaNoticiaStf/anexo/adpf709.pdf}{July
8 ruling} that was affirmed Wednesday by the Supreme Court cited
Bolsonaro's remarks in his decision. "It is also worth noting that there
has been a large government resistance to the realization of rights
indigenous peoples' rights," Justice Luis Roberto Barroso wrote, citing
media reports quoting Bolsonaro's support for development, including
"indigenous reserves make the Amazon unfeasible."

Indigenous people in Brazil often live in communities which are far from
hospitals, in areas which often lack basic infrastructure. Those who
move to towns or cities can end up in precarious living conditions with
few public services, increasing their vulnerability to health issues.

A
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117531v1}{study
conducted} in May and June reported that indigenous people are five
times more likely to contract the coronavirus compared with the
country's white population.

The study by \href{https://portal.ufpel.edu.br/en/}{Pelotas Federal
University} found that indigenous Brazilian's vulnerability remains
higher than that of white Brazilians, even within the same socioeconomic
status and with the same number of residents in the home.

"The interpretation of these analyses suggests that indigenous subjects
were at substantially higher risk than other ethnic groups," the study
said.

Overall, Brazil is second only to the United States in terms of
coronavirus cases, according to the
\href{https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html}{Johns Hopkins University
tracker}. As of Saturday morning, it had reported nearly 3 million cases
with fatalities inching toward 100,000 people.

\subsubsection{No deadline for
outsiders}\label{no-deadline-for-outsiders}}

The new safety measures mandated by the Supreme Court include the
protection of isolated and recently contacted communities, the
establishment of a crisis committee involving indigenous groups and the
supply of health assistance to territories that were not yet recognized
by the government.

In response, Brazil's Ministry for Women, Family and Human Rights has
told CNN that it's already complying with the Supreme Court decision by
creating a working group on July 22 to develop a plan to combat
Covid-19.

But the court's reluctance to set a timeline for the departure of
outsiders was a setback for the litigants.

Amid the pandemic, health risks to the indigenous communities have been
exacerbated by the presence of outsiders, according to their leaders.

APIB sought the removal of outsiders from territories of Yanomami,
Karipuna, Uru-Eu- Wau-Wau, Kayapó, Araribóia Indigenous Lands, Munduruku
and Trincheira Bacajá. "Those 7 territories are suffering
life-threatening situations," said Eloy Terena, legal advisor to APIB.

"It is estimated that more than 20,000 illegal miners are currently
inside the Yanomami land," said Dario Kopenawa, a leader with the
Hutukara association, which represents the community in the Amazonian
territory, home to 27,000 people and known for its rich gold deposits.

That number was disputed by Brazil Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who
is leading the government's campaign to combat illegal mining and
logging and who said,
\href{https://twitter.com/generalmourao?lang=en}{via Twitter}, the
number was closer to 3,500 illegal miners.

More recently, military missions to distribute medical supplies have
alarmed indigenous leaders, who say aid should come through the health
ministry, which already has outposts in indigenous lands and where
health workers understand indigenous concerns.

"We are very upset with the way it was done," Júnior Hekurari, President
of the District Council of Indigenous Health (Condisi) Yanomami e
Ye'kuanajust told CNN.

The first military mission to the Yanomani, between June 29 and July 5,
involved nearly 50 people onboard, including over 20 medical staff and
18 journalists. "They were supposed to only bring supplies and
medicines, not a full committee with dozens of people," Hekurasi said.

The Defense Ministry said that all the personnel on the mission -\/-
aimed at providing medical assistance and supplies -\/- had been tested
for Covid-19.

Two other military missions -\/- to different indigenous communities
-\/- took place in the past few weeks, and the Army said it followed
protocols by ensuring everybody taking part had quarantined for 14 days
before taking part.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court's majority said that while the presence
of outsiders was illegal, it refused to set a deadline. Instead, it
ordered Brazil's government to establish an "action protocol" for their
departure.

"This shows the strength of the agribusiness, the miners and the
politicians," said APIB's Terena. "We were very concerned, because if
the Supreme Court didn't want to confront those people, who would then?"

The justices however did acknowledge the fragility of the indigenous
lands. Their decision highlighted that Brazil's indigenous people -\/-
for historical, cultural, and social reasons -\/- are more vulnerable to
infectious diseases, with a mortality rate higher than the national
average.

One of the justices, Luiz Fux, went further, noting it wasn't an
overstatement to describe the situation as genocide.

"To talk about an ongoing genocide means that the indigenous people are
dying, and the Brazilian state cannot continue to pretend that it is not
seeing this tragedy."
