Explaining the conflict in Libya 02:58

Washington (CNN)As several countries come to the aid of
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/09/world/russia-libya-military-intervention-intl/index.html}{warring
factions in Libya}, President Donald Trump has found himself caught in
the middle of a group of strongmen he's forged close ties with during
his presidency, prompting him to stay out of the fray and let them fend
for themselves.

Recent pleas by the leaders of Turkey, Egypt and others for Trump to get
involved in the conflict have fallen on deaf ears, several foreign and
US officials tell CNN. The Trump White House had taken an active
interest in the conflict in 2019, reaching out to Gen. Khalifa Haftar,
the warlord leading an offensive against the country's United
Nations-backed government. But in recent months, the President's stance
has changed, with Trump telling those leaders that he'd rather not get
involved in another messy Middle Eastern conflict.

In particular, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt have worked to convince Trump to get
involved diplomatically and put pressure on Russian President Vladimir
Putin to back down from its own objectives in the country. The Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and the Crown Prince of the
United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed, have also weighed in, these
officials said.

Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE's ally in Libya, rebel
commander, Gen. Haftar, suffered a string of defeats in recent months as
his militias tried to oust the government in Tripoli so he could install
himself as Libya's ruler.

Turkey, Italy and Qatar, meanwhile, are collectively trying to prop up
Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj's Government of National Accord. In
recent days, the likelihood of a full-blown conflict breaking out
increased after Egypt's parliament green lighted the deployment of
troops to Libya in support of Haftar's rebel forces.

Trump has told all of them that he would rather avoid being involved
ahead of the presidential election with so many other domestic issues
weighing him down and urged them to sort the issue out amongst
themselves, these officials said.

\hypertarget{erdogan-is-constantly-calling-trump}{%
\subsubsection{Erdogan is 'constantly calling'
Trump}\label{erdogan-is-constantly-calling-trump}}

A US and Turkish official said that Erdogan is "constantly calling the
President" to get him to get Russia to back down. The two governments
don't always provide readouts for those calls, the officials noted.

Trump has extolled his ties to other world leaders known for
authoritarian methods, including Putin, el-Sisi and Erdogan. He hasn't
publicly admonished any of those countries for their human rights
record, nor has he urged against some of their controversial military
endeavors, instead, accepting the explanation that they are fighting
extremists.

Even as the potential for war in Libya grows, Trump has not sought to
talk any of his allies off their perch of a full-blown conflict.

again accuses Russia of sending arms and mercenaries to Libya}

"The President usually tells them, 'do what you need to do. I'm not
going to tell you what to do'," one US official said.

Russia and Turkey's backing of opposing sides in the Libyan civil war is
part of a competition for future investment opportunities, including oil
contracts worth billions, in the oil-rich country. France, Greece and
other European nations have taken an interest in the conflict escalating
on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, warning that Russia's
involvement speaks to its interest in having a strong presence at
Europe's southern doorstep.

In recent weeks, fighters loyal to Libya's government, supported by
Turkey, pushed closer to the oil-rich city of Sirte on the Mediterranean
Sea coast, ready for battle. Thousands of Russian military contractors
with armored vehicles and Syrian militiamen have also surrounded the
city in recent days in an effort to bolster forces loyal to Haftar.

The State Department has participated in some talks regarding Libya's
future, as the conflict rages on. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took
part this year in a Libya summit hosted in Berlin, where countries
including France, Russia and Turkey laid out a cease-fire plan, which
ultimately failed, and called for an end to violence despite their own
surreptitious support to the warring factions.

\hypertarget{mixed-messages}{%
\subsubsection{Mixed messages}\label{mixed-messages}}

But some accuse Washington of confusing things with mixed messages.
Under former national security adviser John Bolton, the leaders of Saudi
Arabia and Egypt successfully lobbied Trump to shift US policy in Libya
and reach out to Haftar, a senior US administration official and two
Saudi officials said. Saudi Arabia's bin Salman and Egypt's el-Sisi
urged Trump to back Haftar. Trump agreed, reaching out to Haftar in
April 2019 to discuss "a shared vision for Libya's transition to a
stable, democratic political system," the White House said. Bolton also
had a separate conversation with Haftar during his tenure.

Those calls had marked a significant shift in Washington's position,
which, until then, had unequivocally supported the UN-recognized
government in Tripoli and worked with it in the war on Islamic State.

\href{/2020/06/09/world/russia-libya-military-intervention-intl/index.html}{Russia
raises stakes with 'brazen' military intervention in Libyan conflict}

Officials tell CNN that Bolton and others in his circle had convinced
the White House that a bet on Haftar, who vows to root out Islamists who
have taken hold of Libya in the post-Qaddafi era, was more promising
than any State Department view, which one official described as "very
much in the Turkey camp, but with the view that Russia is a bad actor."

On Tuesday, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said in a
statement that the US strongly opposes "foreign military involvement,
including the use of mercenaries and private military contractors, by
all sides," while falling short of mentioning Russia or any other actors
by name.

The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control then announced on
Thursday sanctions against individuals which it said had contributed to
instability in Libya through smuggling. But ultimately, O'Brien
emphasized that the US is "an active, but neutral actor" in the Libya
conflict, noting in his statement that "it is clear there is no
'winning' side."
