## What we know about the blast in Beirut

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 post-content-rendered render-stellar-contentstyles__Content-sc-9v7nwy-0 ivqjEu">

A massive [explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital of
Beirut](https://cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-port-explosion-ammonium-nitrate-intl-hnk/index.html) on
Tuesday left at least 137 people dead and thousands injured.

Here's what we know about the blast so far:

<div class="Text-sc-1amvtpj-0 render-stellar-contentstyles__List-sc-9v7nwy-1 hWPJAy">

  - **Ongoing investigation:** At least 16 employees of Beirut's port
    have been detained as part of an investigation into the explosion
    that shook the capital, Lebanese National News \[NNA\] agency said
    Thursday.
  - **International support:** The US military is sending three C-17
    transport aircrafts to Lebanon in order to provide relief supplies
    to the Lebanese people. French aid to Beirut "will not go to corrupt
    hands," French President Emmanuel Macron told Lebanese protesters on
    Thursday, an Elysée spokesperson told CNN.
  - **The blast:** The explosion took place at 6:07 p.m. local time
    Tuesday near Beirut's port and central district, close to many
    highly-populated areas and tourist sites. Beirut's governor Marwan
    Abboud told reporters that the explosion had resulted in an
    estimated $3 to $5 billion in damage.
  - **The aftermath:** A crater created by the explosion appeared to be
    roughly 124 meters, or 405 feet, in diameter — well over a football
    field in length, according to CNN analysis of a Planet Labs, Inc.
    satellite image.
  - **Impact to residents:** Abboud told Jordan's state-owned channel Al
    Mamlaka that at least 300,000 people were "unable to sleep in their
    homes."

At least 137 people are dead and 5,000 wounded following an explosion in
Lebanon's capital city of Beirut. The city is decimated with thousands
of residents left homeless, a medical system already strained from
coronavirus and up to $5 billion worth of damage.

Several charities are on the ground providing medical care, shelter,
supplies and other services to help the city recover and rebuild.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that France was
organizing an international conference to help raise support for Lebanon
in the aftermath of Tuesday’s devastating blast at Beirut port.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> Within a few days, France will help organize “an international
> conference of support and assistance for Beirut and the Lebanese
> population to mobilize international funding on the part of the
> Europeans, Americans and all the countries of the region and beyond,
> in order to provide medicine and food and all that is necessary for
> housing,” Macron told reporters in Beirut.

</div>

Macron visited the capital earlier in the day and met with
representatives of multiple political parties and civil society groups. 

Macron said that any funds raised in an upcoming international
conference to help Lebanon would be handled with “full transparency.”

He promised “clear and transparent governance, whether it’s French or
international” to ensure the funds are “directly provided to the local
population, the NGOs and teams on site that need it.”

## This bride thought "I'm going to die" when the blast went off at her wedding photoshoot

</div>

It was all [captured on
video](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-explosion-couple-wedding-shoot-trnd/index.html).
A short block from her wedding venue, 29-year-old Dr. Israa Seblani was
in the middle of a pose for her wedding photoshoot when the explosion
happened in Beirut. Seblani, her husband, Ahmad Sbeih, and the video
crew ran for cover with destruction all around them.

“At that moment, one thing I thought about, “Now, I'm losing my
life, I'm losing my husband, I’m going to be buried under a building,
now I'm going to die. Now I'm waiting the moment. How I'm going to
die? Is it going to be fast? Am I going to feel it? Am I going to be
near him?’” she said.

Seblani, a US resident and Lebanon native, was in Beirut to get married
because her husband had not gotten a US visa, despite waiting for three
years. Not wanting to be apart any longer, they decided to celebrate in
the capital city of Lebanon, where their love first blossomed, CNN’s
Jomana Karadsheh reported.

When Seblani returned to the wedding venue, she said the beautiful
restaurant had transformed into a “nightmare.”

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 pull-quotestyles__PullQuoteContainer-sc-1ia2e5m-0 idZwuC">

““It turned out into a ghost town, filled with dust,
shattered glass. People yelling, bleeding.””

</div>

Prior to the wedding, she had done a final run through of the bridal
suite where the couple would spend the night after the party. She was
excited about the decorations. But when they returned, the red rose
petals thrown off the bed were all that remained of the romance they
envisioned, Karadsheh reported, adding that in a city where life was
turned upside down in seconds, the couple are just grateful to be alive.

The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund said it is time
to address the deep economic crisis Lebanon is facing, urging both sides
to overcome “the impasse in the discussions on critical reforms.”

“In the aftermath of the terrible tragedy in Lebanon, it is time for
national unity - to overcome this disaster, as well as to address the
deep economic and social crisis that the country continues to face,” IMF
chief Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement Thursday.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> “The IMF is exploring all possible ways to support the people of
> Lebanon. It is essential to overcome the impasse in the discussions on
> critical reforms and put in place a meaningful program to turn around
> the economy and build accountability and trust in the future of the
> country,” she added.

</div>

Georgieva also called on the international community and the friends of
Lebanon to step up to help the country in this moment of urgent need.

Lebanon defaulted on some of its debt in March seeking a $10 billion IMF
loan, but bailout talks with IMF have stalled.

The US military is sending three C-17 transport aircrafts to Lebanon in
order to provide relief supplies to the Lebanese people following the
deadly Beirut explosion.

The commander of US Central Command, Gen. Frank Mckenzie, informed the

## This elderly couple is one of thousands who can't return to their destroyed home

From CNN's Aditi Sangal

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 post-content-rendered render-stellar-contentstyles__Content-sc-9v7nwy-0 ivqjEu">

George Faraoun went to his parents’ retirement home that looked directly
on to the Beirut port that was the site of the massive explosion on
Tuesday.

It completely destroyed the apartment, causing a wall to collapse over
Faraoun’s mother. Dried blood marks the spot where she was resting in
bed. She’s still in the hospital, CNN's Ben Wedeman reports.

Given the damage, his parents will probably never be able to move
back. Many neighbors were badly injured and others were killed, Wedeman
reports.

Faraoun went with a friend for what he can salvage from the remains.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 pull-quotestyles__PullQuoteContainer-sc-1ia2e5m-0 idZwuC">

““This is their life. Everything they did here. Look what happened,” he
said.”

</div>

Beirut's governor, Marwan Abboud, told Jordan's state-owned channel Al
Mamlaka that at least [300,000
people](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-blast-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html)
were "unable to sleep in their homes," adding that "half of Beirut's
population have homes that are unlivable for the foreseeable future —
for the next two weeks."

"The supreme religious authority in the holy city of Najaf expresses its

## What you need to know about ammonium nitrate

![Lebanese soldiers watch as a helicopter fights a fire at the scene of
an explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, on August 4. STR/AFP/Getty

</div>

Lebanese officials have [pointed to a possible cause of the massive
explosion](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/europe/lebanon-russian-ship-blast-intl/index.html) that
tore through Beirut: Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the devastating
blast was caused by 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate. 

[The dangerous
compound](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/ammonium-nitrate-beirut-blast-intl/index.html)
— also known as AN — could be traced back to a massive shipment of
agricultural fertilizer that had been stored in the port of Beirut
without safety precautions for years, despite warnings from local
officials. 

[AN doesn't
burn](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-blast-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html),
but if exposed to heat, it can melt — which releases combustible toxic
gases that can cause an explosion. It's even more dangerous if there is
a large supply of AN all stored together, because once a small section
of AN begins to melt and explode, the resulting heat can set off the
rest of the supply**.**

**Other AN disasters:** One of the worst disasters in US history
involving a form of ammonia occurred in April 1947 when a ship loaded
with ammonium nitrate caught fire while docked in Texas City. The fire
caused an explosion and additional fires that damaged more than 1,000
buildings and killed nearly 400 people, according to the website of the
Texas Historical Association.

For perspective, that explosion was triggered by 2,300 US tons (about
2087 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate, according to US Homeland
Security.

And the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, a US domestic terror attack that
killed 169 people and injured 467, used only two US tons (1.8 metric
tons) of ammonium nitrate.
