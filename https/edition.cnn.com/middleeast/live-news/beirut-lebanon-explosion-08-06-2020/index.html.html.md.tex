A
massive~\href{https://cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-port-explosion-ammonium-nitrate-intl-hnk/index.html}{explosion
that rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut}~on Tuesday left at least 137
people dead and thousands injured.

Here's what we know about the blast so far:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Ongoing investigation:} At least 16 employees of Beirut's port
  have been detained as part of an investigation into the explosion that
  shook the capital, Lebanese National News {[}NNA{]} agency said
  Thursday.
\item
  \textbf{International support:} The US military is sending three C-17
  transport aircrafts to~Lebanon~in order to provide relief supplies to
  the Lebanese people. French aid to Beirut "will not go to corrupt
  hands," French President Emmanuel Macron told~Lebanese protesters on
  Thursday, an Elysée spokesperson told CNN.
\item
  \textbf{The blast:} The explosion took place at 6:07 p.m. local time
  Tuesday near Beirut's port and central district, close to many
  highly-populated areas and tourist sites. Beirut's governor Marwan
  Abboud told reporters that the explosion had resulted in an estimated
  \$3 to \$5 billion in damage.
\item
  \textbf{The aftermath:} A crater created by the explosion appeared to
  be roughly 124 meters, or 405 feet, in diameter --- well over a
  football field in length, according to CNN analysis of a Planet Labs,
  Inc. satellite image.
\item
  \textbf{Impact to residents:} Abboud told Jordan's state-owned channel
  Al Mamlaka that at least 300,000 people were "unable to sleep in their
  homes."

At least 137 people are dead and 5,000 wounded following an explosion in
Lebanon's capital city of Beirut. The city is decimated with thousands
of residents left homeless, a medical system already strained from
coronavirus and up to \$5 billion worth of damage.

Several charities are on the ground providing medical care, shelter,
supplies and other services to help the city recover and rebuild.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that France was
organizing an international conference to help raise support for Lebanon
in the aftermath of Tuesday's devastating blast at Beirut port.

\begin{quote}
Within a few days, France will help organize ``an international
conference of support and assistance for Beirut and the Lebanese
population to mobilize international funding on the part of the
Europeans, Americans and all the countries of the region and beyond, in
order to provide medicine and food and all that is necessary for
housing,'' Macron told reporters in Beirut.
\end{quote}

Macron visited the capital earlier in the day and met with
representatives of multiple political parties and civil society groups.~

Macron said that any funds raised in an upcoming international
conference to help Lebanon would be handled with ``full transparency.''

He promised ``clear and transparent governance, whether it's French or
international'' to ensure the funds are ``directly provided to the local
population, the NGOs and teams on site that need it.''

It was all
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-explosion-couple-wedding-shoot-trnd/index.html}{captured
on video}. A short block from her wedding venue, 29-year-old Dr. Israa
Seblani was in the middle of a pose for her wedding photoshoot when the
explosion happened in Beirut. Seblani, her husband, Ahmad Sbeih, and the
video crew ran for cover with destruction all around them.

``At that moment, one thing I thought~about, ``Now, I'm losing my
life,~I'm losing my husband, I'm going to be buried under a building,
now~I'm going to die. Now I'm waiting the moment. How~I'm going to
die?~Is it going to be fast?~Am I going to feel it? Am I going to be
near him?''' she said.

Seblani, a US resident and Lebanon native, was in Beirut to get married
because her husband had not gotten a US visa, despite waiting for three
years. Not wanting to be apart any longer, they decided to celebrate in
the capital city of Lebanon, where their love first blossomed, CNN's
Jomana Karadsheh reported.

When Seblani returned to the wedding venue, she said the beautiful
restaurant had transformed into a ``nightmare.''

````It turned out into a ghost town,~filled with dust,
shattered~glass.~People yelling, bleeding.''''

Prior to the wedding, she had done a~final run through of the bridal
suite~where the couple would spend the night after the~party. She was
excited about the decorations.~But when they returned, the~red rose
petals thrown off the~bed were all that remained of~the romance they
envisioned, Karadsheh reported, adding that in a city where~life was
turned upside down in~seconds, the couple are just grateful~to be alive.

The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund said it is time
to address the deep economic crisis Lebanon is facing, urging both sides
to overcome ``the impasse in the discussions on critical reforms.''

``In the aftermath of the terrible tragedy in Lebanon, it is time for
national unity - to overcome this disaster, as well as to address the
deep economic and social crisis that the country continues to face,''
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement Thursday.

\begin{quote}
``The IMF is exploring all possible ways to support the people of
Lebanon. It is essential to overcome the impasse in the discussions on
critical reforms and put in place a meaningful program to turn around
the economy and build accountability and trust in the future of the
country,'' she added.
\end{quote}

Georgieva also called on the international community and the friends of
Lebanon to step up to help the country in this moment of urgent need.

Lebanon defaulted on some of its debt in March seeking a \$10 billion
IMF loan, but bailout talks with IMF have stalled.

George Faraoun went to his parents' retirement home that looked directly
on to the Beirut port that was the site of the massive explosion on
Tuesday.

It completely destroyed the apartment, causing a wall to collapse over
Faraoun's mother. Dried blood marks the spot where she was resting in
bed. She's still in the hospital, CNN's Ben Wedeman reports.

Given the damage,~his parents will probably never be able~to move
back.~Many neighbors were badly~injured and others were killed, Wedeman
reports.

Faraoun went with a friend for what he can salvage from the remains.

````This is their life.~Everything they did here.~Look what happened,''
he said.''

Beirut's governor, Marwan Abboud, told Jordan's state-owned channel Al
Mamlaka that at least
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-blast-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html}{300,000
people} were "unable to sleep in their homes," adding that "half of
Beirut's population have homes that are unlivable for the foreseeable
future --- for the next two weeks."

Lebanese officials
have~\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/europe/lebanon-russian-ship-blast-intl/index.html}{pointed
to a possible cause of the massive explosion}~that tore through Beirut:
Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the devastating blast was caused by
2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate.~

\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/ammonium-nitrate-beirut-blast-intl/index.html}{The
dangerous compound} --- also known as AN ---~could be traced back to a
massive shipment of agricultural fertilizer that had been stored in the
port of Beirut without safety precautions for years, despite warnings
from local officials.~

\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/middleeast/beirut-blast-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html}{AN
doesn't burn}, but if exposed to heat, it can melt --- which releases
combustible toxic gases that can cause an explosion. It's even more
dangerous if there is a large supply of AN all stored together, because
once a small section of AN begins to melt and explode, the resulting
heat can set off the rest of the supply**.**

\textbf{Other AN disasters:} One of the worst disasters in US history
involving a form of ammonia occurred in April 1947 when a ship loaded
with ammonium nitrate caught fire while docked in Texas City. The fire
caused an explosion and additional fires that damaged more than 1,000
buildings and killed nearly 400 people, according to the website of the
Texas Historical Association.

For perspective, that explosion was triggered by 2,300 US tons (about
2087 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate, according to US Homeland
Security.

And the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, a US domestic terror attack that
killed 169 people and injured 467, used only two US tons (1.8 metric
tons) of ammonium nitrate.
