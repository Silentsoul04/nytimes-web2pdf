In his Fourth of July
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/05/politics/donald-trump-july-4-coronavirus/index.html}{speech},
President
\href{https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/trump}{Donald Trump}
reflected on the nation's history and its accomplishments. He also made
several false claims about
\href{https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/}{the
coronavirus} and his administration's response to the pandemic.

President Donald Trump
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1277954189008744448}{tweeted}
on Tuesday that his administration was working to find the people who
"threw paint on the magnificent George Washington Statue in Manhattan,"
writing that they "will be prosecuted and face 10 years in Prison."

President Donald Trump has long been fond of turning supposedly official
events into
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings-rallies/index.html}{de
facto campaign rallies}. Even by his own standards, though, his Tuesday
speech was extreme.

\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/economy/june-2020-jobs-report-coronavirus/index.html}{announced}
an increase of 4.8 million jobs -\/- was released Thursday morning,
former Vice President Joe Biden gave a speech lambasting President
Donald Trump over his response to the coronavirus.

While former Vice President
\href{https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/biden}{Joe Biden} has
been limited in his campaign efforts due to
\href{https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/}{the
coronavirus pandemic}, the presumptive Democratic nominee has continued
to hold virtual town halls, remote interviews with the press, started a
podcast and, more recently, has held several in-person roundtables.

President Donald Trump falsely claimed again on Thursday that his
Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, is using the
coronavirus pandemic to try to get out of debating him.

In his
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/politics/tulsa-rally-trump/index.html}{first
rally in more than three months}, President Donald Trump repeated a
bunch of false claims he has made before. Trump's return to the rally
circuit, in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, arena that was not full, featured
familiar inaccurate accusations about
\href{https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/biden}{Democratic
opponent Joe Biden}, about his handling of
\href{https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/}{the

subjects.

As the

pandemic} has brought much of normal life to a halt, more and more
states are considering mail-in ballots. Though a

his penchant for

false claims about voter fraud} in the US.

Analysis by Marshall Cohen and Holmes Lybrand, CNN

Former Vice President
\href{https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/biden}{Joe Biden} is
facing new questions about his role in the Russia investigation, and
even though there is essentially no evidence of his wrongdoing, his
seemingly contradictory comments have muddied the waters and prolonged
the conversation.

A new \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv7yVCwv6NU}{ad} from
President Donald Trump's re-election campaign that attempts to portray
former Vice President Joe Biden as being overly friendly to China is
rife with deceptive images and audio clips.
