floodwater being discharged from the Three Gorges Dam in central China's
Hubei Province. The third flood of the year in the Yangtze River
occurred in its upper reaches as the Three Gorges reservoir saw an
inflow of 50,000 cubic meters per second at 2 p.m. Sunday. (Photo by

Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydropower project ever built.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

When construction began in 1994, it was designed not only to generate
electricity to propel China's breakneck economic growth, but also to
tame China's longest river, shield millions of people from fatal floods
and, as a symbol of technological prowess, become a searing point of
national pride. ****

For a start, the whole project
[cost](http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0607/c1001-21776413.html)
200 billion yuan ($28.6 billion), took nearly two decades to build, and
required uprooting more than a million **** people along the Yangtze
River. And while the government
[promised](http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/gongbao/2000-12/14/content_5002697.htm)
the dam would **** be able to protect communities around its immediate
downstream against a "once in a century flood," its efficacy has
frequently **** been questioned.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

Those doubts recently resurfaced, as the Yangtze basin saw its [heaviest
average
rainfall](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/14/c_139209909.htm)
in nearly 60 years since June, causing the river and its many

and 54.8 million people have been affected, causing a devastating 144
billion yuan ($20.5 billion) in economic losses.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

Despite the havoc, Chinese authorities claim the Three Gorges Dam has
succeeded in playing a "[crucial
role](http://ccnews.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0722/c141677-31792659.html)"
in intercepting floodwaters. The dam's operator, China Three Gorges

18.2 billion cubic meters of potential floodwater. A water resources
ministry official
[told](http://ccnews.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0722/c141677-31792659.html)
state-run newspaper China Youth Daily that the dam "effectively reduced
the speed and extent of water level rises" on the middle and lower

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

The Three Gorges Dam is an awe-inspiring structure.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

Firstly, it is one of the few man-made structures on Earth that's
visible to the naked eye from space, according to
[NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3433). Completed in 2006, the body of
the dam is immense. It is 181 meters (607 feet) tall and spans 2,335
meters (1.45 miles) across the Yangtze just before the deep, narrow
valley gives way to plains.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

Then there's its accompanying hydropower plant, which was completed in
2012 and has a generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts, or [more than
three
times](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/three-gorges-dam-worlds-largest-hydroelectric-plant?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)
the capacity of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest in the United States.

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

But according to the Chinese government's 1992
[proposal](http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/gongbao/2000-12/14/content_5002697.htm),
the **** top reason for building the dam **** wasn't power generation,

Here's how it works: the enormous dam is situated on an upstream section
of the Yangtze and helps prevent flooding downstream by trapping
rainwater in a huge reservoir, and then controlling the release of that
water through its sluice gates. The 660 kilometer (410 mile) reservoir
winds upstream through the narrow valleys of the Three Gorges -- a
series of steep canyons known for their imposing beauty and once
treacherous currents -- to Chongqing, a sprawling municipality of 30.5
million people in western China.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

During the dry season, October to May, the reservoir's water level is
kept at a maximum of 175 meters (574 feet) to optimize electricity
generation at the adjoining hydropower plant. Before the summer rains
arrive in June, it's gradually lowered to 145 meters (475 feet) to make
room for the incoming floodwaters.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

The lowering of water levels creates 22 billion cubic meters of storage
space -- enough to contain nearly 9 million Olympic-size swimming pools
of water. But that's nothing compared with the sheer volume of
floodwater that can flow into the dam **** during bad years, said Fan
Xiao, a Chinese geologist and long-time critic of the dam.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

During a "once-a-century flood" more than 244 billion cubic meters of
water -- or about twice the volume of the Dead Sea -- can pass through
the Three Gorges in two months, according to Fan's calculations.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

The storage capacity of the dam's reservoir can handle only about 9% of
that amount, he added.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

"It's like using a small cup to deal with a big tub of water. In terms
of flood control, the cost of the dam has surely outweighed the gain."

### The dream of every Chinese leader

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

The Chinese have for millennia manipulated waterways for flood control,
irrigation and navigation. For China's imperial rulers, the ability to
harness rivers not only saved lives and brought prosperity, but also
gave legitimacy to their reign, as natural disasters were taken as a
sign that the emperor had lost the mandate of heaven, by which he ruled.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

This ambition to control water resources has only grown in modern times,
with the prowess of technology.

Every Chinese leader since Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern
China, dreamed of building a massive dam on the Yangtze, which has
repeatedly wreaked havoc on its banks during flood season.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

In an industrial blueprint he laid out for the Republic of China in
1919, Sun envisioned damming the Three Gorges to improve navigation and
provide hydropower for the whole country.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

The revolutionary leader did not live to see this dream realized. His
successor Chiang Kai-shek carried on with the task in the 1940s,
inviting renowned American engineer John L. Savage -- best known for his
work on the Hoover Dam -- to survey the valleys and draw up a design for
the Three Gorges Dam. Chiang even sent dozens of Chinese engineers to
the US for training, but the project was abandoned during the Chinese
Civil War.

Revolution.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

When his successor Deng Xiaoping brought up the idea again in the late

It was heavily debated throughout the next decade, which was the most

The dam has also had a serious geological impact. Chinese officials and

The first disaster came in 2003, shortly after the reservoir started to
fill for the first time. As the water reached 135 meters (115 feet),
landslides began to occur. A few weeks later, on a tributary of the
Three Gorges, a large chunk of a mountain [split
off](https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ATTCtJcrkt4C&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=Qianjiangping+landslide&source=bl&ots=pSZFtOM9s3&sig=ACfU3U1w2PdniGS4lXmc5Dg_QYpTrzW0XA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ6qHKr9nqAhUJx4sBHTgaB4g4ChDoATAHegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q=Qianjiangping%20landslide&f=false)
and slipped into the river, killing 24 people, destroying 346 houses and
capsizing over 20 boats. ****

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

The dam, which sits near two major fault lines, has also been blamed for
a surge in earthquakes in the region. Scientists argue that the weight
of the large reservoir and the permeation of water into the rocks
underneath can trigger earthquakes in regions already under considerable
tectonic stress.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

According to a
[study](https://journal.probeinternational.org/2011/06/01/chinese-study-reveals-three-gorges-dam-triggered-3000-earthquakes-numerous-landslides/)
from the China Earthquake Administration, in the six years after the
reservoir was filled in June 2003, 3,429 earthquakes were recorded along
the reservoir; only 94 earthquakes were recorded from January 2000 to
May 2003.

</div>

<div class="SpecialArticle__paragraph SpecialArticle__pad SpecialArticle__widthStandard">

Another major concern is the blocking of sediments. By cutting the flow
of the Yangtze River, the dam has retained huge amounts of silt, which
not only dampens its flood control capacity by filling the reservoir,
but also causes [significant
erosion](https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-china-environment-dam-dc/three-gorges-dam-causes-downstream-erosion-study-idUST31738620070521)

And finally, the discovery of 80 large cracks on the Three Gorges Dam's
concrete face, just **** days after the reservoir was filled for the
first time in 2003, didn't help to alleviate concerns about the dam's
safety. Officials said at the time that the cracks were not a threat to
the dam, but could cause leaking if not fixed, according to

Some geologists say instead of relying on dams to stop flooding, we
should give rivers space and allow them to expand during the flood
season.

flooding, some experts say China will be forced to find new solutions
