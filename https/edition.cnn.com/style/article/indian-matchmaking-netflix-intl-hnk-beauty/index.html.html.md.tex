'Indian Matchmaking' presents painful truths about skin color and love
in Indian culture but does nothing to challenge them

Written by Aditi Sangal, CNN

On Netflix's "Indian Matchmaking," marriage consultant Sima Taparia
travels the world to meet with hopeful clients and help them find the
perfect match for an arranged marriage.

The format of the show is simple. Hopeful brides- and grooms-to-be meet
with Taparia -\/- often with their overbearing parents in tow -\/- for
an initial consultation. Criteria are laid out, potential suitors are
presented on paper, dates are arranged, and then it's up to the couple
to decide if it's **** a match.

In some respects, the producers should be commended. This is a show that
turns away from the
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/india-wedding-culture/index.html}{"big
fat Indian wedding"} trope and offers something fresh: a look at how
some traditional-facing couples meet through the services of a
professional matchmaker.

The characters' stories -\/- as well as cringier moments -\/- play out
in entertaining ways, at times revealing the absurdities and awkwardness
of matchmaking. I laughed when, for example, **** Taparia sought the
consultation of an astrologist and a face reader.

At other points, the show presents brutal truths about Indian culture:
the emphasis on being "fair"; the enormous pressure to wed; the focus on
caste and class; the stigmatization of independent, working women.

But the show fails to contextualize or even question these problematic
beliefs when they're brought up by its characters, presenting them
instead as the status quo.

With that,
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/20/entertainment/indian-matchmaking-netflix/index.html}{Netflix}
missed an opportunity to challenge a social system fraught with cultural
biases, and also educate a global audience on important nuances. In Sima
Taparia, the show found a regressive anchor who merely peddles flawed
practices.

\hypertarget{colorism}{%
\subsubsection{Colorism}\label{colorism}}

Mentioned casually but frequently throughout the eight episodes is the
idea that candidates should be "fair," or in other words, have light
skin.

\href{/style/article/india-bollywood-brownface-hnk-intl/index.html}{}

\includegraphics{https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_50,ar_1:1/http\%3A\%2F\%2Fcdn.cnn.com\%2Fcnnnext\%2Fdam\%2Fassets\%2F200508205433-08-bollywood-brownface-split-new-version.jpg}

Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?

The subject of skin color and, subsequently, **** social status in
Indian culture is incredibly complex. While people with darker skin
tones are subjected to harsh discrimination and prejudice, fairness is
revered and associated with beauty, wealth and power.

This cultural bias is engrained from an early age, with women bearing
more of the societal pressure to have lighter skin. If you're a woman,
darker skin can be a deal-breaker for families seeking the perfect wife
for their son. For men, fair skin is seen as a bonus but not as much of
a requirement.

India has an increasingly global perspective on beauty -\/- but the
patriarchy still looms large

Colorism and the desirability of "fairness" is drilled into young girls.
In my own case, it started when I was in middle school in India, when my
classmates taunted me for having darker skin. Older women would also
make unsolicited comments about my complexion, veiled as genuine concern
for me and my future marriage prospects.

In India, the
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/elton-fernandez-makeup-beauty-opinion/index.html}{beauty
standard} is further perpetuated by pop culture and a booming cosmetic
industry.

Skin lightening products are heavily marketed. Actors with glowing, pale
complexions are the stars of
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/india-bollywood-brownface-hnk-intl/index.html}{Bollywood
movies} while their dark-skinned counterparts play poor, disenfranchised
characters. Some dating apps even include skin tone filters.

\hypertarget{unspoken-rules}{%
\subsubsection{Unspoken rules}\label{unspoken-rules}}

"Indian Matchmaking" **** itself offers a window into the lifestyles of
an elite class of Indians who can enlist the service of a top-tier
matchmaker, and in some cases, fly them to the other side of the world.
This is not something regular families do, so status is already built
into the narrative.

with fair skin

Perhaps this makes it easier for families to avoid explicitly specifying
fair skin as part of their match criteria. Taparia assumes it goes
without saying, and constantly describes women as a "good person" or
match because they are "fair and good looking." Some of the families
rely on this -\/- it allows them to be politically correct and vague in
their search for someone "good looking" without explicitly saying
"fair."

Yet, they get exactly the kind of complexion they want to see. It's the
equivalent of writing "caste no bar" in a matrimonial ad -\/- a
suggestion that the person who placed the ad is willing to consider
candidates regardless of social hierarchy -\/- but in reality only going
on dates with people from the "community," which becomes a euphemistic
catch-all term for people from the same religion, caste or class.

\href{/style/article/india-wedding-culture/index.html}{}

Beyonc√©, couture and palaces: India's growing taste for mega-weddings

Take the young Mumbai-based Pradhyuman Maloo, who features prominently
in the show, as an example. His well-to-do parents desperately want him
to settle down and find a wife, but he seems mostly uninterested in the
women presented to him, until he's shown a photo of Rushali Rai, a
beautiful model from Delhi. His eyes light up at the sight of her.
Taparia describes her as "fair and good-looking, but also, she's smart."

When Maloo first sees her photo, he is elated. "Ahh, she's so cute!"

"I'll tell you that from her dressing style to her look and everything,
how she carries herself, that I can meet her," he said. "It's going to
be exciting. It's going to be fun."

\includegraphics{https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http\%3A\%2F\%2Fcdn.cnn.com\%2Fcnnnext\%2Fdam\%2Fassets\%2F200721103542-restricted-01-indian-matchmaking.jpg}

Watching the two side-by-side on their date, it's impossible to ignore
the fact that, of all the characters in the show, they have the most
similar skin tones. Their pairing does nothing to challenge the
deep-rooted cultural notion that you should marry someone with a similar
background.

\hypertarget{changing-attitudes}{%
\subsubsection{Changing attitudes}\label{changing-attitudes}}

As for women who don't fit the "fair, tall and slim" criteria, we do see
the show acknowledging a different fate. Businesswoman Ankita Bansal is
sent to a life coach, with whom she discusses the insecurities she had
with her body growing up.

\href{/2020/07/20/entertainment/indian-matchmaking-netflix/index.html}{}

'Indian Matchmaking': What to know about the latest Netflix series folks
are obsessed with

"People would come and tell me that you're never going to find anybody
because you have to lose some weight," said Bansal, adding that she
suffered from "off the charts" anxiety. "So that played a very big part
in how I lost my confidence completely in even trying to approach a
man."

The life coach acknowledges that such expectations can be unrealistic,
and hurtful when it comes to a woman feeling her true worth. "I think
it's so -\/- superficial, maybe, that they're only defining us by the
way we look."

\includegraphics{https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http\%3A\%2F\%2Fcdn.cnn.com\%2Fcnnnext\%2Fdam\%2Fassets\%2F200721103937-restricted-03-indian-matchmaking.jpg}

But attitudes towards "fairness" and beauty ideals are changing. Young
people -\/- who are usually more social-media savvy and better educated
-\/- feel more empowered to go against the grain, and to put pressure on
those who continue to perpetuate beauty standards.

There are several ongoing campaigns that
\href{https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-stars-who-refused-to-endorse-fairness-creams/photostory/58161094.cms}{call
out celebrities} who endorse skin-lightening products, and some
Bollywood stars have
\href{https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-stars-who-refused-to-endorse-fairness-creams/photostory/58161094.cms}{refused
to be associated} with these creams.

\href{/style/article/priyanka-chopra-fashion-intl-hnk/index.html}{}

Priyanka Chopra's bold fashion has made her a global style icon

The campaign **** "Dark is Beautiful" has waged its decade-long fight
against colorism by creating awareness programs about skin bias. Others
like "Dark is Divine" and "Unfair and Lovely" have also since joined the
fight.

The show sidesteps signs of such progress, instead providing a platform
for outdated clich√©s over cultural debate and context. Fittingly, in one
of the final scenes, Richa, a young Indian American woman, who Tapaira
gives "95 out of 100," reels off her criteria for the perfect match.

It's not the first point in a long list, but when she comes to it, it
lands jarringly.

"Not too dark, you know, fair-skinned."
