When he was 17 James Barnor took his first picture, using a small camera
a craft teacher gifted him. His subject was a "clever and lovely" girl
who he knew from school.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

"Growing up in Ghana, I was surrounded by people who wanted to have
their picture taken," Barnor said during a phone interview. "I don't
regret not taking pictures of landscapes. I started out as an apprentice
portraiture photographer; people came to be photographed or (I would) go
to weddings and school groups."

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

During his career spanning six decades, the Accra-born photographer has
remained unwavering in his mission statement: People are more
interesting than places. Now, having just turned 91, Barnor is one of
Ghana's most well-known photographers, though it's only in this century
that his work has been celebrated in exhibitions across Europe and in
the US -- after curator Nana Oforiatta-Ayim organized his first solo
exhibition in 2007, held at the Black Cultural Archives in London.

Since then, Barnor's photos have been acquired for The Victoria and
Albert Museum and Tate's permanent collections, and last year the Nubuke
Foundation in Accra held a retrospective of his work (the first time the
foundation has hosted a retrospective of a homegrown photographer). And
the Serpentine Galleries in London were scheduled to host a
retrospective to coincide with Barnor's birthday this month (due to
Covid-19 restrictions, this is now postponed until 2021).

It was as the first photojournalist appointed to the Daily Graphic, a
Ghanaian state-owned daily newspaper in Accra, that Barnor honed his
craft and developed a documentary eye. He took pictures of the city's
people and events -- everything car accidents and football matches to
locals at the market.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

"I'd just take my camera and my bicycle and go to the market," he said.
"I'd spend about 20 minutes there and I'd come back to my darkroom, with
pictures all telling different stories. I did that a lot. You capture
the market woman the way she actually is. It takes some art, some
patience, and technique to photograph people in that setting."

Alongside his photojournalism, Barnor took portraits of local residents
at his own makeshift studio, which he christened Ever Young, in the
Jamestown district of Accra, mostly between 1949 and 1959. While this
was predominately a commercial proposition, taking on paid portraiture
commissions and passport headshots, he developed a natural exchange with
many of his subjects.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Barnor's studio was like a "community center," he remembers, and he made
"people feel at home," by talking to and getting to know them. "Young
men would come by to have a chat and have their photograph taken," he
said. "Most people had confidence in me already. Everybody knew me in
Ghana as a successful photographer -- they knew they would be
satisfied."

Barnor says he believes the photographs he took during this time showed
a different, stylish view of his home country -- one that belied
assumptions. "When I had my studio in Ghana people thought we
(Ghanaians) didn't dress up," he said. "But all my sitters, my friends,
were fashion conscious -- women would often request full-length photos
with shoes, a handbag and their accessories."

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

In 1959 Barnor moved to the UK after receiving a scholarship to study at
the Medway College of Art in Rochester, Kent. After graduation in 1961,
he moved to South London, reveling in the capital city's "colors,
adverts, uniforms and music."

But it wasn't all smooth sailing. "If you wanted a room or something and
you were Black (people would say) 'Oh -- it's gone,'" Barnor said. "This
is what it was like. I was lucky though -- I call myself Lucky Jim.
Before I left Ghana, I befriended somebody who worked at the Colonial
Office (a government department that oversaw the administration of
Britain's territories). He helped me find somewhere to live, introducing
me to a Jamaican man in Peckham."

Once in London, Barnor mostly produced work for anti-Apartheid journal
Drum magazine, for whom he had already worked making fashion stories
while he was still living in Ghana. At the time, Barnor recalls, the
magazine stood out for featuring Black models in its pages and on its
covers.

"There weren't magazines or newspapers showing Black models -- Drum
started it," he said. "Any time I saw a Drum cover in London, side by

As part of his work with Drum, Barnor captured the BBC's first Black

Piccadilly Circus, central London. Another photo shows street-scouted

Like his time capturing individual style in his studio portraiture in
Accra, in the UK Barnor amassed a large archive of street photos,
chronicling how Black people were dressing in bright western fashions
distinctive of the era. But unlike his monochrome photos from earlier
days, he was now working in color, a transition that has helped define
his signature style. "My learning, and everything, is around how the
Black body appears in color," he said. "With all these lovely color
dresses."

As well as paid fashion editorial work during the 1960s, Barnor took
photos of his friends and sought out subjects from the Ghanaian and
wider African communities in South London. The resulting archive --
spanning about ten years form 1959-1969 -- is a goldmine of street style
reportage, editorial shoots and portraiture of the African diaspora in
the UK.

And though standalone landscapes were not of interest to Barnor, he
liked to choose locations and backgrounds that spoke to time and place.

"I like vantage points or places which connect to where you are," Barnor
said. "A secluded background, unless it's helping in some way
artistically, is not so good. I have a picture of two friends, I posed
them in front of a telephone kiosk. When you see the image, you know:
This is London."

Barnor eventually returned to Ghana, in 1969, and spent over two decades
there before returning to London, where he now resides. During that time
he opened the country's first color processing laboratory, with the
hopes of sharing his knowledge and experience. "You want to bring people
up, you want to advise them in whatever way you can,"

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

But skills, he says, are not the only thing that's important, and to
aspiring photographers, Barnor's advice is simple: Tell a story that
means something to you. "You can google all the technical stuff. It's
the ideas that you have that're important. The community development,
the self-involvement. Go and learn and be knowledgeable and take the
camera. The story is the picture."
