Kendall Jenner opens the doors to her bohemian LA home

Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Kendall Jenner may hail from one of America's most lavish celebrity
families, but her Los Angeles home is more toned-down than you might
expect.

Opening the doors to her Mediterranean-style house for the next issue of
\href{https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kendall-jenner-los-angeles-home}{Architectural
Digest}, the model and reality TV star has revealed a preference for
subtle, neutral tones and organic textures.

An accompanying photo shoot offers readers a rare look inside the star's
home. In addition to contemporary touches, such as custom sofas and
colorful wall art, the model demonstrates her taste for period pieces,
including an antique Turkish rug, a 19th-century French chaise longue
and a set of teak kitchen stools designed by mid-century architect
Pierre Jeanneret.

In an interview for the magazine's September cover story, Jenner said
that she was "really proud" of her newly renovated property.

"This is the first home I've done completely, and I think it's a genuine
reflection of who I am and what I like," she is quoted as saying. "In
the end, I'm still a young female in L.A., just trying to have some
fun."

Jenner's taste in home decor came as a welcome surprise to interior
designer Tommy Clements, who helped bring the model's vision to life
alongside his design partner (and mom) Kathleen Clements, and celebrity
decorator Waldo Fernandez.

"Her taste was surprising, more bohemian and funky than the rest of her
family," he told the magazine, recounting his team's initial meeting
with Jenner: "The mood she described was totally understated and
down-to-earth."

Kathleen added: "Being who she is, we though Kendall might gravitate
toward something more flashy, more va-va-voom. I think we were all
thrilled to discover that she has taste beyond her years."

Warm, earthy colors are on display throughout Jenner's house, which
boasts an art studio, a pool and a master bathroom equipped with a sleek
brass tub. But there are flashes of color too, from her teal kitchen
cabinets and green bath tiles to a pair of bold prints by Barbara
Kruger.

Among the more notable decorations is a pair of painted 18th-century
Italian door panels in the "sitting area" of Jenner's master bedroom.
According to Fernandez, who has designed homes for celebrities including
Brad Pitt and Elizabeth Taylor, the decor reflects the model's
personalized approach to interiors.

"There are plenty of people we know who have traveled extensively and
been exposed to so much but don't absorb anything," he told
Architectural Digest. "Kendall is different. She takes everything in and
is confident about the things that resonate with her."

Fernandez also praised the model's taste in art. In addition to works by
American artists like Richard Prince, Raymond Pettibon and Sterling
Ruby, the 24-year-old owns a neon wall sculpture by celebrated British
artist Tracey Emin. The property also boasts a wall sculpture by
contemporary artist James Turrell, which she wanted to be the house's
"focal point."

"Kendall wasn't just checking off names on a list or blindly following
the advice of an adviser," Fernandez told the magazine, reflecting on
her taste in art. "She picked things that meant something to her, things
she had a gut reaction to."

In the interview, Jenner also detailed what attracted her to the
property, which previously belonged to Charlie Sheen, and which she
bought in 2017.

"I like a house that has character," she is quoted as saying. "When I
walked into this place, I was immediately drawn to the peaceful
Spanish-y, farmhouse-y vibe. My life involves a lot of chaos and travel
and high energy, so I wanted a home that feels serene, a place where I
can simply zone out and relax."

And if her home -\/- which she described as "always a work in progress"
-\/- looks better-equipped for a quiet night in rather than a wild
after-party, that's precisely the point.

"I'm not a huge party person," Jenner said. "There aren't a lot of
ragers going on here. I like turning on music, lighting the fireplace
and candles and watching NBA games with my friends."
