Bold, black and blazing fast: The North American X-15 was a plane unlike
any other. And although it first flew over 60 years ago, it is still the
quickest manned aircraft ever to fly.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Shaped more like a bullet than a conventional airplane, the
rocket-powered X-15 completed 199 test flights over nine years, starting
in 1959. It could reach the edge of space and then glide back down to
Earth, capturing data that informed the design and engineering of later
American spacecraft, including NASA's space shuttles.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

The plane was flown by an elite team of just 12 pilots, including Neil
Armstrong, who would go on to lead the moon landing in 1969.

"One of the X-15 pilots, Bill Dana, once told me that it was the big
ticket -- the aircraft to fly," said Christian Gelzer, chief historian
at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center, in a phone interview. "It
gave you the greatest speed, the greatest excitement, the greatest
terror. We haven't built anything since that flies within the atmosphere
like the X-15."

The ["X"
series](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/images/X-Planes/index.html)
consists of more than 60 experimental aircraft produced by US government
agencies, including the Air Force and NASA, since the end of World War
II. They were often extreme machines, designed to push the envelope, and
the X-15 had a particularly ambitious goal.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

In 1952, when development of the X-15 started, the official air speed
record for an aircraft was just under 700 mph. The plane's mission was
to reach Mach 5 -- five times the speed of sound, or nearly 4,000 mph.

"Such an airplane would also have to fly at an altitude of 250,000 feet,
which was well above any aircraft's altitude at that point," said
Gelzer. "It was a very big ask."

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

The project was led by the US Air Force and the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which would become NASA in 1958. "They
were after scientific data and flight dynamics data as well," said
Gelzer. "But in the background was the Cold War, which motivated a lot
of the research."

### Flying start

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

The X-15 was essentially a rocket with a cockpit, so unlike other planes
it wasn't designed to take off from a runway. Instead, it had to be
taken to high altitude and released from a mothership, in this case a
specially modified B-52 bomber.

With the 50-foot-long X-15 tucked under its wing, the B-52 would take
off from the Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California and fly
towards Nevada or Utah, before turning back and releasing the aircraft
at an altitude of 45,000 feet and a speed of over 600 mph. Only at that
point would the X-15 pilot ignite the rocket engine and start climbing
out of the Earth's atmosphere and into space.

"It flew aerodynamically like a normal airplane, but it climbed like
nobody's business," said Gelzer. "Milt Thompson, who was one of the
pilots, said that it was the only airplane he ever flew in which he was
glad when the engine quit."

Once the target altitude was reached -- the X-15 went as high as 354,200
feet, around 10 times the cruise altitude of a commercial airliner --
the pilots would conduct experiments in this then-unknown environment,
helping experts gather data on hypersonic flight.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Much of the X-15's design was geared towards being able to fly at high
altitudes, where the air is so thin that conventional aerodynamic
appendages no longer work. For that reason, the X-15 was equipped with a
reaction control system, similar to that later used by space shuttles
and the International Space Station. It spewed bursts of hydrogen
peroxide -- essentially water oxygenated at very high concentration --
which created small amounts of thrust sufficient to steer the aircraft
in the upper atmosphere's thin air.

Flying at thousands of miles per hour, the outer skin of the X-15 became
very hot due to aerodynamic friction and was therefore made of a special
nickel-chromium alloy called Inconel X. "The aircraft heated up to 1,200
degrees Fahrenheit," Gelzer said. "And the pilots could hear it expand
behind them."

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Landing the X-15 wasn't easy. "From the moment it ran out of fuel, or
the pilot turned off the engine, it was a glider. A very heavy, very
fast glider with very small wings -- so not even a great glider. At that
point, the pilot only had speed and altitude to exchange for reaching
his destination," said Gelzer.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

To make things worse, the front wheel lacked steering and the main
landing gear only had skids (two retractable steel beams that skidded
across the landing surface), so a tarmac runway couldn't be used.
Instead, the aircraft had to land on a dry lake bed.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

"By the time they got the aircraft back on the ground it was not the
same airplane that it had been when it left the base. There were holes
burned in from the heat," said Gelzer.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

### Long flight

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Most aircraft make their final landing approach at under 200 mph. The
X-15, however, could start its approach at 20,000 feet and at supersonic
speeds in excess of 1,500 mph -- radically different conditions than
most pilots experienced. Things did not always end well.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

"This was an experimental aircraft, and things went wrong on almost
every single slide. The remarkable thing is that the pilots managed to
bring the aircraft back consistently, despite the problems they had,"
said Gelzer.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Out of nearly 200 flights, only two resulted in crash landings, one of
which killed pilot Michael Adams. On November 15, 1967, Adams went into
a spin during re-entry and could not straighten the aircraft, which
broke up in the air.

The inherent risks of flying this type of aircraft, half-plane and
half-spaceship, is among the reasons why the X-15's records have never
been beaten with modern engineering. It was also a stepping stone
towards the space program, which had grander ambitions than simply
speed.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Nevertheless, the X-15 is consigned to history as one of the most
successful flight research programs ever conducted, and in its nine
years of operation it garnered a wealth of data about high-speed flight,
returning from space and human physiology. And in 1967, pilot Pete
Knight reached the [record speed of 4,520
mph](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html),
or Mach 6.7 (6.7 times the speed of sound).

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

The X-15 also spawned a generation of astronauts, including one of the
greatest: Neil Armstrong. During one of his [seven X-15
flights](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/multimedia/imagegallery/X-15/E-USAF-Armstrong-X-15.html),
Armstrong displayed the legendary problem-solving abilities that would
eventually land him the command of Apollo 11.
