</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>A new era in space exploration began in April 1981, when the first
Space Shuttle launched into orbit from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
Florida. Its large cargo bay was a design feature pushed by the
Pentagon, which used the Shuttle in a handful of classified missions to
send military satellites into orbit. The USSR perceived this capability
as a threat, and wanted a vehicle that could do the same.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The result was the Buran ("Blizzard" in Russian), a Soviet Shuttle
that looked remarkably like its American counterpart, down to the black
and white paint job. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But whether it was a straight up clone or simply informed by the
laws of aerodynamics, the Buran -- along with its companion rocket, the
Energiya -- came with a logistical problem: how to transport the
spacecraft from manufacturing facilities around Moscow to the Baikonur
Cosmodrome, 1,300 miles away in today's southern Kazakhstan, from which
Soviet space missions departed. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Rather than building a new freeway across rivers and mountains,
Soviet engineers asked the Antonov Design Bureau in Kiev to create a new
transporter plane capable of airlifting the shuttle and its rocket. It
would also be used to haul the Buran back to Baikonur whenever it would
land at a backup site rather than the Cosmodrome upon returning from
orbit.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Antonov based it around an existing model, the AN-124 Ruslan,
itself already a very large plane, bigger than the Boeing 747-400.
</span>

</div>

<div class="HTMLEmbed__component">

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The overall size was increased significantly, with the goal of
doubling the cargo capacity. Among the visible upgrades were an extra
pair of engines, bringing the total to six, and a longer landing gear,
which increased the wheel count to a whopping 32. A new twin tail with
an oversize vertical stabilizer was also added to allow the plane to
carry the Buran on its back. </span>

during the inauguration ceremony, was christened the AN-225 Mriya.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The Antonov Design Bureau worked quickly to produce the finished
plane in just three and a half years, but it still couldn't keep up with
the development of the Buran, so an interim solution was chosen:
adapting a fleet of old 3M-T bombers to carry the spacecraft
unassembled. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>When the AN-225 was finally ready, it was history it couldn't
catch up with: both the Buran and the AN-225 first flew in late 1988, a
year before the fall of the Berlin Wall, which foreshadowed the collapse
of the Soviet Union.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>As a result, the Buran program was canceled after just one
official mission, and the AN-225 ended up carrying the shuttle piggyback
style in only about a dozen test flights. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The duo stole the show when it made an appearance at the 1989
Paris Air Show, but its primary mission had vanished. An outlandish
proposal to transform it into a flying hotel, with suites and swimming
pools and space for 1,500 guests never turned into reality, and the
AN-225 ended up in a hangar where it was stripped for parts and rusted
away for seven years.</span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>In 2001, the AN-225 was dusted off, thoroughly upgraded with
modern equipment and brought back into service. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>In the same year it set 124 world records, according to Antonov,
including those for carrying capacity, flight altitude with cargo, and
lifting record cargo to an altitude. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"This happened on the day of the tragedy of September 11, 2001,
and therefore all these records went unnoticed," said Grinberg. "That
day, five battle tanks, each weighing 50 tons, served as the control
cargo. And they drove into the cargo cabin themselves." </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The plane was resurrected because Antonov Airlines, a division of
the Antonov company that operates around a dozen heavy transporter
planes, was receiving orders on cargo deliveries that were beyond the
capabilities of the AN-124, known as the AN-225's "little brother."
</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"We quickly understood that there was a growing demand for
oversize or extremely heavy pieces of cargo," said Vitaliy Shost, senior
deputy director of Antonov Airlines. He says that the AN-225 is able to
accommodate up to 950 cubic meters of cargo, compared to 750 for the
AN-124 and 650 for a Boeing 747.</span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Such capacity would allow the AN-225 to carry up to 16 shipping
containers or 80 family cars. The cargo hold also has a titanium floor
for added strength and its own crane system to load cargo efficiently.
The maximum payload is 250 tons -- reached in 2001 when transporting the
five battle tanks. The record for the heaviest single piece ever
airlifted was achieved by the An-225 in 2009, when a generator was
transported from Germany to Armenia. It weighed 187 tons.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The plane set other records such as the longest cargo item in the
history of transportation -- two wind turbines measuring 137 feet each,
delivered from China to Denmark -- and clinched a Guinness World Records
entry by holding an art exhibition of 500 paintings by 120 Ukrainian
artists at an altitude of 33,000 feet. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The AN-225 has also transported water turbines, nuclear fuel,
construction vehicles, light aircraft and maglev trains. Electric
generators are its most common type of cargo.</span>

<span>In April 2020, the AN-225 set yet another record by transporting
100 tons of Covid-19 protective equipment, medicines and tests from
Tianjin, China, to Warsaw, Poland (with a refueling stop in Kazakhstan).
The landing in Poland was livestreamed to an audience of 80,000,
according to Antonov. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"We didn't expect the plane to be involved in this business,
because PPE packed in boxes is not the standard type of cargo for the
An-225, but due to lack of transport availability our customers
requested it," said Shost. "Over two and half months we performed 10
flights from China to different points around the world." </span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The AN-225 flies sparingly. Its high operational cost -- it uses
over 20 tons of fuel per hour according to Shost, equal to $6,700 at
current prices -- limits it to the most demanding of jobs. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"Last year the plane performed about 20 flights. In 2020 we are
already at 10 flights, and we expect 10 more through the end of the
year," Shost added.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>That means that the current demand is easily handled by the lone
AN-225 in existence. Although Antonov has all the parts required to
build a [second one sitting in its
warehouse](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/antonov-an-225-kiev-ukraine/index.html),
it's not planning to do so anytime soon. China once expressed the desire
to purchase the parts and build the plane, but due to the complicated
logistics of transporting them abroad, the plan never
materialized.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The fact that the AN-225 is one of a kind, however, adds to its
mystique. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"This airplane is our pride and joy, a business card for the
Antonov company and Ukraine itself," said Shost. "I first saw it when I
was a schoolboy and I was so impressed with it, I couldn't believe it
could actually fly. Now I make sure it does."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Antonov is constantly upgrading the AN-225 to keep up with
international flight regulations and requirements, and the company says
that the plane will be in service for at least another 25 years. That's
good news for aviation enthusiasts and plane spotters, who show up in
droves at its every appearance. </span>

</div>

<div class="HTMLEmbed__component">

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"This aircraft ranks 10/10 on a spotter's dream list, in my
opinion," said Casey Groulx, a Canadian plane spotter who photographed
the An-225 when it landed in Toronto in late May to deliver Covid-19
relief equipment.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">
