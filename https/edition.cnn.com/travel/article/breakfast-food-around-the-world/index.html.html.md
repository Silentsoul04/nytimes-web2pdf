(CNN) — <span>When it comes to breakfast foods across the globe, there
are as many ways to enjoy the first meal of the day as there are to say
"good morning."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>From creamy cornbread cake in Brazil to savory Tunisian chickpea
soup, from fluffy Ukrainian pancakes to sweet coconut jam toasts in
Singapore, these 21 international specialties offer a breakfast option
for every palate.</span>

unexpected based on what your first meal of the day typically consists
of, the presentations are likely familiar. Read through our list -- in

world's breakfast cultures, and maybe even find food inspiration for
your next trip.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

### Switzerland

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>On weekdays, the Swiss frequently stick to quick but filling
breakfasts like the traditional birchermüesli, the granola-style blend
of oats with fruit and nuts that's usually served over thick
yogurt.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But on weekends, it's time for Swiss brunch. Along with roesti
(potato pancakes), cheeses, and cold cuts, the centerpiece of the brunch
table is zopf. This braided egg bread is similar to challah or brioche,
and served with honey, butter, and jam.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>When you're having qurs (that's "breakfast" in Amharic, Ethiopia's
official language), chances are you'll be eating porridge. While there
are many varieties and names for hot grain cereals served throughout the
country, savory genfo is one of the most popular.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Genfo is made by mixing barley flour with boiling water until a
thick, sticky dough forms, then shaped into a mound with a well in the
center. The well is then filled with clarified butter blended with
berbere, the complex spice blend, and dollops of yogurt are often
spooned around the edges of the genfo.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Japan

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Japanese breakfasts fall squarely on the savory side of the food
spectrum: In fact, much of what you can eat for breakfast in Japan
wouldn't be out of place at any other meal of the day.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Many morning repasts consist of a selection of small plates, each
with a few bites of a traditional Japanese dish. Fish like salmon or
mackerel, miso soup, pickled vegetables and rice are all represented.
There's also tamagoyaki, a slightly sweet rolled omelet made from thin
layers of egg in a rectangular pan that gives it its signature
shape.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Iceland

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Start your day in Iceland with a jolt of life-giving lysi: cod
liver oil, a plentiful source of omega-3 fatty acids and one of the
byproducts of the country's fish industry. Though it's been said to
combat seasonal affective disorder, among other health benefits, it's
not the only breakfast option.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>For a more palatable morning meal, have a bowl of hafragrautur, a
thick oatmeal. Top it with nuts, raisins, and sugar, or add a helping of
skyr, the thick yogurt-like cultured dairy product that's actually a
fresh cheese. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Singapore

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>If "Crazy Rich Asians" didn't already whet your appetite for
Singapore, let the multitude of dishes served in the hawker centers
entice you further. These open-air food courts are always open for
business, and it's not uncommon to see hungry people scooping up bowls
of savory curry noodles first thing in the morning.</span>

</div>

<div class="Ad__component">

<div id="ad_rect_btf_01" class="Ad__tag Article__adBody Ad__hasLabel">

</div>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>For a traditional hawker-style breakfast, kaya toast is a
must-have. This unassuming-looking toasted sandwich is spread with
flavorful kaya, a sweet jam made with coconut milk, eggs, and sometimes
pandan leaf for vibrant green color and flavor. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>It's great with coffee or tea, and each stall or shop makes kaya
toast its own way -- so why not try a few?</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Morocco

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Along with mint tea, semolina breads are mainstays on the Moroccan
breakfast table. Baghrir are thin, yeasted rounds studded with tiny
holes that give them the name "thousand-hole pancakes" or "thousand-hole
crepes." Instead of maple syrup, these light semolina breads are topped
with butter and honey.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Harcha are thicker, griddled biscuit-style rounds that have a
crispy crust from a dusting of coarse semolina. They can be split like
English muffins and served with cheese or butter, jam, and honey.</span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>For those who love grain bowls, avocado and other savory toasts,
and other staples of all-day café culture, Australia's "brekkie" will be
a match made in heaven. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>With a focus on fresh produce, whole grains, and nourishing
combinations, Australian breakfasts can range from the classic avocado
toast on seeded bread to a farro bowl topped with a poached egg and
pickled vegetables or rice pudding with yogurt, seeds and
berries.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Don't forget the flat white -- an espresso with a high ratio of
steamed milk that even Starbucks can't get enough of. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Argentina

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>There's one word that defines the Argentinean breakfast spread:
facturas. The overarching term for pastries encompasses a sweet and
doughy world of shapes, sizes, and flavors.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Some of the more popular offerings include medialunes, a
croissant-shaped brioche pastry; bombas and bolas de fraille, or fried
doughnuts; and churros, which are often dipped in chocolate. Many are
filled with dulce de leche or crema pastelera, a vanilla custard.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Pair a platter of facturas with highly caffeinated yerba mate or
coffee.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Germany

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>In the land of many wurst, it's not surprising that sausage and
other meats take a starring role in frühstück, the traditional German
breakfast.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>This buffet spread is filled with variety: sausages, cold cuts,
cheeses, bread and rolls (including pretzels), as well as fresh fruit,
soft-boiled eggs and condiments like homemade jam. The abundant choices
are meant for sampling and assembling as you please. </span>

<span>If you can't stop eating pao de queijo, the puffy baked cheese
rolls that are a staple of Brazilian culture, you'll be happy to know
you can eat them for breakfast too. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But for a variation on Brazilian breakfast breads, try bolo de
fuba. It's a cornbread-style cake with a moist and creamy texture that
comes from the addition of grated Parmesan cheese and/or shredded
coconut. Sliced and served like a pound cake, it's frequently an
afternoon pick-me-up too.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Tunisia

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Fans of savory meals will love lablabi, a spiced chickpea soup
that, yes, is a breakfast food in Tunisia. Chickpeas and harissa paste
are the two constants in virtually every lablabi recipe, but the
customizations of this simple, soul-warming soup are up to every cook.
</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Sometimes thickened with pieces of stale crusty bread, sometimes
brightened by a squeeze of a lemon, sometimes made creamy with yogurt or
topped with olives, there are infinite ways to enjoy it.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>And because it's often topped with a poached egg, it's a breakfast
that will fill you up all day.</span>

### Bulgaria

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Popara follows in the long tradition of using leftover bread as
the next day's meal. This warm, comforting breakfast is a childhood
favorite of many Bulgarians -- it's not quite a porridge and not quite a
bread pudding, but shares characteristics of both.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Warm milk or tea is poured over a bowl of cubed bread, crumbled
Bulgarian sirene cheese, butter and sugar, and left to soak until soft
and spoonable. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Sirene is a feta-style cheese that's creamier and softer than many
of the Eastern European brined cheeses, so it doesn't give the dish as
much of a salty flavor and more of a fresh, goat cheese-like
tanginess.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### Turkey

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Kahvalti, the traditional Turkish breakfast spread, is a lavish
affair that has a little something for everyone. For those who love to
graze and snack, the abundant options will leave nothing lacking.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Turkish breads like simit, a circular seeded loaf, or pide, a
chewy flatbread, accompany bowls of feta or other fresh, salty cheeses;
olives; halvah; and honey and preserves. Eggs are often cooked with
pan-fried slices of sucuk, a dried beef sausage spiced with garlic, red
pepper, cumin and sumac.</span>

### Guam

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>This small island -- technically an American territory -- In the
Pacific Ocean is a melting pot of culinary culture, with foods that show
the influence of the various countries that colonized the land over the
centuries.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Like many Asian Pacific nations, Spam is a favorite add-in for
breakfasts of fried rice and eggs. But just as popular is the local
chamorro pork sausage, a fresh chorizo-style sausage named after the
indigenous population of the island. Grilled in links or patties, it's
breakfast sausage like no other.</span>

<span>Coffee drinks with lots of milk are the first order of business
when getting breakfast in Portugal. Uma mei de leite, a half-and-half
blend of coffee and milk, or um galao, which is mostly milk with a shot
of coffee, are an easy way to ease into the day.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Though many Portuguese have a simple piece of toast or bread
alongside their drink, the perfect pairing for these milky coffees are
pasteis de nata, or egg custard tarts. With a flaky puff pastry shell
and a creamy custard filling, they're equally popular as a snack for the
11 a.m. cafe break, another Portuguese morning ritual.</span>

</div>

<span>Ackee, a delicately sweet pear-shaped fruit, is sautéed with salt
cod, tomatoes, garlic, chilies and onion in a breakfast scramble that
brings together sweet, salty, and spicy for a one-of-a-kind island
taste. Though it looks similar to scrambled eggs, that's just the creamy
yellow ackee, Jamaica's national fruit, in the dish.</span>

vendors and restaurants every morning for their customers. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Served hot in the winter and cold in the summer, it's a refreshing
contrast to the chewy scallion pancakes, dumplings and dough fritters
that are also part of the usual Taiwanese breakfast. Dip your fritters
in the soy milk for an extra treat.</span>
