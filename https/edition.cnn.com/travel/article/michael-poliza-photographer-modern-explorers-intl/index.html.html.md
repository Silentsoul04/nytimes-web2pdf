(CNN) — <span>Whether traveling through the vast floodplains of Africa
or Thailand's lush mangrove forests, when photographer Michael Poliza
explores the world, he practices one principle: take nothing but
pictures and leave nothing but footprints.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Over the last two decades, Poliza has traveled to almost 180
countries to capture vibrant and spirited photos focused on intimate
moments of animals and the world's least-documented landscapes.</span>

<span>Capturing these special moments requires patience and an
understanding of the erratic rhythms of the wilderness, but even the
most seasoned wildlife photographers are not immune to nature's whims.
</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>One day in 2011, while soaring over Purnululu National Park in
Western Australia, Poliza and his helicopter pilot were too absorbed by
the beauty of its beehive-like rock formations to notice they were
headed straight towards a storm. </span>

<span>"Lightning was coming down left and right and up and down, and I
had an open door in the back of the helicopter which you cannot close,
so the rain was coming in. It was pitch black," said Poliza. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>It was, he remembers, a "scary afternoon," but not a wasted one.
As documented in his latest book "The World," the combination of
imposing edifices and bottled lightning is among his most stunning
photography to date.</span>

### A man of reinvention

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Poliza, now 62, wasn't always a photographer, starting as a child
actor in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany, before founding multiple IT
companies in the early internet boom. But in 1997, after more than a
decade of transatlantic business trips, he sold his companies, packed up
his things, and set out to explore the world.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>He bought a 75-foot boat and embarked on a 1,009-day expedition
around the world to raise environmental awareness, with photographers
and filmmakers in tow. Together, they documented the journey,
broadcasting photos via satellite and online as they explored remote
areas of the world only reachable by ship.</span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>During the trip, while searching for great white sharks in
Australia, Poliza learned to appreciate that nature cannot be forced.
After five days without a sighting, a friend of Poliza's was getting
impatient and offered money to their guide to speed up the search.
"There was nothing he could do ... that was a very good lesson to
understand that you cannot push nature to do anything."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span></span>

### A new beginning

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>When his journey came to an end, Poliza, then in his mid-40s, was
confronted with what to do next. He sold his ship and stopped in Cape
Town, South Africa, on the way to Madagascar. Besotted, Poliza canceled
his trip to Madagascar, bought a house in Cape Town, and began exploring
the continent. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>He joined his friends on safaris, capturing photos of Africa's
spectacular landscapes and vast range of animals. When some of his
photographs began appearing in advertisements, his career started to
take off. "I was just playing with my camera and trying to shoot things
a bit different," said Poliza. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"To be honest, I didn't really have a plan ... I didn't wake up in
the morning and say, 'I want to take a photo of wildlife or landscapes
or a specific animal,' it just drifted into that."</span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>One day, after returning from a safari, Poliza realized he had a
problem. "I opened up my mail (and) I saw that my bank account wasn't
smiling at me anymore. I realized I need to come up with a plan."</span>

<div id="ad_rect_btf_01" class="Ad__tag Article__adBody Ad__hasLabel">

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>He quickly found a publisher for his first book "Africa," released
in 2006, which gained worldwide attention. Poliza's photographs have
filled a further 11 books, selling thousands of copies. His latest,
"[The
World](https://books-teneues.com/the-world-%C2%B7-michael-poliza/),"
published by [teNeues](https://teneues-books.com/), is the culmination
of his work from the last decade. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"I realized that I had a lot of images that hadn't been used ...
so I thought maybe it would be fun to do a book that is a subjective
look at the world," Poliza said. "I don't attempt to, and I don't
pretend that my set of images covers the whole world. It's just my view
of the world."</span>

<span>No matter where he is, Poliza says it's imperative for him to
travel light, support the local economy, and live among the locals. He
has formed an emotional attachment to the landscapes, the wildlife, and
the people of every place he has traveled to. As the effects of global
climate change worsen, he hopes his photos inspire others to commit to
saving the planet.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"What I'm trying to do is focus on the beautiful side of the
world, and I think there's still a lot of beauty there," he says. "I
want people to ... create an emotional reaction with that area, with
that place, with our planet, and are more willing to take responsibility
that way."</span>

Poliza's boat was 30 feet long. This has been updated to the correct
length, 75 feet.*</span>
