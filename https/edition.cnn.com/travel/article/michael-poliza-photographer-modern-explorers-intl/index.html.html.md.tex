(CNN) --- Whether traveling through the vast floodplains of Africa or
Thailand's lush mangrove forests, when photographer Michael Poliza
explores the world, he practices one principle: take nothing but
pictures and leave nothing but footprints.

Over the last two decades, Poliza has traveled to almost 180 countries
to capture vibrant and spirited photos focused on intimate moments of
animals and the world's least-documented landscapes.

Capturing these special moments requires patience and an understanding
of the erratic rhythms of the wilderness, but even the most seasoned
wildlife photographers are not immune to nature's whims.

One day in 2011, while soaring over Purnululu National Park in Western
Australia, Poliza and his helicopter pilot were too absorbed by the
beauty of its beehive-like rock formations to notice they were headed
straight towards a storm.

"Lightning was coming down left and right and up and down, and I had an
open door in the back of the helicopter which you cannot close, so the
rain was coming in. It was pitch black," said Poliza.

It was, he remembers, a "scary afternoon," but not a wasted one. As
documented in his latest book "The World," the combination of imposing
edifices and bottled lightning is among his most stunning photography to
date.

These beehive-like rock formations found in Purnululu National Park,
Western Australia, are known as the "bungle bungles."

Poliza, now 62, wasn't always a photographer, starting as a child actor
in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany, before founding multiple IT
companies in the early internet boom. But in 1997, after more than a
decade of transatlantic business trips, he sold his companies, packed up
his things, and set out to explore the world.

He bought a 75-foot boat and embarked on a 1,009-day expedition around
the world to raise environmental awareness, with photographers and
filmmakers in tow. Together, they documented the journey, broadcasting
photos via satellite and online as they explored remote areas of the
world only reachable by ship.

During the trip, while searching for great white sharks in Australia,
Poliza learned to appreciate that nature cannot be forced. After five
days without a sighting, a friend of Poliza's was getting impatient and
offered money to their guide to speed up the search. "There was nothing
he could do ... that was a very good lesson to understand that you
cannot push nature to do anything."

\hypertarget{a-new-beginning}{%

When his journey came to an end, Poliza, then in his mid-40s, was
confronted with what to do next. He sold his ship and stopped in Cape
Town, South Africa, on the way to Madagascar. Besotted, Poliza canceled
his trip to Madagascar, bought a house in Cape Town, and began exploring
the continent.

He joined his friends on safaris, capturing photos of Africa's
spectacular landscapes and vast range of animals. When some of his
photographs began appearing in advertisements, his career started to
take off. "I was just playing with my camera and trying to shoot things
a bit different," said Poliza.

"To be honest, I didn't really have a plan ... I didn't wake up in the
morning and say, 'I want to take a photo of wildlife or landscapes or a
specific animal,' it just drifted into that."

One day, after returning from a safari, Poliza realized he had a
problem. "I opened up my mail (and) I saw that my bank account wasn't
smiling at me anymore. I realized I need to come up with a plan."

He quickly found a publisher for his first book "Africa," released in
2006, which gained worldwide attention. Poliza's photographs have filled
a further 11 books, selling thousands of copies. His latest,
"\href{https://books-teneues.com/the-world-\%C2\%B7-michael-poliza/}{The
World}," published by \href{https://teneues-books.com/}{teNeues}, is the
culmination of his work from the last decade.

"I realized that I had a lot of images that hadn't been used ... so I
thought maybe it would be fun to do a book that is a subjective look at
the world," Poliza said. "I don't attempt to, and I don't pretend that
my set of images covers the whole world. It's just my view of the
world."

No matter where he is, Poliza says it's imperative for him to travel
light, support the local economy, and live among the locals. He has
formed an emotional attachment to the landscapes, the wildlife, and the
people of every place he has traveled to. As the effects of global
climate change worsen, he hopes his photos inspire others to commit to
saving the planet.

"What I'm trying to do is focus on the beautiful side of the world, and
I think there's still a lot of beauty there," he says. "I want people to
... create an emotional reaction with that area, with that place, with
our planet, and are more willing to take responsibility that way."

\emph{Correction: An earlier version of this story said Michael Poliza's
boat was 30 feet long. This has been updated to the correct length, 75
feet.}
