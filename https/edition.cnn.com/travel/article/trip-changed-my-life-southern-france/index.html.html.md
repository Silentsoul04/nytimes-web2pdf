programming my coworker described as "moving color bars around a screen

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>So, I decided to attend a language school. All across Europe
you'll find these small, non-credit, unofficial schools which offer
three or so hours of conversational classes per day. They help students
find housing and organize group activities. They're probably meant for
European college students, but they attract anyone looking for a short
escape. </span>

<span>The weather got cold and crisp and the beach lost its charm. Then
my friends began to leave, one by one returning to their home countries.
The Spaniards left, then the Canadian, then the Russian Italian. My
cheap summer room had to be turned back over to the fall student I'd
sublet it from.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Then the strikes started. First the wine growers protested land
taxes. Then the metro stopped working for weeks in the name of metro
worker's rights. The strikes caused chaos and brought attention to a
cause, but they always ended without much progress.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>To truly improve her French, my roommate enrolled in a real
university for the fall and she wanted me to join her. But I couldn't
stomach the idea of being a college student again living in a dorm at
then 29. (I've only realized now, of course, that 29 is still so
young.)</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>I grew tired of never completely understanding anyone and only
getting the gist. I hated all the money I'd spent buying tickets for the
wrong day, and having packages sent to the wrong destination. I was
frustrated that I couldn't have a real conversation with Julien.</span>

<span>At one point I realized I was a lot funnier back in New York. I
just didn't get French humor. I didn't understand why movies never had a
real ending but were instead vaguely unsatisfying. I didn't get all the
constant anger at the government. </span>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Late September, I left Montpellier and took the TGV up to Paris to
stay with my aunt for a few weeks before my flight out. As I rode the
smooth train north, I gazed out at vineyards whipping by with their
grapes hung low to the ground waiting to be picked and crushed.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>In the city, every morning my dear aunt made me a bowl of café au
lait along with pâté smeared on bread. She sent me out into the city
with a thin paper booklet called "Balades a Paris." I climbed the bright
Montmartre hill, learned Notre Dame's secrets from a volunteer tour
guide and bought a classic leather Cassandra bag at the Marche aux
puces.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>My mom and my brother joined me for my final two weeks and we were
dazzled by the marbled figures at the Musee d'Orsay. We loved the thick
chocolate at Angelina cafe. We drove down to see the Loire Valley's
castles.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>As the date of my return flight drew closer, I realized I was
dreading finding a new job in New York and starting my life there over
again. Moving to France hadn't been so hard after all. What had been
difficult was staying there, building up a real life. That's the work
you have to do wherever you choose to go and wherever you try to
stay.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>I realized too late that you never pick up a language. It simply
drags you along till you're standing.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>For a short time, I had been that girl, dating that French guy,
living that French dream, but eventually I became just another American
in Paris and a return ticket took me home.</span>
