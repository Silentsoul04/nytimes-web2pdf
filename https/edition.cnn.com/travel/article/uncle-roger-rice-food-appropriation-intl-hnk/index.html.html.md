(CNN) — <span>On July 8, Malaysian comedian Nigel Ng uploaded [to
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53me-ICi_f8) [a
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53me-ICi_f8) titled "DISGUSTED by
this Egg Fried Rice Video," under his comedic persona "Uncle
Roger."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>In the video, Ng slammed **** BBC Food presenter Hersha Patel's
unconventional way of cooking Chinese-style egg-fried rice, which
included draining the rice through a strainer after boiling.</span>

</div>

<div>

<div class="Ad__component">

<div id="ad_rect_atf_02" class="Ad__tag Article__adBody Ad__hasLabel">

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"What she doing? Oh my god. You're killing me, woman. Drain the --
she's draining rice with colander\! How can you drain rice with
colander? This is not pasta\!" he exclaimed. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Shortly afterward, he groaned, "You're ruining the rice," as Patel
used tap water to wash it of starch.</span>

</div>

<div class="HTMLEmbed__component">

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>What Ng intended to be a comedic video sparked a firestorm of
dismay and disbelief as it ricocheted around the internet, gaining more
than 7 million views on YouTube and nearly 40 million on Twitter.
</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Many viewers, including Asian-American celebrities such as writer
Jenny Yang, derided Patel's methods for departing from how Chinese
egg-fried rice is traditionally made. Patel hadn't washed the rice
before boiling it. She had added too much water. She should have used
day-old rice. The scrambled egg was overcooked instead of runny.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"THIS RICE COOKING IS A HATE CRIME," Yang [joked on
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/jennyyangtv/status/1286131803246350336)</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Ng, who is based in London, tried to defuse the situation by
filming a short clip with Patel announcing they are planning a
collaboration. "While this guy's blown up like nobody's business, I've
been trolled," Patel said [in the
video](https://twitter.com/hershapatel1/status/1286794759982522370),
claiming she had been simply presenting the BBC's recipe and that "I
know how to cook rice."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The BBC has not publicly commented on Ng's or Patel's
remarks.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Rice is a staple ingredient in Asia, and has been adopted by
cuisines globally since it was first domesticated in China more than
9,400 years ago, according to [Chinese
researchers](https://phys.org/news/2017-05-domesticated-rice-dated-years-china.html).
There are countless ways to prepare rice -- you can steam it, fry it,
simmer it slowly in broth like Italian risotto or scorch it to develop a
crispy crust like Iranian tahdig.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But the issue at hand goes beyond a difference in opinion on the
varying methods of cooking rice.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The controversy over the BBC Food clip, and the reaction it
provoked within certain Asian communities, speaks to a broader,
long-standing debate about the intersection of food, ethnicity and
culture -- the fundamental question of who is allowed to cook what
food.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

### Appropriating and whitewashing food

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Countless White chefs in recent years have been accused of
cultural appropriation by creating food from other ethnic groups using
methods and phrases that are deemed "unauthentic," disrespectful, and
sometimes outright racist.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Last year, for instance, an Asian food critic [accused celebrity
chef Gordon
Ramsay](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/gordon-ramsey-asian-restaurant-cultural-appropriation-intl-scli/index.html)
of tokenism, after he launched a restaurant described in promotional
material as "an authentic Asian eating house."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The restaurant didn't differentiate between wildly different and
unique types of Asian cuisines, lumping them all together as generically
Asian. And at the time of the opening, it did not appear to have any
Asian chefs.</span>

[Gordon Ramsay's new 'authentic Asian' restaurant kicks off cultural
appropriation
dispute](/travel/article/gordon-ramsey-asian-restaurant-cultural-appropriation-intl-scli/index.html)

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"Japanese? Chinese? It's all Asian, who cares," wrote the critic,
Angela Hui, in a scathing [Instagram
story.](https://london.eater.com/2019/4/11/18306082/gordon-ramsay-cultural-appropriation-lucky-cat-london-preview)</span>

</div>

<div class="Ad__component">

<div id="ad_rect_btf_01" class="Ad__tag Article__adBody Ad__hasLabel">

</div>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>CNN reached out to Ramsay's restaurant group for comment after the
initial controversy.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Tokenism is when racial, ethnic, or cultural diversity is
emphasized only on a symbolic level, without much substantial effort to
understand that culture -- in Ramsay's case, labeling a restaurant
"Asian" without taking the time to differentiate between these
individual nuanced cuisines.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Food is not just sustenance, it carries history and heritage,
which is why many people are deeply offended when these traditional
methods of cooking **** are cast aside.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Sometimes chefs don't just change up cooking methods, they
blatantly insult the cuisine and culture of origin. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>One notorious example is the Chinese-inspired restaurant Lucky
Lee's in New York. When it opened in 2019, the White owner said it would
serve "clean" food that wouldn't make people feel "bloated and icky"
afterwards -- the implication being that regular Chinese food was
somehow unhealthy. That sparked uproar and the restaurant closed [eight
months
later](https://ny.eater.com/2019/12/6/20999639/lucky-lees-greenwich-village-clean-chinese-closed).</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>And then there are chefs who fail to acknowledge a dish's ethnic
origins at all -- the equivalent of whitewashing food. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The New York Times food columnist Alison Roman, also a White
woman, gained internet fame for her recipe for a ["Spiced Chickpea Stew
with Coconut and
Turmeric"](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019772-spiced-chickpea-stew-with-coconut-and-turmeric)
-- which sounds an awful lot like an Indian or Jamaican curry. But in an
interview with
[Jezebel](https://jezebel.com/alison-roman-is-more-than-thestew-1838861751),
she said: "I'm like y'all, this is not a curry ... I've never made a
curry." Roman's refusal to call it a curry and her denial of its ethnic
background prompted critic Roxana Hadadi to call it ["colonialism as
cuisine."](https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/alison-roman-and-the-exhausting-prevalence-of-ethnic-erasure-in-popular-food-culture.php)</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>In response to the backlash, NYT eventually added a line in
Roman's recipe on their website, saying it "evokes stews found in South
India and parts of the Caribbean."</span>

say](/2020/01/18/asia/chinese-restaurant-syndrome-msg-intl-hnk-scli/index.html)

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But some people have pushed back against the idea of cultural
appropriation.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Gatekeeping food prevents innovation, [some
say](https://www.foodrepublic.com/2017/06/01/cultural-appropriation-food/):
**** for instance, fusion foods are born from chefs experimenting with
different cuisines. Many also point out that food is meant to be shared,
and its power is often directly tied to the communal eating experience.
</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Setting boundaries around food -- for example, saying only Chinese
people can cook Chinese food, or Chinese food can only be cooked a
certain way, as those reacting to Ng's video posit -- seems like the
antithesis of this sharing spirit in our globalized world.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But sharing is different from appropriating without respect,
especially when the chefs who do it profit from portraying those
foods.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

### A reckoning in food media

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The Uncle Roger video is the latest in a string of incidents that
have drawn attention to issues surrounding food and culture. This summer
has seen the reckoning on race and racism, embodied by the Black Lives
Matter movement, spread from the streets to newsrooms and
companies.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Within food media, Bon Appetit -- owned by Conde Nast -- is the
best-known example. Current staffers, including assistant food editor
Sohla El-Waylly, accused the company of underpaying and exploiting
employees of color, and viewers called out the brand for numerous
instances of food appropriation.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>For instance, irate viewers pointed to the time Bon Appetit had a
White chef demonstrate how to cook [Vietnamese
pho](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-you-should-eating-pho?mbid=social_facebook),
with the title "PSA: This Is How You Should Be Eating Pho." There was
also the time they "reinvented" the Filipino dessert
[Halo-halo](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ode-to-halo-halo) by
stuffing it with gummy bears and popcorn, spurring scorn from
readers.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Each time, the brand would issue an apology and a promise to do
better -- but it has been happening for years. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>After this summer's explosive allegations, the company [released a
statement in
June,](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipe-audit?utm_brand=ba&mbid=social_twitter&utm_social-type=owned&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social)
acknowledging that "BA's recipes for Vietnamese pho, mumbo sauce, flaky
bread, and White-guy kimchi all erased these recipes' origins or, worse,
lampooned them."</span>

</div>

[Bon Appetit vows to resolve pay inequities and prioritize people of
color for editor in chief
search](/2020/06/10/media/bon-appetit-apologizes/index.html)

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"In all these cases and more, BA has been called out for
appropriation, for decontextualizing recipes from non-White cultures,
and for knighting 'experts' without considering if that person should,
in fact, claim mastery of a cuisine that isn't theirs," wrote Joey
Hernandez, BA's research director, in the statement.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>The Bon Appetit debacle also prompted other questions about biases
within established institutions. Who chooses what dishes get more
coverage? Why do publications continue to use language that frames
"ethnic" food as occasionally bizarre and often incomprehensible -- for
example, Bloomberg calling tofu a ["white, chewy and
bland"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/the-pandemic-opens-the-door-to-tofu-makers-who-race-to-meet-deman?sref=783qcuCY)
food people are "learning to love?" Bloomberg eventually removed these
phrases from their article after international backlash.</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>And why are "ethnic" chefs -- a euphemism for non-Whites -- often
paid less? Bon Appetit fans were further outraged when Somali chef Hawa
Hassan [revealed last month](https://i.imgur.com/QUCsdbx.png) that she
was only paid $400 per video, and El-Waylly [blasted Bon
Appetit](https://twitter.com/sarahmanavis/status/1270069650060083207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1270069650060083207%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insider.com%2Fbon-appetit-sohla-el-waylly-people-rallying-behind-adam-rapoport-2020-6)
for only paying her $50,000 to "assist mostly white editors with
significantly less experience than me."</span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>These themes sound abstract at times -- but they're linked to and
help perpetuate broader **** real-life inequalities such as workplace
discrimination, pay inequity, power imbalances and prevailing Whiteness
in the food world. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>Ng and Patel may not have intended for their respective videos,
and upcoming collaboration, to raise these questions. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>But viewers' frustrations are inherently tied to the idea that
there is an authentic way to cook fried rice, and that Patel's errors
are made worse by the fact she is a non-Chinese chef presenting herself
as an authority on the dish. </span>

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component">

<span>"FOR ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO SAY THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS OF
COOKING RICE, WELL OF COURSE THERE ARE. AND I LOVE THEM ALL," [tweeted
Yang,](https://twitter.com/jennyyangtv/status/1286351923407396864) the
Asian American writer. "BUT THIS IS \*NOT\* HOW YOU MAKE DELICIOUS FRIED
RICE, THE DISH OF MY PEOPLES, THE SUBJECT OF THIS VIDEO."</span>
