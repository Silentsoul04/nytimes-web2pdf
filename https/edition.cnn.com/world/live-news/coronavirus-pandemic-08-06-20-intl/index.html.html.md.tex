Japan's Health Ministry recorded 1,490 Covid-19 infections on Thursday,
the second-highest number of cases the country has identified in a
single day during the pandemic and yet another worrying sign that its
latest outbreak shows no signs of abating.

Thursday marks the 10th straight day the country has recorded more than
900 cases of the novel coronavirus. Authorities have now identified at
least 44,527 cases of Covid-19, more than half of which have been
reported since the beginning of July.

Seven deaths were reported Thursday, bringing the nationwide death toll
to 1,046.

\textbf{Trouble in Tokyo:} Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike urged people in the
Japanese capital to refrain from traveling during the upcoming Obon
summer vacation season to stop the infection spread.

Authorities reported 360 new infections in Tokyo on Thursday, the 10th
consecutive day of more than 200 cases in row.

To date, more than 14,500 cases of Covid-19 have been identified in the
Japanese capital.

\textbf{Infections spiking elsewhere:} Kanagawa, a prefecture that
neighbors Tokyo, crossed the triple digit threshold for the first time
Thursday, reporting 119 infections. Osaka also posted its highest number
of cases in a single day Thursday, with 225.

\subsection{5 former CDC directors call for increased leadership in the
coronavirus
pandemic}\label{5-former-cdc-directors-call-for-increased-leadership-in-the-coronavirus-pandemic}}

From CNN Health's Lauren Mascarenhas

Five former directors of the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) criticized the contradictory messages put out by
President Donald Trump's administration Thursday.

Here's what some of them said:

\textbf{Dr. Thomas Frieden} said that the CDC had been sidelined early
on in the pandemic and described Trump's contradictory messages as
``chaotic leadership,'' which has led to partisanship, confusion and
increased spread of the virus.

\begin{quote}
``It's unbelievable that six months into the pandemic, it's not clear
who's in charge, federally,'' Frieden said during~a roundtable hosted by
ABC News Live.\\
``There's no plan. There's no common data that we're looking at to see
what's happening with the virus and what's happening with our
response.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Dr. Jeffrey Koplan} said that~"every one of those falsehoods"
damages the nation's mitigation efforts against the virus.

Frieden added that Americans want information from the CDC.~``Americans
are voting with their clicks. There have been 1.6 billion clicks on the
CDC website,'' said Frieden. ``The more we learn, the more we know, the
better we can control it.''

\textbf{Dr. Richard Besser} said the federal response to the pandemic
has been ``absolutely unacceptable'' considering the US is the
wealthiest nation on the planet.

He also criticized politicians for viewing CDC guidelines as an
obstacle.

``If you have politicians saying that CDC guidance is a barrier to
getting children back into school, instead of the roadmap for doing it
safely, the whole system breaks down,'' said Besser, who was an acting
CDC chief during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.

\textbf{Dr. Julie Gerberding}, who headed the CDC under former president
George W. Bush, said she hopes that the government can learn from this
crisis.

``I really do hope that finally it's gotten so bad that we will reinvent
how we think about our health security in the context of our national
security,"~

\textbf{Dr. David Satcher}, a former US Surgeon General who headed the
CDC under former president Bill Clinton, said communities of color that
have been hit harder by the pandemic are going to require particular
attention during recovery efforts

``It's going to say a lot about us as a nation, whether we step up to
this challenge, and remove many of the structural barriers to health
that people in this country face," he said.

\emph{CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misattributed Dr.
Thomas Frieden's remarks to Dr. Jeffrey Koplan. Frieden said that
Americans want information from the CDC, and ``Americans are voting with
their clicks. There have been 1.6 billion clicks on the CDC website. The
more we learn, the more we know, the better we can control it.''}

\subsection{The coronavirus pandemic is skewing younger, WHO
says}\label{the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-skewing-younger-who-says}}

From CNN Health's Maggie Fox

The coronavirus pandemic is starting to move into younger populations,
the World Health Organization says.

WHO posted new data on the pandemic that shows the most cases, by far,
are among people aged 25 to 64. Since February 24, the proportion of
reported cases in very young children and babies has increased
seven-fold, WHO said. The share of cases among teens and young adults
has gone up six-fold.~

\begin{quote}
``This trend may be explained by, but is not limited to, the following
factors:~early detection and testing were initially focused on
identifying cases with severe symptoms, which are more frequently
observed among older people; detection of milder cases; broader testing;
outbreak hotspots shifting to countries with lower age profiles; or a
rise in risky behavior after easing of public health and social
measures,'' WHO said Thursday.
\end{quote}

The global coronavirus caseload now looks like this, WHO said:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1.2\% of cases in babies and young children aged 0 to 4
\item
  2.5\% of cases in children 5-14
\item
  9.6\% of cases in teens and young adults 15-24
\item
  64\% of cases in adults aged 25-64
\item
  19.4\% of cases in older adults 65-84
\item
  3.4\% of cases in people 85 and older

Mexico recorded another 819 fatalities from Covid-19, the Health
Ministry said Thursday, bringing the countrywide death toll from the
virus to 50,517.

This is the third consecutive day that Mexico has reported more than 800
deaths, the first time it has done so since the outbreak began in the
country.

The ministry said it also identified another 6,590 new infections on
Thursday, bringing the country's total number of confirmed coronavirus
cases to 462,690.

A three-hour meeting between senior administration officials and
Democratic leaders yielded little progress tonight as both sides seemed
resigned to the likelihood that Congress won't reach a major stimulus
deal amid an economic crisis.

Both sides emerged trading blame for the sputtering talks --- and the
administration officials warned that President Trump would take
executive action if no deal is reached by Friday.~

It's unclear if the two sides will meet on Friday.~

``We had a consequential meeting that was one way we could see the
difference in values that we bring to the table,'' House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi said.

Pelosi said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows slammed his
hand on the table and stormed out of the room at one point, something
that Meadows denied.

The differences remain as they have been: Democrats want to do
``something big,'' in the words of Pelosi, and the Trump administration
wants a ``skinny bill,'' in the words of Meadows.

\textbf{One of the biggest sticking points}: Aid to state and local
governments.

````We are very far apart --- it's most unfortunate,'' Pelosi said.''

Schumer said, ``We are very disappointed in the meeting ...They were
unwilling to meet in the middle.''

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Meadows indicated they are ``very
far apart'' on some major issues.

``I think there's a lot of issues we are close to a compromise position
on and I think there's a handful of very big issues that we are still
very far apart,'' Mnuchin said.

Trump called the two officials three times during the meeting and urged
them to continuing negotiating, Meadows said.

Mnuchin said that if ``they could conclude tomorrow without a deal,''
Trump will take executive action.

Masks continue to be one of the most effective ways to prevent Covid-19
transmission and there are many different types that serve this purpose,
Dr. Sanjay Gupta explained Thursday during CNN's global coronavirus town
hall.

Gupta showed viewers how to wear masks properly while sharing some data
on how they help prevent Covid-19 infection.

\begin{quote}
"There was a great study out~of Lancet which basically said~the
likelihood of me~transmitting the virus if I~didn't have a mask on was
17\% or~18\%.~If I did have a mask on, it was~closer to 3\%.~You are
talking about a sixfold~difference, potentially.~It is not perfect but
it can really help," Gupta said.

Dr. Andrew Wilhelm is one of the thousands of physicians on the
frontlines facing a surge in Covid-19 cases in the US.

As director of the University of Mississippi Medical Center's Intensive
Care Unit, Wilhelm lives in a state that has the
\href{https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/}{fifth-highest
recorded case count per 100,000 people}, behind only Louisiana, Arizona,
Florida and New York, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

\begin{quote}
"It's tough.~That's really the only word to~describe it. ... it's really

Thursday.

\textbf{More from Mississippi:} Gov. Tate Reeves
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/health/mississippi-coronavirus-masks-schools-positivity-rate/index.html}{announced
a face-covering mandate} in all counties for public gatherings and
retail settings for the next two weeks.

Also, all adults and kids in schools must wear masks, unless there is a
medical reason not to.

"I (had) taken a piecemeal approach (to masks) because I believe firmly
that this was the best way to get the most number of people to
participate," Reeves told reporters Tuesday.

Murray, a researcher behind an influential coronavirus model from the
University of Washington.

Murray's perspective has been shared countless times by health experts
since the start of the pandemic who are still baffled over the sight of
groups of people refusing to wear face coverings.

\begin{quote}
"It's rare that you see something~so simple, so inexpensive, so~easy for
everybody to~participate and have such an~extraordinary impact in
the~US, but also all over the~world actually.~It's quite extraordinary,"
Murray told CNN during its global coronavirus town hall Thursday night.
