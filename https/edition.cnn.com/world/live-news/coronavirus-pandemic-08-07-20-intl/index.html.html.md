## Covid-19 cases are stabilizing in Australian state of Victoria thanks to strict lockdowns

</div>

The number of new Covid-19 patients identified each day in the
Australian state of Victoria has begun to stabilize thanks to strict
lockdown measures, the government said Saturday.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 pull-quotestyles__PullQuoteContainer-sc-1ia2e5m-0 idZwuC">

““Certainly we’re seeing some stabilization in numbers, we’ve got four
to five hundred cases each day that has been more or less the average
for the last week,” said Victoria Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton.”

</div>

A total of 446 new cases and 12 deaths were recorded Friday, according
to Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews. Sutton said that the government's
models showed the lockdown measures prevented about 20,000 cases.

In May, Australia was[ held up as a global
model](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/asia/australia-coronavirus-success-intl-hnk/index.html) for
its handling of the outbreak, which started with early measures to bar
entry from high-risk countries. Stricter curbs on social gatherings,
expanded testing, restaurant and bar closures followed as cases rose,
with some states sealing their borders.

But [Covid-19](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/health/what-is-coronavirus-covid-19-wellness/index.html) cases
in Victoria rose suddenly in recent weeks, with many new infections in
aged care homes and among healthcare workers. Authorities responded by
instituting some of the most stringent movement restrictions in
Australia's history.

Sutton said the government will not see the results of an even stricter
lockdown for another week.

From CNN’s Jennifer Henderson

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 post-content-rendered render-stellar-contentstyles__Content-sc-9v7nwy-0 ivqjEu">

Public schools on the Hawaiian island of Oahu are going to employ
distancing learning for the first four weeks of this academic year due
to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Hawaii Department of Education said in a
statement.

Schools will begin preparing to transition to distance learning next
week and then implement "full distance learning models" on August 17.

Authorities in Hawaii have identified 3,115 cases since the pandemic
began. Of those, 2,741 are in Honolulu County on Oahu.

</div>

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott today said his administration is working with
the Vermont Principals Association, the Superintendent's Association of
School Athletic Directors and Coaches, “with a goal that will allow for
all sports to move forward in some fashion.”

“Like so many things during this crisis, fall sports won't be exactly
what we’re accustomed to,” Scott said.

Scott said his plan includes cross country running, soccer, field
hockey, football, cheerleading, volleyball, bass fishing, and golf, and
practice will start at the same time classes start, which is now Sept.
8.

This guidance will also cover Vermont's recreational sports leagues, the
governor said. 

“Kids, coaches, and parents should prepare themselves. Things will look
much different, especially when it comes to high contact sports. Now
again, this won't be a normal season, but our goal is to offer a path
forward for each of these sports, to give our kids some sense of
normalcy and normal times,” the governor added.

## Trump details potential executive actions if Congress doesn't reach agreement on relief package

</div>

President Trump on Friday laid out the executive actions he would pursue
“if Democrats continue to hold” a relief package “hostage.”

The actions would include a payroll tax deferment, extending
unemployment benefits, extending an eviction moratorium and deferring
student loan payments and forgiving their interest.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> “My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an
> agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment
> benefits, provide protections for evictions … and get relief to
> American families,” Trump said during a news conference. “Yet
> tragically, (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and (Senate Minority Leader)
> Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical left-wing policies that
> have nothing to do with the China virus.”

</div>

“If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage I will act
under my authority as President to get Americans the relief they need,”
he continued.

**Some context:** Negotiations over the next stimulus package stalled on
Capitol Hill today as Democrats and Trump administration officials
walked away after talks broke down and devolved into partisan
finger-pointing.

Princeton University has decided to have all undergraduate students
fully remote for the fall 2020 semester, according to an update sent by
Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber on Friday.

According to Eisgruber's letter, the decision was made due to the
pandemic's impact on New Jersey which "has led us to conclude that we
cannot provide a genuinely meaningful on-campus experience for our
undergraduate students this fall in a manner that is respectful of
public health concerns and consistent with state regulations and
guidance."

**Some context:** Princeton had announced July 6 that it planned to
welcome back first-years and juniors for the fall semester, and
sophomores and seniors for the spring semester, however, that plan was
always subject to change according to the public health situation.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> "The health risks to the campus and surrounding populations appear
> greater now than they did just a month ago," Eisgruber said in the
> letter. "Reopening efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere have
> demonstrated how difficult it is to contain the disease. Where schools
> and universities have started to bring back students, Covid cases have
> rapidly followed."

</div>

According to the announcement, Princeton hopes to bring students back to
campus in the spring, and said seniors in the class of 2021 will be its
top priority.

## Americans are moving around too much, coronavirus forecaster says

From CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 post-content-rendered render-stellar-contentstyles__Content-sc-9v7nwy-0 ivqjEu">

People in many parts of the US are moving around as much as they did
before the pandemic started, a top disease forecaster said Friday.

That’s not good, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute
for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which
issues regular forecasts about the coronavirus pandemic.

More movement predicts more spread of the virus.

“If you look at the mobility data collected from cell phones in many
parts of the country, we're almost back to pre-Covid levels of mobility,
so we're just not being as cautious as other people are in other
countries,” Murray told CNN on Friday.

Murray said that when cases start to come down, people tend to start
interacting more, resulting in the up and down phenomenon many states
have experienced with Covid-19 cases. 

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> “When things get bad in your own community, that's when people start
> sort of being really worried,” Murray said. “That level of caution
> creeps in. That puts the brakes on transmission.”

</div>

There are other things people can do to slow the pandemic besides
staying put, Murray said.

“Our view about this is that there should be a universal mask mandate in
the US, that should come with some penalty if you're caught without a
mask, because we know penalties actually increase mask-wearing even more
than just a mandate,” Murray said. 

**The latest prediction:** The IHME released a model Thursday projecting
nearly 300,000 deaths in the US from coronavirus by Dec. 1. 

The model calculated that if 95% of the people in the US wore masks,
that number could decrease to 228,271 deaths, saving more than 66,000
lives.

## California releases guidance for reopening colleges and universities

From CNN's Sarah Moon

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 post-content-rendered render-stellar-contentstyles__Content-sc-9v7nwy-0 ivqjEu">

California colleges and universities reopening this fall will need to
follow guidelines issued on Friday by the California Department of
Public Health (CDPH), which includes the use of face coverings, social
distancing and intensified cleaning protocols.

While indoor lectures are currently prohibited in counties on the
state’s monitoring list, courses offered in specialized indoor
settings like labs and studio arts will be permitted as long as
substantial physical distancing measures are in place based on the
nature of work performed in the space, the guidance says. 

**Here's what else the state said:**

<div class="Text-sc-1amvtpj-0 render-stellar-contentstyles__List-sc-9v7nwy-1 hWPJAy">

  - CDPH recommends closing nonessential shared spaces and prioritizing
    single room occupancy for housing, as well as limiting nonessential
    visitors and campus activities.
  - Grab-and-go options must be provided for meals and dining halls will
    need to serve individually plated meals instead of any self-serve or
    buffet-type stations, according to the guidance.

</div>

The newly released guidance also provides information on college sports.

“Teams must require masks for coaches, staff, media and any players not
engaged in play at each match,” the guidance stated. Practice may only
resume if athletes and staff get regular periodic Covid-19 testing. 

The state said competitions for high contact sports may be held without
spectators only if the college can provide Covid-19 testing and results
within 72 hours of a game.

“As colleges and other institutions of higher education plan to resume
in-person instruction, it’s critical that campuses make modifications to
reduce risk," State Epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said in a news release.
"This guidance aims to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our
students, families, and the communities where they study.”  

**Some context:** Many campuses in the state, including the University
of Southern California and schools within the University of California
system, have announced they will start the school year with mostly
online classes.

## Some coronavirus cases in California have been underreported due to glitch in registry system

</div>

A glitch in California’s disease registry system (CalREDIE) has created
a backlog of 250,000 to 300,000 records causing an underreporting of
some coronavirus cases, California Health and Human Services Secretary
Dr. Mark Ghaly said in a briefing on Friday.

While the majority of these records may be coronavirus results, Ghaly
explained that it includes duplicate records, both positive and negative
test results, and records for any other reportable diseases.

A server outage on July 25 created a delay in lab records going into the
state’s lab reporting system, Ghaly said. While temporary technical
changes were implemented to allow the records to flow into the system
more quickly, these changes were not disabled later which caused a
further delay in reporting lab data and creating an extensive backlog,
he explained. 

The state also learned that they were not receiving data from one of its
largest commercial lab for five days between July 31 through Aug. 4,
“due to a certificate that the state neglected to renew timely,” Ghaly
said.

According to Ghaly, Gov. Gavin Newsom has directed a full investigation
into the issue.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> “Throughout the pandemic, the CalREDIE data reporting system has been
> challenged by the volume of Covid-19 data,” Ghaly said. “Simply put,
> the CalREDIE system was not built for this volume of data.”

</div>

Ghaly expects to see a normalization of data in 24 to 48 hours. After
working through the backlog, the state will have a better understanding
of the statewide epidemiological curve and the future state of
hospitalizations.

The glitch in the system did not impact any data on hospitalizations or
deaths, according to Ghaly who believes the trend line has been
“stabilizing and coming down.”

## Italy extends coronavirus safety measures through September

From CNN's Sharon Braithwaite

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 post-content-rendered render-stellar-contentstyles__Content-sc-9v7nwy-0 ivqjEu">

The Italian government will extend its coronavirus safety measures until
Sept. 7, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Friday during a news
conference.

The council of ministers approved a decree related to the health
emergency, which will be in force from Aug. 10 through Sept. 7.

<div class="Box-sc-1fet97o-0 block-quote__Container-sc-98e3ot-0 kunFKx">

> "The new decree will find the extension until 7 September of the
> minimum precautionary measures that are currently in force," Conte
> said. "We are in a situation of substantial stability with regards to
> the epidemiological curve, with slight signs of a resurgence of the
> number of infections."

</div>

"The rate of infections in Italy is among the lowest in the European
Union," Conte added, recalling how bad the virus hit the country. 

Among the measures that will be extended, the obligation of wearing face
masks in closed places accessible to the public, the one-meter distance
rule on social distancing and the ban on gatherings.
