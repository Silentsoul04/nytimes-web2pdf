BOSTON — Charles M. Lieber, the chair of Harvard’s department of
chemistry and chemical biology, was charged on Tuesday with making false
statements about money he had received from a Chinese government-run
program, part of a broad-ranging F.B.I. effort [to root out scientists
suspected of stealing biomedical
research](https://web.archive.org/web/20200128165017/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html)
from American laboratories.

Dr. Lieber, a leader in the field of nanoscale electronics, was one of
three Boston-area scientists accused on Tuesday of working on behalf of
China. His case involves work with the Thousand Talents Program, a
state-run program that seeks to draw talent educated in other countries.

American officials are investigating hundreds of cases of suspected
theft of intellectual property by visiting scientists, nearly all of
them Chinese nationals or of Chinese descent. Some are accused of
obtaining patents in China based on work that is funded by the United
States government, and others of setting up laboratories in China that
secretly duplicated American research.

Dr. Lieber stands out among the accused scientists, because he is
neither Chinese nor of Chinese descent. And as a department head at
Harvard, he is widely published and more prominent than most of the
other scientists who have been accused.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2017 he was named a University Professor, Harvard’s highest faculty
rank, one of only 26 professors to hold that status. The same year, he
earned the National Institutes of Health [Director’s Pioneer
Award](https://web.archive.org/web/20200128165017/https://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer)
for inventing [syringe-injectable mesh
electronics](https://web.archive.org/web/20200128165017/https://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer/AwardRecipients17)
that can integrate with the brain.

Harvard’s president at the time, Drew G. Faust, called him “an
extraordinary scientist whose work has transformed nanoscience and
nanotechnology and has led to a remarkable range of valuable
applications that improve the quality of people’s lives.”

Dr. Lieber has made no secret of his work with Chinese partners, joining
five senior Chinese officials and scientists in 2013 to found
the[WUT-Harvard Joint Nano Key
Laboratory](https://web.archive.org/web/20200128165017/http://english.whut.edu.cn/wn/201301/t20130104_91316.htmlhttp://english.whut.edu.cn/wn/201301/t20130104_91316.html)
at the Wuhan Institute of Technology.

Federal prosecutors said on Tuesday that Dr. Lieber made false
representation to questions about his participation in the Chinese
program to the United States Department of Defense. He is also charged
with misrepresenting his involvement in Thousand Talents and his
affiliation with Wuhan University of Technology to officials at the
National Institutes of Health.

According to charging documents, Dr. Lieber was paid up to $50,000 per
month in salary and $150,000 per year in living expenses by Wuhan
University of Technology. He was also awarded more than $1.5 million by
the university and the Chinese government to build a laboratory in
Wuhan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Researchers are legally obligated to disclose such
payments<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>to their academic
institutions.

A representative for Dr. Lieber could not immediately be reached for
comment.

A second person charged, Zaosong Zheng, was a Harvard-affiliated cancer
researcher who prosecutors said was [caught with 21 vials of cells
stolen from a
laboratory](https://web.archive.org/web/20200128165017/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/chinese-scientist-cancer-research-investigation.html)
at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.

Dr. Zheng admitted that he planned to turbocharge his career by
publishing the results in China, under his own name, according to
federal prosecutors. He was charged with making false statements, and is
being held without bail in Massachusetts, after a judge determined that
he was a flight risk.

Yanqing Ye, who had been studying at Boston University until last
spring, was also charged on Tuesday, accused of lying to authorities
about her status as a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army. Ms.
Ye, who was charged with visa fraud, making false statements, acting as
an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy, is in China and was not
be arrested.

Launched in 2008,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>its Thousand
Talents Program is an effort to recruit Chinese and foreign academics
and entrepreneurs. According to a report in the China Daily, new
recruits receive 1 million yuan, or about $146,000, from the central
government, and a pledge of 10 million yuan for their ongoing research
from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The recruitment flows both ways. Researchers of Chinese descent make up
nearly half of the work force in American research laboratories, in part
because American-born scientists are drawn to the private sector and
less interested in academic careers.
