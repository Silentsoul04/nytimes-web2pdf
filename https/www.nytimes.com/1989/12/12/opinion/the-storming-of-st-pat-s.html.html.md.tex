About the Archive

This is a digitized version of an article from The Times's print
archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve
these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter,

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or
other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived
versions.

The demonstrators who stormed St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday may have
hoped to inspire sympathy for the problems of homosexuals in New York
City and resistance to the Catholic Church's positions on abortion. They
mostly brought discredit on themselves for demonstrating in a way that
obstructs consideration of their arguments.

There is plenty of room for controversy over church positions on
homosexuality, AIDS and abortion. No one can quarrel with a peaceful
demonstration outside St. Patrick's, and John Cardinal O'Connor did not
do so.

But some of the demonstrators turned honorable dissent into dishonorable
disruption. They entered the cathedral and repeatedly interrupted the
service. They lay down in the aisles, chained themselves to pews and
sought to shout down Cardinal O'Connor as he said mass. One protester is
reported to have disrupted even the administering of communion with an
act of desecration that deeply offended worshipers.

New Yorkers generally expect protesters to respect the rights of others,
even those with whom they disagree. To deny clergy and laity alike the
peaceful practice of religion grossly violates a decent regard for the
rights of others, let alone the law. Far from inspiring sympathy, such a
violation mainly offers another reason to reject both the offensive
protesters and their ideas.

Arguments over AIDS, homosexuality and abortion are not going to be
advanced by hysterics, threats or the disruption of religious services.
They might be advanced by serious argument that reflects conviction. The
demonstrators who entered St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday invite the
public to think about a different kind of conviction.
