Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen.

Lloyd Bentsen was a friend of Joe Biden’s.

And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague’s 1988
debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at
Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a
latter-day Dan Quayle.

Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning
John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the
economy. Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after
waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, “So, now you’re Jack Kennedy?”

The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for
the Obama campaign after the president’s dismal performance at his
debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last
week. Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama’s rescue,
relished his role, addressing his opponent as “my friend” but dismissing
his arguments as “malarkey.” He laughed at Mr. Ryan’s remarks so often
and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club
roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his
opponent.

It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some
lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer
blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night. Mr. Ryan tried to be
respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy
smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden
kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. “I know you’re under
duress,” he told the vice president, prompting another belly laugh.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past
debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler. He had to be contained
and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look
like a bully. This time he let loose. And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen
in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man
across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts.
His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the
camera.

Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him
for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his
own district. “On two occasions, we — we — we advocated for constituents
who were applying for grants,” Mr. Ryan said stiffly.

“I love that. I love that,” Mr. Biden said. “This was such a bad
program, and he writes me a letter saying — writes the Department of
Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus — it will
create growth and jobs.”

When Mr. Biden went after Mr. Romney’s infamous remark at a private
fund-raiser about the “47 percent,” Mr. Ryan reminded the vice president
of his own propensity for gaffes. “I think the vice president very well
knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right
way,” he said with a gotcha smile. Mr. Biden was not quite as amused.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his
predecessor’s mistakes. Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator,
and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to
be specific and changing subjects abruptly. She seemed determined to be
less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the
Obama-Romney debate.

Mr. Ryan made a point of praising Mr. Romney, even trying to soften his
image by recounting a time when Mr. Romney gave money and attention to a
couple whose children were badly injured in a car accident. It wasn’t
the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his
own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car
crash.

Mr. Ryan talked a lot about Mr. Romney. Mr. Biden talked a lot about Mr.
Biden.
