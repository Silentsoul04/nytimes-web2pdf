WORCESTER, Mass. --- Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the 26-year-old man who the
authorities say is one of two brothers who carried out the Boston
Marathon bombing, died of gunshot wounds and blunt trauma, according to
his death certificate.

A copy of the document, signed by Dr. Henry M. Nields, the chief medical
examiner for Massachusetts, was on file at Graham Putnam \& Mahoney
Funeral Parlors, where Mr. Tsarnaev's body is being kept.

Mr. Tsarnaev died after an exchange of gunfire with police officers
following a pursuit on April 18, not long after the Federal Bureau of
Investigation released grainy surveillance photographs showing him and
his brother, Dzhokhar, at the marathon.

Law enforcement officials say the two placed the explosives that killed
three people and wounded more than 260.

The night of the shootout, the authorities say, the Tsarnaev brothers
shot and killed a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Sean A. Collier, and then stole a car in Boston, which
they eventually drove to nearby Watertown, Mass.

There, officials say, the brothers threw explosives and exchanged
gunfire with the police before Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, climbed back into
the car and drove off, apparently hitting his older brother. The younger
brother was apprehended the next evening in Watertown and is being held
at a federal medical prison in Devens, Mass.

The certificate says Tamerlan Tsarnaev's cause of death was ``gunshot
wounds of torso and extremities'' and also cites ``blunt trauma to head
and torso.'' It says Mr. Tsarnaev was ``shot by police then run over and
dragged by motor vehicle.'' He was pronounced dead on April 19 at 1:35
a.m. after being taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The
death was ruled a homicide.

The certificate says an autopsy has been performed, but Peter A. Stefan,
the owner of the funeral home, said he expected another to take place
before the burial.

He said he had been contacted by lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who told
him that they wanted to have a second autopsy performed.

As of Saturday morning, Mr. Stefan said he had not found a cemetery that
would accept the body. He said he was seeking help from state and
federal authorities.

``If you don't want to bury the body, give me another option,'' Mr.
Stefan said with some frustration. ``What am I going to do?''

Mr. Stefan has been widely criticized for accepting Mr. Tsarnaev's body,
and on Saturday his funeral parlor was guarded by a police detail.

But the funeral home also received at least a dozen calls from
individuals wanting to make donations to assist with the burial, Mr.
Stefan said. The funeral home said individuals should instead donate to
the bombing's victims through the One Fund Boston.
