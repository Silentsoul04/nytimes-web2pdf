[Beyoncé](http://beyonce.com/) is flawless so no one else has to be.

That’s the theme of her superb fifth studio album, “Beyoncé” (Parkwood
Entertainment/Columbia), which arrives as a feat of both music and
promotion. Its songs are steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and
sultry vocals; every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable,
compassionate or pro-feminist. And with both the songs and the videos,
Beyoncé consolidates one of pop’s most finely balanced personas; she is,
at once, glamorous and down-home, carnal and sweet, “Queen Bey” and a
diligent trouper, polished and human. “Underneath the pretty face is
something complicated,” she sings in “No
Angel.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Beyoncé” suddenly appeared in the iTunes music store with no prior hype
— though plenty thereafter — at midnight Eastern time on Thursday.
That’s the latest iteration of a tactic already used this year by
David Bowie and My Bloody Valentine, who also released albums with no
announcement or buildup. Of course, Beyoncé one-upped them: “Beyoncé”
includes elaborate videos for every song, many of them made on location
— in France, Brazil, Australia — while the multitasking Beyoncé was
taking her “Mrs. Carter Show” tour around the world. (It returns to
Barclays Center on Dec. 19 and 22.)

She needed only an [Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/h2YFO6Pw1d/)
announcement to draw international attention, and the album immediately
went to No. 1 in 90 countries on iTunes’ rankings. It was no secret that
she had been working for a long time on the album, her first since “4,”
in 2011. And it arrives at nearly the last possible moment for the
lucrative Christmas season.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Beyoncé transformed a delay into a selling point. And by not
manufacturing discs until the album appeared online — they are promised
to retail stores before Christmas — her label avoided the leaks that
often occur during manufacturing and distribution. Neatly done.

In a year full of overblown marketing campaigns for albums that were
letdowns — among them, “Magna Carta ... Holy Grail,” by Beyoncé's
husband, Jay Z — “Beyoncé” should long outlast the initial stir. The
songs are alert to the current sound of clubs and radio, but not trapped
by it; the refrains are terse and direct, but what happens between them
isn’t formulaic. And while Beyoncé constructed the songs with a phalanx
of collaborators, they all know better than to eclipse her creamy,
soulful voice.

After the scattershot styles on “4,” Beyoncé has chosen to stick with
largely electronic R\&B. She worked with longtime hitmakers — Pharrell
Williams, Timbaland, The-Dream, Justin Timberlake — and relative
newcomers like Hit-Boy and Boots. Mostly, they supply her with means of
seduction: particularly in “Rocket,” an ultraslow tease that looks back
to Prince (by way of the Prince fans Miguel and Mr. Timberlake, who are
among the songwriters), as harmonies blossom all around Beyoncé's cooing
lead vocal.

The even more explicit “Partition,” savoring sex in a limo, has a sparse
synthesizer pulse and little swoops before a whispery chorus joins her.
“Superpower,” a vow of lasting “tough love” that’s a duet with Frank
Ocean, gives doo-wop a futuristic sheen, as her voice goes low and
smoky. Meanwhile, “Jealous” — about promises, suspicion and potential
revenge — turns into an accusatory anthem.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Beyoncé offers solidarity alongside romance. “Heaven” is a mourning
song with hymnlike piano, offering tearful comfort: “Heaven couldn’t
wait for you/So go on, go home”; it may be heard at funerals for years
to come. “Flawless,” with a staccato, trap-flavored track, mixes
growling celebrity autobiography — “I took some time to live my life/but
don’t think I’m just his little wife” — with a feminist speech from a
Nigerian author, [Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,](http://chimamanda.com/) and
a sisterly cheer, “I look so good tonight\!”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The album’s opener is “Pretty Hurts,” written with Sia Furler, which
denounces “plastic smiles” and warns, “It’s the soul that needs the
surgery.” Its video shows beauty pageant contestants in backstage
distress, and through the album, both video and audio snippets remind us
that Beyoncé has been a performer and contestant since childhood.

“Flawless” begins and ends with a televised talent contest lost by one
of Beyoncé's many youthful groups, Girls Tyme (raising the hindsight
question of where the winners are now). And while most of the videos
show Beyoncé in elaborate designer luxury with dancers and actors, she
also appears among ordinary people on Coney Island, in Brazil and at a
Houston roller disco.

The full album includes a video of “Grown Woman” — a song that appeared
earlier this year as a Pepsi commercial — that juxtaposes images of the
wealthy, grown-up Beyoncé, drink in hand, with grainy shots of her
youthful efforts as a performer: eager, smiling, diligent. Superstar and
striver, impossibly accomplished without forgetting a humble start,
Beyoncé has it both ways, and “Beyoncé” makes it believable.
