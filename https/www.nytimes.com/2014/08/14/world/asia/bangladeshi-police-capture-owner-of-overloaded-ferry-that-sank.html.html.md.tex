NEW DELHI --- The Bangladeshi police said on Wednesday that they had
arrested the owner of a ferry that capsized and sank this month, leaving
more than 100 people dead or missing.

After more than a week in hiding, Abu Bakar Siddique, the ferry owner,
was found by an elite police unit, known as the Rapid Action Battalion,
and charged with culpable homicide. The authorities have said that the
boat was carrying more than 250 people, about three times its legal
capacity of 85, before it sank on Aug. 4 in the Padma River.

Ferry accidents are common in Bangladesh, but arrests of ferry owners
are relatively rare. Mr. Siddique will be handed over to the local
police in the central district of Munshiganj, where the accident
occurred, a spokesman for the Rapid Action Battalion, Mufti Mahmud Khan,
said in a telephone interview.

``The ferry owner was found at his home in Chittagong,'' Mr. Khan said,
referring to a seaport nearby.

Only 46 bodies from the ferry have been found, and 61 people are still
listed as missing. The boat has not been located, and the search
operation has ended in part because of monsoon-related turbulence in the
Padma River, said Mohammad Saiful Hasan Badal, the top civil servant in
the Munshiganj district.

``Normally we find the ferry, but this is one such a rare incident that
we are not able to find the ferry,'' said Zakiur Rahman Bhuiyan, an
official with the Bangladesh Department of Shipping. Mr. Bhuiyan said
that this is probably the third time in the country's history that a
sunken ferry has not been located after an accident.
