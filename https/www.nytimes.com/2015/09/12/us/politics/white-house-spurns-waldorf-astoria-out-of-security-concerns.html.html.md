WASHINGTON — With Chinese spies rummaging through White House emails,
[President
Obama](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per "More articles about Barack Obama")
has decided not to risk making their spying any easier: He will break
with tradition and abandon the [Waldorf
Astoria](http://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/waldorf-astoria-new-york-NYCWAWA/index.html),
which was bought last year by Chinese investors with [deep
ties](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/chinese-return-to-the-waldorf-with-2-billion/)
to Beijing’s ruling elite, when he attends the United Nations General
Assembly next week.

Mr. Obama and other officials will instead take up residence a few
blocks away at the [Lotte New York
Palace](http://www.lottenypalace.com/?chebs=gl-thenewyorkpalace), whose
owners are South Korean. The White House and the State Department, while
vague about the reasons for the change, cited several factors, including
security concerns.

Why else “would you not stay at the Waldorf?” said a senior State
Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk
openly about the new arrangements. “Who would make that choice for any
other reason?”

The hotel’s owner, the [Anbang Insurance
Group,](http://fortune.com/2014/10/07/who-is-anbang-insurance-the-new-owner-of-new-yorks-waldorf-astoria/)
may not be a household name in China or the United States, but it is
highly connected in China. Its chairman is the husband of the
granddaughter of [Deng
Xiaoping](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/deng_xiaoping/index.html?8qa),
who was China’s leader from 1978 to 1992. Its board of directors
includes [Chen

Marshal Chen Yi, a revolutionary military commander who later served as
foreign minister.

Anbang’s deal to buy the hotel called for a major renovation, raising
concerns in Washington about whether it would remain a secure location
for official functions, despite the fact that its previous owner, Hilton
Worldwide, agreed to manage the hotel for the next 100 years.
Frustration has risen in Washington over [hacking attacks on government
databases](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/attack-gave-chinese-hackers-privileged-access-to-us-systems.html)
and email servers that officials have linked to China, including a
breach that exposed the personal data of millions of federal workers.

While officials have not specified what they fear could come of the
renovation, which has not yet begun, hotels have long represented a weak
link in security for traveling officials and others. When the president
stays in hotels, his security detail sets up a structure that a former
government official described as “something like a minisubmarine,” but
no setup can be entirely secure.

The Lotte New York Palace, like the Waldorf Astoria, is a luxury hotel
on the East Side of Manhattan, but the similarities end there.

For decades, the president and hundreds of other American officials have
descended on the Waldorf each September for the General Assembly,
securing whole floors for meetings. The Waldorf is among the world’s
best known hotels, and its guests regularly include celebrities and
world leaders. Every Chinese leader has stayed there since Mr. Deng
first visited the United States in 1974.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

An apartment on the 42nd floor of the hotel’s Waldorf Towers has served
as the official residence of the United States ambassador to the United
Nations for more than 50 years.

Apart from its guest register, the Waldorf is known for its lavish
décor. Its artwork, crystal chandeliers and gold doorknobs prompted
President Herbert Hoover to declare the Waldorf’s opening as “an event
in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City.”

That was in 1931, when the hotel was owned by the Astor family. It
eventually ended up in the hands of Hilton Worldwide, which last year
[sold it for $1.95 billion to
Anbang](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/nyregion/waldorf-astoria-hotel-to-be-sold-for-195-billion.html).

The State Department has not yet said whether it will renew its lease on
the ambassador’s residence, which expires this year.

But good enough for an ambassador does not necessarily mean the hotel is
up to presidential standards. When Mr. Obama and his family visited New
York in July, they stayed elsewhere.

“Obviously, there are a range of considerations that influence where the
president will stay when he’s not at the White House,” Josh Earnest, the
White House spokesman, told reporters on Friday. “Those considerations
include everything from available space to cost and to security.”

Pressed on whether the General Assembly decision was primarily driven by
security concerns, Mr. Earnest said: “At this point, I’m not at liberty
to detail the security considerations that may or may not have factored
into this particular decision.”
