WASHINGTON — Putting an end to more than a decade of strict federal
control of public education, [President
Obama](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per "More articles about Barack Obama")
on Thursday signed a sweeping rewrite of the [No Child Left Behind
act](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier "More articles about the No Child Left Behind Act.")
that returns power to states and local districts to determine how to
improve troubled schools.

The bill is a bipartisan measure that preserves federally mandated
standardized testing but eliminates the punitive consequences for states
and districts that perform poorly. The new version, renamed the Every
Student Succeeds Act, also bars the government from imposing academic
requirements like the Common Core.

“This bill makes long-overdue fixes to the last education law, replacing
the one-size-fits-all approach to reform with a commitment to provide
every student with a well-rounded education,” Mr. Obama said at a White
House signing ceremony for the law. “With this bill, we reaffirm that
fundamental American ideal that every child — regardless of race,
income, background, the ZIP code where they live — deserves the chance
to make out of their lives what they will.”

Embraced by an unusual coalition of Republican, Democrats, business
groups and teachers’ unions, the law was a curiosity in a capital more
often gripped lately by partisan gridlock. Mr. Obama referred to the
bipartisan bill-signing as “a Christmas miracle.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The law is the latest revision of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary
Education Act, which sets out the government’s role in schooling from
kindergarten to 12th grade. It was the product of lengthy negotiations
between Democrats and Republicans and a shared opposition to the
strictures in the No Child Left Behind law signed by George W. Bush 14
years ago — and to the Obama administration’s efforts to institute its
own performance incentives tied to teachers’ pay.

“The backlash to Washington trying to tell 100,000 schools too much
about what they should be doing,” said Senator Lamar Alexander,
Republican of Tennessee, an architect of the law, “caused people on both
the left and the right to remember that the path to higher standards and
better teaching and real accountability is community by community,
classroom by classroom, state by state, and not through the federal
government dictating the solution.”

“What we’ve learned from this is that a national school board doesn’t
work in the United States of America — we’re just too big and complex a
country,” added Mr. Alexander, who served as education secretary from
1991 to 1993. “We’ve settled the question of where the responsibility is
going to be, probably for the next 10 to 20 years.”

The new measure will maintain the mandatory standardized testing in
reading and math established by the Bush-era law, but leave it up to
state and local officials to set their own performance goals, rate
schools and determine how to fix those that fail to meet their
objectives.

It will remove a requirement that all children become proficient in
reading and math by a certain date.

States will still face some federal requirements for the schools that
struggle most, including the lowest-performing 5 percent of schools and
those where more than a third of high school students do not graduate on
time. Those schools will also be required to take steps to close gaps in
achievement and in graduation rates between poor and minority students
and other groups. But the federal government will not dictate how they
must do so.

The law explicitly prohibits the government from imposing academic
standards on states and from issuing waivers that are not authorized by
law. [Arne
Duncan](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/arne_duncan/index.html?inline=nyt-per "More articles about Arne Duncan."),
Mr. Obama’s outgoing education secretary, used such waivers to exempt
states from the most burdensome federal mandates if the states agreed to
establish their own rigorous academic standards.

Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers,
said the law marked “a new day in public education” that would bring
about “the most sweeping, positive changes to public education we’ve
seen in two decades.”

“It ensures that the federal government can no longer require these
tests as part of teacher evaluation,” she said. “And it makes public
education a joint responsibility.”

For some, the pendulum may have swung too far from a robust federal
role.

Civil rights groups are concerned that by restricting federal authority
to intervene in states and districts, Mr. Obama is surrendering what has
been a potent tool in decades past to rectify racial discrimination in
the nation’s schools.

“The whole purpose behind the original bill was to ensure that there
were consistent standards and federal oversight to make sure that states
and localities were doing the right thing by poor children, by children
who needed that assistance the most, and reducing that and granting so
much discretion to states is just worrisome,” said Leslie Proll, the
director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “Some states will do
the right thing, and that’s great, others may not, and therein lies the
problem.”

She said her group and other civil rights organizations would press Mr.
Obama to act swiftly during his final year in office to use whatever
federal authority was left to set education parameters for states.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Margaret Spellings, who served as Mr. Bush’s education secretary from
2005 to 2009, said she worried that in removing the consequences for
failing to meet a federal educational standard, the law would take the
pressure off states and districts to perform, especially for poor and
minority students.

“I’m disappointed that the law doesn’t have consequences except for the
bottom 5 percent,” Ms. Spellings said. “We are now in the era of local
control once again, and with that comes a lot of responsibility to work
with states and school districts to make sure that we close the
achievement gap.”

“I’m a little bit skeptical,” she added. “We’ve tried the local control
approach before, and we saw pretty pitiful results.”

The law falls short of some of Mr. Obama’s top priorities. It does not
include a major expansion of early childhood education, as the president
wanted. And it does not go as far as some Republicans wanted in
providing flexibility for states from federal oversight.

But it represents a compromise that neither side thought was
particularly likely just a year ago.

Mr. Alexander said he had recently told Mr. Duncan that when he
discussed the prospects with a Democratic colleague at the start of the
year, they thought the odds against enactment of an education rewrite
were 5 to 1. “Arne said, ‘I would have put it at 10 to 1,’ ” Mr.
Alexander said.
