[North Korea’s
claim](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-claim-reactions.html)
that it set off a hydrogen bomb on Wednesday — in what would be the
fourth time it has tested a nuclear weapon since 2006 — has stirred
concerns among governments around the world. Below is a brief primer on
some of the central issues at stake.

**Q.** *How is a hydrogen bomb different from an atomic bomb?*

**A.** A hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb, combines
hydrogen isotopes under extremely high temperatures to form helium, in a
process known as nuclear fusion. It is [more
powerful](http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/us-nuclear-weapons-policy/how-nuclear-weapons-work#.Vo0mr5OLRQN)
than a conventional atomic weapon: It uses the energy released from the
combination of two light atomic nuclei, while an atomic bomb uses the
energy released when a heavy atomic nucleus splits, a process known as
nuclear fission. American scientists developed the hydrogen bomb, which
was first tested in 1952.

Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are known to
possess thermonuclear weapons. Whether the four other countries known to
have atomic bombs — India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan — also have
hydrogen bombs is not certain.

**Q.** *What, precisely, did North Korea announce?*

**A.** The North’s government said that it had [detonated a hydrogen
bomb](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-test.html "Times article.")
— its first — at 10 a.m. on Wednesday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This test is a measure for self-defense the D.P.R.K. has taken to
firmly protect the sovereignty of the country and the vital right of the
nation from the ever-growing nuclear threat and blackmail by the
U.S.-led hostile forces and to reliably safeguard the peace on the
Korean Peninsula and regional security,” it said, referring to the
North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Q.** *How can North Korea’s claim be verified?*

**A.** The United States, South Korea and scientists doubt that the
claim is true.

The White House said that initial data from its monitoring stations in
Asia were “not consistent” with a test of a hydrogen bomb. When the
United States [detonated a hydrogen
bomb](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/science/comparisons-dont-support-north-koreas-claims-of-a-hydrogen-bomb-experts-say.html "Times article.")
deep beneath the Alaskan tundra in 1971, it set off a colossal upheaval
of rock and earth, a magnitude 6.8 seismic event. In contrast, South
Korea estimated that the bomb detonated on Wednesday was a magnitude 4.8
event — smaller even than the magnitude 4.9 reported after the North’s
last nuclear test, in 2013.

**Q.** *What if it was not a hydrogen bomb?*

**A.** When Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, announced in December that
his country had finally developed the technology to build a
thermonuclear weapon, experts were skeptical. Some said that North Korea
might be preparing to test a “boosted-fission weapon,” more powerful
than a traditional atomic bomb. Designers can easily increase the
destructive power of an atomic bomb by putting at its core a small
amount of tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen. The Yonhap News
Agency of South Korea reported that the government in Seoul was leaning
toward the theory of a boosted-fission weapon, “one level away from a
hydrogen bomb.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Q.** *How many times has North Korea detonated a nuclear weapon?*

**A.** This appears to be the fourth time. North Korea conducted
underground nuclear tests on [Oct. 9,
2006](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/world/asia/09korea.html "Times article.");
[May 25,
2009](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/world/asia/25nuke.html "Times article.");
and [Feb. 12,
2013](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html "Times article.").

**Q.** *What might North Korea be trying to accomplish with its
threats?*

**A.** In the past, United States administrations and South Korean
governments managed to tamp down periodic heightened tensions with North
Korea by offering concessions, including much-needed aid, in return for
the North’s promising to end its nuclear weapons programs. Many analysts
believe that North Korea is again seeking aid and other concessions,
while some suggest that it merely wants to be recognized as a nuclear
state, like
Pakistan.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still others suggest that the North genuinely fears an attack by the
United States or South Korea and views the warnings as deterrence.
Highlighting a perceived threat from abroad is also a favorite tool the
North Korean government uses to ensure internal cohesion in an
impoverished country that has experienced enormous privation, including
devastating famine and continuing pervasive hunger.

**Q.** *Could North Korea attack the United States?*

**A.** Maybe. In 2012, North Korea launched a rocket that put its first
satellite into orbit — raising the possibility of intercontinental
ballistic missiles that could reach North America. The United Nations
Security Council condemned the launching as a violation of several
Security Council resolutions and tightened sanctions against it.

**Q.** *How might the United States, China, Japan and South Korea
respond to a missile test or an attack?*

**A.** If a missile attack went into the water, even if it passed over
Japan, the two countries could ignore it. But if it headed for land, the
United States would probably use its missile interception technology,
including on Aegis-equipped ships off the Korean coast. If there were to
be a more direct attack, like the torpedo that sank a South Korean
warship in 2010, it is likely that both the United States and South
Korea would respond. China would be less likely to take action.

**Q.** *What was the global response to previous North Korean rocket
launchings?*

**A.** As the North’s missile technology has become more sophisticated,
the launching of longer-range missiles has evoked more international
concern.

In 1998, when the North launched a Taepodong that flew over Japan, Japan
temporarily cut off its contribution toward a North Korean energy
project. But in July 2006, when the North launched another long-range
missile, various countries began imposing sanctions, while the Security
Council began adding to economic
sanctions.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In April 2009, when the North’s efforts to launch a three-stage Unha-2
rocket failed, the Security Council said it would strengthen punitive
measures. It did so after the North conducted a nuclear test the next
month.

In April 2012, the United States canceled planned food aid when the
North tried to launch a more advanced missile, the Unha-3. That
launching failed, but another in December succeeded in lifting a small
satellite into orbit. The Security Council tightened sanctions yet
again. After the North’s nuclear test in February 2013, China, the
North’s longtime protector, participated in writing painful new
sanctions aimed at North Korean banking, trade and travel.

**Q.** *What is the Obama administration’s policy on North Korea?*

**A.** The Obama administration adopted a policy of “strategic patience”
in 2009, under which direct negotiations or offers of aid to Pyongyang
are withheld unless the North Korea leadership shows “positive,
constructive behavior” and willingness to negotiate over the dismantling
of its nuclear weapons program.

The policy is a response to the American belief that the United States
had unwisely offered aid, often in the wake of Pyongyang’s provocations,
or struck agreements with the North on which the North later reneged.
Strategic patience, in the words of Robert M. Gates, the former defense
secretary, grew out of a desire not “to buy the same horse twice.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Critics say that while the policy has allowed the United States to
weather multiple rounds of belligerence by Kim Jong-il and his son, Kim
Jong-un, without making concessions, it has done little to curb the
development of North Korea’s nuclear weapons
program.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Q.** *What sanctions are currently in place?*

**A.** The Security Council has passed four resolutions since 2006 aimed
at penalizing North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. In addition,
the United States, which remains in a technical state of war with North
Korea, has imposed its own regimen of strict economic sanctions. The
combined effects have severely squeezed, but not crippled, North Korea’s
economy. The United Nations has prohibited the North from conducting
nuclear tests or launching ballistic missiles, requested that it abandon
all future efforts to pursue nuclear weapons and urged it to return to
negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United
States, the so-called six-party talks.

The resolutions have also imposed embargoes on large-scale arms,
weapons-related research and development materials, and luxury goods;
banned many types of financial transactions including transfers of cash;
placed new restrictions on diplomats; and created monitoring mechanisms
for enforcement.

The [American
sanctions](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/nkorea.txt "Text of the sanctions.")
freeze all North Korean property interests in the United States, ban
most imports of goods and services from the North, and prohibit American
dealings with any names on a blacklist of North Korean businesses and
individuals suspected of illicit activities including money laundering,
counterfeiting, currency smuggling and narcotics trafficking.

Nothing in the American sanctions prohibits American travel to North
Korea or the export of food and other types of humanitarian aid,
although there are some restrictions.

The sanctions leave room for considerable trade in many types of goods
and services. China, which supplies much of North Korea’s basic needs,
is not in any violation of the United Nations
resolutions.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Q.** *How is the South Korean government responding to the North’s
threats?*

**A.** President Park Geun-hye, who took office in 2013, is the daughter
of a former president who ran South Korea as a dictator during the Cold
War. She once promised that if the North mounted a nuclear attack, its
government would be “erased from the earth.” She has largely held a firm
line on North Korea, after a more conciliatory stance in the 1990s.

From 1998 to 2008, the South pursued a “sunshine policy” of
reconciliation and economic cooperation that sent billions of dollars in
business investments, goods and humanitarian aid to the North. Ms.
Park’s immediate predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, said the North would need
to give up its nuclear weapons to receive any more aid. But he was
criticized for what many saw as a weak response after the North shelled
a South Korean island in 2010, killing four people.

**Q.** *Why hasn’t China stopped North Korea from its campaign of
threats? Is there any other country that has enough influence on North
Korea to stop it?*

**A.** China, the North’s patron, has long feared that a collapse of the
North Korean government could lead to a unified Korea allied with the
United States.

China helped write and backed the most recent round of United Nations
sanctions, but it has been loath to push the North too hard. Its
patience with the North may be running out, but even China may have only
limited information about the machinations within the Pyongyang
government.

**Q.** *Why are relations so bad between North and South Korea?*

**A.** After the United States and the Soviet Union divided the Korean
Peninsula at the end of World War II in 1945, they helped install rival
governments in Seoul and Pyongyang. Each asserted claims to the whole of
Korea. The two fought the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended not in a peace
treaty but a truce. Mutual mistrust runs deep, although there have been
intermittent attempts at political reconciliation and economic
cooperation.

**Q.** *How did the North get nuclear weapons?*

**A.** The project started under Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder and
the grandfather of the current leader. Mr. Kim knew that Gen. Douglas
MacArthur wanted Washington to allow the use of nuclear weapons against
Chinese and North Korean troops during the Korean War.

By the 1980s, American intelligence satellites were watching the nuclear
complex at Yongbyon come together. Relations between the United States
and the North grew especially tense over the issue in 1994, and some in
the White House feared a war could break out. A pact was eventually
hammered out that year, the Agreed Framework, but it fell apart in 2002,
during the George W. Bush administration, partly over allegations the
North was cheating on its agreements and developing another path to a
bomb. In 2006, the North conducted its first nuclear test, a partial
fizzle. But the subsequent tests were more successful.
