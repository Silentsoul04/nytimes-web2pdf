DAVOS, Switzerland — The Davos man who attends the World Economic Forum
here each year is a member of the global elite — say, a banker or a
politician — whose status is reinforced by an exclusive white badge that
gives him access to V.I.P. lounges away from the masses at this alpine
resort.

But this year, there is another kind of Davos man. He is a former
snowboarder and schoolteacher who now runs that country just north of
the United States.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, who is noticeable for the
entourage of young and old that seems to trail him wherever he goes, has
been bringing a message of optimism at a conference where attendees have
had a tendency to focus on grim subjects like war and conflict, stock
market turmoil, and economic strife.

It was the same message that Mr. Trudeau, 44 , took to the Canadian
electorate that voted him into office last year.

In Canada, he has captured the nation with a folksy appeal and
inspirational messages about the country and its role in the world. It
is an approach that has traveled far. He recently captured both
Canadians and Indians overseas when a video emerged of him dressed in a
white kurta-pyjama dancing to a Punjabi song.

This week, his speech here outlining Canada’s moment, saying there was
no better time than now for the world to “look to Canada,” is sure to
earn him points at home.

On Thursday, Mr. Trudeau talked to a small group of W.E.F. Global
Shapers, young people who have been singled out for the work they have
done in their communities as entrepreneurs or activists. The group
applauded Mr. Trudeau on his call for diversity and his treatment of
migrants. He has appointed a cabinet that is ethnically diverse with an
equal number of men and women and has welcomed Syrian refugees, calling
them the economic future of Canada.

One woman declared on Thursday, “You’ve done great things for the image
of Canada.”

The prime minister was at ease talking to a man from Jamaica about the
importance of renewable energy in the Caribbean and congratulating a
woman from Gaza who told her story of suffering.

Then, in a gesture nearly unheard-of in Davos, Mr. Trudeau stood up and
began to shake hands with each person in the room individually, until he
ran out of time. He stood for a giant selfie with the group and then
agreed to pose with many of the people individually, some of whom were
effusive in their gratitude to Mr. Trudeau.

The crowd was so taken with Mr. Trudeau that one young man from Nepal
likened him to President Obama, quickly adding that he was referring to
Mr. Obama’s early days as president.
