SEOUL, South Korea --- North Korea said on Thursday that it had
successfully tested a new rocket engine that would significantly bolster
its missile capabilities, and South Korea called on its people to
heighten vigilance against possible terrorist attacks by the North.

The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, recently watched as military engineers
conducted a ground test of the design, a solid-fuel rocket engine, the
state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.

Except for some of its short-range missiles and rockets, most of the
North's missiles, including
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/world/asia/north-korea-moves-up-rocket-launching-plan.html}{the
long-range booster rocket} used to launch a satellite into orbit last
month, are believed to rely on liquid fuel. The use of solid fuel
greatly shortens the time needed to prepare the launch of a missile as
well as increases the ground mobility of the missile system, which would
reduce the South's ability to detect signs of a pending attack, South
Korean defense officials said.

``The North's switching to solid rocket fuel means that it wants to have
a capability to launch a missile anytime it wants,'' said Moon
Sang-gyun, a spokesman for the South's Defense Ministry, calling the
development ``grave.''

``But we have anticipated this,'' he said, ``and we have been making
necessary preparations.''

North Korea's claim to have manufactured a solid-fuel engine was the
latest in a series of assertions and threats it has made about its
missile and nuclear weapons capabilities in recent weeks.

It has said that it has ``standardized'' miniaturized nuclear warheads
to be fitted on its missiles. It has also suggested that it has mastered
``re-entry'' technology needed for a warhead on an intercontinental
ballistic missile to survive crashing through the Earth's atmosphere
toward its target.

The North has also threatened to conduct another nuclear test and to
test ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. On
Wednesday, it cautioned that its rockets were ready to reduce the
Chongwadae, the office of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, to ``a
sea in flames and ashes.''

What the North called a ``crucial report'' on Wednesday also said that
its ``units behind enemy lines to be deployed in the operational theater
of the southern part of Korea are fully ready to start a storm
operation, lightning operation to conquer the Chongwadae and other major
targets.''

South Korea interpreted the warning as a threat of terrorist attacks.

``President Park called for a strengthened vigilance across the country
and asked the people to be especially vigilant for possible
emergencies,'' the chief presidential press secretary, Kim Sung-woo,
said on Thursday.

The South's military said that it had heightened security along the
border with North Korea since a January
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-test.html}{nuclear
test by the North}. The national police ordered its officers to increase
their preparedness, saying that public fear of possible terrorist
attacks had increased after the North's warnings and the bombings in
Brussels this week.

Ms. Park's cautionary statement came on the same day that South Korean
politicians started registering their candidacies for parliamentary
elections slated for April 13.

For weeks, the governing Saenuri Party, of which Ms. Park is a member,
has been shaken by internal disputes. Several lawmakers left the party
to run as independents. They claimed that they were unfairly denied
party nominations because of an attempt by Ms. Park to expand her
faction in the party with the elections in April.
