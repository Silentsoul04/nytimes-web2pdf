After a Chinese-led group
\href{http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160328005392/en/Starwood-Hotels-Resorts-Board-Directors-Determines-Revised}{raised
its bid} for Starwood Hotels to \$14 billion, the hotel chain's other
suitor must now decide whether it will prolong the bidding war.

For now, Marriott International is sticking to its \$13.5 billion offer,
the
\href{http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marriott-international-reaffirms-its-commitment-to-acquire-starwood-hotels--resorts-worldwide-says-its-signed-deal-provides-greater-long-term-value-for-starwood-stockholders-300241892.html}{company
said on Monday}, arguing that its proposal was solid while the competing
offer led by the Anbang Insurance Group of China may not be able to
close.

Starwood declared Monday that Anbang's latest offer was ``reasonably
likely to lead to a `superior offer,' '' paving the way for Starwood to
break its agreement with Marriott.

The bidding war --- the most prominent so far this year --- pits
Marriott, the nearly century-old hotelier, against Anbang, a
Beijing-based insurer that already owns the Waldorf Astoria and the JW
Marriott Essex House hotels in Manhattan.

Combining Marriott and Starwood would create the biggest hotel company
in the world, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels and 1.1
million rooms.

But Anbang has close ties to the Chinese government, potentially
furnishing the insurer with huge sums of cash.

So far, Anbang has proved willing to pay handsomely for Starwood, the
operator of the Westin and Sheraton chains. The latest offer from
Anbang, whose group also includes the American private equity firm J. C.
Flowers \& Company and the China-based Primavera Capital Group, amounts
to \$82.75 a share in cash. That's up 4 percent from the
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/business/dealbook/marriott-raises-bid-for-starwood.html}{sweetened
bid} that Marriott offered last week, which Starwood accepted.

In a statement, Starwood said that the Anbang group had offered \$81 a
share on Saturday, and then the current \$82.75 after talks between the
two sides began.

Both offers would supplement Starwood's plan to sell its time share
business to the Interval Leisure Group, an all-stock transaction that is
valued at about \$5.91 a share, based on Thursday's closing prices.

Analysts have said that Marriott will be hard-pressed to raise its offer
to win the battle, since raising the cash portion of its offer could
threaten its investment-grade rating. Adding more stock as consideration
could harm its earnings per share.

``We do not believe Marriott is willing to incur earnings dilution to
facilitate the transaction,'' analysts at Wells Fargo wrote in a
research note on Monday.

That has left Marriott raising concerns about the certainty of Anbang's
offer. In its statement on Monday, Marriott questioned whether the
Chinese insurer truly had the financing necessary to close that deal,
and how long American government regulators would drag out their
inquiries into the transaction.

Of particular concern, Marriott is likely to note, is how critically a
government panel focused on the national security aspect of mergers will
look at an Anbang-led takeover. Marriott could argue that the proximity
of Starwood properties near sensitive locations such as government
offices and military bases could force divestitures, pushing back the
closing of a deal.

Shares in Starwood were up more than 2 percent Monday afternoon, to
\$83.94, suggesting that investors expected further escalation. Shares
in Marriott were up 4 percent, to \$71.40.
