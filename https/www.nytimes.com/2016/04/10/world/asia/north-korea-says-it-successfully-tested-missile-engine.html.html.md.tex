North Korea said Saturday that it had successfully conducted a ground
test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile, which it
said would enable it to strike the United States mainland with a nuclear
warhead.

The North has repeatedly
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/world/asia/north-korea-propaganda-video-nuclear-strike.html}{threatened
nuclear strikes} against the United States, but it has never
flight-tested a long-range missile, and officials and analysts in the
region doubt that it has built a reliable intercontinental ballistic
missile, or ICBM. In recent weeks, however, North Korea has claimed a
series of successes in testing various technologies needed to make one.

It recently announced that it could now make nuclear warheads small
enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in
testing the re-entry technology that allows an ICBM to return to the
Earth's atmosphere without breaking up, as well as a
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/asia/north-korea-solid-fuel-rocket-engine.html}{solid-fuel
rocket engine}, which would allow for a shorter preparation time before
a launch.

A report on Saturday from the North's state-run Korean Central News
Agency said the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, had witnessed the engine
test. It quoted him as saying the North ``can tip new-type
intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads
and keep any cesspool of evils in the earth, including the U.S.
mainland, within our striking range.''

The report did not say when the test had occurred. It said the test had
been conducted at the Sohae Space Center near the country's western
border with China, the site from which the North
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/world/asia/north-korea-moves-up-rocket-launching-plan.html}{launched
a long-range rocket} in February.

It is unclear how far North Korea has advanced in its quest to build an
ICBM. It displayed what looked like ICBMs during recent military
parades, but analysts said they were probably mock-ups.

North Korea has vowed to expand its nuclear and missile programs,
despite tougher United Nations sanctions imposed last month as
punishment for the North's test of a nuclear device in January and the
launching of a long-range rocket the next month.
