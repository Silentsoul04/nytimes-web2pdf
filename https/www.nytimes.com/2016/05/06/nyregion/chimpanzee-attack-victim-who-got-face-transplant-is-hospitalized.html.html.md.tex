A woman who underwent a full-face transplant in 2011 after she was
mauled by a chimpanzee was back in the hospital on Wednesday after her
body began to reject the transplanted tissue in her face, doctors said.

Charla Nash, 62, was participating in a research study designed to
determine whether tissue transplant patients could be weaned off
traditional anti-rejection drugs when her immune system began to attack
her facial tissue, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said in a
\href{http://www.brighamandwomens.org/About_BWH/publicaffairs/news/facetransplant/facetransplantnash.aspx}{statement}.

Ms. Nash was in no danger of losing her face, however, Dr. Bohdan
Pomahac, the hospital's director of plastic surgery transplantation,
said in a statement. He said she was ``experiencing a moderate rejection
episode.''

``The viability of Charla's face transplant is not in jeopardy,'' he
said. ``Overall, she is doing well.''

Ms. Nash lost her hands, lips, nose and eyes when
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/world/americas/17iht-chimp.1.20241928.html}{she
was viciously attacked} by a friend's pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Conn.,
in 2009. The animal, a 14-year-old named Travis who was something of a
local celebrity, was shot and killed the day of the attack when he
opened the door of a police car and threatened
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/nyregion/25chimp.html}{an
officer} seated inside.

Ms. Nash received a full-face transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital
two years later. She got a new forehead, nasal structure, nose, lips,
nerves, facial skin and facial muscles. Her sight never returned.
Doctors also performed a double hand transplant but both hands ``failed
to thrive'' and were removed,
\href{http://www.brighamandwomens.org/About_BWH/publicaffairs/news/facetransplant/FactSheet_June2011.pdf}{the
hospital said}.

With Ms. Nash's body beginning to reject her face, Dr. Pomahac said she
would be removed from the research study.

``She has resumed her original medication, and will most likely leave
the hospital in the next day or two,'' he said. ``We expect this
rejection episode to be resolved within the coming week.''

In the
\href{http://www.brighamandwomens.org/About_BWH/publicaffairs/news/facetransplant/facetransplantnash.aspx}{statement}
released by the hospital, Ms. Nash said she never felt unwell and had
not realized that her body was rejecting the transplanted tissue.

``I appreciate everyone's concern,'' she said. ``I feel perfect. I
didn't even know I was having a rejection episode.''

Shelly Sindland, a spokeswoman for Ms. Nash, said the only sign of
trouble was a few ``red patches'' that a medical team observed on her
face. Her doctors then did a biopsy and discovered that her immune
system was attacking the transplanted tissue.

The drug study that Ms. Nash was participating in was funded by the
Defense Department to improve quality of life for service members who
return from war with serious injuries, Ms. Sindland said. In a
statement, Ms. Nash said she was disappointed to be leaving the study.

``I am proud of my contributions to date, and am hopeful that it will
help those wounded serving our country and others needing transplants in
the future,'' she said.

Ms. Sindland said Ms. Nash saw her participation in the study as a way
to celebrate the ``miracle'' of her survival after the chimpanzee
attack.

``She wants to make sure that it wasn't in vain and that her life stands
for something,'' Ms. Sindland said. ``That's why she wanted to
participate in this study.''
