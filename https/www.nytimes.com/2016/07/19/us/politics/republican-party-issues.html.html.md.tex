CLEVELAND --- \emph{Follow our latest Day 2 coverage of the}
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/us/politics/republican-national-convention.html}{\emph{Republican
National Convention}}\emph{.}

\_\_\_\_\_

The Republican Party on Monday adopted perhaps its most socially
conservative platform ever, one that offers a harsh portrayal of
homosexuality and a strong defense of the ``natural'' family unit. But
in other places it takes a less traditionally conservative approach,
such as a call for less rigid criminal statutes. It calls for a wall
along the southern border and for English to be designated the country's
official language. It advocates opening up more public land to energy
exploration. And it urges Congress to impeach more judges.

Here are some excerpts:

\textbf{On Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage}

``Five unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their
legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of
one man and one woman. The Court twisted the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment beyond recognition. To echo Scalia, we dissent. We, therefore,
support the appointment of justices and judges who respect the
constitutional limits on their power and respect the authority of the
states to decide such fundamental social questions.''

\textbf{On Judges and the Supreme Court}

``We encourage Congress to use the check of impeachment for judges who
unconstitutionally usurp Article 1 powers. In tandem with a Republican
Senate, a new Republican president will restore to the {[}Supreme{]}
Court a strong conservative majority that will follow the text and
original meaning of the Constitution and our laws.''

``Only such appointments will enable courts to begin to reverse the long
line of activist decisions --- including Roe, Obergefell, and the
Obamacare cases\ldots{}''

\subsection{Republican Convention Day 1:
Analysis}\label{republican-convention-day-1-analysis}}

Times journalists provided live analysis of the first night of the
Republican National Convention as Donald J. Trump aims to unify the
party.

\textbf{On Religious Expression in Public Life}

``We support the public display of the Ten Commandments as a reflection
of our history and our country's Judeo-Christian heritage and further
affirm the rights of religious students to engage in voluntary prayer at
public school events and to have equal access to school facilities.''

''We oppose government discrimination against businesses or entities
which decline to sell items or services to individuals for activities
that go against their religious views about such activities.''

\textbf{On Traditional vs. Modern Families}

``The data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion: Every child
deserves a married mom and dad. The reality remains that millions of
American families do not have the advantages that come with that
structure. We honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens
of parenting alone and embrace the principle that all Americans should
be treated with dignity and respect. But respect is not enough. Our laws
and our government's regulations should recognize marriage as the union
of one man and one woman.''

\textbf{On `Therapy' for Gay Minors}

``We support the right of parents to determine the proper medical
treatment and therapy for their minor children.''

\textbf{On Transgender Rights and Title IX}

``That same provision of law is now being used by bureaucrats --- and by
the current President of the United States --- to impose a social and
cultural revolution upon the American people by wrongly redefining sex
discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories.''

``Their edict to the states concerning restrooms, locker rooms, and
other facilities is at once illegal, dangerous, and ignores privacy
issues.''

\textbf{On Energy Development}

``The Democratic Party does not understand that coal is an abundant,
clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource. Those who mine it
and their families should be protected from the Democratic Party's
radical anti-coal agenda.''

\textbf{On Immigration}

``We support building a wall along our southern border and protecting
all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the
southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and
pedestrian traffic.''

\textbf{On Criminal Justice Reform}

``In the past, judicial discretion about sentences led to serious
mistakes concerning dangerous criminals. Mandatory minimum sentencing
became an important tool for keeping them off the streets. Modifications
to it should be targeted toward particular categories, especially
nonviolent offenders and persons with drug, alcohol, or mental health
issues, and should require disclosure by the courts of any judicial
departure from the state's sentencing requirements.''
