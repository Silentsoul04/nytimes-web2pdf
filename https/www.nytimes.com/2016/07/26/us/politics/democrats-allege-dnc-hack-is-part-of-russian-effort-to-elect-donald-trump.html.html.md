PHILADELPHIA — Cold War-era intrigue permeated the 93-degree heat in
Philadelphia on Monday, as Democrats sought to spread the idea that the
release of thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National
Committee is part of [a Russian
effort](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-emails.html)
to help elect Donald J. Trump.

“I do know this: that the Russians did the D.N.C. hack,” Representative
Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, told reporters.

She said she had learned of Russian involvement not through intelligence
briefings, but through other means.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The hacking embarrassed party officials by showing that they seemed to
favor Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary, when
they were supposed to be neutral.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Pelosi, asked whether she thought Mr. Trump played any role in the
hack or release of the 20,000 emails, said, “I have no reason to think
that.”

Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manger, Robby Mook, tried to deflect attention
from the content of the emails, which led to the resignation of the
party’s chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and keep it on the
Russians.

“There have been larger forces at work to hurt Hillary Clinton,” Mr.
Mook said Monday, calling the hacking an attempt to undermine her
campaign.

Saying he would leave the details of the hacking to intelligence
experts, Mr. Mook added, “It was the Russians who perpetrated this leak
for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Proving a cyberattack is difficult, but researchers have said the
D.N.C.’s server had been breached by Russian intelligence agencies,
which had also targeted the White House and the State Department.

But the Russian-intervention narrative fits with Mrs. Clinton’s efforts
to establish the idea that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wants
to see Mr. Trump elected to weaken America and hurt its closest NATO
allies. Mr. Trump has suggested [he would not automatically
defend](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/politics/donald-trump-issues.html)
NATO allies if they were attacked.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Putin, and throughout her campaign Mrs.
Clinton has tried to tie Mr. Trump to to the Russian leader, with whom
she clashed as secretary of state.

“He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our
friends,” Mrs. Clinton said last month.

“I don’t understand Donald’s bizarre fascination with dictators and
strongmen who have no love for America,” she once said.

“Putin will eat your lunch,” she said in a speech aimed at Mr. Trump.

And if Mr. Trump were elected president, she has said, it would be like
“Christmas in the Kremlin.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Twitter Monday morning, Mr. Trump dismissed the idea that the
Russians were behind the hack and said the Clinton camp had spread the
idea to distract from its own convention drama.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But later Monday, while speaking in Roanoke, Va., Mr. Trump at least
seemed to accept that the Russians might have been involved. Speaking of
Ms. Wasserman Schultz, he said: “She worked very, very hard to rig the
system. Little did she know China, Russia, one of our many, many
friends, came in and hacked the hell out of us.”
