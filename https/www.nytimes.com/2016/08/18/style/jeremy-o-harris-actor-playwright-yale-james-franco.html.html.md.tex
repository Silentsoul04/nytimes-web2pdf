\textbf{Age} 27

\textbf{Hometown} As a military brat, he moved from place to place
before settling in Martinsville, Va.

\textbf{Now Lives} He ``floats'' between a five-bedroom house in the
Highland Park section of Los Angeles, and a three-bedroom apartment in
Washington Heights that he shares with the playwright Claire Kiechel.

\textbf{Claim to Fame} \href{http://www.jeremyoharris.com/}{Mr. Harris}
is an actor and playwright most comfortable off script, starring in
largely improvised scenes in a short film directed by James Franco for
his ``Rebel'' art
\href{http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/14/entertainment/la-et-franco-rebel-20120512}{exhibit}ion
at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and ``Weightless,'' an
upcoming movie from Terrence Malick. He also created
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIY-kLF1ngqHzUCeryOrFWg}{\#Nightstrife},''
a satirical docu-series on YouTube that tackles the job plight of black
comedians in the entertainment industry.

\textbf{Big Break} The same week he dropped out of the Theater School at
DePaul University in Chicago in 2009, Mr. Harris delivered a ``really
bad headshot my friend had taken on a cellphone'' to Erica Daniels, then
a casting director at the
\href{https://www.steppenwolf.org/}{Steppenwolf Theater Company}. The
gambit worked. Mrs. Daniels recommended him for a role in ``Jon,'' a
reworking of a George Saunders short story that later won a Jeff Award,
Chicago's top theater honor. ``At a time I thought I couldn't act,'' he
said. Seth Bockley, who directed the play, ``told me I was the most
centered actor he had ever seen,'' Mr. Harris said.

\textbf{Latest Project} A reading of ``Daddy,'' a play Mr. Harris wrote
about ``a May to December romance between a young black artist and an
older European art collector,'' was recently performed at the
\href{http://www.radiohole.com/hole.html}{Collapsable Hole}, a
performance space in the West Village. He is also collaborating on an
update of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' to be staged on Governors Island
this fall.

\textbf{Next Thing} ``Daddy'' also was the writing sample for his
application to the Yale School of Drama graduate playwriting program,
which he will attend this fall. ``I don't have the résumé I should have,
but I'm asking big questions about theater and what its function is,''
he said.

\textbf{Yes to the Dress} At 6-foot-5 and 160 pounds, Mr. Harris isn't
afraid of experimenting with his physical appearance. He once grew out
his hair to create a singular long dreadlock. And he'll wear the
occasional dress in the name of fashion. ``It never looks unmasculine on
me for some reason,'' he said. ``In general, I tend to just go with
what's offered to me in the world.''
