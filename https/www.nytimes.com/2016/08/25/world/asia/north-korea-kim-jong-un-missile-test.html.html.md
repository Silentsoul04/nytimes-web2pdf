SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his
country’s test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile this week had
achieved the “greatest success.”

He claimed that the continental United States, as well as American
military bases in the Pacific, were now within the striking range of his
missiles, according to the North’s state media on Thursday.

Analysts and defense officials in the region said that North Korea was
still years away from achieving the capability Mr. Kim claimed. The
country still does not have submarines large and advanced enough to
travel long distances without detection to attack distant targets across
the Pacific, they
said.

## North Korea, Always Quotable: 9 Memorable Statements From Kim Jong-un’s Reign

North Korea makes few goods that the rest of the world wants, but it
does specialize in exporting bombastic, bellicose pronouncements.

Nevertheless, the North’s test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile
on Wednesday alarmed leaders of the region, as it demonstrated the
advances the secretive country has made in its efforts to significantly
enhance the range and stealth of its missiles.

The Pukguksong, or Polaris, missile flew 310 miles toward Japan on
Wednesday. When the North first tested it in May last year, the
projectile exploded midair shortly after being ejected from under the
water.

Mr. Kim, who supervised the launching on Wednesday, “appreciated the
test-fire as the greatest success and victory,” the North’s official
Korean Central News Agency said Thursday. It quoted Mr. Kim as saying
that “the U.S. mainland and the operational theater in the Pacific are
now within the striking range of the Korean People’s Army.”

The news agency also said that North Korea launched its missile at a
“high angle” from the maximum launching depth, indicating that it
could have flown more than 310 miles if it had launched it at a normal
angle. South Korean defense officials told reporters that the North
appeared to have launched the missile at a sharp angle to keep it from
landing too close to Japan.

Mr. Kim claimed that the test on Wednesday showed that his country now
had “all substantial means capable of standing up against the U.S.
nuclear hegemony.” He urged his engineers to step up efforts to mount
nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles and develop the means of their
delivery.

During a visit to a front-line military unit on Wednesday, President
Park Geun-hye of South Korea said the North’s “irrational
decision-making system” and Mr. Kim’s “unpredictable character” made the
North’s nuclear and missile threats more dangerous.

Submarine-launched missile technology would extend the reach of North
Korean nuclear missiles and improve the country’s “second-strike”
capability to retaliate if its land-based launching sites were taken
out.

But even if the North has been testing such missiles, it still needs to
build a large, stealthy and long-range submarine to deploy them, South
Korean defense officials said.

North Korea has an outdated fleet of 70 submarines, most of them
minivessels unfit for operations beyond littoral waters, they said. Its
largest submarines at the moment are copies of the Soviet-era Romeo
class. The South Korean military has been monitoring a North Korean
effort to build a modified Sinpo class submarine, which it has also used
for its recent missile tests.

Even this new design with diesel engines would not be enough to make a
round trip across the Pacific without surfacing and exposing itself for
detection, the officials said. But it still could pose a serious threat
to South Korea, Japan and American military bases in the region, they
said.
