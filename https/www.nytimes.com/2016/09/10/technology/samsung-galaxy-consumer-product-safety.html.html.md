WASHINGTON — The fallout over the potential for Samsung Galaxy Note 7
smartphones to catch fire is intensifying.

On Friday, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission urged
owners of the smartphone to power down their Galaxy Note 7 devices and
stop using them altogether.

“C.P.S.C. and Samsung are working cooperatively to formally announce an
official recall of the devices as soon as possible,” the agency said in
a statement. “C.P.S.C. is working quickly to determine whether a
replacement Galaxy Note 7 is an acceptable remedy for Samsung or their
phone carriers to provide to consumers.”

The C.P.S.C. is the main consumer product safety agency in the United
States, with broad oversight over toys, tractors, appliances and
electronics. This year, the C.P.S.C. recalled hoverboards that contained
lithium-ion batteries; those batteries exploded or caught fire in dozens
of cases.

The commission’s statement is the latest blow to Samsung and the Galaxy
Note 7, which became available only two weeks ago. This month, [Samsung
said it would recall 2.5
million](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/business/samsung-galaxy-note-battery.html)
of the devices because of an issue with the lithium-ion batteries in the
phones, which can catch fire and explode. The problem had affected 35
devices globally as of last week.

[Samsung
said](https://news.samsung.com/global/statement-on-galaxy-note7) it was
voluntarily recalling the phones and “conducting a thorough inspection
with our suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the
market.”

Air safety regulators worldwide have since advised passengers not to
charge or turn on the smartphones inside an aircraft. Three Australian
airlines [have banned
them](http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/09/08/technology/08reuters-airlines-samsung.html "Reuters article").
On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration also said it “strongly”
advised passengers onboard planes [not to use the Galaxy Note
7](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/business/faa-strongly-advises-against-using-samsung-galaxy-note-7-on-planes.html "New York Times article").

In a statement on Friday, Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics
America said, “We are asking users to power down their Galaxy Note 7s
and exchange them now.”

The recall comes at a tricky time for Samsung. The Galaxy is one of the
South Korean company’s most visible consumer product lines, and its
smartphones compete with the Apple iPhone for pre-eminence with
consumers. This week, [Apple unveiled its newest
smartphones](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/technology/iphone-7-apple-headphone-jack.html?ref=technology),
the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which will ship later this month.

It was unclear if Samsung would provide refunds for Galaxy Note 7
customers who did not want a replacement provided by the company. All
four major wireless carriers in the United States — Verizon, AT\&T,
T-Mobile and Sprint — have halted sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and have
been given instructions to help owners make an exchange, Samsung said.

While the recall of the Galaxy Note 7 is Samsung’s largest voluntary
recall, it is not the biggest on record. In 2007, Nokia announced a
recall of 46 million cellphone batteries. In 2006, Dell recalled 4.1
million lithium-ion batteries for notebook computers.

Maria Rerecich, director of electronics testing for Consumer Reports,
said the number of people affected by Samsung’s recall was small but
showed “a serious potential safety hazard.”
