SEOUL, South Korea --- North Korea said Tuesday that it had conducted
the ground test of a new long-range rocket engine used to put a
satellite into orbit, an effort long considered by Washington and the
United Nations Security Council to be a cover for developing an
intercontinental ballistic missile.

The announcement followed the North's
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html}{nuclear
test} on Sept. 9. The United States and its allies are calling for the
Security Council to adopt a new resolution to enforce tougher sanctions
to punish the North for the latest nuclear test, its fifth since 2006.

In the past, such sanctions have usually prompted the North to respond
with provocations, like another nuclear test or a rocket launch to place
a satellite into orbit.

North Korea last launched a carrier rocket in February, a month after
its fourth nuclear test, to place its Kwangmyongsong, or Shining Star,
satellite into orbit. (The country also launched a rudimentary satellite
in 2012.)

Analysts have said the North may launch another satellite in time for
the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party, using that as a
signal to the outside world that it was pushing ahead with its
long-range missile program despite sanctions. At home, such a launch is
used to boost Kim Jong-un's leadership.

On Tuesday, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Mr. Kim
visited the Sohae Space Center, the North's main satellite launch site
near its northwestern border with China, to observe the engine test. He
ordered officials there to finish preparations for another satellite
launch ``as soon as possible'' to glorify the North Korean people who he
said ``have fastened their belts owing to the enemies' harsh
sanctions,'' the agency said.

The news agency did not say when the single-engine test took place.

``The test was aimed to make a final confirmation of the feature of
combustion chamber, operation accuracy of valves and control systems and
structural reliability of the engine during 200 second-long working
time,'' it said, calling the test a success. It said the successful test
of the engine will enable the country to launch ``various kinds of
satellites including earth observation satellite at a world level.''

After the North's latest nuclear test and a series of ballistic missile
tests in recent months, its claim that it has acquired the ability to
mount short- and midrange missiles with nuclear warheads has been taken
more seriously by United States and South Korean officials. But they
said the country was still years from being able to build a nuclear
tipped long-range missile, although it habitually threatens to attack
the mainland United States with nuclear missiles.

After the satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials
said that the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully
reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7,400 miles with a
warhead of 1,100 to 1,300 pounds --- far enough to reach the West Coast
of the United States.

Mr. Kim has called for his country to develop and launch ``a variety of
more working satellites'' using ``carrier rockets of bigger capacity.''
The country has also renovated and expanded the gantry tower and other
facilities at the launch site to accommodate more powerful rockets.

In an analysis posted on the website \href{http://38north.org/}{38
North}, Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. and Jack Liu said that the engine test
represented an ``anticipated and significant step in the continued
development of larger, more advanced space launch vehicles'' by the
North.

In January, while announcing sanctions imposed on 11 individuals and
entities involved in Iran's ballistic missile program, the United States
Treasury included three Iranian officials it said have worked with North
Korea on its missile and space programs, including the development of
``an 80-ton rocket booster.''
