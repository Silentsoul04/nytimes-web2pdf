SEOUL, South Korea ---
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/north-korea?8qa}{North
Korea} launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Thursday, but
the test ended in failure, the United States military said. It was the
North's
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/world/asia/north-korean-missile-test.html}{second
failed attempt}to flight-test that type of missile in five days.

The \href{https://www.stratcom.mil/}{United States Strategic Command}
detected the failed North Korean missile launch at 6:30 a.m. on
Thursday, Pyongyang time, the command said in a news release. The test,
which took place near the northwestern city of Kusong, involved the
North's Hwasong-10 missile, known to the outside world as the Musudan.

The launch did not pose a threat to North America, the news release
said. It gave no further details about the failed attempt.

North Korea has had a spotty record in test-launching the Musudan, the
longest-range ballistic missile it has deployed. In seven previous
tests, the projectiles often exploded or crashed into the sea shortly
after launch, South Korean and United States officials have said.

In the last test of the Musudan, which took place near Kusong on
Saturday, the missile also exploded shortly after takeoff, according to
the South Korean military.

North Korea successfully launched the Musudan in June after five
consecutive failures. But the recent failures indicated that the North
has yet to perfect the missile. With a range of more than 2,000 miles,
it is the North's only deployed missile with a range sufficient to reach
American military bases in Guam in the Pacific, and in South Korea and
Japan.
