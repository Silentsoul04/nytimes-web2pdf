The chief executive of
\href{http://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/hhc/html/home/home.shtml}{NYC
Health \& Hospitals}, which runs New York City's public hospitals, is
stepping down from his post atop the nation's largest municipal health
care system, a move that City Hall officials described on Monday as
voluntary and expected.

The departure of the executive, Dr. Ramanathan Raju, comes several
months after Mayor Bill de Blasio
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/nyregion/de-blasio-to-propose-2-billion-for-new-york-citys-hospital-system.html}{announced
his plan} to overhaul the hospital system, which faces a staggering
shortfall of cash for the operations of 11 hospitals across the city,
including the flagship Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan and
Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens.

Appointed by Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, in the first weeks of his
administration in 2014, Dr. Raju told City Hall officials in September
that he wanted to resign, according to a spokeswoman for the mayor. A
person familiar with Dr. Raju's thinking said the recent death of his
mother precipitated his departure, which is effective at the end of the
month.

``He felt in many ways that he had done as much as he could,'' said the
person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private
conversations. ``His mother had always lived with him. He wanted to go
to India and do all of the rituals.''

Dr. Raju will be departing the agency as it faces fiscal challenges that
the city's Independent Budget Office has called the

in memory}. Shortfalls prompted the city to infuse an additional \$500
million into Health \& Hospitals, formerly known as the Health and
Hospitals Corporation, which has a budget of roughly \$7 billion. The
city's annual contribution is expected to top \$2 billion until at least
2020 as state and federal funding has declined. People without health
insurance make up a significant number of those who use the system.

``The city administration really has nothing to do with the funding
issues,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the trade group Greater
New York Hospital Association. ``The transformation of the health care
system is not limited to H.\&H. It's across the United States.''

The city also
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/nyregion/report-details-failings-of-corizon-rikers-island-health-provider.html}{took
over health care services} at the Rikers Island jail complex last year,
adding new complexity to the task of reforming the system.

``I think Ram Raju over the last almost three years really did great
work to start fixing Health and Hospitals Corporation,'' Mr. de Blasio
said during his weekly interview on the local news channel NY1. ``It's
going to need a lot of work.''

His departure was
\href{http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/head-nyc-cash-bleeding-public-hospital-system-step-article-1.2862844}{reported
by The Daily News}.

Stanley Brezenoff, who ran the Health and Hospitals Corporation in the
1980s, is set to take over from Dr. Raju until a permanent replacement
is named. Mr. Brezenoff, 78, a
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/04/nyregion/man-in-the-news-a-public-official-who-garners-superlatives-stanley-brezenoff.html}{veteran
of city politics and health care} who served as first deputy mayor to
Mayor Edward I. Koch, has experience with turning around medical
institutions, notably at Maimonides Medical Center, which struggled
financially before his arrival there in 1995.

``He's a really good strategist and knows how to make a plan,'' said
Pamela Brier, who worked with Mr. Brezenoff at Maimonides and succeeded
him as chief executive. Ms. Brier is now on a panel of health care
experts advising the de Blasio administration on Health \& Hospitals.

Mr. Brezenoff faced another challenge at Long Island College Hospital,
which he ran as the chief executive officer and president of Continuum
Health Partners until the hospital was taken over by the state. Mr. de
Blasio, as a candidate for mayor, resisted its closing and then fought
to preserve some health care there once in office.

The former site of the hospital in Brooklyn Heights is now on a path to
be developed
