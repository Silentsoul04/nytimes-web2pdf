## Trump and Putin talk, officially.

They were accused by detractors of being bosom buddies, in cahoots over
underhanded efforts to rig the American election — accusations candidate
Trump denied. Now, President-elect Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin
of Russia have spoken.

[The Kremlin released a
readout](http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/53255) Monday of the
first call between Mr. Putin and the president-elect since he won the
election, saying the men expressed mutual optimism about improving the
dire state of relations between the two countries.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said he hoped to work with Mr. Trump
in an atmosphere of mutual respect without interfering in each other’s
internal affairs. They also talked about fighting international
terrorism and settling the crisis in Syria.

The Trump transition team reported that “President-elect Trump noted to
President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong
and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.”

While Mr. Trump said he hoped to have a constructive relationship with
Russia, he insisted during one of his debates with Hillary Clinton that
he was “no puppet” of Mr. Putin.

## A justice speaks.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who [once
called](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/12/politics/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump-faker/)
Mr. Trump a “faker” who “has no consistency about him,” said on Monday
what she likely wanted to avoid: Mr. Trump will make the Supreme Court
whole again.

“Most immediately our vacancy will be filled,” she told a meeting of the
Jewish Federations of North America at a Washington hotel. “President
Trump will fill it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She urged the Senate to act promptly on the president-elect’s nomination
to fill the vacancy created by the [death of Justice Antonin
Scalia](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/antonin-scalia-death.html).
“Eight is not a good number,” she said. At full strength, the court has
nine
members.

At a [news<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>conference on
Monday](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/us/politics/barack-obama-trump.html)
before an overseas trip, the president struck a diplomatic tone.

• On Stephen K. Bannon’s appointment as chief White House strategist,
which civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans have
criticized, President Obama demurred, saying, “It would not be
appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the
president-elect starts making.”

• Faced with repeated questions about Mr. Trump’s temperament, Mr. Obama
expressed hope that the presidency would be a reality check. “His gifts
that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest upsets in
political history, hopefully he will put to good use,” Mr. Obama said.

• On his Democratic Party, Mr. Obama said that a period of reflection
was healthy, that new voices were necessary and that the stunning defeat
should be a warning. “It takes a while for people to reconcile
themselves with that new reality,” he said. “Hopefully it’s a reminder
that elections matter.”

• On immigration, Mr. Obama urged Mr. Trump to “think long and hard”
about endangering the status of young immigrants who were brought to the
country illegally as children. He described them as “American kids.”

## Hate crimes surge, led by attacks on Muslims.

The F.B.I. reported Monday that attacks against American Muslims rose
last year, driving an increase of about 7 percent in hate crimes against
all victims.

The data, the most comprehensive look at threat crimes nationwide,
expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors, who
have noted an alarming rise in some types of hate crimes tied to the
intense vitriol of the presidential campaign and the aftermath of terror
attacks at home and abroad since 2015.

A wave of racially charged assaults, graffiti attacks and other episodes
[has swept the country since Election
Day](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/us/reports-of-bias-based-attacks-tick-upward-after-election.html?_r=1),
prompting Mr. Trump to call for a halt to it during a “60 Minutes”
interview broadcast on Sunday night.

In its report Monday, the F.B.I. cataloged a total of 5,818 hate crimes
in 2015 — a rise of nearly 340 over the year before — including
assaults, bombings, threats and property destruction against minorities,
women, gays and others.

Attacks against Muslim Americans saw the biggest surge: 257 reports of
assaults, attacks on mosques and other types hate crimes against Muslims
last year, a jump of about 67 percent over the year before. It was the
highest total since 2001, when the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks saw
more than 480 attacks.

Attacks against transgender people also sharply increased, the data
showed.

Law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an
incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty
record of reporting hate crimes, 26 years after Congress directed the
Justice Department to begin collecting the data.

“We need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to
fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop
it,” James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said Monday.

## File under: Oh, to be a fly on the wall, Trump and Xi.

Mr. Trump [has spoken
with](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/world/asia/trump-china-xi-jinping.html)
President Xi Jinping of China, the presidential transition team
announced on Monday, and the world likely thought, “Interesting.”

According to the announcement, in a call that took place on Monday
Beijing time, Mr. Xi congratulated Mr. Trump for “winning a historic
election,” and the president-elect thanked the Chinese leader for his
well wishes.

“During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual
respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he
believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships
for both countries moving forward,” the statement said.

No mention of whether Mr. Trump’s repeated campaign threats against
Chinese trade practices came up, nor his statement that climate change
was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese, nor his get-tough promises on
economic relations moving
forward.

## Bernie Sanders speaks out.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who mobilized a movement but not
enough votes to win the Democratic presidential nomination, is stepping
forward as an alternative to the party’s leadership and a stalwart
against racial politics.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

He added, “The Democratic Party has to stand with working people, feel
their pain and take on the billionaire class, Wall Street and drug
companies.

But he also said that the new role of Mr. Bannon in the Trump White
House as senior counselor and chief strategist should make the country
“very nervous.” The country has battled “discrimination and racism and
sexism and homophobia” for hundreds of years, he said in an interview on
[ABC’s “The View”
program](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekABC/status/798203534445424641) on
Monday, and the country could not afford to move backward.

“We’re going to tell Mr. Bannon and any other advisers that we’re not
going to be turning on each other,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re going to be
standing together.”

In concert, liberal [activists staged a
sit-in](https://www.periscope.tv/w/1MYGNOqNzPXJw) in the office of
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic minority
leader, to demand a leadership position in the next Senate for Mr.
Sanders.

## Fringe broadcast host says Trump offered thanks.

[Alex Jones, an online broadcast
host](http://www.infowars.com/watch-alex-jones-show/) who has accused
the government of grand-scale conspiracies, says that President-elect
Trump personally called him to thank him for his support during the
campaign.

Mr. Jones made the revelation on a brief clip on his website.

“He said, ‘Listen Alex, I just talked to the kings and the queens of the
world,’” Mr. Jones recalled, saying that Mr. Trump added, “I want to
thank you, your audience.”

He said the incoming president promised to come on his program again in
the next few weeks. He celebrated that Mr. Trump had triumphed over
“hoaxes” such as Obamacare.

Mr. Jones was an early booster of Mr. Trump, who appeared on his program
during the end of the primaries. Mr. Jones has charged, among other
things, that the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in December
2012 was a
hoax.
