Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is planning to
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/asia/japan-donald-trump-shinzo-abe.html}{sit
down with Donald J. Trump} in New York on Thursday, in what would be the
president-elect's first meeting with a foreign leader since his
election.

\hypertarget{why-are-they-meeting}{%
\subsection{Why are they meeting?}\label{why-are-they-meeting}}

Mr. Abe wants to find out how serious Mr. Trump was during his campaign
when he repeatedly criticized Japan on trade issues and for not paying
more of the cost of its own defense.

And since the Japanese establishment was expecting Hillary Clinton to
win the presidency, Mr. Abe wants to assure Mr. Trump that he is willing
and eager to work with him.

\hypertarget{what-is-mr-abe-most-worried-about}{%
\subsection{What is Mr. Abe most worried
about?}\label{what-is-mr-abe-most-worried-about}}

The prime minister is concerned about Mr. Trump's commitment to
protecting Japan.

The United States is Japan's most important ally, and is legally
obligated to defend it against attack. There are around 50,000 American
troops stationed in Japan, a powerful deterrent against the rising
threat of North Korea, and an increasingly assertive China.

During the campaign, President-elect Trump suggested he might withdraw
American troops.

\hypertarget{as-president-could-he-do-that}{%
\subsection{As president, could he do
that?}\label{as-president-could-he-do-that}}

Not without resistance from members of Congress, officials at the State
Department, diplomats and military advisers. The United States-Japan
alliance has been in place since the end of World War II, and has a lot
of backing on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.

\hypertarget{can-japan-pay-the-united-states-more-for-defense}{%
\subsection{Can Japan pay the United States more for
defense?}\label{can-japan-pay-the-united-states-more-for-defense}}

Maybe. There are signs that Japan might be willing to pay or do more,
but many experts contend American troops are not only defending Japan
but the United States' own interests in Asia.

The Pentagon is budgeted to spend about \$5.5 billion to support troops
and bases on Okinawa and elsewhere around Japan this year. Japan is set
to spend \$1.8 billion to support the bases, in addition to at least \$4
billion on related expenses, including compensation for the communities
that host the bases and funds for relocating American troops.

Under its Constitution, which was written by American occupying forces
after World War II, Japan can keep an army for defensive purposes. But
Mr. Abe has said he wants to
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/world/asia/japan-election-shinzo-abe.html?rref=collection\%2Fbyline\%2Fmotoko-rich\&action=click\&contentCollection=undefined\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=31\&pgtype=collection}{revise
the Constitution and expand the military}. In August, his government
requested
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/world/asia/japan-defense-military-budget-shinzo-abe.html?rref=collection\%2Fbyline\%2Fmotoko-rich\&action=click\&contentCollection=undefined\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=20\&pgtype=collection}{the
latest in a series of increases in military spending}.

\hypertarget{would-japan-pursue-nuclear-weapons}{%
\subsection{Would Japan pursue nuclear
weapons?}\label{would-japan-pursue-nuclear-weapons}}

Japan has committed to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and Mr. Abe
will probably remind Mr. Trump of that.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump decried the cost of providing a
so-called nuclear umbrella to allies such as Japan and South Korea that
do not have their own nuclear arms. In March, Mr. Trump told The New
York Times that he was open to those countries
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html}{building
their own nuclear arsenals}, but on Twitter this week he
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/797832229800050688}{denied
having said so}.

Mr. Abe has reaffirmed his country's commitment not to develop atomic
weapons. Any move to do so would face severe public opposition in Japan,
the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack.

\subsection{Will Mr. Abe press his case on trade and the Trans-Pacific
Partnership?}\label{will-mr-abe-press-his-case-on-trade-and-the-trans-pacific-partnership}}

He has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the Trans-Pacific
Partnership --- or TPP, as it is known --- though Japan was the last of
a dozen Pacific Rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact. Mr. Trump
repeatedly criticized the TPP during the presidential campaign.

Mr. Abe made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to
close the deal and get Japanese manufacturers tariff-free access to
export markets in the United States and elsewhere. The trade partnership
could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as
a counterweight to China, the region's fast-rising superpower.

\hypertarget{with-mr-trumps-election-isnt-tpp-dead}{%
\subsection{With Mr. Trump's election, isn't TPP
dead?}\label{with-mr-trumps-election-isnt-tpp-dead}}

Mr. Abe acknowledged after Mr. Trump's victory that the Trans-Pacific
Partnership was in a ``very difficult situation.'' But his government
still plans to have Parliament ratify the agreement, and he has not
given up on selling it to Mr. Trump.

Mr. Abe may also seek to soften Mr. Trump's angry campaign stance, in
which he accused Japan of crushing the United States on trade, and
manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage.

Mr. Trump says he's for free trade in principle, but wants a ``better
deal'' for the United States. What that means, for now, remains a
mystery.
