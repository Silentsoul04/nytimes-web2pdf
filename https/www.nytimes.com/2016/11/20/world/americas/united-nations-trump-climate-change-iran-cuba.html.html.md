UNITED NATIONS — In the genteel, carpeted halls of the [United
Nations](http://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-nations?inline=nyt-org)
headquarters, a 20-minute walk from Trump Tower, diplomats from the
world over are holding their breath about the American president-elect.

The optimists among them are expressing relief that Donald J. Trump said
nothing during the campaign about dismantling the United Nations
altogether — or turning its iconic tower facing the East River into
condos.

Those who represent the United States’ closest allies are trying to
learn who Mr. Trump will appoint to crucial foreign policy jobs and how
he will actually approach the pressing crises that are sure to come up
before the Security Council: Syria, Ukraine, North Korea and the
widening chasm between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Not least,
many are trying to persuade his transition team to respect the
international deals the United States has accepted under the auspices of
the United Nations.

“It’s important to reaffirm that, more than ever, we need an America
that’s committed to world affairs,” said the ambassador from France,
François Delattre, who noted, without elaborating, that he had met with
members of the Trump team.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Sarah F. Cliffe](http://cic.nyu.edu/people/sarah-cliffe), a former
United Nations assistant secretary general who is now director of the
Center on International Cooperation, a research organization at New York
University, said she expected a reprise of the tensions that erupted
between the United States and the United Nations during the
administration of President George W. Bush. John R. Bolton, who was
ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, once said the United
Nations would be more effective without its top 10 floors, where its
senior leaders have their offices. Mr. Bolton is one of Mr. Trump’s many
would-be candidates for secretary of state.

But Ms. Cliffe said Mr. Trump may also find the United Nations useful.

“He prides himself on making deals,” she said. “The U.N. is the forum
where countries make deals in their own national interests but that also
does some collective good.”

His own comments about the United Nations are difficult to parse. At a
[2005 Senate
hearing](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg23164/html/CHRG-109shrg23164.htm "transcript of hearing")
about planned renovations of the United Nations headquarters, he
described himself as “a big fan” and said that “the concept of the
United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is
very important to me and very important to the world as far as I am
concerned.”

As one of Manhattan’s pre-eminent builders, he also offered [to handle
the renovation at half the
price.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-touts-un-renovation-plan/) In
2012, he complained on Twitter about the marble behind the speaker’s
lectern at the General Assembly hall, claiming he could build it better.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In March, [during a campaign
speech](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/donald-j-trump-remarks-at-aipac)
at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, he excoriated the world
body as “not a friend to freedom,” adding, “it surely isn’t a friend to
Israel.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whatever his specific views, a number of statements made by Mr. Trump
and his loyalists have conflicted with the values and positions of the
United Nations. Here are the major examples:

## Climate Change

Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has suggested he would
withdraw the United States from the Paris accord, widely regarded as the
most important United Nations achievement in years. Secretary General
Ban Ki-moon and President Obama invested a great deal of political
energy in its success.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This past week, speaking in Marrakesh, Morocco, at an international
meeting on climate change, Mr. Ban said he had spoken by telephone with
Mr. Trump and looked forward to a personal meeting about the importance
of saving the planet from environmental disaster.

“As president of the United States, I am sure that he will understand
this, he will listen, he will evaluate his campaign remarks,” Mr. Ban
said.

Even if Mr. Trump does not withdraw the United States from the accord,
he could ignore important commitments, including cuts in carbon
emissions or contributions to a global fund to help poor countries deal
with the damage wrought by climate change. American disregard of the
accord could cause other countries to renege on their promises as well.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Refugees and Migrants

Mr. Trump has said he wants to bar entry to refugees from certain
countries, and his campaign has defended a [widely pilloried Twitter
message](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-skittles.html)
by his son, Donald Trump Jr., comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned
Skittles.

Barring refugees based on where they come from would be in blatant
violation of international law, which requires countries to offer
protection to all those fleeing war and persecution. Mr. Trump’s
proposal has already been denounced by the United Nations high
commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, who said during
the campaign that Mr. Trump would be “[dangerous from an international
point of
view](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/world/europe/donald%2Dtrump%2Dun%2Dhuman%2Drights.html).”

The incoming United Nations secretary general, [António
Guterres](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/world/americas/antonio-guterres-united-nations-secretary-general.html),
was even more pointed. He said that any proposal to restrict Muslim
refugees would only help jihadist organizations spread their propaganda
and recruit followers. “It’s just telling them: ‘You are right. We are
against you.’ ”

He is to take office less than three weeks before Mr.
Trump.

## Iran Nuclear Agreement  

Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to scrap the agreement reached last
year between Iran and six world powers, including the United States,
that severely limited Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for
sanctions relief.  

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Ban has expressed the opposite view, calling the agreement a
[triumph of
diplomacy](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-07-20/statement-secretary-general-occasion-first-anniversary-adoption "Ban Ki-moon statement on anniversary of accord's adoption")
that reduced the threat of war. He has urged all participants to respect
its provisions.  

The agreement was also endorsed by the Security Council in a unanimous
[resolution](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2231\(2015\)).  

Almost immediately after the agreement was announced in July 2015, Mr.
Trump expressed his hostility in a Twitter post.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At that same March[meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee](http://time.com/4267058/donald-trump-aipac-speech-transcript/ "Transcript of Trump's AIPAC speech"),
a lobbying group, Mr. Trump asserted that “my No. 1 priority is to
dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,” arguing that the Iranians had
outsmarted the United States in winning concessions and could still
develop a nuclear weapon when the pact’s restrictions expire in 15
years.

Despite Mr. Trump’s assertions, it remains unclear whether he will seek
to annul or amend the nuclear agreement. The other countries involved —
Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia — have all expressed
their intention to honor it.

Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is under consideration
for a cabinet post in the new administration, said Mr. Trump would
probably be cautious about any change of policy.

“I don’t think he will tear it up, and I don’t think that’s the way to
start,” [Mr. Corker said on
CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/bob-corker-donald-trump-iran-deal/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Human Rights

Mr. Trump has vowed to
restore[waterboarding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/17/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-torture-works/)
as a counterterrorism tool, saying “torture works.” That would
contravene an [international convention on
torture](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx).

Kris Kobach, a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team, has
[suggested](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN13B05C)
that the new administration could create a national registry for
immigrants from countries where terrorist groups are active. That would
go against an international convention on nondiscrimination, which took
effect nearly 50 years ago.

Western powers have sought to use the United Nations to highlight rights
abuses they attribute to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Mr. Trump
has made clear that whatever war crimes Mr. Assad may have carried out,
Mr. Trump’s first priority is the Islamic State. “I don’t like Assad at
all, but Assad is killing ISIS,” he said in October. “Russia is killing
ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS.”

## Arms Trade Treaty

Mr. Trump has not specified his view on the [Arms Trade
Treaty](http://www.thearmstradetreaty.org/index.php/en/the-arms-trade-treaty),
which was overwhelmingly adopted in 2013 by the General Assembly and
entered into legal force nearly two years ago. But gun-rights advocates
in the United States led by the National Rifle Association, one of Mr.
Trump’s most powerful supporters, strongly criticized the treaty and
vowed to ensure that the Senate never ratifies it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The treaty is an attempt to regulate the enormous global trade in
conventional weapons, and for the first time it links sales to the human
rights records of the buyers.

The N.R.A. has argued that the [treaty’s provisions amount to an
infringement of the Second
Amendment](https://www.nraila.org/issues/internationalun-gun-control-issues/).
Kelly Ayotte, a Republican senator from New Hampshire who is among those
being talked about as Mr. Trump’s potential ambassador to United
Nations, has been an outspoken critic of the treaty.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Israel and Palestinians

Mr. Trump’s precise views are unclear on this question, which has vexed
the United Nations for decades. But he has said he is [“100
percent”](http://www1.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2016/01/19/exclusive-donald-trump-tells-the-brody-file-hes-100-in)
in favor of moving the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
the holy city that Israel claims as its undivided capital. Such a change
would be a major break from longstanding American policy and would
infuriate the Palestinians, who want at least part of Jerusalem to be
the capital of a future Palestinian state. The secretary general has
called Jerusalem [“the heart of any negotiated solution to the question
of Palestine.”](http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/gapal1362.doc.htm)

## Relations With Cuba

Mr. Trump has sharply criticized President Obama’s reconciliation with
Cuba, a change that was widely welcomed at the United Nations, where an
annual resolution condemning the American trade embargo with Cuba passes
overwhelmingly. Mr. Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, has vowed that the
new administration’s policy will be much tougher.
