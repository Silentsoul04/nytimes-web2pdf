LONDON — Michael S. Sherwood, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman and co-head
of its European division, will retire from the Wall Street firm at the
end of the year.

Mr. Sherwood, who is also known as Woody, had previously been seen as a
potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chairman
and chief executive. Mr. Blankfein [revealed last
year](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/dealbook/goldman-ceo-lloyd-blankfein-has-lymphoma.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBlankfein%2C%20Lloyd%20C.&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=8&pgtype=collection)
that he had what he described as a “highly curable” form of lymphoma.

Mr. Sherwood’s departure came as Goldman tries to navigate the political
uncertainty following Britain’s decision this year to leave the European
Union.

The outcome of the British referendum has raised questions about whether
Goldman and other American banks may be forced to shift operations out
of London to continue to serve some European clients.

Richard J. Gnodde, who oversaw the bank’s European operations with Mr.
Sherwood, will become the sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs
International after Mr. Sherwood’s departure, according to an internal
memorandum reviewed by The New York Times.

“Over the course of his career, Michael has played a vital role in
establishing and growing our franchise in Europe and around the world,”
Mr. Blankfein and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s president, said in the memo on
Monday.

“His expertise and knowledge across a range of markets, as well as his
passion and commitment to our culture, have influenced a generation of
professionals at Goldman Sachs,” they added.

Mr. Sherwood has been with Goldman for 30 years, joining the bank in
1986. He previously headed its fixed-income, currency and commodities
division in Europe and served as global co-head of its securities
division. He has been co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs International
since 2005 and a vice chairman since February 2008.

He is one of the firm’s highest-paid employees, earning total
compensation of $21 million in 2015, according to its [proxy
statement](http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/proxy-statements/2016-proxy-statement-pdf.pdf).

His departure came just over a month after Mark Schwartz, who is
chairman of Goldman’s Asia Pacific region and a vice chairman of the
firm, [announced
plans](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/business/dealbook/goldman-sachss-asia-pacific-chairman-to-retire.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FGoldman%20Sachs%20Group&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=collection)
to retire at the end of the year.

This year, Mr. Sherwood was one of several Goldman executives called to
testify before Parliament over the collapse of BHS, one Britain’s
best-known retailers. Goldman served as an informal adviser to Philip
Green, the chain’s former owner, in its sale.

The department store chain, which employed 11,000 people, was liquidated
following its collapse in April just a year after it was sold by Mr.
Green to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, a former racecar driver
and businessman who had previously declared bankruptcy multiple times.
