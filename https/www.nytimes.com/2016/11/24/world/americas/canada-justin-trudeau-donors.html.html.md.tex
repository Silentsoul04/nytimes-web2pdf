OTTAWA --- When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prevailed in Canada's
election last year, he promised
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/world/americas/canada-election-stephen-harper-justin-trudeau.html}{``sunny
ways''} and later pledged to hold his cabinet ministers to high ethical
standards when it came to conflicts of interest and fund-raising.

Now, after being the chief attraction at a fund-raiser attended by
wealthy businessmen, Mr. Trudeau himself is facing criticism from some
who say he is not following his own rules.

On Tuesday, The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper,
\href{http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-attended-cash-for-access-fundraiser-with-chinese-billionaires/article32971362/}{reported
that Mr. Trudeau} spoke in May at a political fund-raiser held in the
Toronto house of the president of the Chinese Business Chamber of
Commerce. Most of the 32 guests paid 1,500 Canadian dollars, or about
\$1,100, to attend.

Among the nonpaying guests was Zhang Bin, president of the Beijing-based
\href{http://www.chncia.org/en/about.php?mid=1}{China Cultural Industry
Association}, a promotional agency under the control of China's minister
of culture. Not long afterward, Mr. Zhang and his group's honorary
president made a
\href{http://www.trudeaufoundation.ca/en/activities/news/200000-gift-explore-canada-china-relations}{joint
donation} of 1 million Canadian dollars, or about \$741,200, to the
Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which includes Justin Trudeau's
brother among its board members, and the University of Montreal law
faculty. The donation included funds for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, the
former prime minister and Justin's father, at the law school.

The article was the latest in a series by The Globe and Mail that
suggests, opposition members of Parliament say, that donors get
privileged access to members of Mr. Trudeau's cabinet in exchange for
cash, which can sometimes be as little as 500 Canadian dollars, or
\$370. Mr. Trudeau has maintained that no rules have been broken or
ethical boundaries crossed.

On Thursday, the questions over the May fund-raiser followed the prime
minister to Liberia, where he was making a two-day visit. Speaking to
reporters in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, Mr. Trudeau rejected the idea
that the large donation from Mr. Zhang and the Chinese association's
honorary president, Niu Gensheng, to the foundation named for his father
could influence his thinking or the direction of government policies.

Mr. Trudeau said he had cut all ties to the foundation, which promotes
and funds academic research in the humanities and social sciences, when
he entered politics.

``I stepped down from any of my family-related responsibilities shortly
after having gotten elected, in order to demonstrate that there is a
tremendous separation there,'' he said.

Mr. Zhang did not respond to a request for comment.

Efforts by Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet members to defend the
fund-raisers have not placated opponents.

``Not only does this event break the prime minister's own ethics rules,
but it does not pass the smell test,'' Rona Ambrose, the interim
Conservative leader, told the House of Commons on Tuesday. ``He could
stop this right away. Why does he not?''

Compared with the United States, Canada has severe limits on political
donations. A fund-raising scandal in the late 1990s involving a Liberal
government led by Jean Chrétien prompted changes that banned donations
by unions and corporations and that
\href{http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol\&document=index\&dir=lim\&lang=e}{limited
individual donations} to parties to 1,525 Canadian dollars, or about
\$1,130, a year. Only Canadian citizens may donate.

After The Globe and Mail reported on fund-raisers involving some members
of Mr. Trudeau's cabinet, Mary Dawson, the independent conflict of
interest and ethics commissioner, told a House of Commons committee the
sessions did not break any laws, but noted that she had repeatedly
called for stricter rules.

On the way out of the committee room Ms. Dawson told reporters that the
fund-raisers were ``not very savory.''

Mr. Trudeau's critics argue that even if the events break no laws, they
seem to be in direct conflict with the stringent and much publicized
\href{http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/11/27/open-and-accountable-government\#Standards_of_Conduct}{ethics
rules} he set down for his cabinet.

``There should be no preferential access to government, or appearance of
preferential access, accorded to individuals or organizations because
they have made financial contributions to politicians and political
parties,'' Mr. Trudeau's rules state.

When they were in power, the Conservatives held fund-raisers that
sometimes cast the party in an unflattering light.

Lisa Raitt, a former cabinet minister from Toronto, became the subject
of an investigation after a prominent lobbyist organized one of her
fund-raising events. While Ms. Dawson cleared Ms. Raitt, she called for
tighter rules related to fund-raisers, a request that so far remains
unheeded. Ms. Raitt is now campaigning to lead the Conservatives.

Mike Storeshaw, a spokesman for the Conservatives, said that when the
party was in power, guest lists at fund-raisers were vetted and anyone
who did business with the government was asked not to attend. He
acknowledged that the system was not always perfect.

Since The Globe and Mail began publishing its articles, the Liberal
Party decided to bar lobbyists from fund-raisers attended by cabinet
ministers they lobby. This month, the chairman of a large generic drug
company based in Canada pulled out of a group organizing an event
attended by the federal finance minister.

In
\href{http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/on-cash-for-access-justin-trudeau-picks-up-where-kathleen-wynne-left-off/article32988739/}{an
editorial} this week, The Globe and Mail proposed that Mr. Trudeau go
much further and reduce individual donations to a mere 100 Canadian
dollars, or about \$74.

``Dropping them to just \$100 per person would price cash-for-access
fundraising out of business for good,'' The Globe and Mail wrote.
