NEW DELHI — On Nov. 8, the Indian government announced an immediate ban
on two major bills that account for the vast majority of all currency in
circulation. Indians would have until the end of the year to change
those notes for other bills, including newly minted ones.

On Wednesday, the government released via a smartphone app called
“Narendra Modi,” named after the prime minister, the results of a
survey purporting to show 90 percent support for its so-called
demonetization policy.

[The poll was rightly
criticized.](http://scroll.in/article/822358/the-daily-fix-modis-cynical-app-survey-betrays-the-governments-insensitivity-on-demonetisation)In
the two weeks after the measure was announced, millions of Indians
stricken with small panic [rushed out to
banks](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/business/india-bans-largest-currency-bills-for-now-n-bid-to-cut-corruption.html);
A.T.M.s and tellers soon ran dry. [Some 98 percent of all transactions
in
India](http://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2016/11/09/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-parallel-economy-in-india),
measured by volume, are conducted in cash.

Demonetization was ostensibly implemented to combat corruption,
terrorism financing and
[inflation](http://www.narendramodi.in/text-of-prime-minister-s-address-to-the-nation-533024).
But it was poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the
market, and it is likely to fail. So far its effects have been
disastrous for the middle- and lower-middle classes, [as well as the
poor](http://scroll.in/article/822101/how-four-families-have-survived-two-weeks-of-demonetisation).
And the worst may be yet to come.

India has a large amount of what is known as “black money,” meaning cash
or any other form of wealth that has evaded taxation. According to a
2010 World Bank estimate, the most reliable available, the shadow
economy in India makes up one-fifth of the country’s G.D.P. (A 2013
study by McKinsey, the consulting firm, puts the figure at [more than
one-quarter](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jQBKN2vqEa0J:www.mckinsey.com/%7E/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/financial%2520services/latest%2520thinking/payments/mop16_forging_a_path_to_payments_digitization.ashx+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl).)

Black money tends to exacerbate inequality because the biggest evasions
occur at the top of the income spectrum. It also deprives the government
of money to spend on infrastructure and public services like health care
and education. According to the World Bank’s most recent estimate, from
2012, [India’s tax-to-G.D.P. ratio is about 11
percent](https://issuu.com/world.bank.publications/docs/9781464806834?e=0/35179276),
compared with about 14 percent for Brazil, about 26 percent for South
Africa and about 35 percent for Denmark.

The government’s wish to tackle these problems is laudable, but
demonetization is a ham-fisted move that will put only a temporary dent
in corruption, if even that, and is likely to rock the entire economy.

Many Indians have been scrambling to change their old notes, causing
snaking queues in front of banks and desperation among the poor, many of
whom have no bank account and live from cash earnings.

Anyone seeking to convert more than 250,000 rupees (about $3,650) must
explain why they hold so much cash, or failing that, must pay a penalty.
The requirement has already spawned a new black market to service people
wishing to offload: Large amounts of illicit cash are broken into
smaller blocks and deposited by teams of illegal couriers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Demonetization is mostly hurting people who aren’t its intended targets.
Because sellers of certain durables, such as jewelry and property, often
insist on cash payments, many individuals who have no illegal money
build up cash reserves over time. Relatively poor women stash away cash
beyond their husbands’ reach, as savings for the children or the
household.

Small hoarders often fear being questioned about the source of their
money — they are accustomed to being harassed by tax collectors, among
others — and may choose instead to forgo some of their savings.

People have also been skimping in response to the new policy, causing
demand for certain basic goods to fall, which has hurt farmers and small
producers and could eventually lead them to scale back on their
activities.

And even more pain is around the corner. With so much money in
circulation suddenly ceasing to be legal tender, India’s economic growth
is bound to nose-dive. Another risk is that the Indian rupee could
depreciate as a result of people and investors moving to more robust
currencies.

The government’s demonetization dragnet will no doubt catch some illicit
cash. Some people will turn in their black money and pay a penalty;
others will [destroy part of their illegal
stashes](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sacks-full-of-burnt-500-and-1-000-rupee-notes-in-uttar-pradesh-1623440)in
order not to draw attention to their businesses. But the overall
benefits will be small and fleeting.

One reason is that the bulk of black money in India isn’t money at all:
It’s held in gold and silver, real estate and overseas bank accounts.
Another is that even if demonetization can flush out the black money
that is held in cash, with no improvement in catching and punishing tax
evaders, people with ill-gotten gains will simply start saving in the
new bills currently being issued.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the government [announced
demonetization](http://finmin.nic.in/press_room/2016/press_cancellation_high_denomination_notes.pdf),
it also justified the measure as a way to curb terrorism financing that
relies on counterfeit rupee notes, as well as to dampen inflation.

Both these justifications are flawed. Catching fake notes already in
circulation neither helps trap the terrorists who minted them nor
prevents more such money from being injected into the economy. It simply
inconveniences the people who use it as legal tender, the vast majority
of whom had no hand in its creation.

There also is no evidence that black money actually is more inflationary
than white money; nor in theory should it be. Black money is just money
held by people instead of the government. It’s an excessive money supply
that tends to create inflation; whether that money is white or black
makes little difference.

Demonetization may have been well-intentioned, but it was a major
mistake. The government should reverse it. It could at least declare
that 500 rupee notes, which many poorer people frequently use, are legal
again.

And if the government really does want to limit the amount of black
money in circulation, it would do better to move India toward becoming a
more cashless society. About 53 percent of adult Indians [have a bank
account](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/country/india),
but many signed up at the government’s initiative and so quite a few of
the accounts are dormant. On the other hand, more than one billion
people in India have a cellphone, and this could be tapped to encourage
more active banking, in the form of mobile banking.

India’s push to issue a unique I.D. number to all Indians based on their
biometric information is a major step in the right direction. [More than
one billion
people](https://portal.uidai.gov.in/uidwebportal/dashboard.do) have
already been registered, according to the government, potentially
enabling them to use an app to collect pensions, for example.

Tackling corruption also goes beyond currency, cash or even banking. It
requires changing institutions and mind-sets, and carefully crafting
policies that acknowledge the complexity of economic and social life.
The government could start by increasing penalties for tax evasion and
amending India’s outdated anti-graft laws.

In a country like India, where the illegal economy is so intimately
intertwined with the mainstream economy, one inept government
intervention against shadow activities can do a lot of harm to the vast
majority, who are just trying to make a legitimate living.
