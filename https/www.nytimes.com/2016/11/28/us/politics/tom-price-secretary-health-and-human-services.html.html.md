WASHINGTON — If President-elect Donald J. Trump wanted a cabinet
secretary who could help him dismantle and replace President Obama’s
health care law, he could not have found anyone more prepared than
Representative Tom Price, who has been studying how to accomplish that
goal for more than six years.

Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon who represents many of the northern
suburbs of Atlanta, speaks with the self-assurance of a doctor about to
perform another joint-replacement procedure. He knows the task and will
proceed with brisk efficiency.

Mr. Trump has picked Mr. Price, a six-term Republican congressman, to be
secretary of health and human services, Mr. Trump’s transition team
announced Tuesday morning.

Also on Monday, Mr. Trump [met with David H.
Petraeus](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/politics/donald-trump-transition-david-petraeus.html "Times article."),
the highly decorated but scandal-scarred former military commander, who
has emerged as a new contender for secretary of state.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While some Republicans have attacked the Affordable Care Act without
proposing an alternative, Mr. Price has introduced bills offering a
detailed, comprehensive replacement plan in every Congress since 2009,
when Democrats started work on the legislation. Many of his ideas are
included in the “Better Way” agenda issued several months ago by House
Republicans.

In debate on the Affordable Care Act in 2009, Mr. Price railed against
“a stifling and oppressive federal government,” a theme that pervades
his politics. His most frequent objection to the law is that it
interferes with the ability of patients and doctors to make medical
decisions — a concern he will surely take with him if he wins Senate
confirmation.

“The practicing physician and the patient could not have a better friend
in that office than Tom Price,” said Representative Michael C. Burgess,
Republican of Texas, who is also a physician.

Mr. Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he felt
events had borne out his warnings about the health law.

“Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration blatantly ignored
the voices of the American people and rammed through a hyperpartisan
piece of legislation that will have a disastrous effect on our nation’s
health care system,” Mr. Price said shortly after Mr. Obama signed the
bill in 2010.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, he says: “Premiums have gone up, not down. Many Americans lost the
health coverage they were told time and time again by the president that
they could keep. Choices are
fewer.”

## Donald Trump’s Cabinet Is Complete. Here’s the Full List.

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The legislation Mr. Price has proposed, the Empowering Patients First
Act, would repeal the Affordable Care Act and offer age-adjusted tax
credits for the purchase of individual and family health insurance
policies.

The bill would create incentives for people to contribute to health
savings accounts; offer grants to states to subsidize insurance for
“high-risk populations”; allow insurers licensed in one state to sell
policies to residents of others; and authorize business and professional
groups to provide coverage to members through “association health
plans.”

As secretary, Mr. Price would be responsible for a department with an
annual budget of more than $1 trillion, health programs that insure more
than 100 million Americans, and agencies that regulate food and drugs
and sponsor much of the nation’s biomedical research.

Democrats criticized the selection of Mr. Price.

“Congressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what
Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and
Planned Parenthood,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in
line to be the Senate Democratic leader in the new Congress. “Thanks to
those three programs, millions of American seniors, families, people
with disabilities and women have access to quality, affordable health
care. Nominating Congressman Price to be the H.H.S. secretary is akin to
asking the fox to guard the henhouse.”

From his days as a Georgia state senator, Mr. Price, now 62, has been a
voice for doctors, often aligned with the positions of the American
Medical Association and the Medical Association of Georgia.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He has introduced legislation that would make it easier for doctors to
defend themselves against medical malpractice lawsuits and to enter into
private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries. Under such contracts,
doctors can, in effect, opt out of Medicare and charge more than the
amounts normally allowed by the program’s rules.

He also supported legislation to bar federal funds for Planned
Parenthood, saying some of its clinics had been involved in what he
called “barbaric” abortion practices.

Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, said that Mr. Price “poses a grave threat to women’s health”
and that as health secretary he “could take women back decades.” If he
had his way, she said, “millions of women could be cut off from Planned
Parenthood’s preventive health services,” could lose access to free
birth control under the Affordable Care Act and could again be charged
more than men for the same health insurance.

Mr. Price’s intimate knowledge of Medicare could serve him well. The
secretary of health and human services sets Medicare payment policies
for doctors, updates the physician fee schedule each year and issues
rules that can have a huge influence on the practice of medicine. The
government is carrying out a law that changes how doctors are paid under
Medicare, and Medicare often serves as a model for private insurers.

On the other hand, as secretary, Mr. Price would need a broader
perspective. He would have to consider not only the interests of
doctors, but also the needs of Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid patients
and taxpayers who finance those programs.

Mr. Price is a strong conservative who invariably excites the audience
at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. His website
lists him as a member of the Tea Party Caucus. His district includes
territory once represented by Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the
House. But Mr. Price is no bomb thrower. He works within the system and
has led two groups that promote conservative policies in the
House.

## 20 Things Donald Trump Said He Wanted to Get Rid of as President

Some of the parts of the government that Mr. Trump promised to dismantle
if he was elected.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Born in Lansing, Mich., Mr. Price went to college and medical school at
the University of Michigan, did his residency at Emory University in
Atlanta and was medical director of the orthopedic clinic at Grady
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He says he got into politics because he found that officials in
Washington and Atlanta who had no medical training were making decisions
that affected his ability to take care of patients.

Speaking at a political conference in early 2010, Mr. Price said he was
proud to join fellow conservatives in an effort to beat back a “vile
liberal agenda.”

In a similar vein, he complained this year that Obama administration
officials were trying to “commandeer clinical decision-making” by
forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of
paying for prescription drugs, hip and knee replacement operations, and
heart surgery for Medicare patients.

As secretary of health and human services, Mr. Price could carry out the
advice he has given Mr. Obama: “Stop these mandatory demonstration
projects.”

Mr. Price is also an outspoken opponent of abortion and has consistently
received ratings of 100 percent from the National Right to Life
Committee and scores of zero from the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America.

Gay rights groups have also been critical of Mr. Price. Sarah Kate
Ellis, the president and chief executive of GLAAD, formerly known as the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said Mr. Price was
“completely unfit” to be health secretary.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the Supreme Court ruled last year that the Constitution guarantees
a right to same-sex marriage, Mr. Price said it was “not only a sad day
for marriage, but a further judicial destruction of our entire system of
checks and balances.”

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that he had chosen Seema Verma, a health
policy expert in Indiana, to be administrator of the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services. Working in state government and then as
president of a consulting company, she helped Indiana expand Medicaid
eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, with conservative policies
that emphasized “personal responsibility.”

Ms. Verma worked closely with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the vice
president-elect, and with former Gov. Mitch Daniels, also a Republican.
She has won praise from health care providers and state legislators of
both parties. She has also provided technical assistance and advice to
Medicaid officials in other states.

Under Mr. Obama, the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid has also led
efforts to carry out the Affordable Care Act, supervising most of the
online marketplaces where people can buy health insurance and obtain
subsidies to help cover the cost.
