Steven Mnuchin started his career as a trader.

He now appears to have made the political trade of a lifetime: His early
pledge of loyalty to the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump has
landed him the job of secretary of the Treasury. The position is
expected to be announced on Wednesday, [people close to the transition
said](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/politics/steven-terner-mnuchin-trump-treasury-secretary.html).

Up until the last several weeks, Mr. Mnuchin — an entrepreneur, a Wall
Street investor and a Hollywood producer — would have appeared an
unlikely choice for the position made famous by Alexander Hamilton. Over
his business career, he was never particularly involved in politics, nor
did he publicly express an interest in public policy. He never ran a
large organization or showed himself to be an accomplished economist.

With his appointment to the Treasury, Mr. Mnuchin would be sidestepping
— or passing over — the more conventional paths to having his
signature on United States currency and an office neighboring the White
House.

On the surface, all of that may make Mr. Mnuchin an outsider of sorts.
But he is very much a part of the firmament of the finance world, even
if he never reached the corner office of one of Wall Street’s top firms.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He started his career at Goldman Sachs, where his father, Robert, was a
legendary trader. He then worked for his Yale roommate, the hedge fund
manager Eddie Lampert, who runs Sears Holdings, and later for George
Soros, before striking out on his own — with the backing of Mr. Soros —
to start Dune Capital Management.

He has spent much of the last decade on the West Coast, where his firm
[bought
IndyMac](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/worldbusiness/04iht-indymac.1.19066482.html),
a bankrupt housing lender, in 2009 from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and rebuilt it under the name OneWest before [selling it
for an enormous
profit](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/cit-to-buy-onewest-for-3-4-billion/)
to the CIT Group in 2015.

Along the way, he also developed a side business as a financier of many
Hollywood hits. His name regularly appears in the credits of films. Just
in the past year, he produced “Sully,” “Storks,” “The Legend of Tarzan”
and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”

Mr. Mnuchin is known as a smart, hard-working, talented executive. Henry
M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary who was critical of Mr.
Trump during the campaign, was very complimentary of Mr. Mnuchin’s
performance at Goldman Sachs.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I think Steven Mnuchin would be an excellent choice for Treasury
secretary,” Mr. Paulson said on Tuesday evening. “He is very talented,
has a deep understanding of finance and markets, he knows how to bring
people together to get things done, and — importantly — he has a working
relationship with and the confidence of the president-elect.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That confidence and loyalty appear to be what clinched the role for Mr.
Mnuchin. Unlike several Trump insiders who have publicly campaigned for
jobs, Mr. Mnuchin has remained relatively behind the scenes and never
seemed to seek the spotlight.

While Mr. Mnuchin, who served as the Trump campaign’s national finance
chairman, was always considered the probable pick for the Treasury, Mr.
Trump spent the last two weeks considering others. The most prominent
was Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive. Others on the
shortlist included David McCormick, president of the hedge fund
Bridgewater Associates and the former under secretary of the Treasury
for international affairs, according to people involved in the process.

It is hard to discern what policies Mr. Mnuchin will seek to enact
beyond those espoused by Mr. Trump. Like the president-elect, he has
talked about lowering taxes and lifting regulations, but mostly without
describing specifics.

While Mr. Mnuchin’s deepest relationships are with hedge fund managers,
investors and big names in Hollywood — less so among the chief
executives of the biggest banks and multinational companies — he is
expected to be welcomed as what one former colleague described as one of
the adults in the administration that the industry will feel it can work
with.

Still, he is expected to face a steep learning curve when it comes to
working on international trade, where he doesn’t have much previous
experience. And even though he is both an insider and an outsider, some
of Mr. Trump’s supporters and critics may see him as too much of the
former.

Mr. Trump criticized Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin’s former employer,
during the campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches
to the bank.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But anyone looking for hints about Mr. Mnuchin’s ideology may be
disappointed: His friends say he is not ideological and that, if
anything, his ideology is simply his ambition.

When Mr. Mnuchin decided to back Mr. Trump — much to the horror of some
of his friends and peers — [he explained
it](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-31/steven-mnuchin-businessweek)
to Bloomberg Businessweek the way a trader would: “Nobody’s going to be
like, ‘Well, why did he do this?’ if I end up in the administration.”
