MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said on Saturday
that President-elect Donald J. Trump had endorsed his brutal antidrug
campaign, telling Mr. Duterte that the Philippines was conducting it
“the right way.”

Mr. Duterte, who spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Friday, said Mr.
Trump was “quite sensitive” to “our worry about drugs.”

“He wishes me well, too, in my campaign, and he said that, well, we are
doing it as a sovereign nation, the right way,” Mr. Duterte
said.

There was no immediate response from Mr. Trump to Mr. Duterte’s
description of the phone call, and his transition team could not be
reached for comment.

Since his election last month, Mr. Trump has held a series of unscripted
calls with foreign leaders, several of which have broken radically from
past American policies and diplomatic practice. A [call on Friday with
the president of
Taiwan](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/us/politics/trump-speaks-with-taiwans-leader-a-possible-affront-to-china.html),
Tsai Ing-wen, appeared to be out of sync with four decades of United
States policy toward China and prompted a Chinese call to the White
House.

Mr. Duterte has led a campaign against drug abuse in which he has
encouraged the police and others to kill people they suspect of using or
selling drugs. Since he took office in June, more than 2,000 people have
been killed by the police in what officers describe as drug raids, and
the police say several hundred more have been killed by vigilantes.

The program has been condemned by the United States, the United Nations,
the European Union and others for what rights organizations have
characterized as extrajudicial killings. In rejecting such criticism
from the United States this fall, Mr. Duterte [called Mr. Obama a “son
of a
whore.”](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/30/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-quotes-hitler-whore-philippines.html)

In a summary of the phone call with Mr. Trump released by Mr. Duterte’s
office on Saturday morning, Mr. Duterte said the two had spoken for just
a few minutes but covered many topics, including the antidrug campaign.

“I could sense a good rapport, an animated President-elect Trump,” Mr.
Duterte said. “And he was wishing me success in my campaign against the
drug problem.”

Mr. Duterte added: “He understood the way we are handling it, and I said
that there’s nothing wrong in protecting a country. It was a bit very
encouraging in the sense that I supposed that what he really wanted to
say was that we would be the last to interfere in the affairs of your
own country.”

Mr. Duterte, who has said [he was seeking “a
separation”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-china.html)
from the United States, a longtime ally, and has threatened to bar
American troops from his country, also said, “We assured him of our ties
with America.” He did not elaborate on that comment.

Mr. Duterte also said that Mr. Trump had invited him to visit New York
and Washington, and that Mr. Trump said he wanted to attend the summit
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations next year in the
Philippines.

Mr. Duterte has often been compared to Mr. Trump for his blunt speech
and populist positions.

“I appreciate the response that I got from President-elect Trump, and I
would like to wish him success,” Mr. Duterte said. “He will be a good
president for the United States of America.”
