FORT YATES, N.D. — After four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, after
being hit by a roadside bomb and losing two friends to explosions, Jason
Brocar floated from job to job, earning enough to pay for long solo
hikes where his only worries were what he would eat and where he would
sleep. He was deep into a rainy trek through Scotland when he noticed
friends back home talking about a place called Standing Rock.

He decided to join them, which is why he was lined up inside a huge shed
this weekend with hundreds of other veterans, some of them Native
Americans, who have come to North Dakota to join the Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe’s fight to block an oil pipeline.

On Sunday, they cheered the [Department of the Army’s
announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/us/federal-officials-to-explore-different-route-for-dakota-pipeline.html)
that it would seek other routes for the pipeline and would not allow a
crucial section to be drilled under the Missouri River just upstream
from the tribe’s reservation, where there were worries it could pollute
their drinking water and cross near sacred burial sites.

But President-elect Donald J. Trump’s support for finishing the pipeline
means the saga is far from over. His administration could undo the
Sunday decision and order the pipeline through, though the tribe and
environmental activists would almost surely sue to stop him. Reflecting
the continued uncertainty, the veterans were out singing and marching on
Monday in gale-force winds and driving snow.

The presence of many hundreds of veterans — organizers were anticipating
2,000 or more — adds another potent layer to a fight that is already
steeped in sharp contrasts, between a tribe and an oil company, between
environmentalists and pro-energy advocates, between tan-shirted
sheriff’s deputies [armed with rubber
bullets](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/dakota-access-pipeline-protesters-police.html)
and water cannons and protesters wearing traditional dress and feathers
in their hair.

“Fall in\!” came a cry one night this weekend. Hundreds of men and women
packed into the building to get their orders from Brenda White Bull and
Loreal Black Shawl, who are leading the [veterans’ groups at the protest
camps](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/veterans-to-serve-as-human-shields-for-pipeline-protesters.html).

The orders, they said, were “peace and prayer.” No confrontations
between veterans and law enforcement officers who are guarding a
still-closed highway at what protesters call the front lines. On Monday,
many protesters [defied an
order](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/dakota-pipeline-protest.html)
by the Army Corps of Engineers to leave a campsite north of the
Cannonball River.

“You guys are very symbolic,” Dave Archambault II, the Standing Rock
Sioux tribal chairman, told the lines of veterans at a meeting at
Sitting Bull College here on the tribe’s reservation. “What you’re doing
is sacred.”

Law enforcement officials leading the response to the [monthslong
protest](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/dakota-access-pipeline-protest.html)
in Morton County say they have only used force when threatened or
attacked by protesters.

Sheriff Paul Laney of Cass County said that officers wanted to calm
things down after weeks of rising tensions and violent flare-ups, and
that they were willing to pull back from a blockaded bridge where
several confrontations had occurred. He said protesters first needed to
meet conditions like agreeing not to cross the bridge and not to tear
down barriers or wires that law enforcement had put up.

“We all want this to de-escalate and end peacefully,” Sheriff Laney
said.

Veterans’ views are hardly monolithic, and as the veterans began to
arrive, the Morton County Sheriff’s office — whose ranks include
veterans — sought to show it had the support of local veterans. The
county released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1WzkHhSDPY)
featuring Raymond Morrell, a Marine veteran. He criticized the protests
and questioned why veterans arriving from outside North Dakota would
join what the sheriff has called an unlawful protest.

At a news conference, Sheriff Laney said he had received information
that an “element” within the protest camps wanted to exploit veterans
with post-traumatic stress and goad them into acts of violence. Tribal
leaders and protesters say they are nonviolent and have no weapons.

Several of the veterans who lined up wore caps saying, “Native Veteran.”
Some were old men, veterans of Korea and postwar Europe, who said they
had grown up in Indian boarding schools where they were beaten for
speaking their language. Some drove in from reservations across the
Plains.

Some of the arriving veterans have spent years in the antiwar movement
after returning from Vietnam or Iraq. They said they saw the pipeline
protests as a new chapter in that activism. They came with open letters
and leaflets, and they raised flags in the camp that fluttered alongside
the names of Native American nations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many said they came ready to form a barrier between protesters and law
enforcement.

“A lot of people here are willing to sacrifice their body, willing to
give their life,” said Vincent Emanuele, 32, a former Marine who served
in Iraq and has spoken out extensively against what he called a futile
war. “You might as well die for something that means something.”

Others said they did not care much about politics and had never joined a
protest. But they said they had been moved by the tribe’s fight to block
a crucial section of the 1,170-mile pipeline. Or they said they were
angry at seeing images of violent clashes between lines of law
enforcement and Native Americans.

“I just couldn’t believe what was happening in the United States,” Mr.
Brocar, 44, said. “Even in Iraq, there was some rule of engagement. If
these guys don’t have weapons, it just doesn’t make sense to me that
it’s a shooting gallery.”

Like other veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who came here — any many who
did not — he said he had grown disillusioned with the grinding wars and
their human toll. On his wrist were two metal bracelets with the names
of his two dead friends — “hometown guys who joined to save the world.”

After the meeting ended, the veterans dispersed across the dark plains
to sleep, some heading to tents and yurts at the camp, others to
borrowed beds. Robert Abbey, 37, a former soldier who joined the
military at 17 and deployed once to Iraq, ended up sleeping at the
community college.

He said he came because he wanted to help, and to see what was unfolding
five hours north of his home in Hermosa, S.D. Some of the veterans here
said they might stay for weeks, but Mr. Abbey had to get back home for
an appointment at the local Veterans Affairs agency.
