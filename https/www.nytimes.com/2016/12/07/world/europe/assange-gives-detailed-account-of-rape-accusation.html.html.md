LONDON — [Julian
Assange](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/julian_p_assange/index.html?inline=nyt-per),
the
[WikiLeaks](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/wikileaks/index.html?inline=nyt-org)
founder, offered his most detailed and public account on Wednesday of
events that led to a rape accusation against him in Sweden, saying he
was innocent and had engaged in “consensual and enjoyable sex” with the
accuser.

Last month, questions prepared by Swedish prosecutors were posed to Mr.
Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has lived since 2012 to
avoid extradition to Sweden over the rape accusation. The questions were
asked by an Ecuadorean prosecutor under an agreement made by the two
countries in August.

But in a move that is likely to irk Swedish prosecutors, whom Mr.
Assange has denounced for forcing him to remain confined in the embassy
for the past six years, the WikiLeaks founder on Wednesday released the
answers he gave during the interview. [In the 19-page
statement](https://justice4assange.com/IMG/html/assange-statement-2016.html),
which reads alternately like a legal defense brief and an emotional
airing of personal grievances, he writes that he is “entirely innocent”
and had engaged in “consensual and enjoyable” sex with the woman who
accused him of rape.

Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution Authority,
said Wednesday that the authority was still waiting for a written report
on Mr. Assange’s questioning from the Ecuadorean prosecutor.

WikiLeaks has courted controversy by publishing confidential and
damaging information from the United States and other countries. During
the American presidential election, WikiLeaks came under renewed
scrutiny for distributing [hacked
emails](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/us-formally-accuses-russia-of-stealing-dnc-emails.html)
from the Democratic National Committee, and Mr. Assange
[acknowledged](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html)
that he was timing their release to do maximum harm to the prospects of
Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Assange, 45, an Australian, has refused to go to Sweden to face the
rape accusation for fear, he says, of being extradited to the United
States and being jailed for life, even though the Swedish authorities
have sought to allay such concerns. No formal charges have been filed
against him.

In the statement detailing his account of his relationship with his
accuser, referred to as “SW,” whom he met in August 2010, Mr. Assange
railed against the Swedish authorities, saying that he had been forced
to endure “six years of unlawful, politicized detention without charge.”

He said that, as a result of the American government’s aggressive stance
toward WikiLeaks, his bank cards were blocked after he arrived in Sweden
in 2010, forcing him to depend on the hospitality of others.

During his trip, he said, he met a woman, who “made it very clear that
she wanted to have sexual intercourse with me.” After having sex several
times that night and the next morning, he says they parted amicably. But
several days later she called to say that she was at a hospital and
asked him to meet her there to be tested for sexually transmitted
diseases.

Because he was busy dealing with “escalating political and legal
threats” from the Pentagon, he said, he agreed to meet her the next
day in a nearby park at lunchtime. “You can imagine my disbelief,” he
told investigators, “when I woke the next morning to the news that I had
been arrested in my absence for ‘rape’ and that the police were
‘hunting’ all over Stockholm for me.”

“I immediately made myself available to Swedish authorities to clarify
any questions that might exist, even though I had no obligation to do
so,” he said.

In the interview, Mr. Assange criticized the Swedish authorities, saying
that despite the fact that the chief prosecutor of Stockholm, Eva Finne,
had closed her investigation and said that no crime had been committed,
another Swedish prosecutor had reopened an investigation and issued an
extradition warrant for his arrest.

Citing a determination by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention that the Swedish and British governments had “arbitrarily
detained” him since 2010, Mr. Assange said that he had been denied due
process and had endured “cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.”

In August 2015, prosecutors dropped their investigation into two
possible charges — one of unlawful coercion, another of sexual
molestation — after running out of time to question Mr. Assange. But he
still faces the more serious accusation of rape.

In October 2015, the London police [ended their round-the-clock
surveillance](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/world/europe/london-police-end-24-hour-watch-at-embassy-housing-julian-assange.html)
outside the embassy, but they said they were prepared to arrest Mr.
Assange if he tried to leave the compound.
