MOSCOW — Carter Page, an early foreign policy adviser to Donald J. Trump
who was [scrutinized by the
F.B.I.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html)
on suspicion of private communications with senior Russian officials
over the summer, was back in Moscow on Thursday.

Mr. Page was closelipped about the purpose of his visit, [telling RIA
Novosti](https://sputniknews.com/russia/201612081048303433-trump-adviser-russia-talks/),
a Russian state-run news agency, that he would stay in Moscow until
Tuesday and would meet with “business leaders and thought leaders.”

Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called [Global
Energy Capital](http://globalenergycapital.com/), drew attention during
the summer for a speech that criticized the United States and other
Western nations for a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as
democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” in Russia and
in other parts of the former Soviet Union.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

He worked as an investment banker in Russia for at least three years in
the 2000s, advising on [several major
transactions](http://globalenergycap.com/management/) involving Russian
state companies. Mr. Page’s extensive business links in Russia prompted
suggestions that he might be serving Mr. Trump as a [back-channel
liaison](https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-s-intel-officials-probe-ties-between-trump-adviser-and-kremlin-175046002.html)
with senior Kremlin
officials.

Mr. Page dismissed the accusations, calling the F.B.I. investigation a
“witch hunt.”

Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told journalists that
government leaders in Moscow had no plans to meet with Mr. Page and that
they had never had any contact with him. “We have learned about this
from the press,” Mr. Peskov told the news agency Interfax.

Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, said officials at
his department had no plans to meet with Mr. Page.

In Russia’s Parliament, Leonid E. Slutsky of the international affairs
committee dismissed talk of Mr. Page as a foreign policy adviser to Mr.
Trump, even though the American president-elect [told the Washington
Post editorial
board](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/21/a-transcript-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/?utm_term=.e7c8cc4f1c13)
in March that he was.

“He is not Mr. Trump’s adviser. He is an impostor who likes to make a
lot of media noise about himself,” Mr. Slutsky said.

In his previous visit to Moscow, in July, Mr. Page gave a speech at a
graduation ceremony at the New Economic School, a Moscow university. At
the time, he insisted that he had traveled to Russia as a private
person.

[Speaking to
CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/09/25/sotu-carter-page-2.cnn)
in September, Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, said that
Mr. Page was not part of the Trump team and that he was not authorized
to speak to Russian officials on its behalf.
