UNITED NATIONS --- António Guterres
\href{http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55783\#.WE8hjbIrK72}{took
the oath of office} on Monday to become the next secretary general of
the United Nations amid a rise in nationalist movements around the world
and what he called a loss of confidence in institutions, including the
one he will take over in January.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/world/americas/united-nations-un-antonio-guterres.html}{next
United Nations leader} would already have faced tough challenges: war,
climate change, widening income inequality, record levels of global
displacement. But the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the
United States has changed the incoming secretary general's approach to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/world/americas/united-nations-trump-climate-change-iran-cuba.html}{virtually
every major crisis}, a wide array of United Nations diplomats said in
recent weeks, outlining three particularly vexing conundrums.

The first is that even as he needs commitment from the United States,
the single largest funder of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres will be
under pressure to call out American leaders if they flout the basic
values of the United Nations Charter, including ``respect, human rights,
tolerance and solidarity,'' as he described them to the packed General
Assembly hall on Monday.

``The threats to these values are most often based on fear,''
\href{http://webtv.un.org/watch/secretary-general-designate-ant\%C3\%B3nio-guterres-statement-after-the-oath-of-office-general-assembly-60th-plenary-meeting/5244687141001}{he
said}. ``Our duty to the people we serve is to work together to move
from fear of each other to trust in each other. Trust in the values that
bind us, and trust in the institutions that serve and protect us.''

Second, he has to ensure that Mr. Trump does not severely cut United
States funding for the United Nations or dismiss the institution
altogether as a platform for solving global problems.

The third conundrum is Syria, which Mr. Guterres staked out as his top
priority when he campaigned for the job. Mr. Trump has suggested he
wants to join Russia in routing the Islamic State from Syria, even if
that approach means keeping the country's strongman, Bashar al-Assad, in
power. If he goes along, Mr. Guterres, a canny, well-connected
politician who has cast himself as a champion of human rights, will face
the prospect of endorsing a leader widely accused of committing war
crimes.

In his speech on Monday, he laid out his priorities while reassuring
world powers he has their interests at heart. In a pitch to the incoming
Republican administration, Mr. Guterres said he would make the United
Nations more ``nimble'' and ``efficient'' and promised ``management
reform,'' shorthand for cost cutting. There is widespread concern among
United Nations diplomats that Mr. Trump, who has dismissed the value of
global cooperation, at least on the campaign trail, could kneecap the
organization, going well beyond the gutting of specific programs, like
reproductive rights, targeted by previous Republican administrations.

Mr. Guterres committed the United Nations to fighting terrorism, a nod
to Russia, which, according to several diplomats, is angling for the
creation of a new senior post that would oversee counterterrorism
efforts. That is a tricky proposition: Some Western diplomats have
suggested that counterterrorism is an area of potential cooperation with
the Kremlin, while critics warn that under the Russian president,
Vladimir V. Putin, the fight against terrorism is a dangerously blunt
weapon.

Mr. Guterres, a former Socialist prime minister of Portugal and for 10
years the head of the United Nations refugee agency, spent much of his
speech discussing the importance of preventing conflict; diplomats have
said in recent days that he is considering making that a top priority.

He warned against using human rights ``as a means to a political end''
and spoke about the paradox of globalization: It has spawned ``growing
inequalities'' along with the tendency of people to ``live within their
own bubbles.'' He extended a rhetorical olive branch to those who had
``lost confidence not only in their governments but in global
institutions, including the United Nations.''

His greatest challenge will almost certainly lie in how he deals with
the Trump administration. In his speech on Monday he signaled he would
be gentle, for now.

Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for Mr. Guterres's transition team, said
Mr. Guterres had not yet met with the Trump transition team, but the two
are expected to speak by phone soon.

Mr. Guterres said nothing about Mr. Trump during his speech. Asked about
his message to the president-elect, he told reporters only that he would
show ``a clear will to cooperate in relation to the enormous challenges
we will be facing together.''

Mr. Guterres is under heightened pressure to recruit women to his
administration. Many diplomats had campaigned for a woman to lead the
organization for the first time in 70 years, and Mr. Guterres has
promised gender parity in his senior leadership.

A reminder of his promise comes on Tuesday, when a group of mostly
female diplomats is expected to unveil an exhibition on the
contributions of women to the United Nations. A recent analysis found
that women held just over 20 percent of the top jobs in the United
Nations Secretariat, a far cry from what the General Assembly set out to
achieve by 2000: a 50-50 balance.
