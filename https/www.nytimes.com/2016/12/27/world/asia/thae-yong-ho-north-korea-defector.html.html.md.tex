SEOUL, South Korea --- A senior North Korean official who defected to
the South told reporters on Tuesday that the North viewed 2017 as the
best time to advance its nuclear program because it could take advantage
of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea.

The official, Thae Yong-ho, North Korea's No. 2 diplomat in London, is
the most senior North Korean official to defect in nearly two decades.
At a news conference with South Korean reporters --- his first meeting
with outside journalists
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/world/asia/north-korea-defector-thae-yong-ho-britain.html}{since
his defection in August} --- he cautioned that as a diplomat, he was not
privy to the status of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

Yet he said North Korea was also confident that China would not punish
it too harshly for its nuclear program, out of fear that the North's
collapse would create a pro-American, unified Korea on its border.

``North Korea knows this weakness of China,'' Mr. Thae said. ``As long
as Kim Jong-un is in power, North Korea will never give up its nuclear
weapons, even if it's offered \$1 trillion or \$10 trillion in
rewards.''

The foreign news media was not allowed into Mr. Thae's 150-minute news
conference in Seoul with local reporters. But a transcript revealed Mr.
Thae's thoughts on his home country and its leader, Mr. Kim.

He said Mr. Kim did not consider his nuclear weapons program a
bargaining chip but rather sought to deal with the United States after
being recognized as a nuclear power, a status Washington has pledged not
to grant.

This year, North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and launched more
than 20 ballistic missiles, and it has openly vowed to develop the
ability to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead.

President-elect
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html}{Donald
J. Trump has indicated} that he was open to allowing Japan and South
Korea to manufacture their own nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, an
idea that drew a withering response from the Obama administration, which
said the idea flouted decades of nonproliferation policy.

South Korea will hold a presidential election next year.

Mr. Thae, a career diplomat, served in Denmark and Sweden before he was
assigned to the North Korean Embassy in London about 10 years ago. In
London, he was spotted delivering speeches at far-left events, including
meetings of the British Communist Party, where he would speak
passionately in defense of North Korea.

On Tuesday, he spoke of frustration as a North Korean diplomat abroad.

He said that North Korea paid its ambassadors only \$900 to \$1,100 a
month, making its diplomats desperate for an extra income through work
outside the embassy. The diplomats live a communal life inside their
embassy to save costs, he added.

But he said they enjoyed one luxury the elites back in the North could
not: They had access to the internet and could read news from South
Korea, including updates about the lives of North Korean defectors.

Mr. Thae said that back in the North, the totalitarian regime was so
paranoid about outside information affecting its people that it kept
surveillance on diplomats who had returned home for fear they might
spread outside news, even though DVDs smuggled in from China have made
South Korean movies and soap operas increasingly popular in the North.

Mr. Thae himself was an avid fan of South Korean soap operas.

South Korea has hailed his defection as a sign of loosening loyalty
among the North Korean elite. The North called him ``human scum'' and
said he had fled after embezzling state funds and sexually assaulting a
minor.

Mr. Thae denied these accusations on Tuesday and said his
disillusionment with Mr. Kim had deepened after
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/world/asia/execution-raises-doubts-about-kims-grip-on-north-korea.html}{the
execution of many officials}, including the leader's uncle, Jang
Song-thaek, in an attempt to tighten his control through a reign of
terror.

The North Korean government requires its diplomats to leave some of
their family members back home, holding them as hostages against
potential defections. Mr. Thae said he was lucky because he could defect
to the South with his wife and two children.

North Korean diplomats are also required to monitor one another to
thwart treason. But Mr. Thae said there were holes in the surveillance,
although he declined to divulge details of how he had defected.

``It's a human world, and it's impossible to monitor someone
constantly,'' he said.
