SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s Constitutional Court formally opened
President Park Geun-hye’s impeachment trial on Tuesday, despite the
absence of Ms. Park, whose lawyers said she was unlikely to attend any
of the proceedings.

The nine-member court has until June to decide whether Ms. Park, whose
powers have been suspended since the National Assembly [voted on Dec. 9
to impeach
her](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
over a corruption scandal, will be reinstated or removed from office.

The court, which had held three [preliminary
hearings](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-impeachment.html)
on Ms. Park’s impeachment, convened in full for the first time on
Tuesday, with the intent of inviting her to respond to the National
Assembly’s charges and answer questions. But she did not appear, and the
hearing was adjourned after nine minutes.

A lawyer for the president, Lee Joong-hwan, said after the hearing that
Ms. Park would make her case through her attorneys. “She won’t appear in
court unless there is an exceptionally special reason to do so,” Mr. Lee
said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By law, Ms. Park cannot be compelled to testify. If she declines to
appear for a second time, the court can proceed without her. Chief
Justice Park Han-chul, who is not related to the president, said that
the next hearing would be held on Thursday and that oral arguments would
begin regardless of whether Ms. Park attends. Four former or current
presidential aides were also asked to testify on Thursday.

“We recognize the weighty significance this case has in our nation’s
constitutional order,” Chief Justice Park said. “We will do our best to
ensure an utterly fair and appropriate trial.”

Ms. Park has been accused of conspiring with a longtime friend and
confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to [extort $69 million from South Korean
businesses](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-samsung.html).
In its impeachment motion, the National Assembly characterized the money
as bribes. The legislature also accused Ms. Park of undermining freedom
of the press by cracking down on her critics and of shirking her duty to
protect citizens’ lives by neglecting to respond efficiently to a [ferry
disaster
in 2014](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/12/world/asia/12ferry-timeline.html)
that killed more than 300 people.

No South Korean president has been forced out of office through
impeachment. The National Assembly voted in 2004 to [impeach President
Roh
Moo-hyun](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/13/world/president-s-impeachment-stirs-angry-protests-in-south-korea.html),
but the Constitutional Court [reinstated
him](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/world/constitutional-court-reinstates-south-korea-s-impeached-president.html),
ruling that his violations of election law were too minor to justify
ending his presidency. Mr. Roh did not attend the court’s hearings on
his impeachment.

The charges against Ms. Park are much more serious than those Mr. Roh
faced, and they have infuriated the public. [Large crowds have
gathered](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html)
in central Seoul for the past 10 consecutive Saturdays demanding an end
to her presidency. Small groups of protesters gathered Tuesday outside
the Constitutional Court, some calling for Ms. Park’s ouster and others
supporting her.

After Ms. Choi was arrested on extortion charges in November, Ms. Park
promised to cooperate with prosecutors investigating the scandal. But
she later refused to be questioned by them, calling them politically
biased. Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office, but the
prosecutors’ indictment of Ms. Choi [names her as an
accomplice](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea-extortion-accomplice-prosecutors.html).

While refusing to testify or be questioned, Ms. Park has vehemently
asserted her innocence in other forums. She did so again on Sunday, in a
meeting with South Korean reporters at the presidential Blue House,
arguing that the allegations against her had been fabricated.

Kweon Seong-dong, who leads the legal team arguing for impeachment
before the Constitutional Court, chided Ms. Park for speaking to
reporters but not appearing in court. “If she had anything to say, she
should have appeared at court, out of courtesy for the judges,” Mr.
Kweon said after Tuesday’s hearing.
