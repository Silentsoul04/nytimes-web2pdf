Having signaled a tough attitude and tightened purse strings toward the
United Nations, President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by phone on
Wednesday with the organization’s [newly installed secretary
general](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/antonio-guterres-united-nations.html),
António Guterres, who has hinted at his own plans for budget restraint.

A United Nations spokesman, Farhan Haq, said at a regular daily briefing
that Mr. Guterres had initiated the conversation. “This was an
introductory call,” Mr. Haq said, adding that “it went quite well.” He
said the two men had discussed “a number of avenues for participation
and cooperation,” but he did not elaborate on them.

A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Sean Spicer, also did not specify what had
been discussed except to say in a statement that the incoming
administration would demand “some reform and change” to ensure that the
organization used American tax dollars effectively.

Mr. Trump has criticized the United Nations in statements and Twitter
posts, describing it as an organization that causes problems rather than
resolving them. He has threatened to renounce the [Paris
agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html)
on tackling climate change that was a signature achievement of Mr.
Guterres’s predecessor, Ban Ki-moon.

Mr. Trump also denounced the Security Council’s Dec. 23 resolution
[condemning Israeli
settlements](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-settlements-un-vote.html)
and criticized the Obama administration’s decision not to veto that
measure. “As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,” he
wrote in a [Twitter
message](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/812390964740427776),
referring to his administration’s first day in office.

Three days later, Mr. Trump [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/813500123053490176)
that the United Nations was “just a club for people to get together,
talk and have a good time.

“So sad\!”

Mr. Guterres, formerly the top official of the United Nations refugee
agency and a onetime prime minister of Portugal, took over as secretary
general after Mr. Ban’s term ended on Dec. 31. Like all secretaries
general, he is mindful that the United States is the largest donor to
the budgets of the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations, which
together total about $13 billion.

Although Mr. Guterres has not specified what he might do differently in
the budget, Mr. Haq hinted on Wednesday that the new secretary general
was looking for ways to economize, announcing the creation of a
committee that will look into “reorganization for greater efficiency.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Guterres’s first full day on the job, he diplomatically
pushed back on Mr. Trump’s criticisms of the organization. Asked by
reporters if he was concerned about the president-elect’s statements,
Mr. Guterres said: “No. I’m concerned with all the terrible problems we
face in the world.”

The new Security Council president for the month of January, Ambassador
Olof Skoog of Sweden, was more pointed in his reaction when asked on
Tuesday about Mr. Trump’s descriptions of the United Nations.

“Do we have fun in the U.N.?” Mr. Skoog said. “Yeah, but we also work
very hard.”
