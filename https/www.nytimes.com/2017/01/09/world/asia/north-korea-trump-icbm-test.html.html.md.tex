SEOUL, South Korea --- Less than a week after Donald J. Trump taunted
North Korea over its ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has
said that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental missile
``anytime and anywhere'' in a rebuke to the incoming president.

Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the
United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can
reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never
tested a long-range missile that could fly over the Pacific.

\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/world/asia/north-korea-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-test-kim-jong-un.html}{In
a New Year's Day speech}, Kim Jong-un, North Korea's leader, said his
country had reached a ``final stage'' in preparing to test an
intercontinental ballistic missile. That drew
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/world/asia/trump-twitter-north-korea-missiles-china.html}{a
Twitter post the next day} from Mr. Trump that said, ``It won't
happen!''

On Sunday, an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign
Ministry told the North's official Korean Central News Agency, ``The
ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by our supreme
leadership.''

The spokesman's remarks, made public on the KCNA website Monday, were in
response to comments last Thursday by Antony J. Blinken, the United
States deputy secretary of state, that North Korea had made
\href{https://www.state.gov/s/d/2017d/266602.htm}{``a qualitative
improvement''} in its missile capabilities over the past year. And he
said Washington and its allies would continue ``comprehensive, sustained
pressure and sanctions'' against the North.

On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, Ashton B. Carter, the departing
secretary of defense, said the United States would shoot down a North
Korean missile ``if it were coming towards our territory or the
territory of our friends and allies.''

It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable
ICBM. Although it has displayed the road-mobile KN-08, believed to be
its first ICBM, during military parades in recent years, it has never
flight-tested that system.

In the past year, however, North Korea has boasted of successfully
testing key technologies, such as long-range missile engines and heat
shields for an ICBM.

Last Tuesday, John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department, said
Washington did not believe that North Korea had achieved its goal of
tipping long-range missiles with nuclear warheads, though it continued
to ``march in that direction.''

North Korea has sought to develop by early 2018 miniaturized nuclear
weapons that can fit atop a missile capable of reaching the United
States, Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected, told
the Yonhap news agency of South Korea on Sunday.
