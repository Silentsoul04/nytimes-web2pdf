HarperCollins is withdrawing the digital edition of Monica Crowley's
2012 book ``What the (Bleep) Just Happened?'' from retailers, after
evidence of plagiarism.

Its decision to recall the book comes after a
\href{http://money.cnn.com/interactive/news/kfile-trump-monica-crowley-plagiarized-multiple-sources-2012-book/?sr=fbmoney010717kfile-trump-monica-crowley-plagiarized-multiple-sources-2012-book0531PMStoryLink\&linkId=33126237\&sr=twCNN010717/?sr=fbmoney010717kfile}{report}
by CNN that Ms. Crowley, a conservative columnist and TV personality who
was chosen by President-elect Donald J. Trump for a high-ranking
communications role at the National Security Council, had included
plagiarized passages from Wikipedia and newspaper articles.

``The book, which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will
no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the
opportunity to source and revise the material,'' HarperCollins said in a
statement on Tuesday.

The book, which took aim at Barack Obama's presidency and policies, was
a modest commercial success, selling around 20,000 hardcover copies,
according to Publishers Marketplace. Ms. Crowley's book was published by
Broadside Books, a conservative imprint at HarperCollins; it included
identical language to passages published by other sources without
attributing credit --- in some 50 instances --- CNN reported over the
weekend. More examples of plagiarism surfaced in Ms. Crowley's Ph.D.
dissertation, according to
\href{http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-columbia-214612}{Politico},
which found more than a dozen examples of passages that had been lifted
from scholarly works.

While publishers typically have nonfiction books vetted by their legal
departments, most do not check for plagiarism, fabrication or factual
inaccuracies. As a result, nonfiction books often contain errors and,
every so often, plagiarism.

These types of offenses once signified the end of an author's career.
But publishers have seemed more willing to give writers a second chance.
Last year, Simon \& Schuster published a book by Jonah Lehrer, whose
previous books for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt were recalled after it was
revealed that Mr. Lehrer had plagiarized passages, recycled his own work
and fabricated quotations. James Frey, who fabricated portions of his
memoir, ``A Million Little Pieces,'' about his drug addiction, made a
comeback as a young-adult novelist and publisher.

In Ms. Crowley's case, the evidence seemed clear enough: CNN highlighted
many instances where text had been lifted from other sources and
presented passages with the original material to stress similarities.

HarperCollins's decision to withdraw the book put it at odds with Mr.
Trump's transition team, which vigorously defended Ms. Crowley and
dismissed the charges of plagiarism as ``a politically motivated
attack.''

``Monica's exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this
country around is exactly why she will be serving in the
administration,'' Mr. Trump's transition team said a statement to CNN.
``HarperCollins --- one of the largest and most respected publishers in
the world --- published her book, which has become a national best
seller. Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a
politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues
facing this country.''
