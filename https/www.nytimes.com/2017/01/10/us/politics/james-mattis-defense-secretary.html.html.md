WASHINGTON — The prospects for James N. Mattis to serve as secretary of
defense in the Trump administration received a boost on Tuesday when two
experts in military policy recommended that an exception be made so Mr.
Mattis, a retired four-star general, can assume the top Pentagon post.

Military officers are barred by law from serving as defense secretary
unless they have been retired for seven years. General Mattis left
military active duty in May 2013.

Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who leads the Senate Armed
Services Committee and has strongly supported General Mattis’s
nomination, convened a hearing on Tuesday that was intended to give
committee members, particularly Democrats, a chance to explore the issue
of civilian control of the military, including the legislation that
would be needed to enable General Mattis to take the Defense Department
job.

Eliot A. Cohen, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies, who served as the State Department counselor
during the administration of George W. Bush, said at the hearing that
“the principal of civilian control of the military is precious.”

But Mr. Cohen, who signed a letter during the campaign arguing that
Donald J. Trump was unfit to serve as commander in chief, argued that an
exception should be made because General Mattis was a person of
integrity, had important experience at a time when the Pentagon has to
contend with multiple threats and might dissuade the incoming
administration from acting recklessly.

“A Secretary Mattis would be a stabilizing and moderating force,
preventing wildly stupid, dangerous and illegal things from happening,
and over time helping to steer American foreign and security policy in a
sound and sensible direction,” Mr. Cohen said.

Kathleen H. Hicks, with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, told the hearing that it was appropriate to make an exception
for General Mattis, and praised his character and expertise. But she
stressed that this was the sort of exception that should be made only
rarely.

“I assess the state of U.S. civil-military relations to be strong enough
to withstand any risk such a once-in-two-generations exception, on its
own, could pose,” she said.

The only previous case in which a legal exception was made so that a
military officer could become defense secretary was George C. Marshall.
Faced with the Korean War and growing tensions with the Soviet Union,
Congress passed an amendment in 1950 allowing General Marshall to become
the Pentagon chief.

After the hearing, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat,
said she still had “grave concerns” about allowing General Mattis to
become defense secretary.

But there was little opposition from other members of the panel. Senator
Jeane Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said that Mr. Cohen’s
assertion that General Mattis could be a stabilizing force within the
Trump administration was the “strongest argument” in favor of confirming
the retired Marine general.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked for advice on
crafting legislation to ensure that confirming General Mattis would not
open the door for similar nominations of recently retired officers to
run the Pentagon. Mr. Cohen said that one way to avoid that would be to
require that any future nominee be retired from the military for at
least a decade.

General Mattis is scheduled to testify on Thursday before the committee,
which is expected to approve his nomination and the proposed
legislation. General Mattis’s supporters hope President Obama will sign
the legislation before leaving office.
