As a candidate back in July 2015, Donald J. Trump promised that he would
repeal Obamacare and replace it with “something terrific.”

The Senate voted, 51 to 48, on Thursday morning for a measure setting
Congress on the path toward repealing President Obama’s health care law,
and Mr. Trump is now a few days from taking office. The public, however,
knows little more about his proposal than it did in 2015.

In comments [to The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/repeal-affordable-care-act-donald-trump.html)
on Tuesday and in his news [conference on
Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html),
Mr. Trump described when a Republican health reform bill would be
released — “very quickly.” But he has yet to give details about the
policies it would contain.

“We’re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far
better,” he said Wednesday.

Mr. Trump accurately describes problems with the current health care
system for Americans under 65: “You have deductibles that are so high,
that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through
the roof, the health care can’t even be used by them because their
deductibles bills are so high.”

[Mitch
McConnell](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcript-january-8-2017-mcconnell-priebus-booker-morell-woolsey/),
the Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Paul Ryan have also spoken
forcefully in recent days about how health care is too expensive.

Premiums for health insurance plans in the United States are high. And
[increasing
deductibles](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/business/health-insurance-analysis-kaiser.html)
can make needed coverage a financial stretch [even for the
insured](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/upshot/lost-jobs-houses-savings-even-insured-often-face-crushing-medical-debt.html).
[Recent
polling](http://kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-health-care-priorities-for-2017/)
from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that the public
agrees with Mr. Trump’s assessment: High out-of-pocket spending on
health care is Americans’ No. 1 health care concern. (Mr. Trump has
promised that he will not make major changes to Medicare, the program
for Americans 65 and older.)

But solving those problems is not as easy as identifying them. The real
reason health care premiums and deductibles are so high is that medical
care is very expensive in the United States — [far more
costly](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA) than it is
anywhere else in the world. The United States pays very high prices to
doctors and hospitals and drug and device makers, and Americans use a
lot of that expensive medical care. That means that the country spent
far more on health care than its peers even when tens of millions of
Americans lacked health coverage.

Obamacare has been successful in getting health insurance to people who
lacked it before. About 20 million more Americans had insurance last
year than before the law passed, according to [an Obama administration
estimate](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf).
But the health law, largely focused on health insurance regulation, did
not drive down the cost of medical treatments. Health care, and health
insurance, continues to be expensive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That means that a Republican health reform plan that is both cheaper and
better than Obamacare will be hard to deliver.

Republicans in Congress and right-leaning think tanks have put together
a number of possible Obamacare replacement plans. They are all slightly
different, and it is unclear which one Mr. Trump and congressional
leaders will choose. But none of them solve both sides of the “less
expensive and far better” equation.

Most of the G.O.P. plans manage to be less expensive for the federal
government — by offering stingier federal payments in helping people buy
insurance and allowing the coverage people buy to be skimpier. But those
proposals will tend to increase, not decrease, the amount many Americans
spend on their health care.

[Lower-income people will end up paying a larger
share](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/upshot/walker-and-rubio-health-proposals-are-less-concerned-about-poor.html)
of their income to buy coverage than they do under Obamacare.
Deductibles and other forms of out-of-pocket spending, capped under
Obamacare, will tend to rise in many plans. Millions to tens of millions
fewer Americans will have coverage under such plans, according to
independent estimates.

Republicans also want to pare back the minimum package of benefits that
plans must cover, which will drive up costs substantially for some
patients, while reducing them for others. If the bill eliminates
requirements to pay for [maternity
care](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/why-is-maternity-care-such-an-issue-for-obamacare-opponents/281396/)
or prescription drugs, for example, that could lower the sticker price
of a health plan, but will make health care much more expensive for
anyone who has a baby or takes medication.

There will be people who will be better off under a Republican plan.
Higher-income, healthy people who buy their own insurance have been the
most disadvantaged group under Obamacare, and their fortunes would
improve. The Republican plans, with their skimpier benefits, and more
generous tax assistance for the wealthy, would offer them a better deal.

The G.O.P. plans tend to be worse for people who need insurance and are
poor or have major health problems. (Some sick people may be far worse
off. Mr. Trump has promised that people with [pre-existing health
conditions will be
covered](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/upshot/why-keeping-only-the-popular-parts-of-obamacare-wont-work.html)
under his plan, but not all the Republican plans offer them the kind of
coverage that they can get under Obamacare.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Affordable Care Act is a case study in these trade-offs. Most of the
things its creators did to try to make health insurance “far better,”
like requiring minimum benefits or banning lifetime coverage limits,
also made it more expensive. The things they did to make insurance “less
expensive,” like encouraging higher deductibles or requiring all
Americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine, are top anti-Obamacare
talking points.

The consensus Democratic approach to making Obamacare “far better” has
been to make it more expensive for the federal government, but less
expensive for individuals. Proposals circulated by President Obama and
Hillary Clinton would involve more federal spending on subsidies to help
make insurance more affordable for more people, but at the expense of
higher taxes.

So far, the Republican plans have tended to engage in the same
trade-offs, but tilt in the opposite direction, emphasizing government
savings over program generosity.

The recent statements from Mr. Trump suggest that the coming replacement
plan — promised in the next few weeks — will be able to achieve both
goals simultaneously. Mr. Trump has provided almost no detail about what
will be in it.
