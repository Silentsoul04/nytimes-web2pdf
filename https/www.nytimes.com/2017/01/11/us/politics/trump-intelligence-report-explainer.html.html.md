*How did American intelligence officials come to brief President Obama,
President-elect Donald J. Trump and lawmakers about* [*supposed Russian
plans*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html "Times article.")
*to blackmail Mr. Trump? There are far more questions than answers. But
here is a look at the story so far.*

## What We Know

■ In September 2015, a Washington political research firm, Fusion GPS,
paid by a wealthy Republican donor who did not like Mr. Trump, [began to
compile](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html "Times article.")
“**opposition research**” on him — standard practice in politics.

■ Last June, after evidence of Russian hacking of Democratic targets
surfaced, Fusion GPS **hired a retired British intelligence officer,
Christopher Steele,** to investigate Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia.

■ After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee,
Democratic clients who supported Hillary Clinton **began to pay Fusion
GPS** for this same opposition research.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

■ Mr. Steele, who had long experience in Russia and a network of
connections there, compiled **dozens of reports** detailing what he
heard from his contacts. The memos he wrote, mostly one to three pages
long, are dated from June to December.

■ The memos contain **unsubstantiated claims** **that Russian officials
tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump** by preparing to blackmail him
with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals.

They also claim that the Trump campaign met with Russian operatives to
discuss the Russians’ hacking and leaking of emails and documents from
the Democratic National Committee and from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign
chairman, John D. Podesta.

■ Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele shared the memos first with their clients,
and later with the F.B.I. and multiple journalists at The New York Times
and elsewhere.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The memos, totaling about 35 pages, also **reached a number of members
of Congress**.

■ Last week, when **the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency gave
a classified report** on the Russian hacking, leaking and efforts to
influence the presidential election to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and
congressional leaders, they attached a two-page summary of the
unverified allegations in the
memos.

<div class="css-17dprlf" data-id="100000004799217" data-slug="news-tips-article-promo" style="max-width:580px">

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## What We Don’t Know

■ Whether any of the claims in the memos are true. American intelligence
agencies have not confirmed them, and **Mr. Trump has said they are a
complete fabrication**.

In addition, one specific allegation — that Mr. Trump’s lawyer Michael
Cohen met with a Russian official in Prague in August or September — has
been denied by both Mr. Cohen, who says he has never been to Prague, and
the Russian, Oleg Solodukhin.

■ Who concocted the information in the memos, if it is entirely false or
partly so, and with what purpose. If all the information in the dossier
is false, it **is a very sophisticated fabrication.**

■ What exactly prompted American intelligence officials to pass on a
summary of the unvetted claims to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and Congress.
Officials have said they felt the president-elect should be aware of the
memos, which had circulated widely in Washington. But putting the
summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the
executive branch made it **very likely that it would be leaked**.

## What will happen now?

The F.B.I. has been investigating the claims in the memos, and Democrats
are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that Trump
representatives met with Russian officials during the campaign. But as
of Jan. 20, **Mr. Trump will be in charge of the bureau** **and the
other intelligence agencies**, and he may not approve such an
investigation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Why can’t I read the memos on your website?

Because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on Mr.
Trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor
The Times has been able to verify, Times editors decided to briefly
summarize the claims and not publish the
document.

## Why did The Times report extensively on the hacking of the Democratic Party, but not this?

The Times did
[report](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html "Times article.")
before the election that the F.B.I. was investigating claims about Mr.
Trump’s ties to Russia — an article that resulted from an extensive
reporting effort. The Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails
were public, their authenticity was not in doubt, and they contained
newsworthy
information.

## Why did the F.B.I. director write two letters about Clinton’s emails, but not this?

That is a question the director, James B. Comey, may eventually have to
answer. His two public statements about the bureau’s investigation of
the Clinton emails [broke with long F.B.I.
tradition](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html "Times article.").

## Why did the news media not raise this during the campaign?

Many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the
claims in the memos but were unsuccessful.

## So what changed on Tuesday? Why is this now being reported?

CNN [broke the
news](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/ "CNN article.")
that a summary of the memos had been attached to the classified report
by the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency on the Russian
hacking and leaking, and that it had been given to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump
and congressional leaders last week. That level of official attention
prompted news organizations to decide to inform the public about the
memos.
