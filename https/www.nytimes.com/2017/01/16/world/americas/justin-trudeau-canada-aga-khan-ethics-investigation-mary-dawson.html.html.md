OTTAWA — Canada’s federal conflict-of-interest and ethics office
confirmed on Monday that it is investigating the propriety of Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau and his family’s spending part of the Christmas
holidays as guests of the Aga Khan, the billionaire philanthropist and
spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims, on a private island in the Bahamas.

Jocelyne Brisebois, a spokeswoman for the ethics commissioner, Mary
Dawson, said in an email that an inquiry is being conducted under
Canada’s [conflict-of-interest
act](http://ciec-ccie.parl.gc.ca/EN/Pages/ConflictOfInterestAct.aspx)but
offered no details about its scope or timing.

Ms. Dawson said earlier that she would speak to Mr. Trudeau about
separate allegations that he had broken conflict-of-interest laws by
[attending Liberal Party fund-raising
events](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/world/americas/canada-justin-trudeau-donors.html),
where small numbers of people met the prime minister after making
donations of 1,500 Canadian dollars apiece, or about $1,100.

The two inquires threaten to tarnish the image of Mr. Trudeau, who has
long promised to conduct politics in a transparent manner. The penalty
of any finding against Mr. Trudeau, however, would be mostly political.
Violations of these conflict-of-interest laws are not crimes and bring
comparatively small fines in the worst cases.

Citing remarks made by Mr. Trudeau on Friday, Cameron Ahmad, his press
secretary, wrote in an email that “we are happy to engage with the
commissioner and answer any questions she may have.”

The latest inquiry appears to have been the result of complaints to Ms.
Dawson by two Conservative opposition members of Parliament.

In a letter to Blaine Calkins, one of the complainants, Ms. Dawson said
she was looking into possible violations of rules barring cabinet
ministers from accepting free transportation. Mr. Trudeau and his family
traveled to the Aga Khan’s island from Nassau on his private helicopter.

According to the letter, the commissioner will also review whether the
vacation itself broke the rules because the Aga Khan and his charities
have dealings with the government.

The government of Canada over decades has donated millions of dollars to
foreign aid programs run by charities led by the Aga Khan. The previous
Conservative government agreed to match a donation of 30 million
Canadian dollars from the Aga Khan to establish a [Global Center for
Pluralism](http://www.pluralism.ca/en/) in Ottawa.

The Aga Khan has established several institutions in Canada without the
government’s help, including [a museum of Muslim art in
Toronto](http://www.akdn.org/where-we-work/north-america/canada/aga-khan-museum).

The Aga Khan was a friend of Mr. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Elliott
Trudeau, a former prime minister.
