WASHINGTON --- Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina on Wednesday became
the latest cabinet nominee to show daylight with President-elect Donald
J. Trump, declaring that Russia was guilty of war crimes in Syria and
that it should also be subject to additional sanctions for its
incursions into Ukraine.

Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her
confirmation hearing as ambassador to the United Nations, Ms. Haley
said: ``Russia is trying to show their muscle right now. It's what they
do.'' She added: ``I don't think we can trust them. We have to continue
to be very strong back, and show them what this new administration is
going to be.''

Ms. Haley said she believed the Russians were guilty of war crimes in
bombing the Syrian city of Aleppo. At his hearing last week, Rex W.
Tillerson, Mr. Trump's nominee for secretary of state, declined to call
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a war criminal for ordering the
bombing of civilians there or in Chechnya.

Ms. Haley, a rising star in Republican politics and the daughter of
Indian immigrants, fared better with senators than Mr. Tillerson did.
While both were grilled on topics including Russia and the banning of
Muslim immigrants, Ms. Haley showed flashes of humor, seemed well
prepared and parted company with Mr. Trump diplomatically.

Asked if she favored establishing a registry for Muslims in the United
States --- an idea Mr. Trump proposed during the presidential campaign
--- she said no, but then suggested that no longer reflected his views
either. ``This administration and I do not think there should be any
registry,'' she said.

Ms. Haley staked her strongest position on an issue of central concern
to Republicans and many Democrats, and one on which she and Mr. Trump
are aligned: the United Nations' stormy relationship with Israel.

``Any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds
with U.S. interests,'' Ms. Haley said, noting the 20 United Nations
resolutions critical of Israel --- more than against Syria, Iran or
North Korea. ``This cannot continue,'' she said, also criticizing the
Obama administration's abstention from the latest United Nations
Security Council resolution condemning Israel's settlement construction.

``I will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that
comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the United
States,'' she said. Also, noting the United States' large financial
contributions to the United Nations, she asked, ``Are we getting what we
pay for?''

In her opening statement, Ms. Haley acknowledged she was a newcomer to
the rituals of international diplomacy and the mechanics of the United
Nations. But she said she was steeped in diplomacy because she practiced
it every day in the governor's mansion in South Carolina, whether in
attracting foreign manufacturers to open factories in her state or
leading the fight to remove a Confederate battle flag from statehouse
property after the deadly church shooting in Charleston in 2015.

Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking
Democrat on the committee, praised Ms. Haley for the latter decision,
even as he told her, ``I am concerned with your lack of foreign policy
experience.''

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/nikki-haley-donald-trump-un-ambassador.html}{Mr.
Trump's choice of Ms. Haley} was mildly surprising, and not just because
of her background. In 2016, delivering the Republican response to
President Obama's State of the Union address, she criticized Mr. Trump's
campaign. Later in the primary, she was a frequent critic of Mr. Trump
and supported one of his opponents, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.

Some of Ms. Haley's toughest questioning on Wednesday came from Senator
Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and Hillary Clinton's running mate. He
told Ms. Haley her interpretation of the Iran nuclear deal was
``completely inaccurate'' and encouraged her to ``read the agreement.''

``What we all need to remember is that a nuclear Iran is very dangerous
for the entire world,'' she replied.
