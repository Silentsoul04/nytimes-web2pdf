WASHINGTON — Just hours after President Trump was sworn into office, the
Senate on Friday confirmed two nominees for critical national security
positions, approving James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F.
Kelly as homeland security secretary.

Republicans had hoped to approve far more than [two
nominees](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html)
on Mr. Trump’s first day in office, but that process has been delayed in
part because several of the nominees have been slow in filing ethics
disclosures, prompting protests by Senate Democrats.

While Republicans sought to confirm a third national security nominee on
Friday, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the president’s choice to
lead the Central Intelligence Agency, Democrats managed to delay his
approval until Monday, when he is expected to receive a vote after some
debate.

Three Democratic senators — Ron Wyden of Oregon, Patrick J. Leahy of
Vermont and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — objected to what they
characterized as an overly speedy push to confirm Mr. Pompeo.

“We ought to have a debate in broad daylight, not when senators are
trying to figure out if their tux is going to fit,” Mr. Wyden
said.

The skirmish over nominees set a grim tone for the first day of the
Senate under the new president. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell,
Republican of Kentucky, chastised Democrats for delaying nominees,
pointing out that the Senate had cleared seven cabinet-level officials
on President Obama’s first day in office in 2009.

Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, responded that Mr. McConnell
had refused to even allow a hearing to be held for Mr. Obama’s Supreme
Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, during his last year in office.

“For those who have forgotten the record of the Republicans in the
Senate when it comes to delaying nominations, Exhibit A will continue to
be the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court,” Mr. Durbin said on the Senate
floor, adding, “That vacancy continued for political reasons regardless
of the fact that it created at least a hardship and some confusion on
the highest court of the land. It went on for 10, 11 months and it
continues to this day.”

Both Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly are retired Marine Corps generals. Federal
law requires a seven-year waiting period between active duty and serving
as the secretary of defense; Congress passed legislation last week
granting a waiver to Mr. Mattis, and Mr. Trump signed it on Friday.

The Senate voted 98 to 1 to confirm Mr. Mattis. Senator Kirsten E.
Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, voted no “because she believes
civilian control of the military is fundamental,” said a spokesman for
the senator, Marc Brumer.

The vote to confirm Mr. Kelly was 88 to 11.

At a luncheon at the Capitol, Mr. Trump said the generals in his cabinet
“are going to keep us so safe” while describing them as out of “central
casting.” He also nudged the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of
New York, over the pending confirmations.

“Our cabinet’s lined up and ready,” Mr. Trump said. “I know eventually
Chuck’s going to approve them, I’m sure. I really believe that.”
