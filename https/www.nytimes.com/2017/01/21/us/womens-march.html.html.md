• Hundreds of thousands of women gathered in Washington on Saturday in a
kind of counterinauguration after President Trump [took office on
Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-day.html).
A [range of speakers and
performers](https://www.womensmarch.com/speakers/) cutting across
generational lines rallied near the Capitol before marchers made their
way toward the White House.

• They were joined by crowds in cities across the country: In Chicago,
the size of a rally so quickly outgrew early estimates that the march
that was to follow was canceled for safety. In Manhattan, Fifth Avenue
became a river of pink hats, while in downtown Los Angeles, even before
the gathering crowd stretched itself out to march, it was more than a
quarter mile deep on several streets.

• Begun as [a Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/events/2169332969958991/) just after the
election, the march is the start of what organizers hope could be a
sustained campaign of protest in a polarized America, unifying
demonstrators around issues like reproductive rights, immigration and
civil rights. The movement has also
[encountered](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/womens-march-on-washington-opens-contentious-dialogues-about-race.html?_r=0)

## Here are some highlights from the rally in Washington:

(Or [watch video of the whole
event](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000004879811/washington-march-live-video.html).)

• The singer and actress **Janelle Monae** highlighted the issue of
police violence, leading the crowd in a chant of “Sandra Bland\! Say her
name\!”, a reference to [the high-profile
case](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/us/panel-calls-for-major-changes-at-texas-jail-that-held-sandra-bland.html)
where a black woman died in police custody in Texas after being arrested
in 2015.

She then brought the microphone to each of the women in [“Mothers of the
Movement”](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/26/politics/mothers-movement-dnc-hillary-clinton/)
who had joined her onstage. One by one, they joined in the chant, each
inserting the name of her child who had died at the hands of the police.

• The actress **Ashley Judd** delivered an uninhibited speech that ended
with her referencing how Mr. Trump bragged, in [a 2005
recording](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html),
that he could use his celebrity status to force himself on women, even
groping their private parts.

They “ain’t for grabbing,” she said. “They are for birthing new
generations of filthy, vulgar, nasty, proud, Christian, Muslim,
Buddhist, Sikh, you name it, for new generations of nasty women.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• **Gloria Steinem**, the feminist icon of the 1960s and 1970s, told the
women in the group to get to know one another more personally.

“Make sure you introduce yourselves to each other and decide what we’re
going to do tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow,” she said. “We’re never
turning back\!”

• “It’s been a heart-rending time to be both a woman and an immigrant in
this country,” said the actress and activist **America Ferrera**.“But
the president is not America. His cabinet is not America. Congress is
not America. We are America\! And we are here to stay.”

• After getting to the crowd to repeat a number to call Congress, the
filmmaker **Michael Moore** urged people to run for office:

“This is not the time for shy people\! Shy people, you have two hours to
get over it.”

• The actress **Scarlett Johansson** told a story about how she had
visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in New York City after starting her
acting career, and how a doctor there had treated her with compassion,
“no judgment, no questions asked.”

“I feel that in the face of this current political climate, it is vital
that we all make it our mission to get really, really personal,” she
said.

“President Trump, I did not vote for you,” she continued. “I want to be
able to support you. But first I ask that you support me. Support my
sister. Support my mother. Support my best friend and all of our
girlfriends.”

Many participants believed that Mr. Trump expressed misogynistic views
during the presidential campaign, with remarks about [Megyn
Kelly](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/business/media/megyn-kellys-cautionary-tale-of-crossing-donald-j-trump.html),
[Carly
Fiorina](https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/10/donald-trumps-uncomplimentary-comments-about-carly-fiorina/)
and [Hillary
Clinton](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/politics/hillary-clinton-women.html).
After the 2005
[recording](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html)
surfaced, several women came forward [to accuse Mr. Trump of
inappropriate sexual
conduct](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html).
He dismissed the recording as “locker room banter” and assailed [his
accusers](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html).

In a sly allusion to the crude remarks Mr. Trump made in the recording,
many marchers, men and women alike, wore pink “pussyhats,” complete with
cat ears. The hats are described on
[pussyhatproject.com](https://www.pussyhatproject.com/) as a way to
“make a unique collective visual statement which will help activists
be better heard.”

*\_\_\_\_\_*

## Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to ignore the march

Just after 10 a.m., Mr. Trump and his family headed in the opposite
direction of the march in Washington for the National Prayer Service, an
inaugural tradition, at the National Cathedral. When he spoke at C.I.A.
headquarters in Langley, Va., in the midafternoon, he told his audience
that they were his “No. 1 stop” on his first full day in office, because
they were “really special amazing people.”

He also [ruminated about how big the
attendance](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html)
had been at his inaugural speech, but he did not mention the large
crowds of the women’s march, where demonstrators were challenging his
administration on a number of policies, or even that the march was
taking place as he was speaking.

*\_\_\_\_\_*

## Hillary Clinton tweets her support

Mrs. Clinton was not expected to attend the march in Washington, [The
Times reported on
Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-inauguration.html),
but her Twitter account sent a midmorning note anyway.

## Elizabeth Warren: ‘Me, I’m here to fight back’

In a speech in Boston, Ms. Warren, a Democratic senator from
Massachusetts, said fundamental freedoms, like abortion rights and gay
marriage, could be at stake under Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court.

“We can whimper, we can whine or we can fight back,” she said, as
demonstrators in pink hats waved American flags. “Me, I’m here to fight
back.”

“We believe in science,” Ms. Warren said, adding, “we know that climate
change is real.” A police officer patrolling the rally pumped his fists
in agreement.

“We also believe that immigration makes this country a stronger
country,” Ms. Warren said. “We will not build a stupid wall and we
will not tear millions of families apart.”

“You know, I could do this all day,” she added, to laughs and cheers.
“But we gotta march.”

## John Lewis: ‘Don’t let anybody, anybody, turn you around’

**Notable Signs:** “Bend toward justice,” evokeing the work of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

“I’m ready to march again,” said Mr. Lewis, a Democratic representative
of Georgia, who chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in
the 1960s. “I’ve come here to say to you: Don’t let anybody, anybody,
turn you around.”

Citing the demonstrations across the country, Mr. Lewis urged marchers,
who flowed onto the street running near the Center for Civil and Human
Rights, to “use this unity to organize” future political efforts.

”The next election, we must get out and vote like we never, ever voted
before,” said Mr. Lewis, who was embroiled in a public clash with Mr.
Trump recently.

## Everyone wants to know: How many people turned out?

The crowds appeared to be huge in most places, with marchers in
Washington, New York City and Chicago seeming to stretch to the
horizons. Police departments, at times, decline to provide crowd
estimates, and [crowds are notoriously hard to
estimate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/us/politics/How-Crowds-at-the-Capitol-Have-Been-Counted.html),
even with a good satellite image. But some official and unofficial
estimates have given a sense of the turnout.

Attendance in **New York City** was more than 400,000, according to
Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office. The **St. Paul** police issued an
official crowd count of 50,000 to 60,000 people. Attendance in
**Boston** was 175,000, according to Nicole Caravella, a spokeswoman for
Mayor Martin J. Walsh. The **Atlanta** Police Department estimated about
60,000 people attended a rally there. The Department of Public Safety in
**Phoenix** estimated that some 20,000 marched, while in **Key West,
Fla.**, a town of 25,000, police said more than 2,000 people marched.

Organizers in **Chicago** estimated the crowd there at 250,000, the
[Chicago
Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-womens-march-chicago-0122-20170121-story.html)
said. The Office of Emergency Management and Communications there said
late on Saturday morning that Grant Park, the sprawling area where the
rally-goers had gathered, had been filled to capacity. Though the
official march was canceled, many still chose to walk through downtown
holding protest signs.

Although the mayor’s office in **Washington** and organizers declined to
provide an estimate of the size of the flagship march, The Associated
Press reported that the District of Columbia’s homeland security
director, Christopher Geldart, said it was safe to say the crowd at the
march there was more than the 500,000 that organizers told city
officials to expect.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The crowd was so heavy, we didn’t know which way to go,” said Sabitha
Pillai-Friedman, a psychotherapist who traveled to Washington from
Philadelphia with her 17-year-old child, Sanji, and a friend, Pallavi
Sreedhar. “We were squeezed, touching.”

(March organizers offered a worldwide
[tally](https://www.womensmarch.com/sisters) for the 673 “sister”
marches, but when asked, could not provide an explanation of how the
tally had been calculated.)

## Here’s a rundown of scenes across the country. First up? Location: Washington. Time: 4:43 p.m.

**Overheard Chant:** “Yes we can” as people walked past the White House.

As the sun set downtown, protesters made their way to the White House
and assembled in small groups in a park just across from the building’s
entrance. There in an area surrounded by temporary gates, people walked
single file through one open entrance and one by one laid protest signs
across gates set up for inauguration several hundred feet away from the
White House.

While the temporary gates made walking up to the building impossible,
people stood shaking their heads in frustration.

Fontella Garraway, a 50-year-old retired Army veteran who drove three
and half hours from her home in Rocky Mount, N.C., sat on a bench
staring at the White House with a pin that read “girl power.”

“Even looking at the White House, it’s like I hope he’s looking out here
at us,” she said of Mr. Trump. “I hope it’s penetrating to him that we
mean business and we are serious.”

Moments later she lay a handwritten sign that read “Love trumps hate;
Hear our voice,” on the a fence facing the White House.

## Location: Phoenix. Time: 1:01 p.m.

**Notable Chant:** “Tell me what America looks like\! This is what
America looks like.”

**Notable Sash:** “65,855,610 votes for a woman,” worn by Sara Powell,
61, of Phoenix, and nine of her friends.

**Overheard:** “My arms are tired. This is a good workout,” said Rima
Borgogni, 50, owner of a Pilates studio in Sedona, Ariz., after holding
a sign throughout the mile-long march.

Ellen Ferreira and her friends felt as if they were fighting for some of
the same things they used to. They are mostly retired and many of them
are veterans of past protests, including the March on Washington for
Jobs and Freedom in 1963, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his
“I Have a Dream” speech.

“For our right to choose,” said Piya Jacob, 70, a retired elementary
school principal.

“For equality,” said Mary Helsaple, 67, an artist.

“For healing justice,” said Gretchen Vorbeck, 72, who runs a nonprofit
that buys grocery gift cards for public schoolteachers.

Carol Decker, 70, a retired magazine publisher, jumped in and said,
“We’re mad as hell and we’re not going to take it anymore.”

Just off 15th street, a block north of the parade’s official end point,
a large flatbed float with big “TRUMP” letters arched along the back
parked itself in the middle of the street, drawing the ire of the
thousands of marchers, who berated the float with chants of “Shame\!”
and “We are the popular vote\!”

Police officers formed a barricade around the float with more than a
half-dozen sidecar motorcycles. The six or so men and one woman on the
float all took pictures of the protesters.

Yet some of those who chanted to chase the float away weren’t surprised
at its appearance at their march.

“I mean the inauguration was yesterday,” said Chrissy Fiore, 39, of
Washington, though she said it was “crazy that they made it down here
and that now they’re getting police escorted out.”

Officers wouldn’t let reporters approach those on the float or those
driving it, but a magnet on the side said “Trump Unity Bridge.”

As the float headed east to move away from the parade, Sheriff David A.
Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, a Trump supporter, was seen walking
along the sidewalk, taking in the scene but remaining silent. He did not
respond to a reporter’s question about his opinion of the march or
protest.

## Location: New York City. Time: 1 p.m.

**Chant:** “Don’t take away our ACA” and “Who’s the boss? We are\!”

**Notable Signs:** “Show us your taxes;” “you can’t comb over sexism;”
“1459 days;” and “build a bridge not a wall.”

**Overheard:** One woman speaking at the rally told the story of having
an abortion when she was young, making the minimum wage and could not
support a child. She said she was fighting for equal pay “not just for
white women.”

At the rally in Mr. Trump’s hometown near Trump World Tower, elected
officials and celebrities assailed the president. Signs in the crowd
mocked his bouffant hair and the size of his hands. The actress Whoopi
Goldberg said it would be the first of many protests against the
president.

“This is how people ended the war in Vietnam,” Ms. Goldberg told the
cheering crowd.

Grace Huezo, 20, a student at Hunter College, marched with her twin
sister holding a “Nasty Woman” sign. She said she was there to defend
women’s rights after she was appalled by Mr. Trump’s comments about
grabbing women.

“We’re here saying, no, people do not have permission to grab women
without our permission,” she said.

She said she was buoyed by the huge turnout and the camaraderie.

“I’m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they’re
keeping their spirit,” she said. “We’re all just going to stick together
over the next four years.”

## Location: Denver. Time: 10:22 a.m.

**Popular chant:** “March\! March\! March\!”

**Notable signs:** “I won’t stop til it rains glass;” “You can’t comb
over misogyny” (accompanied by a drawing of Mr. Trump’s hair); “Flunk
the Electoral College.”

**Overheard:** “I got to bring my high school punk rock out,” said Emily
Hastings, 39, a woman from Denver wearing a black “eat the rich” T-shirt
and carrying a “Don’t tread on women” sign. “Punk rock is all about
resistance.”

The march began in a park at the center of the city with a group singing
“You’ve got a friend.” Marchers blanketed the park nestled between the
gold-domed state capitol and city hall, hauling strollers, wearing pink
hats and often hugging and kissing.

## Location: St. Paul. Time: 10:55 a.m.

**Notable Sign:** “Make America Compassionate Again,” and “I Love You”

Thousands of demonstrators gathered on a drizzly morning clad in rain
boots, ponchos and pink knit “pussyhats” to march to the Capitol.

“What Trump has said is so based on exclusion and winning and being
right versus taking care of everyone,” said Hilary James, 27, a musician
from Minneapolis. “Even if he doesn’t listen to us, I feel it’s
important to not sit back.”

**Notable Sign:** Make America Think Again

Gloria Cole, 66, had turned the protest into a family affair, traveling
here with her wife, her daughter, her daughter’s boyfriend, and her
brother and sister-in-law.

“I drew a line, it’s like, I’m an old woman — I’m not that old, I’m 66 —
I have to stand up for equal rights for everyone, for human rights,” Ms.
Cole said. “We’re here, and we’re not going away.”

Aili Shaw, 14, held a white sign that read, “Our arms are tired from
holding these signs since the 1920s.”

Ms. Shaw had traveled here, by train and car, with friends from her home
in Coventry, R.I.

“Women don’t have the rights they should,” she said.

## Location: Washington. Time: 10:30 a.m.

**Popular Chant:** “Thank You.” Women were chanting this to the
organizers of the march as they kicked off the day’s events.

**Notable Clothing:** At the corner of C and Third Southwest, many women
(and some men) were wearing cat-eared “pussyhats” of all shades of pink.
Organizers wanted to knit as many as one million hats for this event.

People were also getting creative with the signs they carry. Alan and
Alison Lewis drove in from Astoria with their 20-month-old, Grace.

“You shouldn’t have to have a relationship to a woman to stand up for
women,” Mr. Lewis said. “Equality and justice is enough of a reason to
be here.”

## And now meet a family with three generations of marchers

**Who She Is:** Jessica Coleman, 56, of Stone Mountain, Ga.

**Backstory:** A black retired teacher who used to show her daughter
documentaries about black history and march with her daughter and church
members during Martin Luther King holiday weekends.

“I wanted them to know you can be a smart, intelligent black person. You
don’t have to sag your pants and follow certain things that became media
culture. I wanted them to know that people marched, bled and died for us
to be able to vote and be able to go to college and have certain jobs.”

“You can really lose your sense of self if you don’t know where you’ve
come from and you don’t have a vision of where you want to go.”

“On the evening of election night, after saying, ‘Hey, I’m going to vote
and I’m going to get my friends to vote,’ I sat on the sofa bawling
trying to figure out what to say to my daughters the next morning
because they went to bed certain that Hillary was going to win.”

“Marching is my way of putting my money where my mouth is as far as
being an active citizen.”

“I want my daughters to have agency and have control over their bodies
and feel comfortable in the country that they are in so this is my way
of saying, ‘Hey everybody, I agree with all the people who are out here
for different reasons and we don’t agree with what is happening right
now and we are taking a stand.’”

**Who She Is:** Garvey Mortley, 8, of Bethesda, Md., is Ms. Coleman’s
granddaughter

**Backstory:** Third grader; was named after Marcus Garvey

“I think it’s good to share the moment with them and help protest Donald
Trump because we want to stand up for our rights because a long time
ago, lots of women could not vote. Now we can vote and protest people
and stuff.”

“If he affects the world in a bad way — like I have lots of friends from
different countries and he could make them all move away … that makes me
mad because all the people from the civil rights movement had a hard
time trying to put us together. It’s like a puzzle, all these people
came together, piece by piece, and now Donald Trump is coming over and
just breaking those puzzle pieces.”
