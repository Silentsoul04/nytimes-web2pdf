BEIJING --- Sumi Jo, a Grammy Award-winning South Korean soprano, had
been scheduled to perform alongside three top orchestras in mainland
China.

One venue billed the performance as a ``grand and worthy'' tribute to
the beloved opera singer Maria Callas by ``one of the most sought-after
Korean sopranos in the world.''

But on Sunday, about a month before the concerts were scheduled to take
place, the three orchestras suddenly issued separate but seemingly
coordinated notices announcing that Ms. Jo, a veteran coloratura
soprano, would no longer be performing.

The cancellations have heightened suspicions that South Korean classical
musicians are the latest casualties of political tensions with China
that go back to July, when the government in Seoul announced that it
would deploy
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/asia/south-korea-us-thaad-china.html}{a
United States missile-defense system known} as Thaad on its soil.

In statements published on their official WeChat social media accounts,
three orchestras --- the Shanghai Symphony, the Guangzhou Symphony, and
the China Philharmonic in Beijing --- offered little or no explanation
for why Ms. Jo would not be performing.

The China Philharmonic noted that Ms. Jo and the South Korean conductor
Min Chung had been ``forced to withdraw'' from the performance for
``specific reasons.''

For the concerts in Guangzhou and Shanghai, Ms. Jo will be replaced by
the Chinese soprano Ying Huang. In Beijing, her spot will be filled by
the Chinese soprano Liping Zhang, while the Chinese conductor Yang Yang
will replace Mr. Chung.

The Xi'an Concert Hall has also removed from its online performance
calendar information about a concert that had been scheduled for March
25 and that was to feature Ms. Jo. It was not part of the Callas tribute
series.

Ms. Jo's performances with the Hong Kong Philharmonic on Feb. 3 and 4
appear to be unaffected. The semiautonomous region has a separate visa
application process.

The announcements on Sunday came just days after a performance by the
South Korean pianist Kun-woo Paik and the Guiyang Symphony Orchestra,
scheduled for March in the Chinese province of Guizhou, was abruptly
called off on Wednesday.

Based on \href{http://www.gyso.cn/Pages/ProductDeta.aspx?Pid=26}{Guiyang
Symphony Orchestra's website}, it appears that Mr. Paik has been
replaced in the program by the Chinese pianist Sa Chen.

``We never expected this to happen,'' Ms. Jo's brother, Jay Jo, said by
telephone on Monday. ``Sumi has toured nearly every year in China for
almost 10 years.''

Many observers had been expecting various forms of Chinese retaliation
after the announcement about the missile system. In August, several
events in China featuring South Korean music and television stars were
suddenly called off, setting off fears that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/world/asia/china-korea-thaad.html}{the
Chinese government was quietly going after K-pop}, one of South Korea's
biggest cultural exports.

There has been no official confirmation of a Chinese blacklist or a ban
on South Korean artists and entertainers. But ``that's the beauty of the
Chinese government --- they never say anything,'' Mr. Jo said.

He added that the idea for the tribute concerts to Callas had been
presented to Ms. Jo more than two years ago, and that the China tour
dates had been confirmed in the summer.

When Ms. Jo was preparing to apply for an entry visa last month, Mr. Jo
said, the Chinese orchestras were unable to provide the required
government-approved invitation letter.

Reached by telephone on Monday, the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra
declined to comment. The China Philharmonic Orchestra and the Shanghai
Symphony Orchestra did not respond to requests for comment sent by email
and WeChat. The Chinese conductor Long Yu, who holds a leadership
position in all three of the orchestras, did not respond to a call for
comment.

Ms. Jo last performed in China in May, at a concert with the Spanish
guitarist Pepe Romero at the National Center for Performing Arts in
Beijing.

On Jan. 31, she will make her debut with the New York Philharmonic at
its annual Chinese New Year concert. Mr. Yu will conduct.
