WASHINGTON — Just days after President Trump spoke of a “running war’’
with the media, his chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon,
ratcheted up the attacks, arguing that news organizations had been
“humiliated” by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the
media as “the opposition party” of the current administration.

“The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut
and just listen for a while,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview on
Wednesday.

“I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the
opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not
understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.”

The scathing assessment — delivered by one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted
and influential advisers, in the first days of his presidency — comes at
a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration,
with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd and the
president’s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented
immigrants swayed the popular vote against him.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bannon, who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of
Breitbart News, the provocative right-wing website he ran until August,
was echoing [comments by Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html)
last weekend, when the president said he was in “a running war” with the
media and called journalists “among the most dishonest people on earth.”
Mr. Bannon’s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and
a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his
election campaign.

Among Mr. Trump’s advisers in the White House, Mr. Bannon is responsible
for putting into action [the nationalist
vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/stephen-bannon-white-house-trump.html)
that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign, one
that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself. And in many ways Mr. Trump has
acted on that vision during his first week in office — from the
description of “American carnage” he laid out in his inauguration speech
to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements,
immigration and the building of a border wall.

Mr. Bannon is one of the strongest forces in an administration with
competing power centers. A savvy manipulator of the press, and a proud
provocateur, he was among the few advisers in Mr. Trump’s circle who
were said to have urged Sean Spicer, the new press secretary, to give a
confrontational, emotional statement to a shocked West Wing briefing
room on Saturday, when the White House disputed news reports about the
size of the inauguration crowd. He shares Mr. Trump’s view that the news
media misunderstood the movement that the president rode into office.

Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Mr. Bannon delivered a broad
indictment of the news media as being biased against Mr. Trump and out
of touch with the American public. That is an argument familiar to
readers of Breitbart and followers of personalities friendly to Mr.
Trump, like Sean Hannity of Fox News.

“The elite media got it dead wrong, 100 percent dead wrong,” Mr. Bannon
said of the election, calling it “a humiliating defeat that they will
never wash away, that will always be there.”

“The mainstream media has not fired or terminated anyone associated with
following our campaign,” Mr. Bannon said. “Look at the Twitter feeds of
those people: They were outright activists of the Clinton campaign.” (He
did not name specific reporters or editors.)

“That’s why you have no power,” he added. “You were humiliated.”

Mr. Bannon spoke in blunt but calm tones, peppered with profanity, and
humorously referred to himself as “Darth Vader.” He said, with ironic
relish, that Mr. Trump was elected by a surge of support from “the
working-class hobbits and deplorables.”

The conversation was initiated by Mr. Bannon to offer praise for Mr.
Spicer, who has been criticized this week for making false claims at the
White House podium about attendance at Mr. Trump’s inaugural, for
calling reporters dishonest and lecturing them about what stories to
write, and for failing to disavow Mr. Trump’s lie about widespread voter
fraud in the election.

Asked if he was concerned that Mr. Spicer had lost credibility with the
news media, Mr. Bannon chortled. “Are you kidding me?” he said. “We
think that’s a badge of honor. ‘Questioning his integrity’ — are you
kidding me? The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard
work.”

“You’re the opposition party,” he said. “Not the Democratic Party.
You’re the opposition party. The media’s the opposition party.”

Journalists reacted with alarm and defiance to Mr. Bannon’s comments.
“What country are we living in?” Christiane Amanpour, the CNN
correspondent, [wrote on
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/camanpour/status/824730505543319554)

“We are not the opposition,’’ Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief of the
nonprofit news organization [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/),
wrote in an email. “We are part of an essential function in any
democracy.” He added that ProPublica had no intention of “shutting up in
response to this or any other president’s demand.”

“We are here to tell the truth and we intend to continue doing so,
regardless of how badly some might want us to parrot ‘alternative
facts,’” Mr. Engelberg said.

Mr. Bannon mostly referred to the “elite” or “mainstream” media, but he
cited The New York Times and The Washington Post by name.

“The paper of record for our beloved republic, The New York Times,
should be absolutely ashamed and humiliated,” Mr. Bannon said. “They got
it 100 percent wrong.”

He added that he has been a reader of The Times for most of his adult
life.
