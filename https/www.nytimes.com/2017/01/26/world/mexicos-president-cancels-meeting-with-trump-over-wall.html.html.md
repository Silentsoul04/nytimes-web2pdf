MEXICO CITY — President [Donald J.
Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per)’s
decision to build a wall along the southern border escalated into a
diplomatic standoff on Thursday, with Mexico’s president publicly
canceling a scheduled meeting at the White House and Mr. Trump firing
back, accusing Mexico of burdening the United States with illegal
immigrants, criminals and a trade deficit.

Mr. Trump’s push to fulfill his campaign pledge and build a border wall
brought to a head months of simmering tensions, culminating in a
remarkable back-and-forth between the two leaders.

By afternoon, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said the president would pay for the
border wall by imposing [a 20 percent
tax](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/politics/mexico-wall-tax-trump.html?action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=64842749&pgtype=Homepage)
on imports to the United States, which he said would raise billions of
dollars.

The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico
announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump
next week, rejecting the visit after the new American leader [ordered
the border
wall](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/refugees-immigrants-wall-trump.html)
between the two nations.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trump’s vows to build a
wall during the American presidential campaign, President Enrique Peña
Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more
forcefully to his northern neighbor.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to beef up the
nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along
the border. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order:
It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and
their counterparts in Washington, and just days before the meeting
between the two presidents.

Mr. Trump’s action was enough to prompt Mr. Peña Nieto to start
discussing whether to scrap his plans to visit the White House,
according to Mexican officials. In a [video
message](https://twitter.com/EPN/status/824447050066468865) delivered
over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated his
commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people,
and he chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall.

“I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the
construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides
us,” he said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump fired back, warning that he might
cancel the meeting himself if Mexico did not agree to pay for the wall.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just before Mr. Trump fired off his Twitter post, the Mexican foreign
minister and Mr. Trump’s [Homeland Security
secretary](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/homeland-security-john-kelly-border-wall.html),
John F. Kelly, were preparing to see each other for a scheduled 11:30
a.m. meeting.

According to a senior American official, the secretary had been briefed.
The appropriate flags had been arranged by the protocol staff at the
Department of Homeland Security. Then, just as American officials
greeted the minister outside the department’s headquarters in Northwest
Washington, the minister received word from Mexico that he was being
pulled back, the official said. The meeting never happened.

By early afternoon, Mr. Trump said it was the United States that was
being treated unfairly.

“We have agreed to cancel our planned meeting,” Mr. Trump said in a new
conference Thursday afternoon. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the U.S.
fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to
go a different route. We have no choice.”

In Mexico, Mr. Peña Nieto had little political room to maneuver. With
Mr. Trump’s order to build the wall, the perceived insults Mexico had
endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of
friendly relations between the nations — on matters involving trade,
security and migration — seemed to be unraveling.

Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Peña
Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the
perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s action
was referred to by politicians and historians as a “an offense to
Mexico,” a “slap in the face” and a “monument to lies.”

Historians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to
invade a “Soviet Mexico” had the United States so deeply antagonized the
Mexican populace.

“It is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,” said
Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico
City. “In the 19th century, we fought a war with the U.S.; now we find
ourselves in a low-intensity war, a commercial one over Nafta and an
immigration war due to the measures he just announced.”
