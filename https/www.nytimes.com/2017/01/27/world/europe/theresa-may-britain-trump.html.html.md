WASHINGTON — [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump) plans to open
a dialogue with Russia on Saturday that could lead to lifting American
sanctions, even as Britain’s visiting prime minister and leading
senators from his own party urged him not to let up the pressure on the
Kremlin until it reverses its armed intervention in Ukraine.

In what will be their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office, he
and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intended to [talk by
telephone](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/01/27/world/europe/ap-eu-russia-us.html)
on Saturday about areas of possible cooperation, particularly in
fighting terrorism in the Middle East, a collaboration that would
represent a significant turnabout from years of friction between the two
countries.

At the direction of the White House, American officials in recent days
have been preparing memos outlining possible common ground, including
the prospect of removing some or all of the sanctions imposed by former
President Barack Obama, according to officials briefed on the matter.
Mr. Trump has suggested lifting the punitive measures in exchange for
nuclear arms cuts and Russian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State.

Asked about sanctions on Friday, Mr. Trump played down the possibility
of quick action, but did not rule it out.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As for sanctions, very early to be talking about that,” Mr. Trump said
Friday at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May
of Britain. “But we look to have a great relationship with all
countries, ideally.”

As for Mr. Putin, he offered a far more distant assessment after months
of praising the Russian president for his leadership. “I don’t know the
gentleman,” Mr. Trump said. “I hope we have a fantastic relationship.
That’s possible, and it’s also possible that we won’t. We will see what
happens.”

## President Trump and Theresa May Joint News Conference: Video and Analysis

Join Times reporters for live updates and analysis from President
Trump’s joint news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Great
Britain.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Standing at Mr. Trump’s side, Mrs. May warned against easing sanctions
unless Russia abides by a peace settlement for Ukraine negotiated in
Minsk, the capital of Belarus. “We believe the sanctions should continue
until we see that Minsk Agreement fully implemented, and we’ve been
continuing to argue that inside the European Union,” she said.

Any talk of lifting sanctions is all but certain to spark the first
serious conflagration between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans,
who have largely given the president a pass on [myriad policy
areas](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/politics/trump-republican-retreat.html?hp=&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&smid=tw-nytpolitics&smtyp=cur&referer=https://t.co/MklSBYHS66)
where they disagree. Republican lawmakers have been bracing for Mr.
Trump to make this move, and their concerns deepened Friday when his
counselor, Kellyanne Conway,[said in an
interview](https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/824966414456852480)
that removing sanctions was under consideration.

Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Mr. Trump on Friday against
lifting sanctions and vowed to push legislation reinstating them if he
does, a measure that already has strong bipartisan support, including
from Republicans like Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Ben Sasse of
Nebraska. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who
has largely shunned confrontation with Mr. Trump, has been a
longstanding opponent of lifting sanctions, a position he
forcefully[reiterated](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/mitch-mcconnell-trump-russia-sanctions-234281)on
Friday.

In a scathing statement against Mr. Putin, Mr. McCain cataloged all of
Russia’s controversial actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere and said
it could not be trusted as a partner.

“President Trump should remember this when he speaks to Vladimir Putin,”
Mr. McCain said. “He should remember that the man on the other end of
the line is a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American
national security interests at every turn. For our commander in chief to
think otherwise would be naïve and dangerous.”

Mr. Portman concurred, saying in a statement, “We must stand by our
allies in the region, including Ukraine.”

Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mrs. May was his first with a visiting foreign
leader since taking office with a promise to pursue an “America First”
foreign policy. For Mr. Trump, it was a debut on the world stage that
took on additional meaning after a scheduled White House visit by
Mexico’s president next week fell apart in a dispute over the border
wall Mr. Trump wants to build.

Mr. Trump appeared comfortable and confident with Mrs. May standing to
his right. He offered a brief opening statement that referred twice to
the “special relationship” between the two countries, a phrase Britons
take seriously. He offered crisp answers, in contrast to Mr. Obama, who
tended to talk at length. While Mr. Trump did not demonstrate detailed
policy knowledge, he went out of his way to emphasize commonalities with
Mrs. May.

He also tried to reassure Europeans who view him with deep skepticism.
When a British reporter referred to him as a “brash TV extrovert,” Mr.
Trump replied, “Actually, I’m not as brash as you might think.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mrs. May, eager to [forge a relationship with
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/europe/theresa-may-trump.html)
akin to Margaret Thatcher’s alliance with Ronald Reagan, reciprocated
the warm sentiments, praising his “stunning election victory” and
conveying an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for the president to
make a state visit, which he accepted.

Addressing one area of disagreement, Mrs. May said that the president
had privately expressed his support for NATO, despite past comments
disparaging the alliance as “obsolete.” “Mr. President,” she said, “I
think you said, you confirmed that you’re 100 percent behind NATO.”

Mr. Trump embraced the decision by British voters to exit the European
Union, a referendum known as “Brexit” that he and others have seen as a
precursor to his own election. “I think Brexit’s going to be a wonderful
thing for your country,” he said. “I think when it irons out, you’re
going to have your identity and you’re going to have the people that you
want in your country.”

Mr. Trump and Mrs. May talked about [negotiating a new free-trade
agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/trump-trade-theresa-may-uk-britain.html)
between the two countries.

Ms. May is not the only European leader worried about Mr. Trump’s
blossoming friendship with Russia, which United States intelligence
agencies have concluded hacked Democratic email accounts to influence
the American election last year. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has
been a leading voice of keeping the pressure on the Kremlin, and Mr.
Trump is scheduled to talk with her by telephone, too.

The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russian officials
and companies, mainly in response to the seizure and annexation of
Crimea and the separatist war fomented in eastern Ukraine. Before
leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed [additional
sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/us/politics/russia-election-hacking-sanctions.html)
in response to the Russian election hacking.

In an [interview with The Times of
London](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/full-transcript-of-interview-with-donald-trump-5d39sr09d)
shortly before taking office, Mr. Trump suggested a bargain that would
ease sanctions on Russia in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and
cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State.

One topic that may come up on Saturday’s call is [the fate of Austin
Tice](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/world/middleeast/us-and-syria-discuss-missing-journalist.html),
a freelance journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012. Mr. Trump may
ask Mr. Putin for help in pressuring Russia’s ally, President Bashar
al-Assad of Syria, to release Mr. Tice, according to an official briefed
on the matter. Syria has never acknowledged holding him, but Mr. Trump
has considered dropping support for the Syrian opposition.
