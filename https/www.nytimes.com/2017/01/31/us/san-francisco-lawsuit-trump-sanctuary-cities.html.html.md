SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco on Tuesday became the first city in the
country to sue President Trump over his order to withhold federal
funding from so-called sanctuary cities, saying the order was
unconstitutional.

In a lawsuit filed with the United States District Court of the Northern
District of California, San Francisco’s city attorney, Dennis Herrera,
requested an injunction on the Trump administration’s attempted
crackdown on sanctuary cities, which limit city agencies and local law
enforcement from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration
laws.

“You can’t put a gun to the head of states and localities to get them to
comply with what you might want at the federal level,” Mr. Herrera said.

The Trump order says it is in the interest of public safety for local
officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and seeks to
withhold federal grants from municipalities that have sanctuary city
policies.

San Francisco is home to around 30,000 undocumented residents, Mr.
Herrera said. The city receives around $1.2 billion in federal funding,
but city officials say it is unclear how much is at risk. San
Francisco’s sanctuary city law took effect in 1989.

In a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Herrera said the executive order
was unconstitutional because it “tries to turn city and state employees
into federal immigration
enforcers.”

## What Are Sanctuary Cities?

Behind the term that Donald J. Trump and others are talking about.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

San Francisco’s mayor, [Edwin M.
Lee](https://twitter.com/mayoredlee/status/826490889623134208), argued
that forcing city officials to assist federal immigration authorities
would make the city less safe because illegal immigrants would be afraid
to cooperate with the police.

“Sanctuary cities are safer,” Mr. Lee said. “You talk to our police
chief and our sheriff and other law enforcement professionals, they
believe having open communications with all elements of our society is
much more preferable.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In San Francisco, a city proud of its liberal traditions, Mr. Trump
received 10 percent of the vote in November. Protests have erupted here
over the Trump order on sanctuary cities and the order limiting
immigration from predominantly Muslim countries.

Mr. Lee said the city was aware of the risk of confronting the Trump
administration. “It’s no surprise that this president might continue to
target us,” he said. “We have to be ready.”

San Francisco featured in the debate over sanctuary city policies in
2015 after a resident, Kathryn Steinle, 32, was shot and killed by Juan
Francisco López-Sánchez, an immigrant who was in the country illegally,
had a criminal record and had been deported at least five times.

Mr. Trump seized on the killing as “yet another example of why we must
secure our border.”

Mr. Lee has said the killing “should never have happened” because San
Francisco’s sanctuary city policy allows for cooperation with federal
immigration authorities when dealing with felons.

Hundreds of cities could potentially be affected by the administration’s
order, said [Grisel Ruiz](https://www.ilrc.org/grisel-ruiz), a staff
attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco. But
she cautioned that there was no clear definition of a sanctuary city and
that they varied greatly in degree of cooperation with federal
authorities.
