Hundreds of angry protesters confronted Israeli police officers as they
tried to eject them Thursday from the illegal West Bank settlement of
Amona, the second day of clashes there. Several officers were injured as
they cleared a synagogue of 200 people who had barricaded themselves in
the outpost's last inhabited building.

``How can the State of Israel destroy a synagogue?'' Rabbi Yair Frank of
the settlement asked on Israeli radio. ``The entire Jewish people should
be crying on this day.''

The police permitted Rabbi Frank to say a final prayer in the building
before the last of the activists were removed.

Earlier, protesters sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers and
threw rocks, paint bottles and wooden planks, the police said.

Someone spray-painted a swastika and graffiti that compared the Israeli
police to Nazis on the synagogue walls.

``The officers faced especially tough and violent resistance,'' the
police said in a statement.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Thursday to establish a new
West Bank settlement ``as soon as possible'' after the court-ordered
evacuation of Amona, the largest of about 100 outposts built without
authorization across the West Bank.

After years of court action and contentious debate over the Amona
settlement outpost in the occupied West Bank, Israeli security forces
operating under a court order forcibly evacuated settlers there on
Wednesday.

Adding to the chaos, hundreds of young activists barricaded themselves
in makeshift buildings at the site.

Hundreds of unarmed police officers in blue sweatshirts and baseball
caps were sent to remove about 40 families from the outpost, which
Israel's Supreme Court has declared illegal.

Amona is the largest of about 100 outposts built without authorization
across the West Bank. Over the years, it has become a flagship and a
flash point of the Israeli settler movement. In 2014, the Supreme Court
ruled that the outpost had been built on privately owned Palestinian
land and ordered officials to raze it.

The government of Mr. Netanyahu delayed the evacuation as long as it
legally could, worried that removing the settlers would jeopardize his
standing with right-wing Israeli voters who support settlement building
on lands they view as historically Jewish.

The police confronted protesters, many of them high school students,
exactly 11 years to the day after Israeli forces demolished part of an
earlier version of the settlement. In 2006, Israeli forces destroyed
nine homes in Amona and clashed violently with settlers and their
supporters.

About 2 p.m. on Wednesday, the police began evacuating settlers from the
rugged hilltop overlooking a string of Palestinian villages. The young
activists had built barricades from broken tiles, large rocks and metal
bars.

``You are supposed to protect us, not break into our homes!'' one man
shouted as the police tried to enter one home.

``This is a dark day for us, for Zionism, for the state and for the
great vision of the Jewish people returning to its homeland,'' Avichay
Buaron, a spokesman for Amona, told Channel 2 TV.

Ayelet Videl waited on the porch for the police to arrive at her trailer
home. ``Our heart is broken,'' she said. ``I didn't imagine that all
these energies would be channeled into destruction rather than
construction.''

Despite the evacuation, settler leaders said the day's events
represented only a minor setback in a larger battle over settlements ---
and one that they perceive they are winning. Hours before the police
entered Amona, Mr. Netanyahu's government approved the construction of
3,000 more settler housing units in the West Bank. That roughly doubled
the number of units approved, along with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/middleeast/israel-settlement-expansion-west-bank.html}{two
earlier construction plans} that recently set off international
condemnation.

``Altogether, we are moving on a very good vector. We are close to half
a million people in Judea and Samaria,'' said Shilo Adler, the head of
the Yesha Council advocacy group, using biblical names for the West
Bank.

The Palestinians claim the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan
in the 1967 war, as part of a future independent state. In the
Palestinian villages near Amona, landowners who helped bring the lawsuit
against the settlers praised the outpost's destruction.
