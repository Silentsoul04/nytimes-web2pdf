From the moment she was introduced in late November as President Trump’s
nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos has taken heat from not
only teachers’ unions but also some charter school advocates and parent
groups.

Ms. DeVos, a wealthy Republican fund-raiser and philanthropist who is a
major supporter of school vouchers, has faced [vociferous
opposition](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-has-steered-money-from-public-schools.html).
Her support for directing taxpayer dollars to privately run schools, and
her efforts to shape education in her home state of Michigan and across
the country, elicited criticism from opponents who argued that she had
neglected the public schools she would be charged with improving as the
head of the Department of Education.

Ms. DeVos endured a grueling line of questioning from senators during
her confirmation hearing last month. While Republicans praised what they
called her commitment to education and to children, Democrats said they
were startled by many of her answers, which they said laid bare the
weaknesses of an education secretary pick who has little experience with
public schools.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

They expressed their concern as well about the potential for conflicts
of interest in her complex web of financial investments; Ms. DeVos was
the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees not to complete an ethics review
before appearing before
senators.

Ms. DeVos faced a number of uncomfortable questions, which critics said
showed a lack of familiarity with laws protecting students with
disabilities and the metrics for assessing student progress. In addition
to pointing out Ms. DeVos’s inexperience in running a large bureaucracy,
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, [questioned how she
could manage the Department of

As demonstrations popped up across the country, thousands of calls and
messages flooded the Capitol, many of them urging senators to vote
against Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump’s other nominees.

In a move that put Ms. DeVos’s nomination in question, two Republican
senators — Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska —
[announced last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/trump-cabinet-nominations-senate.html)
that they would not vote to confirm her, citing the concerns of their
constituents. “I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary
of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so
immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what
actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is
broken and how to fix them,” Ms. Murkowski said on the Senate
floor.

But as most Senate Republicans maintained their support for Ms. DeVos,
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, scheduled a
rare, early-morning procedural vote on her nomination to press ahead.

Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a former education secretary and
chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos in a party-line vote,
said she would be “an excellent education secretary.”

“She’s committed to public education, and there’s no better example of
that than her work on the most important reform of public schools in the
last 30 years: public charter schools,” Mr. Alexander
said.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, asked his

On Monday, Senate Democrats said they would spend the final 24 hours
before Ms. DeVos’s confirmation vote [speaking out against her on the
floor](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/us/politics/betsy-devos-democrats-education.html)
in a last-ditch effort to woo Republicans to their side.

But as the evening wore on, it looked increasingly likely that Ms.
Collins and Ms. Murkowski would be the only Republican defectors,
setting up a 50-50 tie. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to break
the deadlock on Tuesday as president of the Senate, offering the 51st
vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary.
