WASHINGTON — [Betsy
DeVos](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary-confirmation.html),
a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public
education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation’s education
secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking
vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two
defections within her own party.

The 51-to-50 vote capped an all-night vigil on the Senate floor, where,
one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber. But
they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped
Ms. DeVos — a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting
charter schools and vouchers — from becoming the steward of the nation’s
nearly 100,000 public schools.

It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol
to break a tie on a cabinet nomination.

Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded before the vote that
Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos. “If we cannot set
aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting
the president’s nominees, what are we even doing here?” Mr. Franken
asked.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The two Republicans who voted against the nominee, Senators Susan
Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos was
unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and
with laws meant to protect students.

“I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education
who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the
push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is
successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to
fix them,” Ms. Murkowski said last week [when the two announced their
opposition](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/trump-cabinet-nominations-senate.html).

Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages
she had received urging her to reject the
nomination.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For many educators, Ms. DeVos’s support for charter schools and vouchers
— which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at
private, religious and for-profit schools — reflected a deep disconnect
from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended
a public school.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for
children. In a fiery speech moments before the vote, Senator Lamar
Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary
himself, criticized his Democratic colleagues for opposing Ms. DeVos, he
said, simply because she was nominated by a Republican president.

“She led the most effective public school reform movement over the last
few years,” he said. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the committee that
approved Ms. DeVos’s nomination last week in a party-line split, said
she had been “at the forefront” of education overhaul for decades.

By midday Tuesday, as the vote in the Senate deadlocked at 50 to 50, Mr.
Pence, a former member of the House, took the gavel and at 12:29 p.m.
declared his vote for Ms. DeVos. In a procedural quirk, a confirmation
vote on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general was
scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he could vote “yes” before leaving
the Senate, securing Republicans a decisive vote.

Raised in a wealthy family, Ms. DeVos, who married into the Amway
fortune, has a web of financial investments, has also raised alarm among
critics who worried about the many opportunities for conflicts of
interest. She was the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees not to complete an
ethics review before appearing before a Senate panel. She filed her
ethics paperwork on Jan. 19, two days after her confirmation hearing.

Teachers’ unions and even some charter organizations had protested Ms.
DeVos’s nomination across the country. Senator Patty Murray of
Washington, the top Democrat on the committee that approved Ms. DeVos —
and a former educator herself — urged disheartened advocates on Tuesday
morning before the vote not to think of their efforts as a waste.

“It’s made an impact here and made a difference,” she said. “And I think
it’s woken each of us up in this country to what we value and what we
want.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shortly after Ms. DeVos’s confirmation, Randi Weingarten, the president
of the American Federation of Teachers, a union that protested the
nomination, said the public would now have to “serve as a check and
balance” to her policies and be “fierce fighters on behalf of children.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s telling that even when Trump had full control of the legislative
and executive branches, he could only get DeVos confirmed by an
unprecedented tiebreaking vote by his vice president,” Ms. Weingarten
said. “That’s because DeVos shows an antipathy for public schools, a
full-throttled embrace of private, for-profit alternatives and a lack of
basic understanding of what children need to succeed in school.”

David E. Kirkland, an education professor at New York University who has
studied Ms. DeVos’s impact in Michigan, said he feared she could badly
hurt public education and pull resources out of schools in need of
federal funding. “Her extensive conflicts of interest and record of
diverting money away from vulnerable students and into the pockets of
the rich make DeVos completely unfit for the position she was just
confirmed to,” he said.

Ms. DeVos has focused on expanding parental choice in education and on
embracing charter schools and vouchers. Her ideology was a good fit for
Mr. Trump’s education platform during the campaign, which called for a
$20 billion voucher initiative aimed at low-income children.

But freeing such an enormous sum would most likely require the
reallocation of federal education money, as well as a realignment of
congressional priorities. Vouchers were not part of a [sweeping
education overhaul passed
in 2015](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/us/politics/president-obama-signs-into-law-a-rewrite-of-no-child-left-behind.html),
and lawmakers from rural areas, where schools tend to be farther apart,
are particularly wary of such initiatives.

The Trump administration could potentially advance a more limited
voucher program and seek tax credits for private school tuition or home
schooling costs.

Ms. DeVos has also indicated that she would dismantle other pieces of
the Obama administration’s legacy, potentially including a rule that
denies federal student aid money to for-profit colleges whose graduates
struggle to get jobs, as well as an aggressive effort to investigate and
adjudicate campus sexual assault claims.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. DeVos’s critics said they would continue to fight her as she serves.
Some vowed to demonstrate at her appearances at forums and schools and
to seek candidates friendly to their view to run for local office.

Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education
Association, said her union would tap into the vast database of
advocates it had built during Ms. DeVos’s confirmation process to help
keep her in check. “As soon as she does something alarming, it will be
known, it will be seen,” she said. “She won’t be able to hide.”

Mr. Trump’s choice of Ms. DeVos, known for her big-spending lobbying
efforts to expand charter schools in Michigan — an experiment that even
charter school supporters now criticize — to lead the Education
Department presented senators with a multitude of potential pitfalls.
Her background as a [prolific<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>fund-raiser who has
donated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary.html)
about $200 million over the years to Republican causes and candidates —
including some senators, as has been the case for previous presidential
nominees — came under scrutiny.

Democrats have also expressed concern about her family’s contributions
to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people and
her past statements that government “sucks” and that public schools are
a “dead end.” Opponents have also focused on the poor performance of
charter schools in Detroit, which she championed.

Senators and education advocates from both sides of the aisle also
expressed concern after Ms. DeVos, during [her Jan. 17 confirmation
hearing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-senate-hearing.html),
confused core responsibilities of the department.

In one notable exchange that spread across the internet, Senator Tim
Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, asked Ms. DeVos whether all schools that
receive public money should have to follow the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Act, the landmark 1975 civil rights legislation.
Under that federal law, states and school districts are required to
provide special education services to children with disabilities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. DeVos said the issue was “best left to the states.”

In a bizarre moment that made her the butt of late-night TV jokes, Ms.
DeVos also suggested that states should decide whether to allow guns in
schools, citing in part concerns about protection from grizzly bears in
Wyoming.

“I think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a
school to protect from potential grizzlies,” she said.

Before the vote Tuesday, Mr. Franken said, “It was the most embarrassing
confirmation hearing that I have ever seen.”

In a final push that included demonstrations around the country,
constituents and advocates swamped Senate offices with calls, so
inundating the Capitol switchboard that it disrupted the Senate’s voice
mail system.
