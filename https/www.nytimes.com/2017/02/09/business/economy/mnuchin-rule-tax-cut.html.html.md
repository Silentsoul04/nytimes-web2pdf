The newly christened “Mnuchin rule” — the assurance given by the
Treasury nominee Steven T. Mnuchin that “there would be no absolute tax
cut for the upper class” — seems as if it was made to be broken.

Mr. Mnuchin initially made the statement during an [interview on CNBC in
November](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/30/exclusive-steve-mnuchin-no-absolute-tax-cut-for-the-upper-class.html),
after President Trump chose him for the cabinet. At Mr. Mnuchin’s
confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, rebranded
the comment as a “rule,” transforming a throwaway line into a formal
pledge.

Whether it will be kept may become clearer in two or three weeks — the
timing Mr. Trump [mentioned
Thursday](https://www.nytimes.com/video/business/dealbook/100000004922130/trump-on-phenomenal-tax-plan.html)
for delivering a “phenomenal” tax plan.

Although Mr. Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset
by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to
fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are
pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Redesigning the tax code with an eye fixed on lower rates has been a
Republican mission for decades, and one that Mr. Trump adopted. That
prospect, combined with a promised regulatory retreat, has pumped up the
stock market and fueled optimism among business
leaders.

</div>

At the same time, the president has raised expectations among his
working-class supporters that “the rich will pay their fair share,” and
that “special-interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street
investors, and for people like me, but unfair to American workers” [will
be
eliminated](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/08/restrained-trump-goes-at-clinton-for-tax-plan.html).
Mr. Mnuchin, soon to be one of the administration’s top economic policy
officials, promised “a big tax cut for the middle class.”

Yet analyses of the [president’s and the House Republicans’
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/business/economy/trump-and-congress-both-want-tax-cuts-the-question-is-which-ones.html)
consistently conclude that the wealthy will receive the largest tax cuts
by far.

Start with the House blueprint, which at the moment is the closest thing
to a working draft that exists. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a
joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, found
“high-income taxpayers [would receive the biggest
cuts](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-house-gop-tax-plan),
both in dollar terms and as a percentage of income.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

How big? “Three-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the top 1 percent
of taxpayers,” if the plan were put into effect this year, it said. The
highest-income households — the top 0.1 percent — would get “an average
tax cut of about $1.3 million, 16.9 percent of after-tax income.”

Those in the middle fifth of incomes would get a tax cut of almost $260,
or 0.5 percent, while the poorest would get about $50.

That split would worsen down the road, the Tax Policy Center says: “In
2025 the top 1 percent of households would receive nearly 100 percent of
the total tax reduction.”

Those wary of any potential liberal bias could turn to the
conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. [Its
analysis](https://taxfoundation.org/details-and-analysis-2016-house-republican-tax-reform-plan/)
found a smaller gap between the wealthy and everyone else, but a gap
nonetheless. The foundation concluded that four out of five taxpayers
would see only a 0.2 to 0.5 percent increase in after-tax income, while
those in the top 1 percent of the income scale would save at least 10
times as much, or 5.3 percent. That’s nearly $40,000 extra for those at
the top, compared to $67 for those smack dab in the middle of the income
scale.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The Mnuchin rule is already being broken as Republicans look to strip
away hundreds of billions of dollars in Affordable Care Act tax credits
for working Americans to pay for a giant tax break for the wealthy,”
Senator Wyden said. “Bottom line is it’s unfair to cut benefits that the
middle class depends on, all so the wealthy pay a lower rate.”

Mr. Mnuchin did not respond to a request for comment.

Republicans argue their plan makes everyone a winner — that lower taxes
will unleash an enormous swell of economic growth, raising wages,
incomes and tax revenue all around.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The historical record does not offer much support for the claim that
slashing taxes for the most affluent creates growth. Yet even assuming
the rosiest of forecasts, the top 1 percent, according to the Tax
Foundation, would still receive close to a $100,000 tax cut — 32 times
as much as a middle-income family.

Mr. Mnuchin has offered his own formula for adhering to the standard he
laid down, explaining that “any reductions we have in upper-income taxes
would be offset by less deductions.”

That would require some otherworldly mathematical magic, however.

Consider the list of proposals that would reduce taxes on the rich:

> ■ Cut the top income tax rate to 33 percent, from 39.6 percent.
> 
> ■ Cut taxes on capital gains, [70 percent of which flow to the top 1
> percent](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/904606-Tax-Reform-and-the-Tax-Treatment-of-Capital-Gains.PDF).
> 
> ■ Eliminate the estate tax, which applies to a tiny number of people,
> couples that have estates bigger than $10.8 million.
> 
> ■ Eliminate the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners’ investment income
> that has been used to subsidize health care for poorer Americans.
> 
> ■ End the [alternative minimum
> tax](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/alternative_minimum_tax/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier),
> which currently limits deductions for high earners.
> 
> ■ Lower taxes on cash flow and income that passes from small
> businesses to their owners, which also primarily benefits wealthier
> Americans.

Now, what deductions could be eliminated that would offset all those
cuts at the top? There aren’t many, said [Alan
Viard](http://www.aei.org/scholar/alan-d-viard/), an economist at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute. If Republicans insist on
lowering taxes on top wages, capital gains, estates and cash-flow and
pass-through income as advertised, “there’s not a lot of latitude to
limit itemized deductions further,” Mr. Viard said.

Any plan to curb itemized deductions would be partly offset by Mr.
Trump’s plan to increase the standard deduction. Curtailing mortgage
deductions for the most expensive homes is probably a good idea, Mr.
Viard said, but that isn’t going to do much to raise revenue from those
at the top of the income pyramid, and the deduction is already roughly
limited to the interest paid on $1 million in mortgage debt.

Such alternative ideas, however, assume that the Mnuchin rule will have
a meaningful impact on what the White House will propose or Congress
will debate. Not everyone is convinced that it will. As Mr. Viard said,
“I don’t know how much interest there is in fulfilling that statement
by Mnuchin, however it’s interpreted.”
