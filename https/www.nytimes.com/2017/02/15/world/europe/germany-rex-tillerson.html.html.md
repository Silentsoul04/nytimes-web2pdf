BONN, Germany — When President Trump [met with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-trump.html "Times article.")
of Israel at the White House on Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex W.
Tillerson was conspicuously absent. He was on his first flight overseas
as America’s top diplomat, pretty much alone.

Mr. Tillerson, who has no government experience, also missed two other
important occasions in Washington this week: a lunch with Russia’s
ambassador and Mr. Trump’s meetings with the prime minister of Canada.
He has yet to hold a news conference.

Among the eight senior State Department staff members who accompanied
Mr. Tillerson on Wednesday to Bonn, five are serving in temporary
positions.

Mr. Tillerson was not expected to do much talking, at least publicly, at
a Group of 20 foreign ministers’ meeting here on Thursday, which will
lay the groundwork for the Group of 20 meeting in July.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The State Department did not invite the customary scrum of reporters,
apparently hoping that Mr. Tillerson could continue to keep what has so
far been a low profile.

Mr. Tillerson relied on his acting deputy, Thomas A. Shannon Jr., a
holdover from the Obama administration, to be his stand-in for the
meetings this week with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the
lunch with ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak of Russia, who is entangled in
the growing scandal that [cost Michael T. Flynn his
job](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html "Times article.")
as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser.

Having decided to spend Wednesday flying to Bonn so he could get a good
night’s sleep before the Group of 20 meeting, Mr. Tillerson sent Mr.
Shannon to Mr. Trump’s meetings with the Israeli prime minister instead.

The State Department has not held its usual daily briefing since Mr.
Trump was inaugurated last month, and Mr. Tillerson has said almost
nothing publicly since the Senate confirmed him for the job two weeks
ago.

Part of the problem may be an extraordinary leadership vacuum at the
department. Some appointees to top jobs during the Obama administration
resigned or retired, and most of the rest were dismissed by the Trump
administration long before there were candidates to replace them.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Tillerson asked Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and
George W. Bush administrations, to become his No. 2, but [Mr. Trump
overruled
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/politics/trump-wall-21-billion-dollars.html "Times article.").
After interviewing Mr. Abrams in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump decided he
could not get beyond Mr. Abrams’s criticism of him during the campaign.

The very public rejection of Mr. Abrams by Mr. Trump sent a chill
through the ranks of other Republican foreign policy veterans, many of
whom had been equally critical of Mr. Trump during the campaign, if not
more so. Finding the dozens of experienced diplomats needed, just as the
National Security Council is going through its own uproar, will be
challenging.

The official theme of the gathering in Bonn is “Foreign Policy Beyond
Crisis Management.” But the crisis engulfing the White House, over
[contacts between Mr. Trump’s
aides](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html "Times article.")
and Russian intelligence officials, will probably be difficult for Mr.
Tillerson to avoid.

He will meet with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia in the
first high-level face-to-face engagement between the Trump
administration and the Russian government.

Russia’s role in the election of Mr. Trump has become a central concern
for Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill after intelligence
agencies concluded that Russia used hacking to help Mr. Trump’s campaign
and that Trump aides and associates had repeated contacts with senior
Russian intelligence officials.

Since the election, the Trump administration has been [sending mixed
signals](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/michael-flynn-russia.html "Times article.")
on issues important to Russia, particularly the lifting of economic
sanctions.

While Mr. Trump has largely defended President Vladimir V. Putin of
Russia, many of his top aides have been less positive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Tillerson, who was awarded Russia’s Order of Friendship as chief
executive of Exxon Mobil, made critical comments about Russia in his
confirmation hearings, and Pentagon officials recently accused Russia of
[violating a landmark arms control
treaty](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html "Times article.").

Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, who
nominally reports to Mr. Tillerson, [condemned
Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/europe/nikki-haley-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html "Times article.")
this month for its “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine and made it
clear that sanctions imposed on Russia would remain in place.

Mr. Tillerson will also be meeting in Bonn with the foreign ministers of
Britain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Korea, Argentina, Brazil and Italy.
Meetings are planned to discuss the conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

But then, instead of joining many of his counterparts as they head to
the nearby Munich Security Conference, an important annual gathering
focused on security policy that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is also
expected to attend, Mr. Tillerson will go home Friday.
