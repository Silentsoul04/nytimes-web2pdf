# Republicans Agree on Cutting Taxes, but Not on How to Do It

</div>

Republicans control the White House and Congress, and remain united in
their desire to change the tax code. But they are far from united in how
to achieve that
goal.

For anyone who thinks that Republican control of the presidency, the
Senate and the House of Representatives means that an overhaul of the
tax code will zip through at bobsled speed, there is an important phrase
to remember:

[“Blah, blah, blah,
blah.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/us/politics/sweeping-tax-overhaul-plan-would-bring-big-changes.html?_r=0)

That was the reaction of the Republican speaker of the House, John A.
Boehner of Ohio, in 2014 to a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code
proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee — and a member
of his own party.

Republicans remain united in their desire to cut taxes, simplify the
system and recover some of the [$2 trillion in untaxed profits that
American companies have stashed
overseas,](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/your-money/strategies-corporate-cash-repatriation-bipartisan-consensuss.html)
out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. And the possibility of
a once-in-a-generation makeover of the rules governing both business and
personal taxes provides powerful motivation. Still, despite their grip
on power, they are far from united in how to accomplish those goals.

“Just because there’s an ‘R’ in the White House, an ‘R’ in the House and
an ‘R’ in the Senate doesn’t mean they’re from the same alphabet,” said
Douglas Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae.

This time around, the speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Ways
and Means chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas, have both taken ownership of
[a House
blueprint](https://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-Tax-PolicyPaper.pdf)for
transforming the tax code, currently a masterpiece of complexity,
inefficiencies and inequities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But several Republicans have misgivings about specific provisions, not
to mention the cost. As for the White House, the most predictable
response is unpredictability.

The president said his administration would release a [“phenomenal” tax
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/video/business/dealbook/100000004922130/trump-on-phenomenal-tax-plan.html)
in a couple of weeks. Mr. Brady has indicated that he wants to introduce
comprehensive legislation by March and pass a bill before the August
recess — perhaps suggesting the existence of an alternate congressional
universe with no gridlock.

Yet the controversy that has already exploded over how to tax imports
and exports — [the border adjustment
tax](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/02/03/us/politics/03reuters-usa-tax-border.html),
for short — offers a taste of how difficult getting to “yes” will be on
any comprehensive bill.

As it turns out, Republicans at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and in the
House are not that far apart when it comes to the individual side of the
tax code. They agree on the goal of lowering income tax rates for
everybody. The House blueprint reduces the number of brackets to three
from seven and drops the top rate on the highest incomes to 33 percent
from 39.6 percent. The middle range rate would be 25 percent and the
lower rate, 12 percent.

Taxes on capital gains (which tend to affect higher-income households
the most) would be slashed, and the alternative minimum tax, devised to
limit the use of loopholes, would be eliminated. The estate tax, which
affects the top 0.2 percent sliver of households, would disappear, as
would most itemized deductions, including one that allows the deduction
of state and local taxes — dear to anyone who lives where there is a
state or city income tax.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But bigger standard deductions would take away much of the sting,
reducing the incentives for most taxpayers to itemize at all. (Instead
of 30 percent, just 5 percent would still find it worth their while.)
During his campaign, President Trump talked about capping deductions for
mortgage interest and charitable donations, but the House plan promises
to retain them (with vague references to making them more efficient).
Given how popular these two costly deductions are, however, there is not
much appetite in Congress for going after them.

Other proposals, like tax credits for children, have also been widely
embraced.

What could trip up the reform of personal taxes is the promise by the
Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, of [“no absolute tax cut for the
upper
class.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/business/economy/mnuchin-rule-tax-cut.html)
Republicans have repeatedly characterized their plan as a big cut for
the middle class, but independent analyses have concluded that the
wealthy are clearly the biggest winners.

“Three-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the top 1 percent of
taxpayers,” the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said of the House plan.
The highest-income households — the top 0.1 percent — would get “an
average tax cut of about $1.3 million, 16.9 percent of after-tax
income.” By contrast, those in the middle fifth of incomes would get a
0.5 percent tax cut, worth about $260.

Such problems are trifles when compared with divisions caused by
proposed alterations to corporate and business taxes.

On Friday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and a Republican
from Kentucky, announced that Congress would move ahead on health care
and tax reform without the Democrats.

That is not a surprising decision these days, when “bipartisanship” has
turned into a punch line and party-line voting has become the rule
rather than the exception. Still, this strategy has risks .

Laws that lack a single vote from the opposition party are by nature
more controversial, unstable and vulnerable to political attack: The
Affordable Care Act was passed that way. And when the budget is
involved, bills passed with slim majorities can be subject to time
limits. (When you hear Washington insiders talking about “budget
reconciliation,” that’s part of what they are referring to.)

Although Republicans unilaterally pushed through personal tax cuts when
they controlled Congress in the past, the majority’s fast-track weapon
has never been used with comprehensive tax reform. Tax provisions can
dictate many businesses’ long-term planning and investment decisions,
and no one wants to restructure his or her operation only to find that
the rule book will be thrown away in a decade.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee and
now[the longest-serving Republican in the chamber’s
history](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/09/politics/orrin-hatch-senate-honor/),
is also keenly attuned to the Senate’s traditions of decorum and the
veneer of statesmanship.

Earlier this month, he[told the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce,](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/hatch-unveils-finance-committee-agenda-for-115th-congress-)
“My preference would be to find a bipartisan path forward.” He added,
“Historically speaking, that’s what’s worked best.”

The last major [revamping of the tax code,
in 1986,](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/business/a-starting-point-for-tax-reform-what-reagan-did.html)
was led by a Republican president (Ronald Reagan), a Democratic speaker
(Tip O’Neill of Massachusetts) and a Democratic senator (Bill Bradley of
New Jersey). Now, the question is whether Republicans can do it on their
own. Republicans, after all, have just a two-vote margin in the Senate.
And some of the most bitter tax face-offs do not necessarily fall along
partisan or ideological lines.

Ideas intended to discourage companies from going abroad to hire cheaper
foreign workers instead of Americans have split[importers and
exporters](http://fortune.com/2017/02/01/walmart-target-border-tax-trump/).
The border adjustment tax — a complex arrangement that would have the
effect of adding a 20 percent tax to any imports sold in the United
States and nothing on exports — has [drawn support
from](http://www.americanmadecoalition.org/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=border%20tax&utm_medium=search)
agriculture, manufacturing and technology businesses like General
Electric, Boeing, Dow Chemical and Oracle. The companies are exporters
and argue that the move would “support American jobs and American-made
products.”

Sectors that rely heavily on imports — retailers, foreign carmakers and
oil interests led by the billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch —
have [declared war on the
idea](https://www.keepamericaaffordable.com/content.aspx?page=About),
saying it would hurt consumers by raising prices.

[“Mucho
sad,”](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/01/27/lindsey-graham-tweets-concern-over-trumps-mucho-sad-border-tax-proposal/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/)
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, warned on Twitter,
writing that an import tax was “a big-time bad idea” because it would
raise the cost of Mexican products.

Other proposals — like ending the business deduction for interest
payments and allowing immediate
[depreciation](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/a-brief-overview-of-depreciation)
— could set heavily leveraged industries like farming, finance and real
estate (Mr. Trump’s backyard) against those that primarily invest in
equipment that loses value over time, like manufacturers.

“There’s a lot of proposals floating around, and it’s clear there are
going to be some winners and losers,” said Ken Esch, a partner at the
consulting and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. “Many companies
are struggling to figure if they’re going to be a winner or a loser.”

Then there is the cost. Supporters of the House plan say it aims to
bring in the same revenue as the existing code. But independent analyses
by both the [Tax Policy
Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-house-gop-tax-plan)
and the conservative-leaning [Tax
Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/details-and-analysis-2016-house-republican-tax-reform-plan/)
point to a shortfall that could run into the trillions over the next
decade.

That red ink will irk Republican deficit hawks.

“If we don’t get any Democrats on board, we’ll basically need universal
Republican support to pass anything,” Mr. Hatch said. “That means the
Senate will have to work through its own tax reform process if we’re
going to have any chance of succeeding.”

Several Democrats — most important, the Senate’s minority leader, Chuck
Schumer of New York — also want to lower corporate tax rates from their
current 35 percent. (They would demand concessions in return,
potentially putting other treasured Republican proposals at risk.)

With each passing day, partisan rancor has ratcheted up, including in
the Finance Committee. When the Democrats boycotted a committee hearing
on Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Hatch suspended the rule that required a least one
member of the minority party to be in attendance. “I don’t care what
they want at this point,” Mr. Hatch said, calling the Democrats
“idiots.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ignoring Democrats still doesn’t patch up the divisions among
Republicans. Mr. Hatch also told the Chamber of Commerce that “no one
should expect the Senate to simply take up and pass a House tax reform
bill,” signaling to Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady that their blueprint was
unlikely to emerge intact.

At the same time, Mr. Hatch seemed to deliver a subtle dig to Mr. Trump,
who has boasted that when it comes to solving the country’s problems,
[“I alone can fix
it.”](http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000536691)

In regard to lackluster economic growth, a crippling national debt and
many other problems, Mr. Hatch told the chamber, “I certainly don’t
believe they can all be fixed by a single party or president.”

The veteran Republican’s warning, however, is unlikely to stop the
Republicans from trying.
