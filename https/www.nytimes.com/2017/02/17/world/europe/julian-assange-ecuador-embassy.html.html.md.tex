LONDON --- When Ecuador holds a general election on Sunday, the results
could have international repercussions linked to one man thousands of
miles away: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who took refuge in
the country's embassy in London nearly five years ago and who remains
there.

Mr. Assange moved into the embassy in Knightsbridge, one of the British
capital's most affluent neighborhoods, after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/europe/assange-gives-detailed-account-of-rape-accusation.html}{accusations
of rape in Sweden}, which he has described as a cover-up for an American
effort to extradite him and try him on espionage charges.

Whether Ecuador will continue its role of reluctant warden to Mr.
Assange, who was granted
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/world/americas/ecuador-to-let-assange-stay-in-its-embassy.html}{asylum
by President Rafael Correa in 2012}, hinges on the outcome of the
elections. Eight candidates are seeking the presidency, and at least two
have said they would evict him if they won.

If balloting reflects recent poll results, it is unlikely that Mr.
Assange would need to pack his bags anytime soon: While Mr. Correa's
preferred successor, Lenín Moreno, is the front-runner, polls indicate
that the election is likely to go to a second round, meaning that Mr.
Assange's fate may not be decided until a runoff in early April.

If Guillermo Lasso of Creating Opportunities or Cynthia Viteri of the
Social Christian Party pull off an upset, however, it could be a
different fate altogether.

``As president of this nation, I need the money used for his upkeep, for
example to pay for my children's school lunches,'' Ms. Viteri said about
Mr. Assange,
\href{http://elcomercio.pe/mundo/latinoamerica/ecuador-viteri-retirara-asilo-assange-si-gana-elecciones-noticia-1969235}{the
newspaper El Comercio} reported on Thursday. ``I withdraw his asylum,''
she said, ``for the purchase, in my opinion, of Mr. Assange's silence.''
She did not elaborate.

Ms. Viteri was a distant third in two recent polls, with about 14
percent of support.

In the past, Mr. Lasso has supported Mr. Assange's stay at the embassy,
but he expressed a different view in comments to
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-notice-eviction}{The
Guardian} last week.

``The Ecuadorean people have been paying a cost that we should not have
to bear,'' he said. ``We will cordially ask Señor Assange to leave
within 30 days of assuming a mandate.''

\subsection{How Julian Assange and WikiLeaks Became Targets of the U.S.
Government}\label{how-julian-assange-and-wikileaks-became-targets-of-the-us-government}}

Here are key points in his case since WikiLeaks burst onto the scene in
2010.

Foreign Minister Guillaume Long has rejected the idea that Mr. Assange
might be forced to leave the embassy. ``We've ratified his asylum
several times, and under this government, there is no decision to revoke
it at all,'' he said in an interview on Friday. ``Let's not forget that
Julian Assange was granted asylum on grounds of fear of possible
political persecution.''

Mr. Moreno, the front-runner, did not make much of the issue of Mr.
Assange's fate during the campaign, which has focused on economic
matters at a time of falling oil prices.

Speculation that Mr. Assange was overstaying his welcome grew when the
embassy cut off
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/world/europe/julian-assange-embassy.html}{his
access to the internet} in October, shortly before elections in the
United States.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/julian-assange-wikileaks-emails.html}{WikiLeaks
had published} tens of thousands of hacked emails from inside
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/hillary-rodham-clinton?inline=nyt-per}{Hillary
Clinton}'s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

``We didn't want any ambiguity,'' Mr. Long said of his country's
decision to cut off Mr. Assange's online access. ``We wanted it to be
very clear that Ecuador's diplomatic mission was not being used in order
to interfere in the U.S. electoral process.''

Mr. Long said that Mr. Assange, whom he last saw in June, lived in
``extremely tough conditions,'' in a small space with very little light.
``London is not exactly the most luminous city, and it has a long
winter,'' he said.

The foreign minister revealed some weariness with the length of Mr.
Assange's time at the embassy, The Guardian reported, asking for Sweden
to speed up its investigation as ``this has been going on for far too
long.''

But in the interview on Friday, he dismissed the idea that providing
refuge to Mr. Assange came at a financial cost that Ecuadoreans could
not afford. Rather, he said, the cost is political.

``We've taken a principled decision, and it speaks highly of a country
that defends its ideals, not just petty interests,'' he said.

``Having one more person in the embassy is a marginal addition to the
cost of running the embassy,'' he continued. ``What's the cost of having
someone in the bedroom?''
