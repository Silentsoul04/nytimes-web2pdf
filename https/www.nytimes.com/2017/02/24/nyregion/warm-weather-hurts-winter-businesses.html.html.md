They threw open their windows, sat outside in parks, chatted outdoors
with jackets off. On an unseasonably warm day in New York — where
70-degree temperatures surpassed those in Los Angeles — the weather gave
many residents a reason to enjoy being outside.

But for scarf and glove vendors, firewood sellers, heating oil companies
and others whose fortunes rise in the cold, the weather was another
reason to groan in a winter that has rarely delivered a frost.

“We’ve sold a fraction, somewhere between a quarter and a third of what
we would normally sell shovel-wise and salt-wise for winters past,” said
Joe Franquinha, the owner of [Crest
Hardware](http://www.cresthardwarenyc.com/ "store's website") in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are difficulties weathering winter — already a slow season —
without much, well, winter, Mr. Franquinha said. Stocking a store like
his requires preparation: thousands of dollars worth of salt, shovels,
space heaters and window insulation need to be ready the instant the
forecast calls for a heavy snow or cold snap.

Order too little, Mr. Franquinha said, and customers will gripe upon
finding your shelves bare. And in New York, who has space for too much?
His distributors had taken to bartering their winter wares at steep
discounts, Mr. Franquinha said. Still, he wasn’t stocking up.

“They don’t want it a week after it snows,” Mr. Franquinha said. “You
can’t win.”

There has been one benefit, Mr. Franquinha said: Customers catching a
taste of spring were starting to buy plants.

At the outdoor ice rink at Brookfield Place in Battery Park City, the
staff put up cautionary wet floor cones in the puddles that had formed
from water melting off the rink. A handful of skaters glided over the
surface of what looked like a lake.

“Trying to maintain the ice in 67-degree weather, it’s a mission,” said
the rink manager Miguel Cordero, 24, who was taking advantage of a quiet
moment to skate in a T-shirt and
sunglasses.

“It’s soft,” he said of the ice. “Every glide you take you’re trying not
to kick too much, because you don’t want a boot full of water.”

Friday was the warmest day of an already [warm
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/nyregion/NYC-school-closings-winter-storm.html)
where the mean temperature in New York has hovered near 40 degrees —
about five degrees above average, according to the National Weather
Service. Records were set around the region: 74 degrees in Newark, 65
degrees in Bridgeport, Conn., and 64 degrees in Islip on Long Island.
While the 70 degrees registered in Central Park was not a record, it was
only the city’s eighth recorded sighting of the 70-degree mark in
February.

“It isn’t good for us,” said Wayne Ambrose, 68, the owner of Astoria
Fuel Corporation in Queens, as sunlight streamed through the windows of
his shop.

On a normal February day he makes around 15 to 20 stops to refill
heating oil and repair and replace boilers. By the time he closed up his
shop on Friday, he’d only made
six.

it’s harder for a small company like us,” he said. “Weather like this,
it hurts.”

Sharieff White, 53, who sells warm weather apparel from a table in
Midtown, took out the T-shirts on Friday. But the rhinestone-laden
baseball caps he was selling lacked the appeal of a pair of gloves on a
cold day.

“When you’re cold, you feel like, ‘I gotta have it, I don’t care. My
hands are freezing, I gotta have it,’” he said.

Even some business opportunities that arose in the warm weather were
fleeting. In East Harlem, the Urban Garden Center had flowering plants
on the street for the first time since October. But customers were told
to be cautious. It is still winter, after all.

“We’re not going to hope there’s a run on daffodils today without
explaining that in two days you might be disappointed,” said Dimitri
Gatanas, a co-owner of the store.
