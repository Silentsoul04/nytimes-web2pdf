HONG KONG — The Malaysian authorities said on Friday that Kim Jong-nam,
the half brother of North Korea’s leader, had been [killed by VX nerve
agent](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-vx-nerve-agent-.html)
applied to his face. The substance, listed as a chemical weapon, was
kept for decades in the arsenals of many militaries, including that of
the United States. But since the [Chemical Weapons
Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/) came into
force in 1997, most stockpiles globally have been destroyed.

## What is a nerve agent?

A [nerve agent](https://fas.org/programs/bio/chemweapons/cwagents.html),
sometimes called nerve gas, acts on the nervous system of an organism
and prevents muscles from functioning properly. The substance is derived
from organophosphate pesticides, and military officials had envisioned
dispersing it over a wide area — using a specialized artillery shell or
bomb, for instance — to kill or incapacitate enemy forces and make the
affected area impossible to safely move through.

## How does it kill you?

The VX molecule
[interferes](https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp) with
the way glands and muscles function by blocking an enzyme that allows
them to relax. That causes muscles to clench uncontrollably and,
eventually, prevents a victim from being able to breathe. The lethal
dose for VX ranges from about 10 milligrams via skin contact to 25 to 30
milligrams if inhaled. Early symptoms can include pinprick pupils, runny
nose, wheezing and muscle twitching. Death can occur anywhere from
within a few minutes to hours, depending on the dose and the method of
contact.

## Are there any antidotes?

Injections of
[atropine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/atropine), if
administered quickly after exposure, can
[counteract](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a9388/how-it-works-atropine-the-nerve-gas-antidote-15859092/)
the lethal effects of VX. The drug counteracts VX’s effects on a
neurotransmitter, while another drug, pralidoxime, counteracts
enzyme-related effects, allowing cells to resume functioning normally.
Hospitals generally have atropine on hand; it is commonly used in much
less drastic situations, like dilating pupils for eye exams.
Anticonvulsive drugs like
[diazepam](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3016#section=Therapeutic-Uses)
may also be administered. Military forces are often equipped with
autoinjectors, which can be removed from a wrapper and used directly
through clothing or protective gear in the event of an attack.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Has VX been used before?

Not in combat. In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult [Aum
Shinrikyo](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/03/14/national/history/cult-attraction-aum-shinrikyos-power-persuasion/#.WK--yW996po)
used homemade VX to poison three people, one of whom died.

In the 1960s, testing of a nerve agent that may have been VX led to the
[accidental
deaths](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F05E7DF1639EF3BBC4A51DFB3668382679EDE&legacy=true)
of thousands of sheep in Utah. Syrian government forces are accused of
using a related nerve agent, possibly
[sarin](https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/), against civilians
[in 2013](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/world/middleeast/new-study-refines-view-of-sarin-attack-in-syria.html).

## How detectable is VX?

In its purest form, VX is colorless, tasteless and odorless. But
production often introduces small impurities, turning it light yellow or
amber. It is slightly oily to the touch and is considered not very
volatile, meaning it does not evaporate quickly. Its chemical makeup is
easily detectable through testing, but if medical personnel are not
expecting to encounter it, that testing may not occur.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

VX can also be delivered in [“binary”
form](https://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/nerve-agents/#c4114),
meaning two relatively harmless compounds can be combined in the field
to create the lethal nerve agent, which may have been the method used to
kill Mr. Kim.

## How do you make VX?

Very carefully. Many of the individual ingredients — sulfur, for
instance — are easy to come by. Others, like hydrochloric acid gas, may
require some hunting. Obtaining all of them would most likely draw the
attention of some high-ranking law enforcement officials. Making VX is,
essentially, a matter of having the right ingredients; gear like flasks,
distillation equipment and aspirators; and a desire to manufacture
something deadly enough to kill you with a single misplaced drop.
