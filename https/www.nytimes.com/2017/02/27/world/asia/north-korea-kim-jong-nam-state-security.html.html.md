SEOUL, South Korea — Officials from North Korea’s secret police and
Foreign Ministry were involved in the killing of the estranged half
brother of the country’s leader, South Korean intelligence officials
told lawmakers on Monday.

Ever since [Kim
Jong-nam](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/asia/kim-jong-un-brother-killed-malaysia.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article),
the eldest brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was first
reported assassinated, the South Korean government has held the North
responsible. On Monday, the National Intelligence Service in Seoul
provided more details of what it described as state-sponsored terrorism,
saying that four of the eight North Koreans identified as suspects by
the Malaysian authorities were agents from North Korea’s Ministry of
State Security, the country’s secret police.

Speaking on Monday in a closed-door parliamentary hearing, Lee Byung-ho,
the director of the National Intelligence Service, said that two other
suspects worked for the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The
remaining two were affiliated with [Air
Koryo](http://www.airkoryo.com.kp/), the North’s state-run airline
company, and Singwang Economics and Trading General Corporation, Mr. Lee
said, according to two lawmakers who attended the briefing. Singwang is
among North Korean companies facing United Nations sanctions.

The Malaysian authorities have said that Mr. Kim was [killed by an
extremely toxic nerve agent known as
VX](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-vx-nerve-agent-.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article).
They said that the North Koreans had hired and trained two women, one
from Indonesia, the other from Vietnam, to attack Mr. Kim at Kuala
Lumpur International Airport. The women smeared his face with the
chemical while he was waiting to check in for a flight to Macau, where
he and his family had a home, they said.

The two women are now in police custody in Kuala Lumpur.

Mr. Lee, the South Korean intelligence chief, was quoted by the
lawmakers as saying that the eight North Koreans, working as two
four-member teams, converged in Kuala Lumpur to carry out the Feb. 13
assassination.

He said that Ri Jae-nam, a state security agent, and Ri Ji-hyon, a
Foreign Ministry official, had brought [Doan Thi
Huong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-suspect-doan-thi-huong.html),
a 28-year-old Vietnamese woman, into the assassination plot, while [Siti
Aisyah](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-vx-nerve-agent-siti-aisyah.html),
a 25-year-old Indonesian woman, was hired by O Jong-gil, a state
security agent, and by Hong Song-hac, a Foreign Ministry official.

The four North Koreans who made up the assassination team left Malaysia
the same day Mr. Kim was killed and are believed to be back in their
country, Mr. Lee was quoted as saying. The Malaysian police have
confirmed their departure.

[Hyon
Kwang-song](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-killing-malaysia-north-korea.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FKim%20Jong-un&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=9&pgtype=collection),
a senior diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and three
other North Koreans worked as a support team, Mr. Lee told the
lawmakers, keeping track of Kim Jong-nam’s whereabouts and providing
logistical assistance. Mr. Hyon worked for the Ministry of State
Security, he said.

Mr. Hyon and the Air Koryo employee, Kim Uk-il, remain at the embassy in
Malaysia.

A third member of the support team, identified as Ri Jong-chol, has been
arrested in Kuala Lumpur. The fourth, identified as Ri Ji-u, is believed
to be at large in Malaysia.

North Korea’s Ministry of State Security specializes in ferreting out
people whose loyalty to Kim Jong-un’s totalitarian regime is in doubt.
Mr. Kim is believed to have used the ministry in the arrests and
executions of senior officials, including an uncle, [Jang
Song-thaek](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/world/asia/north-korea-says-uncle-of-executed.html),
who was executed on charges of corruption and sedition in 2013. The
ministry also runs a network of prison camps.

During the intelligence briefing on Monday, Mr. Lee told the lawmakers
that five senior officials affiliated with the State Security Ministry
had been executed with antiaircraft guns. He also said that [Gen. Kim
Won-hong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/world/asia/north-korea-purge-kim-jong-un-kim-won-hong.html?_r=0),
who was removed as chief of the secret police in January, was in
detention as part of a purge.

Mr. Lee said that General Kim and his five deputies had angered Kim
Jong-un by filing false reports, but he did not elaborate. The South’s
intelligence agency had said earlier that General Kim was dismissed on
charges of corruption and abuse of power.

He was the latest in a series of high-ranking party and military
officials that Kim Jong-un has fired, demoted or executed in efforts to
consolidate his power through what South Korean officials have called a
“reign of terror.”
