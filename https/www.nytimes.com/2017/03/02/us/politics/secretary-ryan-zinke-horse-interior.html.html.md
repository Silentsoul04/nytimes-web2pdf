On his first day on the job, the new Interior Department secretary, Ryan
Zinke, proved he knows how to make an entrance: arriving high in the
saddle on Tonto, an Irish sport horse. Mounted police escorted him a few
blocks through Washington.

Mr. Zinke, [a fifth-generation
Montanan](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/ryan-zinke-navy-seal.html)who
now oversees the country’s 500 million acres of public land, including
59 national parks, showed up to work to a grand reception.

Officers from various agencies under the Interior Department lined the
steps to the administration building. A drummer from his home state’s
Northern Cheyenne tribe performed. The department is the liaison with
federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native nations.

Mr. Zinke, 55, [served nearly two dozen years with the Navy
SEALs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/16/us/politics/document-Ryan-Zinke-Navy-SEAL-Records.html)
before entering politics in 2008 as a Republican. After two terms in the
Montana legislature, he was elected in 2014 as the state’s at-large
representative in the House, before his nomination to the cabinet by
President Trump. He was confirmed on Wednesday by the Senate with a vote
of 68-31.

His horseback journey on Thursday started around 9 a.m., when Mr. Zinke,
wearing a cowboy hat and jeans, mounted Tonto, a bay roan. Tonto, a
gelding, stands an inch more than 17 hands, or about 5-foot-9, and
belongs to the United States Park police. He is kept in stables at the
National Mall.

Mr. Zinke rode several blocks to the entrance of the Interior Department
on C Street NW, dismounted and then introduced himself to the staff
inside, a department spokeswoman said. The department has 70,000
employees at 2,400 locations.

“It was quite a neat reception,” said Greg Julian, a spokesman at the
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
