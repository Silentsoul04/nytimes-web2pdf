WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Rick Perry on Thursday as the head of
the Energy Department, an agency he had once pledged as a presidential
candidate to eliminate.

The vote was 62 to 37. Mr. Perry, a former Texas governor, will lead an
agency that, despite its name, is largely focused on overseeing the
nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, as well as a network of 17
national scientific laboratories.

In his confirmation hearing, [Mr. Perry told
senators](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/rick-perry-energy-department.html)
that he regretted his call in the 2012 campaign to eliminate the agency.
His [inability to remember the
name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvmKnFY4uk) of the Energy
Department in a 2011 debate, even as he called for getting rid of the
agency, was widely seen as helping to sink his campaign.

People close to Mr. Perry said that at the time he had [believed that
the Energy
Department](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/rick-perry-energy-secretary-donald-trump.html)
was largely focused on developing and promoting the nation’s energy
resources. At his January confirmation hearing, Mr. Perry told the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after “being briefed
on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,” he now
supported its mission.

The agency does play some role in the nation’s energy policy: Its
laboratories conduct research into energy technologies that could help
fight climate change.

Mr. Perry, who has long called climate change a hoax and mocked the
science of human-caused climate change, said he had also changed those
views, telling senators: “I believe the climate is changing. I believe
some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by
man-made activity.”
