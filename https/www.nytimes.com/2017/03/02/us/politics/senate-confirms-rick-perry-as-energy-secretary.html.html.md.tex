WASHINGTON --- The Senate confirmed Rick Perry on Thursday as the head
of the Energy Department, an agency he had once pledged as a
presidential candidate to eliminate.

The vote was 62 to 37. Mr. Perry, a former Texas governor, will lead an
agency that, despite its name, is largely focused on overseeing the
nation's vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, as well as a network of 17
national scientific laboratories.

In his confirmation hearing,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/rick-perry-energy-department.html}{Mr.
Perry told senators} that he regretted his call in the 2012 campaign to
eliminate the agency. His
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvmKnFY4uk}{inability to remember
the name} of the Energy Department in a 2011 debate, even as he called
for getting rid of the agency, was widely seen as helping to sink his
campaign.

People close to Mr. Perry said that at the time he had
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/rick-perry-energy-secretary-donald-trump.html}{believed
that the Energy Department} was largely focused on developing and
promoting the nation's energy resources. At his January confirmation
hearing, Mr. Perry told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee that after ``being briefed on so many of the vital functions
of the Department of Energy,'' he now supported its mission.

The agency does play some role in the nation's energy policy: Its
laboratories conduct research into energy technologies that could help
fight climate change.

Mr. Perry, who has long called climate change a hoax and mocked the
science of human-caused climate change, said he had also changed those
views, telling senators: ``I believe the climate is changing. I believe
some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by
man-made activity.''
