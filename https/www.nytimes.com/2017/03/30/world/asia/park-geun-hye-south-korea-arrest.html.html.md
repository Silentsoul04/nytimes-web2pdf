SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s recently impeached president, Park
Geun-hye, was arrested on Friday, becoming the first South Korean leader
to be put behind bars since the mid 1990s, when two former military
[dictators were
imprisoned](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/world/south-korea-indicts-2-former-presidents-in-staging-of-1979-coup.html)
on corruption and mutiny charges.

Ms. Park’s dramatic downfall capped months of turmoil and intrigue, as
huge crowds took to the streets [to protest a sprawling corruption
scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html)
that shook the interlocking worlds of government and business —
including [the leadership of
Samsung](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/business/jay-y-lee-samsung-trial.html),
the nation’s largest conglomerate.

A judge at the Seoul Central District Court issued the warrant early
Friday morning, warning that if Ms. Park were not taken into custody
quickly she might “destroy evidence.” The charges against her include
bribery, extortion and abuse of power.

In December, the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach Ms.
Park, and she was formally removed from office on March 10.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Her removal rattled the delicate balance of relationships across Asia at
a tense moment. Ms. Park’s conservatives, in power for four years, had
joined the United States in pressing for a hard line against North
Korea’s nuclear program. She had accepted Washington’s deployment of
an advanced missile defense system that has angered China, which is
[fearful of an arms
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/asia/thaad-missile-defense-us-south-korea-china.html)
in the region.

Moon Jae-in, the liberal opposition leader considered most likely to win
the May 9 election to select a new president, has vowed to review that
decision, as well as an unpopular deal she struck with Japan over the
so-called comfort women, or Korean sex slaves, used by Japan’s army
during World War II.

Mr. Moon is also viewed as less confrontational toward North Korea and
China, and has advocated dialogue to halt the North’s nuclear and
missile threats.

Ms. Park had spent the night in the prosecutor’s office waiting to learn
if she would be placed under arrest. Shortly after 3 a.m., Judge Kang
Bu-young issued the warrant and Ms. Park was taken to a jail outside
Seoul, the South Korean capital.

Prosecutors had already said that they would indict the former president
on 13 criminal charges regardless of whether the judge issued an arrest
warrant. Once her trial begins in the coming weeks, Ms. Park will
commute from her cell to a Seoul courthouse.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Park was accused of conspiring with a longtime confidante,[Choi
Soon-sil](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/world/asia/south-koreans-ashamed-over-les-secretive-adviser.html),
to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, including
more than $38 million in bribes from Samsung. Both Ms. Choi and
Samsung’s top executive, [Lee
Jae-yong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/samsung-heir-arrested-south-korea.html),
have previously been arrested and are standing trial on charges
including bribery.

On Thursday, hundreds of emotional supporters were gathered near her
two-story, red brick house in southern Seoul as her motorcade pulled out
for the hearing. Some tried to push past police officers lining the
road.

“We can’t let you go\!” they shouted, some of them trying to hurl
themselves onto the road. Protesters also threw yellow plastic police
fences at uniformed officers who tried to push them back.

The 10-minute ride was nationally televised, with a fleet of television
crews following her car.

If she is convicted of bribery, Ms. Park, 65, could face between 10
years and life in prison, although her successor has the power to free
her with a special presidential pardon.

Ms. Park’s arrest added another tragic chapter to the story of her
family, which has mirrored the country’s tumultuous modern history.

Her father, Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979, was
considered the initiator of the country’s dramatic economic growth but
was also vilified as a dictator who used martial law and torture to
silence dissidents.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 1974, her mother, Yuk Young-soo, was fatally shot by a pro-North
Korean assassin who had targeted her husband. Ms. Park’s father was
assassinated five years later by his spy chief.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After leaving the presidential Blue House, Ms. Park lived in seclusion,
unmarried and without children. In the succeeding decades, while the
country moved toward democracy, her family drew little attention.

Then in the late 1990s, as the economy faltered in the financial spasms
that engulfed Asia, and South Koreans began yearning for the kind of
charismatic and stern leadership her father represented, Ms. Park was
catapulted into political stardom.

She seized the opportunity and won a parliamentary seat in 1998, casting
herself as a faithful daughter on a mission to rebuild the nation and
restore the honor of her father and his generation, whom she credited
with fighting Communism and creating a vibrant, world-class economy from
the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.

In 2013, she returned to the Blue House, her childhood home, after
winning the presidential election. She was the first child of a former
president to win the presidency.

Older South Koreans were among her most fervent supporters, while
critics warned that she was trying to take the country back to its
authoritarian past.

Four years later, her career ended in disgrace. In a speech last
November, as the growing scandal paralyzed her government, she tearfully
confided that she regretted ever becoming president.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While a majority of South Koreans believe her ouster was merited, Ms.
Park’s fall from grace has been hard to accept for many older,
conservative South Koreans who still worshiped her father and family as
Koreans once did their ancient kings.

“Your highness, I am so sorry that I am powerless to protect you,” an
old woman recently [wailed on the
pavement](http://www.wikitree.co.kr/main/news_view.php?id=295753) in
front of Ms. Park’s home. “Please forgive me, your highness.”

Since she [returned to her
home](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/world/asia/park-geun-hye-blue-house.html)
on March 12, hundreds of supporters holding South Korean flags have been
rallying daily outside the house to protest her impeachment and oppose
her arrest.

Ms. Park, who has never accepted the Constitutional Court ruling that
[ended her
presidency](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html),
did not answer questions shouted from reporters as she walked into the
courthouse on Thursday. But she had earlier denied any legal wrongdoing.

Last fall, local news media and former associates of Ms. Choi’s began
exposing lurid details of Ms. Park’s alleged conspiracy to abuse her
presidential authority to help Ms. Choi, one of her few friends, to
collect bribes or extort large “donations” from big businesses.

With the economy slowing and youth unemployment rising, the allegations
convinced people that Ms. Park had inherited the worst traits of her
father: an authoritarian streak and corrupt ties with the business
elite. They took to the streets in central Seoul, up to two million at a
time, marching peacefully to demand her resignation. When she refused to
step down, the National Assembly [voted overwhelmingly to impeach
her](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
on Dec. 9, and she was formally removed from office on March 10.

Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader to be forced from office in
response to popular pressure since the country’s founding president,
Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against
his corrupt, authoritarian rule.

Two former presidents — the military dictators Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo — were arrested in 1995 on charges of each collecting hundreds
of millions of dollars in bribes. The two men, former army generals,
also faced [sedition and mutiny
charges](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/world/south-korea-indicts-2-former-presidents-in-staging-of-1979-coup.html)
for their roles in the 1979 military coup that brought them to power and
in the 1980 massacre of antigovernment demonstrators in the southwestern
city of Gwangju.

Mr. Chun was sentenced to life in prison while Mr. Roh was sentenced to
17 years. Both were pardoned and released in December 1997.
