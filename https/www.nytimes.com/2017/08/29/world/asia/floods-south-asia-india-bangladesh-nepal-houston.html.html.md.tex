MUMBAI, India --- More than 1,000 people have died in floods across
South Asia this summer, and as sheets of incessant rain pummeled the
vast region on Tuesday, worries grew that the death toll would rise
along with the floodwaters.

According to the United Nations, at least 41 million people in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/climate/bangladesh-floods.html}{Bangladesh},
India and Nepal have been directly affected by flooding and landslides
resulting from the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/world/asia/monsoon-asia-bangladesh-india.html}{monsoon
rains}, which usually begin in June and last until September.

And while flooding in the Houston area has grabbed more attention, aid
officials say a catastrophe is unfolding in South Asia.

In Nepal, thousands of homes have been destroyed and dozens of people
swept away. Elephants were pressed into service, wading through swirling
waters to rescue people, and aid workers have built rafts from bamboo
and banana leaves.

But many people are still missing, and some families have held last
rites without their loved ones' bodies being found.

``This is the severest flooding in a number of years,'' Francis Markus,
a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, said by phone from Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.

Nepal's flooded areas are the poorest parts of the country, where most
families live in bare mud houses and rely on subsistence farming, he
said. Those farms are now underwater, and thousands of people are stuck
living under plastic tarps in camps for displaced people where disease
is beginning to spread.

Asked how the situation in Nepal compared with that in Houston, Mr.
Markus said, ``We hope people won't overlook the desperate needs of the
people here because of the disasters closer home.''

India has also suffered immensely. Floods have swept across the states
of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and other areas.

This weekend,

than 400 people are believed to have died in floods} in recent weeks. He
pledged millions of dollars in assistance and urged insurance companies
to send in assessors as soon as possible to help farmers cope with their
losses.

And the rain keeps coming.

On Tuesday, Mumbai, the sprawling financial capital, was soaked to the
bone. Nearly all day, the rain drummed down. As people scurried up the
sidewalks, the wind tore umbrellas out of their hands.

The sky seemed to fall lower and lower, pressing down on the building
tops, cutting visibility to a few blocks, then a few yards. By
midafternoon, it was so dark it felt like nightfall.

Busy intersections were deluged, and cars struggled to part the muddy,
greenish waters. Several Mumbai television channels reported that more
rain had fallen on the city in the past several days than any other time
since July 2005, when severe flooding killed more than 1,000 people in
this part of India.

trains and flights were delayed or canceled}, marooning countless
people. The authorities urged people to stay home and keep the roads
clear for emergency vehicles. (Many did not heed that advice, leading to
traffic snarls throughout the city on Tuesday evening.)

Schools and colleges were shut. Rising water spilled into hospitals and
sloshed across the floors.

Police officials warned people to leave their cars behind if they were
caught in a flash flood.

The Mumbai police, writing on Twitter, urged people to abandon their
cars if they encountered high water.

The monsoons have battered Bangladesh as well. A low-lying and densely
populated country of 165 million, Bangladesh is chronically ravaged by
flooding. This year's monsoons have left roughly a third of its terrain
submerged.

The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent
\href{http://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/2017/08/28/millions-flood-affected-people-bangladesh-live-life-uncertainty-despite-decreasing-water-levels/}{said
on its website} that more than eight million Bangladeshis had been
affected by the flooding, the worst in 40 years. At least 140 people
have died, and nearly 700,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.

Corinne Ambler, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Bangladesh who had just taken
an aerial tour of the devastation, said she was stunned.

``All I could see was water, the whole way,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Dhaka, the capital. ``You have tiny little clumps of
houses stuck in the middle of water.''

After visiting some of the afflicted villages by boat, she said that
many Bangladeshis had told her, ``We're used to flooding, but we've
never seen anything like this in our lives.''
