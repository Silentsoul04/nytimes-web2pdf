It was the biggest known breach of a company’s computer network. And
now, it is even bigger.

Verizon Communications, which acquired Yahoo this year, said on Tuesday
that a previously disclosed attack that had occurred in 2013 affected
all three billion of Yahoo’s user accounts.

Last year, Yahoo said the 2013 attack on its network had affected one
billion accounts. Three months before that, the company also disclosed a
separate attack, [which had occurred
in 2014,](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hackers.html?action=click&contentCollection=Technology&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article)
that had affected 500 million accounts.

Digital thieves made off with names, birth dates, phone numbers and
passwords of users that were encrypted with security that was easy to
crack.

The intruders also obtained the security questions and backup email
addresses used to reset lost passwords — valuable information for
someone trying to break into other accounts owned by the same user, and
particularly useful to a hacker seeking to break into government
computers around the world.

Yahoo sold itself to Verizon for $4.48 billion in June. But the deal was
nearly derailed by the disclosure of the breaches and $350 million was
[cut from Verizon’s original
offer](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/technology/verizon-will-pay-350-million-less-for-yahoo.html?_r=0).
Yahoo was combined with AOL, another faded web pioneer that Verizon
bought in 2015, into a new division of the telecommunications company
called Oath.

That investigators did not discover the full extent of the 2013 incident
before Verizon closed the deal to acquire Yahoo in June was surprising
to outside cybersecurity analysts.

“Frankly, I don’t know how Yahoo got away with this,” said Jay Kaplan, a
former Defense Department cybersecurity expert and senior analyst at the
National Security Agency who is now the chief executive of the
cybersecurity company Synack.

After Yahoo discovered that one billion accounts were affected, it
should not have been a stretch to consider that all of the company’s
user accounts had been compromised, he said. “My guess is that Yahoo was
completely ‘owned’ across the board,” Mr. Kaplan said.

Verizon [said in a
statement](https://www.oath.com/press/yahoo-provides-notice-to-additional-users-affected-by-previously/)
[Tuesday](https://www.oath.com/press/yahoo-provides-notice-to-additional-users-affected-by-previously/)that,
with the assistance of outside forensic experts, it had determined that
all Yahoo’s user accounts were affected. The company said it would
continue to work closely with law
enforcement.

“Our investment in Yahoo is allowing that team to continue to take
significant steps to enhance their security, as well as benefit from
Verizon’s experience and resources,” Chandra B. McMahon, Verizon’s chief
information security officer, said in the statement. The company said it
did not have more to add beyond an [additional fact sheet for
users.](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN28451.html?impressions=true)

Yahoo was hit with several shareholder lawsuits after the breaches
became public, and the disclosure that data on all of its accounts was
compromised could increase financial liabilities for Verizon.

No one knows exactly what happened to the data after it was stolen in
2013. But last August, a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe
quietly began offering Yahoo’s information for sale, according to
intelligence gathered by InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity company
that monitors the darker corners of the web.

Since then, at least three buyers — two known “spammers” and an entity
that appeared more interested in using the stolen Yahoo data for
espionage — paid about $300,000 each for a complete copy of Yahoo’s
stolen database, InfoArmor said after Yahoo first disclosed the breach.

Cybersecurity professionals warned that because many of the three
billion Yahoo accounts belong to people who use the same passwords for
different sites and services, there is likely to be an escalation of
email fraud and account takeovers. They added that anyone who had used
Yahoo should be [diligent about monitoring their personal
accounts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/technology/how-to-protect-data-online.html)

With the stolen data, fraudsters have a higher chance of gaining access
to the victims’ bank accounts, said Frances Zelazny, the vice president
of marketing at BioCatch, a security start-up. “Most people reuse
passwords or make multiple versions of the same passwords that are easy
to hack,” she said.

Yahoo maintains that the breaches in 2014 and 2013 are not related. But
investigators believe the attackers behind the 2013 breach were Russian
and possibly linked to the Russian government.

In March, the Department of Justice charged four men, including two
Russian intelligence officers, with the 2014 breach. Investigators said
the Russian government used stolen Yahoo data to spy on a range of
targets in the United States, including White House and military
officials, bank executives and even a gambling regulator in Nevada,
according to [an
indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions).

The stolen data was also used to spy on Russian government officials and
business executives, federal prosecutors said.

What made that theft particularly egregious, Justice Department
officials said, was that the two intelligence officers who were indicted
had worked for an arm of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B.,
that is charged with helping foreign intelligence agencies track
cybercriminals.
