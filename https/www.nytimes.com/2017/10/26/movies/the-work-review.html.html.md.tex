The main takeaway from the prison-therapy documentary
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/100000005492201/trailer-the-work.html}{``The
Work''} (besides the fact that watching grown men scream and grovel is
not for the fainthearted), is that crime in this country could be
drastically reduced if only more fathers were around to raise their
sons.

That may seem a simplistic, even flippant conclusion. But hearing inmate
after inmate describe an absent or emotionally withholding father as the
source of his mental anguish renders it also an inescapable one. Set
mainly in a single, stone-walled room in Folsom State Prison in
California, this fly-on-the-wall study by Jairus McLeary and Gethin
Aldous follows three variously troubled non-inmates over four days of
intense group therapy with a passel of maximum-security convicts.

Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels
unseemly to witness, ``The Work'' is enlightening yet also punishing.
Even more disturbing than one of the crimes described --- and the
near-constant background howls --- is the convicts' willingness to bare
their souls for the nosing-around camera. Some offenders have been
attending these sessions (run by an admirable
\href{http://insidecircle.org/about-us/our-mission/}{nonprofit}
dedicated to inmates' personal growth) for years, and the
brothers-in-arms lingo of the 12-step program flows easily. The men's
wrenching revelations and raging breakdowns appear brave and genuine;
but how far can we trust behavior that at some point could be factored
into parole decisions?

For one quiet outside visitor, warily watching these agonized displays,
the pressure to follow suit is palpable.

``I didn't come here looking to cry,'' he says, ``and I don't want to
feel like I'm letting them down if I don't.'' His guardedness is the
movie's most relatable moment.
