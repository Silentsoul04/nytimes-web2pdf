SAN JUAN, P.R. — José Andrés was walking along a dark street in a
stained T-shirt and a ball cap, trying to decompress after another day
of feeding an island that has been largely without electricity since
Hurricane Maria hit a month ago.

He’d gone barely half a block before two women ran over to snag a
selfie. A man shouted out his name from a bar running on a generator and
offered to buy him a rum sour.

The reaction is more subdued in rural mountain communities like Naguabo,
where Mr. Andrés and his crew have been delivering supplies so cooks at
a small Pentecostal church can make 5,000 servings of arroz con pollo
and carne guisada every day. There, people touch his sleeve and whisper,
“Gracias.” They surround him and pray.

“He’s much more than a hero,” said Jesus R. Rivera, who was inside a
cigar store watching Mr. Andrés pick out one of his daily smokes. “The
situation is that still some people don’t even have food. He is all that
is keeping them from starving.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s overwhelming, even for Mr. Andrés, the larger-than-life,
Michelin-starred Spanish chef with a prolific, unfiltered social media
presence, [who got into a legal fight with the Trump
Organization](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/07/523004201/trump-organization-settles-lawsuit-with-chef-jos-andr-s)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Every day I have this personal anxiety inside,” Mr. Andrés said during
a Jeep ride through the countryside in late October. “We only came here
to try to help a few thousand because nobody had a plan to feed Puerto
Rico, and we opened the biggest restaurant in the world in a week.
That’s how crazy this is.”

Since he hit the ground five days after the hurricane devastated this
island of 3.4 million on Sept. 20, he has built a network of kitchens,
supply chains and delivery services that as of Monday had served more
than 2.2 million warm meals and sandwiches. No other single agency — not
the Red Cross, the Salvation Army nor any government entity — has fed
more people freshly cooked food since the hurricane, or done it in such
a nurturing way.

Mr. Andrés’s effort, by all accounts the largest emergency feeding
program ever set up by a group of chefs, has started winding down. But
it illustrates in dramatic fashion the rise of chefs as valuable players
in a realm traditionally left to more-established aid organizations.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With an ability to network quickly, organize kitchens in difficult
circumstances and marshal raw ingredients and equipment, chef-led groups
are creating a model for a more agile, local response to catastrophes.

“It’s part of a larger trend we’re starting to see with corporations and
individuals who are applying their unique skill sets to solve problems
after a disaster,” said Bob Ottenhoff, the president and chief executive
of the [Center for Disaster
Philanthropy](http://disasterphilanthropy.org/), which helps donors make
strategic contributions related to domestic and international
emergencies.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to sending money or showing up to hand out blankets or boxes
of food, companies like UPS and IBM are designing ways to quickly supply
logistical and technical aid.

“Chefs are part of that trend now, too,” Mr. Ottenhoff said. “They’re
starting to say, ‘Look, people are in need of not just food but good
food, and we know how to serve large quantities of good food very
quickly.’”

Kimberly Grant, the chief executive of Mr. Andrés’s [Think Food
Group](http://www.thinkfoodgroup.com/), which runs 27 restaurants, put
it like this: “Who else can take raw ingredients that are seemingly
unassociated and make them into delicious food and do it under extreme
pressure?”

Restaurateurs have long offered food when trouble hit their communities.

Kitchens near the World Trade Center in New York served thousands of
meals each day to emergency workers after 9/11. In response to the 2004
earthquake off the coast of
[Sumatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra"), Indonesia,
the celebrity chef Cat Cora started [Chefs for
Humanity](http://chefsforhumanity.org/). Competition barbecue teams that
headed to Joplin, Mo., after the 2011 tornadoes organized themselves
into [Operation BBQ Relief](https://operationbbqrelief.org/), a
nonprofit group that has since responded to [more than 40
disasters](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/us/cnn-hero-stan-hays-operation-bbq-relief/index.html).

Mr. Andrés helped out after Hurricane Sandy, but his first big lesson in
emergency food relief came in August, when [he rallied local
chefs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/08/30/jose-andres-is-on-the-ground-in-houston-ready-to-cook-for-displaced-residents/?utm_term=.0c209646d1a6)
in Houston to help feed survivors of Hurricane Harvey.

Other Houston chefs and caterers started a website called “I Have Food I
Need Food” and used social media to [create a
system](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/How-a-Midtown-shelter-became-a-kitchen-command-12252653.php)to
organize donations, cook food and get it delivered. They codified their
effort in a manual and sent it to chefs in Miami who were staring down
Hurricane Irma, which landed 16 days later.

Mr. Andrés went to Houston in part to study how to expand the scope of
[World Central Kitchen](https://www.worldcentralkitchen.org/), a
nonprofit association of chefs he established in 2011 after helping
Haiti earthquake victims a year earlier. The idea was to learn how he
and Brian MacNair, World Central Kitchen’s executive director, could add
emergency food relief to an agenda that already included building school
kitchens, organizing culinary training and offering other forms of
support in several countries.

But nothing prepared Mr. Andrés for what he faced in Puerto Rico. After
taking one of the first commercial flights to the island after the
storm, he realized that things were worse than anyone knew.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

He found his friend Jose Enrique, the chef who has been leading Puerto
Rico’s [farm-to-table
resurgence](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/dining/reclaiming-puerto-ricos-food-paradise.html).
Mr. Enrique had no electricity to run his [Restaurant Jose
Enrique](http://joseenriquepr.com/), in the Santurce district of San
Juan. Rain poured through the roof. But he had food in the freezer.
Other chefs did, too. Someone had a
generator.

“We decided we would just start cooking,” Mr. Enrique said.

The next morning, Mr. Andrés went to a food distributor and loaded up
his car. “I was already smart enough to know I would need aluminum pans,
so I bought every aluminum pan I could,” he said.

They began cooking big pots of the classic island stew called sancocho
on the street in front of Mr. Enrique’s small restaurant. Word spread
and the lines grew. They sent food to people waiting in 10-hour lines at
gas stations. They heard that workers at the city’s biggest medical
clinic were going hungry, so they added it to what was now a makeshift
delivery schedule. “Every day it would just double,” Mr. Enrique said.

Mr. Andrés didn’t realize that his was the biggest hot-food game on the
island until a week or so after they started. Someone from the Salvation
Army pulled up and asked for 120 meals.

“In my life I never expected the Salvation Army to be asking me for
food,” he said. “If one of the biggest NGOs comes to us for food, who is
actually going to be feeding Puerto Rico? We are. We are it.”

More cooks arrived to help. Partnerships were forged with other aid
groups and large food companies. Sandwiches and fruit were added to
their repertory of rice
dishes.

The team moved its base of operation to the island’s largest arena. To
pay for it all, at least in the beginning, they used Mr. Andrés’s credit
cards, or cash from the pockets of the Orvis fly-fishing vest he wore
like a battle jacket.

Mr. Andrés left the island only a few times, the first after 11 days on
the ground. He had lost 25 pounds and became dehydrated.

His team deployed food trucks, like a strike force, to isolated
neighborhoods and towns that needed help. Agents of [Homeland Security
Investigations](https://www.ice.gov/hsi), a division of United States
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were serving as emergency workers,
and staying in the same hotel as Mr. Andrés’s crew. The chef persuaded
them to load food into their vehicles every morning as they headed out
to patrol.

With limited ability to communicate, the crew organized everything with
satellite phones, WhatsApp and a big paper map of all the feeding
stations on the island, which Mr. Andrés carried like a general at war.

He negotiated with a chain of vocational schools around the island to
let culinary students cook there. During visits to his kitchens, 18 in
all, he admonished volunteers to add more mayonnaise to sandwiches, keep
the temperature up on the pans of rice or serve bigger
portions.

someone who understood what it takes to feed several thousand people at
a time.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Andrés recruited his own chefs, too. David Thomas, accustomed to
making $540 suckling pigs as the executive chef at Mr. Andrés’s [Bazaar
Meat](https://slslasvegas.com/restaurants-bars/bazaar-meat-by-jose-andres/)
restaurant in Las Vegas, suddenly found himself trying to figure out how
to make meals out of donations that might include 5,000 pounds of lunch
meat one day and 17 pallets of yogurt the next.

The operation grew so big that at one point you couldn’t find any sliced
cheese in all of Puerto Rico. The team had bought it all up for
sandwiches.

Eventually, the effort would cost World Central Kitchen about $400,000 a
day, paid for by donations from foundations, celebrities and a flood of
smaller donors, as well as two Federal Emergency Management Agency
contracts — one early on to cover the cost of 140,000 meals, and another
for $10 million to cover two weeks’ worth of meals while Mr. Andrés’s
team scaled down the operation.

Mr. Andrés, who often rolls right over regulations and ignores the word
“no,” clashed more than once with FEMA and other large organizations
that have a more-seasoned and methodical approach. In meetings and
telephone calls, FEMA officials reminded him that he and his people
lacked the experience needed to organize a mass emergency feeding
operation, he
said.

“We are not perfect, but that doesn’t mean the government is perfect,”
Mr. Andrés said. “I am doing it without red tape and 100 meetings.”

many other groups and agencies besides World Central Kitchen were

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Late last week, the system that was serving more than 130,000 meals a
day became much smaller. A core crew will most likely keep things going
until Thanksgiving, with one main kitchen and a handful in some of the
neediest regions.

Mr. Andrés flew home to Washington, D.C., on Thursday. “This has been
like my little Vietnam, but now I need to go back to normal life,” he
said.

He never intended to stay as long as he did, he said. Or to feed an
island.

“At the end, I couldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t try to do what I
thought was right,” he said. “We need to think less sometimes and dream
less and just make it happen.”
