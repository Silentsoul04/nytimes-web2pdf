WASHINGTON — One is a rail-thin liberal idealist who spent his career in
government, on campaigns and at think tanks. The other is an overweight
pragmatist who made a fortune lobbying for all manner of liberal
boogeymen.

And now, in a twist with Shakespearean undertones, the two influential
Washington brothers have found themselves on opposite sides of the
scandals over Russian interference in the 2016 election.

John D. Podesta, perhaps more than anyone except Hillary Clinton, was a
victim of the [Russian
cyberassault](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html)
on allies of her presidential campaign, of which he was the chairman.
Emails stolen from his personal Gmail account were dribbled out by
WikiLeaks last fall, revealing the embarrassing rifts roiling the
campaign and Washington’s Democratic establishment. He has pushed hard
for an aggressive investigation of Russia’s role in the election.

Mr. Podesta’s older brother, Tony Podesta, has been ensnared in the
investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into
Russia’s meddling in the race and whether it involved any associates
of President Trump. The efforts by his firm, the Podesta Group, to win
support for the agenda of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned
former president of Ukraine, were cited in an indictment handed down
last month against two former campaign aides to Mr. Trump, Paul Manafort
and Rick Gates, who arranged the Ukrainian lobbying work.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Neither Tony Podesta nor anyone at the Podesta Group has been publicly
charged in the case. But Mr. Mueller has [subpoenaed the firm and its
employees](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/us/politics/law-firm-faces-questions-for-ukraine-work-with-manafort.html)
for documents and testimony related to their work and interviewed
roughly half a dozen people about Tony Podesta’s involvement. And as the
Podesta Group has withered under the scrutiny, its employees were
informed in a tearful meeting on Thursday that they may stop receiving
paychecks after next week, according to people in attendance.

For some Democrats, there is little question over who deserves the most
sympathy.

“Sure, the Clinton campaign made some mistakes, but that’s not like
representing a dictatorship,” said James Carville, who has known John
Podesta for years through Democratic political circles. Mr. Carville
said he was less acquainted with Tony Podesta, but added that “by
reputation, you can’t put them in the same book. John is one of the
straightest guys I know. Everybody says, ‘Can you believe that those
guys are brothers?’”

Mr. Trump, for his part, went after both brothers last month, lumping
them together as [emblematic of “the
swamp](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925364408364171265)”
of Washington special interests against which he campaigned.

In fact, the Podesta brothers, who were raised in a modest two-flat on
[Chicago’s northwest
side](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/December-2013/How-the-Podesta-Brothers-Rose-From-the-39th-Ward-to-the-White-House/)
by a Greek-American mother and an Italian-American father, represent
very different strains of a Washington establishment now under attack
from left and right.

John Podesta, 68, served as a top White House aide to the last two
Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and was believed
[to be in line as White House chief of
staff](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/podesta-tops-clintons-short-list-for-chief-of-staff-230366)
if Mrs. Clinton had won the presidency. In between campaign and White
House stints, John Podesta helped to create and run some of the leading
institutions on the American left, including the Center for American
Progress think tank, and provided policy and political advice to
generations of Democratic politicians and operatives.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Tony Podesta, 74, built one of the highest-grossing lobbying firms in
Washington, signing clients across industries and ideologies — including
defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, banks like Wells Fargo, drug
makers like Mylan and foreign regimes like the government of the former
Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak. Tony Podesta is known for his
fund-raising — in 2016, he donated or raised nearly $900,000 for Mrs.
Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party — as well as for a lavish
lifestyle.

Had Mrs. Clinton prevailed, as official Washington expected, it most
likely would have cemented the legacies of both brothers — John Podesta
as a key confidant to presidents and one of the most important
Democratic strategists of the past century, and Tony Podesta as the
go-to lobbyist for Democratic administrations. Instead, the Podestas
have been drawn into the vortex of investigations and conspiracy
theories that have enveloped Washington in the Trump era.

Tony Podesta [stepped down from his
firm](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/tony-podesta-resignation-lobbying.html?_r=0)
hours after it was obliquely referenced in the indictments of Mr.
Manafort and Mr. Gates, though he had been in talks about leaving for
months. It is unclear what will happen to his investment in the Podesta
Group, which has been hemorrhaging clients and employees, both because
of the mounting scrutiny and because businesses are looking for
lobbyists with connections to the Trump administration, according to
interviews and lobbying filings. Some firm partners are starting a new
firm next month called Cogent Strategies, in which Tony Podesta will
have no stake.

Last week’s indictment did not name the Podesta Group or another firm
with which it worked on the Ukraine account, Mercury Public Affairs.
Instead, the indictment referred to them as “two Washington, D.C.,
firms” that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates.

While both firms disclosed the work to Congress under less-rigorous
domestic lobbying rules, they did not initially register under the
Foreign Agents Registration Act. The indictment alleges that was done
intentionally — by routing the money through a Brussels-based nonprofit
— “to minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign” that “was
under the ultimate direction” of Mr. Yanukovych, his party and his
government.

Tony Podesta and his lawyers are working to navigate the issues raised
by the Mueller investigation and accompanying attacks from the right.
They have already [demanded a
retraction](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164203-Tony-Podesta-Cease-amp-Desist-to-Tucker-Carlson.html)
from the conservative news media on claims that [both
Podestas](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/10/25/tucker_carlson_source_podesta_brothers_and_manafort_not_trump_central_figures_in_mueller_probe.html)
worked with Mr. Manafort to advance Russian interests.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

John Podesta, for his part, has dedicated his time since the election to
trying to expose the connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and
Russia.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the postelection [publication of a
dossier](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html)
by a former British spy into those connections — which included some
salacious claims — John Podesta met with Glenn Simpson, the co-founder
of the firm that commissioned the opposition research, to compare notes
on Russia’s involvement, according to an associate of Mr. Podesta.

During the general election season, the firm’s research was
[funded](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html)by
the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, though John
Podesta has told congressional investigators that [he had no knowledge
of those
payments](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/26/politics/john-podesta-debbie-wasserman-schultz-trump-dossier/index.html).
The associate said the meeting came as Mr. Simpson was considering
whether, and how, his firm could continue its Russia-related Trump
research. A spokeswoman for Mr. Simpson’s firm, Fusion GPS, declined to
comment.

John Podesta has helped raise millions of dollars from major donors with
whom he has [personal and financial
relationships](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/john-podesta-donor-foundation-230571)
— including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler — for
nonprofits fighting the Trump administration. With funding from Mr.
Sandler, he helped begin a group called Democracy Forward that is suing
the Trump team on a number of fronts, including at least [one
lawsuit](https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DOJ-FOIA-Complaint.pdf)
intended partly to reveal whether Mr. Trump’s aides tried to influence
the Russia investigation.

John Podesta “could have gone into a bunker and vanished, but instead he
dedicated himself to fighting this,” said Faiz Shakir, who worked for
him at the Center for American Progress and serves with him on the board
of Democracy Forward. “He is very driven by exacting some measure of
justice for the unscrupulous form of politics that was utilized against
him and his side,” said Mr. Shakir, who considers Mr. Podesta a mentor.

Both brothers declined interview requests through their representatives.
But John Podesta provided a written response to a question about whether
he saw it as tragic — or at least ironic — that the Russia investigation
for which he has been advocating has ensnared his brother.

“The only tragedy is that Donald Trump is president and got there with
the Russians’ help,” he said. “That’s a tragedy for the American
people.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For both John and Tony Podesta, the connections with Democratic politics
began at an early age. In 1970, they worked together on the Rev. Joseph
D. Duffey’s antiwar Senate campaign in Connecticut, for which Tony
Podesta served as a top official, and his younger brother — as well as
Bill and Hillary Clinton — were volunteers.

Over the next 23 years, the brothers’ paths intertwined. They wove in
and out of campaigns and car-pooled together to Georgetown University’s
law school, from which they both earned degrees in 1976. Tony Podesta
joined the United States attorney’s office in Washington, while John
Podesta went to work at the Justice Department.

After a few years, the brothers left those jobs — John Podesta joining
the Democratic staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Tony Podesta
becoming the founding president of the liberal advocacy group People for
the American Way.

In 1987, the brothers teamed up to create a lobbying and public
relations firm called Podesta Associates, which was seen as having a
liberal bearing, representing a mix of public interest groups and media
companies and associations. But after Mr. Clinton won the presidency in
1992 — a campaign for which both Podestas worked — the brothers’ paths
diverged once and for all. John Podesta took a job in the White House
and divested his stake in the firm, which Tony Podesta pointed in a less
ideological direction.

By President Obama’s second year in office, domestic lobbying revenues
for the Podesta Group had risen to more than $29 million, buoyed in part
by the perception of access to the new administration.

The brothers remained close, even as their lifestyles took different
paths.

Tony Podesta moved into a 7,000-square-foot house in Washington’s
exclusive Kalorama neighborhood, which he had bought for $3.9 million in
addition to his homes in Australia and Venice. After three years of
renovations, he turned it into a fund-raising hot spot with a [modern
art
collection](http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/)
and a wine cellar with [thousands of
bottles](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/23/AR2009082302381_4.html).
His divorce from his second wife, 26 years his junior, was widely
chronicled in Washington.

John Podesta, who remains married to the mother of his three children,
lives in a relatively modest house near American University in Northwest
Washington, where his clan makes a habit of getting together for home
cooked pasta.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the end, said Lanny Davis, who has known both Podestas since the
Duffey campaign, the brothers have much in common.

“Tony Podesta may have clients that are way to the right of him in
politics,” he said, “but neither John nor Tony Podesta, no matter who
their clients are, have withdrawn one inch from being liberal Democrats
with progressive values.”
