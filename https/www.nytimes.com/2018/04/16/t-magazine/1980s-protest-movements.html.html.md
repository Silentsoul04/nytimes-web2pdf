# When Protest Movements Became Brands

</div>

As socially minded public installations in New York City became popular
in the 1980s, political movements realized their marketing potential.

STARTING IN 1979, when I was 21, I was an out reporter writing for
underground queer newspapers, in which I covered key acts of political
warfare in New York City. This was the beginning of President Reagan’s
terrifying and far-reaching unification with the Christian right. As a
particularly despised group of people, queers were fighting police
brutality on one front and racist admission policies in gay and lesbian
bars on the other, homophobia at home and the closet at work. At the
time, there was still no gay rights bill in the city, and sodomy was
illegal in more than half of the states. Simultaneously, there were
people who insisted on being out and who created rich subcultures that
forged new ground in sex, night life, imagination — and rebellion.

Three years later, in 1982, I witnessed a violent New York City Police
raid on a gay bar, Blues, a place for black men in Times Square. The
cops beat up patrons, breaking mirrors and shattering bottles. Then as
now, police violence against black men largely went unpunished. And when
the gay community came out in anger to demonstrate in favor of Blues’s
patrons, the action received no television coverage. The only
documentation was by the Super 8 filmmaker Jim Hubbard. His grainy
footage shows a multiracial, angry gathering of queer men and women
holding small homemade signs; there were no mass-produced T-shirts
emblazoned with slogans, no shiny pins, no professionally printed
posters. This was what resistance looked like then: nothing to buy, and
nothing to sell.

SO HOW DID we get from that to the highly visible, art-directed
expressions of the late 1980s and early ’90s, which — as proven by the
[pink pussy
hats](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/fashion/the-year-in-stuff.html)
and [Black Lives
Matter](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/us/how-blacklivesmatter-came-to-define-a-movement.html)
shirts of recent years — still resonate today? Look first to late-70s
conceptual artists, including Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger, who drew
attention to cultural contradictions with their stark, text-based works,
originally pasted on buildings and construction sites in the newly
gentrifying SoHo. Public fine art, in combination with the era’s
advertising, inspired a generation of graphic designers, including Avram
Finkelstein, whose collective created the famous “Silence=Death” logo,
later donated to [ACT UP](http://www.actupny.org/) (Aids Coalition to
Unleash Power) in 1987. Provocative protest iconography soon became the
norm: Artists like Tom Kalin, Marlene McCarty, Loring McAlpin and Robert
Vasquez formed Gran Fury, one of a number of art collectives in ACT UP.
In 1991, AIDS activists’ four-year campaign to expand the Centers for
Disease Control’s definition of AIDS, so that more infected women could
get health benefits, was accompanied by a Gran Fury poster that read
“Women Don’t Get AIDS They Just Die From It.”

In many ways, this AIDS rebellion, and the aesthetic it created, drew
from the 1960s Civil Rights template. Much as the Black Power movement
had established its own look (black berets, leather jackets and a raised
fist), so too did New York’s AIDS activists develop a signature
telegenic appearance, with their slogan T-shirts, jeans and Doc Martens.
Artists such as [Keith
Haring](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/17/obituaries/keith-haring-artist-dies-at-31-career-began-in-subway-graffiti.html),
[Felix
Gonzalez-Torres](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/11/nyregion/felix-gonzalez-torres-38-a-sculptor-of-love-and-loss.html)
and the collective General Idea made highly visible pieces about loss,
inserting AIDS into public spaces, advertisements and even mass-produced
apparel. By 1991, the filmmaker Jerry Tartaglia and others in an
organization called [Visual AIDS Artists’
Caucus](https://www.visualaids.org/projects/detail/visual-aids-artists-caucus)
had conceived of the red AIDS ribbon as a sign of solidarity in a
country that was stigmatizing and isolating infected people. That year,
the 11-year-old actress Daisy Eagan wore one to accept her Tony Award
for her work in “[The Secret
Garden](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/26/theater/review-theater-garden-the-secret-of-death-and-birth.html),”
and the ribbon became an instant piece of iconography — of the AIDS
movement, of course, but for all future movements as well, a symbol of
the conflation of money and power that was a new kind of social currency
altogether, one in which one should be, or appear to be, socially aware.

The legacy of those years is today inescapable, as grassroots protest is
our only hope for survival, not something to be marketed and sold, a set
of images and memes. So many disparate communities are under attack
today — black people, trans people, Muslims, women seeking abortions —
that it would be foolhardy, not to mention impossible, to try to
homogenize us all under one symbol or slogan. With so many perspectives,
cultures and aesthetics at risk, it’s the sheer variety of our
resistance that will express the breadth of our communities. Defying
branding, ultimately, will be the most successful strategy of all.
