***Climate Fwd:****, our email newsletter.*

WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency and architect of President Trump’s aggressive effort
to rewrite the government’s rule book on environmental regulations,
resigned on Thursday in the face of [numerous ethics
investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/climate/scott-pruitt-epa-investigations-guide.html)
that doomed his tenure.

Despite Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to nurture a close relationship with the
president, Mr. Trump himself announced the resignation in a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1014956568129892352)
sent from Air Force One. He thanked Mr. Pruitt for an “outstanding job”
and said the agency’s deputy, [Andrew
Wheeler](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/climate/wheeler-epa-pruitt.html),
a former coal lobbyist, would take over as the acting administrator on
Monday.

Mr. Pruitt in his [resignation
letter](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1014965976599875585) cited
“unrelenting attacks on me personally” as one of the reasons for his
departure. Mr. Pruitt had been hailed by conservatives for his zealous
deregulation, but he could not overcome a spate of questions about his
alleged [spending
abuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/climate/pruitt-epa-ethics-letter-congress.html),
[first-class
travel](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/climate/gowdy-pruitt-epa-travel.html)
and cozy relationships with lobbyists.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Pruitt also came under fire for [enlisting aides to obtain special
favors for him and his
family](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-aides.html?action=click&module=In%20Other%20News&pgtype=Homepage&action=click&module=News&pgtype=Homepage),
such as [reaching out to the chief executive of
Chick-fil-A](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/climate/pruitt-epa-chick-fil-a.html),
Dan T. Cathy, with the intent of helping Mr. Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn, open
a franchise of the restaurant.

The resignation appeared to happen quickly.

On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt attended two Fourth of July parties, one at the
White House and another at the Interior Department. One attendee who
spent time with him said he spent the night mingling, shaking hands,
watching the fireworks and showing no indication that he planned to step
down. His chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, also gave no hint of what was
ahead.

An individual close to Mr. Pruitt said the president acted after he
found one particular story in recent days embarrassing: a report that
Mr. Pruitt had [asked Mr. Trump to fire Jeff
Sessions](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/politics/scott-pruitt-jeff-sessions-trump/index.html),
the attorney general, so that Mr. Pruitt could run the Justice
Department.

The idea had been discussed privately for months by the president, who
occasionally asked advisers if it was a good idea, according to two
people familiar with the discussions. But seeing those deliberations
being aired publicly, amid a string of other damaging reports, focused
Mr. Trump’s attention, a person close to the president said. Fresh
allegations that Mr. Pruitt had retroactively altered his public
schedule, potentially committing a federal crime, had also escalated
concerns about him at the White House, according to a White House aide.
On Thursday afternoon, around 1:30, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F.
Kelly, reached out to Mr. Pruitt to tell him the time had come.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built his career on
[lawsuits against the
agency](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/14/us/politics/document-Pruitt-v-EPA-a-Compilation-of-Oklahoma-14.html)
he would eventually lead, remained a favorite of Mr. Trump’s for the
majority of his tenure at the E.P.A. He began [the largest regulatory
rollback](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/us/politics/trump-epa-chief-pruitt-regulations-climate-change.html)
in the agency’s history, undoing, delaying or blocking several Obama-era
environmental rules. Among them was a suite of historic regulations
aimed at mitigating global warming pollution from the United States’
vehicles and power
plants.

Mr. Pruitt also played a lead role in urging Mr. Trump to follow through
on his campaign pledge to [withdraw the United States from the 2015
Paris climate
agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html),
despite warnings from some of the president’s other senior advisers that
the move could damage the United States’ credibility in foreign policy.
Under the landmark accord, nearly every country had committed to
reducing emissions of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution.

In 2017, [Mr. Pruitt made headlines
for<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

the established science of human-caused climate change, contradicting
decades of research by scientific institutions, including his own
agency. Although Mr. Pruitt was harshly criticized for the remarks, they
did not affect his good standing with a president who has also mocked
climate
science.

## 78 Environmental Rules on the Way Out Under Trump

This is the full list of environmental policies the Trump administration
has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel
industry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has repeatedly told associates that Mr. Pruitt has done what
he has wanted in terms of cutting regulations, so he has been reluctant
to let him go. Mr. Pruitt, for his part, had made himself available to
the president as a confidant.

He ingratiated himself in part by offering himself as a sounding board
on topics ranging from the North American Free Trade Agreement to to the
Russia investigation, and he would join in as the president criticized
the attorney general, Mr. Sessions. He often lunched at the White House
mess in hopes of running into the president.

But White House advisers, including Mr. Kelly, the president’s chief of
staff, for months have implored Mr. Trump to get rid of Mr. Pruitt.
Ultimately, the president grew disillusioned with Mr. Pruitt after the
accusations of impropriety and ethical missteps overshadowed Mr.
Pruitt’s policy achievements.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent days, people who have spoken with Mr. Trump said he sounded
exasperated with his E.P.A. administrator’s negative headlines. “It’s
one thing after another with this guy,” one person close to Mr. Trump
quoted the president as saying.

Mr. Pruitt is the subject of at least [13 federal
investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/climate/scott-pruitt-epa-investigations-guide.html),
and a government watchdog agency concluded that he had broken the law
with his purchase [of a $43,000 secure telephone
booth](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/climate/scott-pruitt-phone-booth.html).
He was also under investigation for his 2017 [lease of a bedroom in a
condominium](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/climate/scott-pruitt-epa-rental.html)
linked to a Canadian energy company’s powerful Washington lobbying firm,
and for accusations that he [demoted or sidelined E.P.A.
employees](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/business/epa-officials-questioned-scott-pruitt.html)
who questioned his actions.

The former E.P.A. administrator had come under criticism for lavish
expenditures on foreign travel, including a [trip arranged for him by a
lobbyist to
Morocco](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/pruitt-epa-trips-lobbyists.html),
a country where the E.P.A. has no policy agenda. His domestic travel
also came under fire after a former staff member [told congressional
investigators](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/climate/pruitt-epa-ethics-letter-congress.html)
that his boss often sought to travel to Oklahoma, where Mr. Pruitt owns
a home, directing his employees to “find me something to do” there so he
could justify charging taxpayers for the
expense.

## The Turnover at the Top of the Trump Administration

Since President Trump’s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet
officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A [New York Times
report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/us/politics/scott-pruitt-oklahoma-epa.html)
earlier this year detailed Mr. Pruitt’s lavish spending and questionable
practices in his home state. O n Thursday The Times reported on new
questions about whether aides to Mr. Pruitt had [deleted sensitive
information](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/climate/pruitt-epa-calendar-morris.html)
about his meetings from his public schedule, potentially in violation of
the law.

While Democrats have criticized Mr. Pruitt since his nomination, in
recent months even conservative Republicans had taken the unusual step
of criticizing and questioning his ethics. Representative Trey Gowdy,
Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight
Committee, has started an investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s actions at the
E.P.A., the first such Republican-led inquiry into a Trump
administration cabinet member.

Joni Ernst and Charles E. Grassley, two Republican senators from Iowa, a
farm state with a solid bank of Trump voters, have both publicly
criticized Mr. Pruitt. Last month, the conservative [National
Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/06/scott-pruitt-should-resign/),
which once championed his appointment, called on Mr. Pruitt to resign.
On Tuesday, Laura Ingraham, the conservative talk radio host,
[tweeted,](https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/1014281388269408257)
“Pruitt is the swamp. Drain it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On May 2, Mr. Gowdy’s staff began conducting transcribed,
behind-closed-doors interviews with Mr. Pruitt’s closest aides. Partial
transcripts from one of those interviews revealed that Mr. Pruitt used
one of his top aides last year [essentially as a personal
assistant](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/climate/pruitt-epa-apartment-aide.html),
having her help him search for an apartment as well as try to procure a
used mattress from the Trump International Hotel.

In addition, Mr. Pruitt faced irritation from the White House after The
Atlantic magazine [reported that Mr. Pruitt’s office gave raises to two
aides](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/pruitt-epa/557123/),
even though the White House had declined to approve the raises.

The E.P.A. has denied any wrongdoing on Mr. Pruitt’s behalf.

As the scandals mounted through the spring, Mr. Pruitt was called to
testify before several House and Senate committees. Although they were
routine budget hearings, they ended up serving as forums for lawmakers
to interrogate Mr. Pruitt about his management practices. Mr. Pruitt,
who is deeply religious, spent considerable time in the days before the
hearings in prayer, according to a person close to
him.

He got through the hearings battered but intact, after deflecting blame
for numerous issues onto his staff, particularly his chief of staff, Mr.
Jackson, whom he blamed for making controversial decisions such as the
illegal purchase of the $43,000 secure telephone booth.

But the tactic of blaming his employees cost him loyalty.

In recent months, nearly a dozen political appointees have quit or been
fired from the E.P.A. More recently, many of those staffers have been
called to testify to investigators on the House Oversight Committee,
which had launched a probe into Mr. Pruitt’s expenditures. The results
of that investigation were expected to be the subject of a Senate
hearing next month.

Inside the E.P.A. on Thursday, as news of Mr. Pruitt’s departure spread,
some career employees said that the mood was jubilant but quiet given
that many people were out of the office around the July 4 holiday. Some
employees met for early drinks at Mackey’s Public House, a bar near the
E.P.A.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It remains unclear how well some aspects of Mr. Pruitt’s regulatory
rollback agenda, and his effort to undo the environmental work of his
predecessors, will stand the test of time. In his haste to cripple
government regulation and publicize his success, Mr. Pruitt and his
officials have [failed to follow important
procedures](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/climate/scott-pruitt-epa-rollbacks.html),
and courts have already struck down at least six of his rollback
efforts.

His removal will deal a blow to his [political
aspirations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/climate/scott-pruitt-political-ambitions.html).
People close to Mr. Pruitt have said that he had been using his
prominence in the Trump administration to position himself for a run for
state office in Oklahoma. His sights, some said, were set on a possible
presidential run in 2024.

Instead, Mr. Pruitt is now the latest in Mr. Trump’s purge of top
administration officials.
