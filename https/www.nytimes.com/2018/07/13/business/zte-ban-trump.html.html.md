The Trump administration on Friday lifted a ban on the Chinese
telecommunications firm ZTE that had pushed the company to the brink of
financial collapse by preventing it from acquiring parts and software
from American companies.

The ban, imposed in April to punish ZTE for failing to live up to an
earlier agreement related to violating United States sanctions against
Iran and North Korea, was removed after the company met the conditions
of a settlement, the Commerce Department said in a news release.

Under the deal, ZTE was required to pay a $1 billion penalty, put $400
million in escrow with an American bank, overhaul its leadership and
allow a team of compliance monitors to be installed inside the company
for 10 years.

Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said in a statement that ZTE,
China’s second-largest telecommunications firm after Huawei, would
remain under closer scrutiny even after being dropped from the
department’s “denied persons list.”

“While we lifted the ban on ZTE, the department will remain vigilant as
we closely monitor ZTE’s actions to ensure compliance with all U.S. laws
and regulations,” Mr. Ross said.

ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Its shares rose
nearly 24 percent in trading in Hong Kong on Thursday after the Commerce
Department said [it was on the verge of lifting the
ban](https://twitter.com/CommerceGov/status/1017110327887003648).

The United States originally found ZTE in violation of sanctions on Iran
and North Korea in 2016, and imposed a $892 million penalty on the
company last year.

In April, amid rising trade tensions between the United States and
China, the Commerce Department barred[ZTE’s American
suppliers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/business/us-china-zte-deal.html)
from doing business with the company for failing to rectify the
sanctions issue. Because ZTE relies heavily on American components to
produce its smartphones and telecommunications equipment, the move
threatened to drive the company out of business.

In May, President Trump [wrote on
Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/trump-vows-to-save-jobs-at-chinas-zte-lost-after-us-sanctions.html)
that he and President Xi Jinping of China were working together on a
lifeline for ZTE. Mr. Trump also said he had directed the Commerce
Department to “get it done.” [A
deal](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/06/secretary-ross-announces-14-billion-zte-settlement-zte-board-management)
was announced on June 7.

The administration deal to save ZTE has [been
criticized](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/senate-zte-trump.html)
by lawmakers from both parties, who argue that it puts national security
at risk. The Senate last month approved, as part of a larger defense
bill, a measure that would
[reinstate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/senate-zte-trump.html)
tough penalties on the company. It is unclear, however, whether the
measure will take effect.
