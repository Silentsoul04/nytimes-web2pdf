Pier 17 on the South Street Seaport was teeming with people craving to
be near the water. It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and the East River
sparkled in the sunlight, the salty Lower Manhattan air carried the
beats of familiar contenders for song of the summer.

Adding to the festive vibe was a ceiling at the back of the pier covered
with dozens of balloons — yellow, red, sea foam and kelly greens,
magenta, orange. Ranging in size from two feet wide to almost 10 feet
wide, the dozens of balloons hang above a bar with benches that offer
sweeping views of Brooklyn.

“Anyone taking a breezy walk on the water can come over here, and they
see it and they’re touched by it,” said Jihan Zencirli, 33, the artist,
known as Geronimo, who designed the installation, which was unveiled on
June 30 at a colorblock party. “My work is about looking up and getting
out of yourself for a moment,” she added.

The installation is an [eye-catching
celebration](https://www.pier17ny.com/content/hhc/pier17ny/en/whats-on-folder/whats-on/geronimo.html)
of the revived Pier 17, transformed after its first renovation in
decades. The pier, poking out over the East River just below the
Brooklyn Bridge, was once an active seaport, long a hub for
international trade for New York City. But it had endured decades of
wear and tear. Then it took a pounding several years ago from Hurricane
Sandy.

These days, a new four-story building, lit up in warm pinks and cool
blues at night, sits on the river’s edge. ESPN has built a studio there
with a green room that overlooks the river, and a rooftop — with highly
Instagrammable views of Brooklyn — has a concert space sprawling over an
acre. The band Kings of Leon will play there in August. The celebrity
chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten and David Chang will soon have
restaurants on the lower part of the pier, joining a bar and a walkway
that extend over the water. It’s all part of a broader revitalization of
the seaport district, which has included the development of 12
buildings.

“I think the whole seaport district is going to be really experiential,”
said Saul Scherl, president of the tristate region for the Howard Hughes
Corporation, which is overseeing the redevelopment.

“When you come here, you’ll always experience something different,” Mr.
Scherl added. “Today was a phenomenal colorblock party. Tomorrow, you
are going to have family day out on the seaport square. In a few weeks,
we’ll have movie night on the rooftop.”

As for Ms. Zencirli, the balloons also represent a moment for her as an
artist. For most of her 10-year career, the life span of her work has
been fleeting. That was the case with her display last winter at New
York City Ballet’s Art Series, in which her balloons adorned the David
H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. Now, she has a piece that will
survive longer than just a few days or weeks.

The balloons at Pier 17, which are made of biodegradable, post-consumer
recycled plastic, are laser cut and hand forged in Los Angeles. They are
designed to last four months, which is when the installation closes.

Balloons have been a central part of Ms. Zencirli’s work for years. In
2011, she tied tassels to the bottom of balloons and gave them to people
as she drove around Los Angeles on a moped. “It was kind of like a
performance art,” she said.

After a friend asked her to post photos of the balloons on her blog, she
started getting requests from around the world and from celebrities,
including the Kardashians and LL Cool J.

Before that, her direction as an artist was unclear. At 19, she moved to
New York City to “do my own thing,” and “failed miserably.”

“I failed at every job I had because it wasn’t genuine to me,” she said.

Ms. Zencirli went home to Seattle to care for her ailing grandmother.
After her grandmother died in 2010, she decided it was time for her to
create again, and that’s when she moved to Los Angeles.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Seven years later Ms. Zencirli received the Edge Award for emerging
talent at the Los Angeles Design Festival. The festival noted that Ms.
Zencirli creates “arguably the most recognizable public art
installations in the country.”

Back in New York on that Saturday, as a band heavy with horns and drums
played, Ms. Zencirli danced her way to the back of the pier. She was
wearing large hoop earrings with “Geronimo” written in cursive and a
white suit covered in green, blue, yellow, purple and red butterflies
that she hot-glued onto the suit herself.

She was celebrating summer, a new pier and her latest New York
installation.

“It’s’ nice to have a simple art that stands on its own and creates an
emotion” in people, Ms. Zencirli said. “I try not to overcomplicate it.”
