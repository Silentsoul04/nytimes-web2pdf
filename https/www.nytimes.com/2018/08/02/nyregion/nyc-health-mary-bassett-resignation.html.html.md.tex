The New York City health commissioner, Mary T. Bassett, who coordinated
the city's response to a series of health crises involving
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/in-new-york-bringing-a-comforting-message-during-a-chaotic-time.html}{Ebola},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/nyregion/new-york-ordering-tests-of-water-cooling-towers-amid-legionnaires-outbreak.html}{Legionnaires'
disease}and the looming threat of the Zika virus, is leaving her job to
take a top post at Harvard University, the city announced on Thursday.

Dr. Bassett, who will become the director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud
Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard and will also teach
classes there, departs as her department has come under scrutiny for its
role in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/nyregion/inquiry-on-public-housing-lead-failures-extends-to-health-department.html}{lead
paint inspections} at public housing complexes.

Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Dr. Bassett for emphasizing issues of
inequality in making public health decisions, saying that ``her approach
to public health is helping make New York City a better, fairer and more
just city.''

Dr. Bassett is the latest in a succession of crusading health
commissioners who have helped make New York a leader in innovative
public health policy. She brought a focus on social equity to the health
department, pushing officials to look at how health policy interacted
with questions of racial disparities. She developed neighborhood health
centers to make health and social services more accessible to poor New
Yorkers.

Dr. Bassett said that applying ``a racial equity and social justice lens
to everything that we do'' was part of her legacy.

Yet the crises involving communicable diseases got most of the
attention. ``My tenure as health commissioner was definitely dominated
by microbes,'' she said.

She helped prepare the city for the possibility that someone infected in
an African Ebola outbreak in 2014 might wind up in New York before being
diagnosed. When a patient finally emerged, it was an American doctor who
had worked in Africa treating Ebola victims before traveling back to the
United States. He was treated at Bellevue Hospital and survived.

In 2015, Dr. Bassett confronted a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease in the Bronx. It was during that outbreak that she clashed with
Mr. de Blasio, who dressed down a group of top officials over what he
considered inadequacies in the city's response.

``I've said and I think the mayor would say that we have enormous
respect for each other,'' Dr. Bassett said. ``Both of us speak our
minds.''

Dr. Bassett said her departure was unrelated to the inquiry into her
department's handling of lead inspections at public housing complexes.
``Being offered this kind of position isn't in response to a headline,''
she said.

The first deputy health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, will serve as
acting health commissioner while a search is conducted for a replacement
for Dr. Bassett.
