KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia --- The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/business/1mdb-jho-low-malaysia.html}{fugitive
Malaysian financier Jho Low}, a prime suspect in the theft of billions
of dollars from the government, was charged Friday with eight counts of
laundering money, much of it reportedly used to purchase a \$250 million
yacht.

The Malaysian police issued arrest warrants for Mr. Low and his father,
Low Hock Peng, who was charged with one count of money laundering.

The warrants are a first step in seeking the pair's extradition. Their
location is unknown but there has been recent speculation in the news
media that the younger Mr. Low is in China.

He is accused of playing a key role in the theft of at least \$4.5
billion from a government investment fund, 1 Malaysia Development
Berhad, that was established and overseen by the former prime minister,
Najib Razak.

The scandal over missing government money, including the diversion of
\$731 million to Mr. Najib's personal account, outraged many Malaysians
and helped secure

Najib's upset election defeat in May}.

Since taking office, the new government of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has aggressively pursued a criminal investigation into the
missing funds.

Shortly after the election, the police seized
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/world/asia/malaysia-najib-razak-police-seizure.html}{\$273
million} in cash, jewelry, luxury handbags and other valuables during
raids on properties controlled by Mr. Najib and his wife, Rosmah.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/world/asia/malaysia-najib-razak-1mdb.html}{Mr.
Najib has since been charged} with seven counts of money laundering,
criminal breach of trust and corruption. He has pleaded not guilty. He
and his wife are prohibited from leaving the country.

Mr. Low's megayacht, Equanimity, was seized in Indonesia last month and
handed over to the Malaysian government. On Friday, the government won
court approval for a quick sale of the ship.

The eight charges against Mr. Jho Low accuse him of laundering \$450
million in stolen funds through bank accounts in Singapore, the United
States, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland.

Mr. Low's father was charged with transferring \$56.4 million in stolen
funds to an account controlled by his son.

Each charge could be punished by as much as five years in prison.

The charges against Mr. Low and his father were first reported by The
Edge, a Malaysian media organization. Two of its print publications, the
Edge Weekly and the Edge Financial Daily, were suspended for three
months in 2015 by Mr. Najib's government for their coverage of the
investment fund scandal.

The Edge reported Friday that most of the money cited in the charges
against the Lows was used to purchase the Equanimity.

An Australian public relations firm representing the younger Mr. Low
issued a statement saying that he had not violated the law.

``Mr. Low maintains his innocence and is confident he will be
vindicated,'' said the statement released by Benjamin Haslem, co-chief
executive of the firm, Wells Haslem Mayhew Strategic Public Affairs.

Mr. Haslem declined to say where the Lows were or to answer questions
about the case.

The statement asserted that the criminal charges were an attempt to
distract attention from the seizure of the Equanimity and the
government's plan to sell it.

It also sought to cast the case as political, calling Mr. Mahathir's
elected government a ``regime'' and asserting that the criminal charges
amount to ``political reprisal.''

Mr. Low, the statement said, ``will not submit to any jurisdiction where
guilt has been predetermined by politics and self-interest overrules
legal process.''
