SEOUL, South Korea — Park Geun-hye, South Korea’s [impeached and ousted
president](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article),
was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison, as an appeals court
convicted her of collecting more bribes than previously believed from
Samsung, the country’s largest business conglomerate.

In [a lower-court ruling in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea.html),
Ms. Park, 66, was sentenced to 24 years in prison on bribery, extortion,
abuse of power and other criminal charges and ordered to pay 18 billion
won ($16 million) in fines. But on Friday, the appeals court in Seoul
added another year to her prison term and increased her fine to 20
billion won, saying that the collusive ties between Ms. Park and Samsung
were more expansive than the lower court had ruled.

Ms. Park, who has been in jail since last year, did not appear in court
on Friday to hear the verdict. Her trial does not end until the Supreme
Court rules on the case.

Ms. Park’s fall from power began in 2016, when hundreds of thousands of
protesters began months of weekly rallies in central Seoul demanding
that she be forced from office. That December, the [National Assembly
impeached](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
her on charges of bribery and abuse of presidential power. In March
2017, [Ms. Park became the first South Korean leader
removed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article)
from office through parliamentary impeachment after the Constitutional
Court upheld the lawmakers’ decision.

The case of Ms. Park, a daughter of the former military dictator Park
Chung-hee, has exposed the [entrenched, collusive
ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-samsung.html)
between powerful politicians and the huge family-controlled
conglomerates known as chaebol.

When she was convicted in April, a lower court ruled that Ms. Park and
her longtime secretive friend and confidante, [Choi
Soon-sil](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-choi-soon-sil.html),
had collected or demanded 23 billion won in bribes from three big
businesses, including nearly 7.3 billion won from Samsung.

But on Friday, the appeals court put the amount of bribes Ms. Park and
Ms. Choi received from Samsung at 8.7 billion won. It said Samsung
offered the bribes to help win government support for an attempt by
Samsung’s vice chairman, Lee Jae-yong, to inherit management control
from his father, Lee Kun-hee, the company’s chairman.

The ruling on Friday could have legal implications for Lee Jae-yong, who
is the de facto head of Samsung, as his father remains seriously ill.

In August of last year, Mr. Lee was sentenced to five years in prison
for offering bribes to Ms. Choi and Ms. Park. But he [was released from
prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/business/samsung-lee-jae-yong-appeal.html)
in February after an appeals court cut his sentence in half and
suspended it, saying the amount of bribes he offered was smaller, at 3.6
billion won — a finding the judges in Ms. Park’s case disagreed with.

Also on Friday, Ms. Park’s friend, Ms. Choi, was sentenced to 20 years
in prison.

The two women were also convicted of coercing 18 businesses into making
donations worth 77 billion won to two foundations that Ms. Choi
controlled.

The 25-year sentence is not the only prison term Ms. Park faces.

In two separate trials last month, Ms. Park was sentenced to a total of
eight years in prison on charges of violating election laws and
illegally using millions of dollars from the budgets of the government’s
National Intelligence Service.
