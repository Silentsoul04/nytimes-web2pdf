RACINE, Wis. — This city’s downtown was all but empty on a recent Sunday
afternoon, but one storefront office was so packed with Democrats that
people had to wait outside.

One by one, the party’s top Wisconsin candidates took a microphone and
fixated on a single villain — a Republican who drew jeers from the
campaign volunteers preparing to make phone calls and walk door to door
with clipboards and pleas for votes.

The target? Not President Trump, who drew only passing mention. It was
Scott Walker, the state’s governor. His eight years in office are the
Democrats’ greatest weapon this fall, even as his economic record has
become their greatest complication.

“Forty days is not enough to talk about all the awful things Scott
Walker’s done,” [Mandela
Barnes](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/15/media-reports-mandela-barnes-dead-white-and-not-ballot/982165002/),
the Democrats’ nominee for lieutenant governor, called out.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Randy Bryce, a mustachioed former ironworker who hopes to seize the seat
that House Speaker Paul Ryan is leaving, mocked the “Scott-holes” that
he said plague Wisconsin’s roads.

And Tony Evers, a grandfatherly-looking state schools superintendent who
is running against Mr. Walker, said that it was high time they hold the
governor accountable for cuts to schools, rising health care costs and a
state economy that may look dazzling in headlines but, Mr. Evers says,
doesn’t always feel that way to
residents.

Wisconsin, which had not picked a Republican for president since 1984,
shocked the country in 2016 by backing Mr. Trump. In hindsight, it
shouldn’t have been such a surprise: Mr. Walker and the
Republican-controlled Legislature were re-elected in 2014 after slashing
taxes, and many Republicans, independents and even some fiscally-minded
Democrats saw benefit in a firmer line on the size and costs of
government, not to mention lower tax bills.

But now there’s a rising debate over whether this state needs more than
Mr. Walker’s unbending rectitude. One question for Democrats is whether
they can successfully make an economic argument at a time when
Wisconsin’s economic indicators are strong. By most metrics,
Wisconsin’s economy is doing well. At 3 percent, the state’s
unemployment rate is well below the national average of 3.7 percent.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nationally, Democratic leaders are watching Wisconsin closely, in part
to understand how to run against a relatively upbeat economy, and in
part for lessons for winning back the state in the 2020 presidential
election.

As in other once-blue states, the Trump victory in Wisconsin led to new
energy among Democrats this year, [turning a state Supreme Court seat
over to a liberal
candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/wisconsin-election-supreme-court.html),
electing Democrats in [special
elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/us/wisconsin-elections-state-senate.html)
to two state legislative seats that had long been held by Republicans,
and drawing a [higher primary election voter turnout in
August](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2018/08/15/democrats-outdraw-republicans-wisconsin-primary-turnout-nears-1-million/996379002/)
than the Republicans saw.

But for the moment, just like [party candidates in some other
places](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/us/politics/democrats-house-midterm-campaign.html),
many Wisconsin Democrats are running hard against Mr. Walker and the
Republican establishment that has moved the state firmly to the right,
and less overtly against President Trump. Part of it is calculation:
Avoid alienating independent voters who may have voted for Mr. Trump.

After years of setbacks, including a failed effort [to remove Mr. Walker
in a recall
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/politics/walker-survives-wisconsin-recall-effort.html),
Wisconsin Democrats’ dreams are suddenly vast. They hope not only to
hold onto Tammy Baldwin’s United States Senate seat but to win the
governor’s office and control of the State Senate. With redistricting
and advantages going into the 2020 presidential race at stake, Democrats
have fielded candidates for more state legislative seats than in recent
memory.

But the Democrats’ most challenging problem may not be on the ballot.

“Wisconsin is working,” Mr. Walker told reporters about the economy,
after a campaign event not long ago. “Democrats are trying to tell
something to people that’s not true with what they actually know and
see.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For months, as Wisconsin residents debated the possibility of a “blue
wave” of Democratic votes on Election Day, one unlikely voice has
repeatedly warned that it could happen: Scott Walker himself.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

Mr. Walker, who is 50 and seeking a third term in a state where nearly
everyone already has an opinion of him, rocked up and down in his
sneakers the other day as he waited for his introduction at the edge of
a stage in Burlington. He looked impatient to get to work.

Wearing an Aaron Rodgers’ Green Bay Packers jersey, Mr. Walker told the
crowd of supporters something that most of them might have argued with
had it come from anyone else.

The polls show a tight race, Mr. Walker warned the crowd, and they
should be believed.

“Don’t explain the polls by saying they’re wrong,” he said. “Explain the
polls by saying that’s all the motivation we need to talk to more
voters.”

“The only way we fail to win,” he said, “is if the truth gets blurred
over.”

Last week, the [Marquette Law School
Poll](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/) found Mr. Walker a percentage
point ahead of Mr. Evers among likely voters. The poll showed Ms.
Baldwin with a 10-point lead in her Senate race against Leah Vukmir, a
Republican ally of Mr. Walker from the Legislature.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Walker, a former lawmaker and county executive who ran for president
briefly and knows Wisconsin politics like few others, has countered
shows of mounting Democratic strength with a fierce, unrelenting
campaign: The state Republican Party ran an ominous-sounding
[ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75xbRWAqqrI) accusing Mr. Evers, in
his role as a schools leader, of failing to properly discipline teachers
accused of sexual misconduct; the Republicans have issued sharp warnings
that Democrats would return the state to days of high taxes and budget
deficits; and, most of all, Mr. Walker ticks off Wisconsin’s economic
successes every chance he gets.

In addition to the state’s 3 percent unemployment rate, wage growth is
picking up speed after lagging the rest of the country for much of 2016
and 2017. Average hourly earnings in the state are up five percent from
a year ago, compared with a 2.9 percent increase nationally.

“It’s hard to argue we need a change economically as people are doing
well,” said Noah Williams, director of the[Center for Research on the
Wisconsin Economy](https://crowe.wisc.edu/) at the University of
Wisconsin — Madison.

The turnaround was a long time coming, however. The state lost more than
175,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010 and it took until 2015 for total
employment to get back to where it had been before the recession.

One of Mr. Walker’s campaign promises during his initial run for
governor in 2010 was to create 250,000 jobs in his first term, which
ended in early 2015. He reached that goal in April 2018, more than seven
years after taking office.

“Most people feel that the state is really doing well,” said Rosanne
Hahn, a retired teacher who conferred with Mr. Walker outside his
Burlington event and said she plans to vote for him. “A lot of times
there are many jobs and people won’t take them,” Ms. Hahn
said.

Mr. Evers, 66, was a teacher and principal before he became the state’s
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and he looks the part — a pen at
the ready in his dress shirt pocket, a flop of white hair and a gentle
smile.

His name is widely known in the state, but his political style is
factual and bland, a concern for some Democratic voters who say they
wonder whether a more inspirational candidate could better seize the
political moment. But some strategists say Mr. Evers, who won the
nomination in a wide field of primary candidates, is a safe, ideal
choice for keeping the focus not on himself — but on Mr. Walker’s
legacy.

By Mr. Evers’s telling, the state’s economic picture may be the
centerpiece of Mr. Walker’s campaign, but that doesn’t make it a less
potent argument for the Democrats — largely, he says, because people
don’t feel like things are as upbeat as the statistics imply.

“He can talk about the unemployment rate until the cows come home,” Mr.
Evers said in an interview. “Most people are just scraping by, so that
doesn’t mean anything to them. Many of the people that are employed are
having to get two or three jobs just make ends meet. Also, we’re in a
state that people are leaving because of the decisions he has made.
There’s a lot of data out there other than the unemployment rate.”

This is how Wisconsin Democrats are pivoting from a strict economic
pitch to a case that may be easier to make: They say that Mr. Walker’s
political philosophy has starved Wisconsin of money for needed services.

When Mr. Walker first entered office, he cut spending on schools.
Gradual increases followed and the most recent budget had an infusion of
new dollars, Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst at the Wisconsin Budget
Project, said. But, she added, the new funds were not enough to make up
for the initial cut, after adjusting for inflation.

Aid to the state’s university system has also been cut under Mr. Walker.
In the 2010-11 budget year, state funding totaled $1.179 billion. It
dropped by $178 million the following year after he took office, and
stood at $1.06 billion in 2017-2018.

Under Mr. Walker’s watch, the state ranked 44th in a [U.S. News and
World Report ranking of road
quality](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wisconsin). Adjusted
for inflation, in fiscal 2019 Wisconsin’s [transportation
budget](https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/about-wisdot/performance/budget/trends2018-2019.pdf)
remains 20 percent below where it was in 2010.

Even as needed services were deprived of money, Mr. Evers says, the
state was agreeing to a deal that would provide [$3 billion in tax
credits](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/wisconsin-foxconn-tax-subsidies.html)
so that Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics company, could build a campus
in Southeast Wisconsin. “We’re starving the school systems but giving
this Hail Mary version of economic development with one company?” Mr.
Evers said. “It’s a terrible
deal.”

Around the state, Democrats said they had not felt the benefit of the
state’s impressive economic statistics. Manufacturing plays an outsize
role here; the factory sector is responsible for 18.6 percent of
economic output, compared with 11.7 percent for the United States as a
whole. Nearly half a million Wisconsin residents work in manufacturing,
up 24,000 since the beginning of 2017, but still shy of the total before
the recession.

“Whoopee\!” Denis Olson, who is 62 and fixes tractors, said of the
state’s low unemployment rate. “If you’re looking for a job for a buck
over minimum wage you can find them. Every low-paying job is hiring, but
who can live on
that?”

## The State Senate up for grabs?

In Blanchardville, a village of just more than 800 people, homecoming
royalty and homemade floats rolled down Main Street on a sunny, windy
Saturday not long ago. One float bore a canoe and a sign that read “Come
Hell or High Water,” an allusion to widespread and damaging flooding in
parts of Wisconsin in recent months. Supporters of Ms. Marion, the
Democrat running for state senator, handed out postcards with a [Maple
Dunker](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wisconsin-recipes-maple-dunkers/)cookie
recipe from Ms. Marion, who raced through the crowd in a sparkly
T-shirt, shaking hands.

In a state that was once seen as mostly blue but often flipped control
back and forth, Democrats view the Wisconsin Senate as one of their most
winnable openings. Republicans hold control of the chamber with an 18-15
margin, and Democrats have poured attention into several seats they see
as particularly competitive.

The district Ms. Marion is trying to seize from a Republican incumbent
includes small towns and dairy farms in a rolling, rural section of
Southwestern Wisconsin that went for Mr. Trump in 2016, but also Barack
Obama before that; it’s a place strategists see as a swing district that
could reflect Democrats’ strength in the state this
year.

Ms. Marion, a county board member who tends a small farm with a
bed-and-breakfast, drew statewide attention a few years ago as part of
efforts to pass legislation that became known as the “Cookie Bill.”
State law didn’t authorize bakers to sell their goods at farmers’
markets without commercial licenses, and she wanted to change that, but
struggled to get anywhere with the Republican-controlled Legislature.
Eventually, she was among a group that sued. A court ruling opened the
way for such sales, but Ms. Marion saw the events as telling.

“How simple should that have been to get a cookie bill passed?” she
said. “It was eye opening in terms of how you think you know what
democracy is. I’m actually not super into baking cookies, but we just
need more opportunities out here.”

Not far from Ms. Marion along Main Street, supporters of her opponent,
Sen. Howard Marklein, the Republican incumbent and an accountant who
grew up on a dairy farm, were handing out Packers’ game schedules and
bright yellow Marklein bags to children collecting candy along the
street. Mr. Marklein said that farmers are struggling but that his
constituents tell him they see the state’s economy as growing and
vibrant.

“I’ve knocked on thousands of doors,” Mr. Marklein said. “You talk to
businesses, and these are the best years they’ve ever
had.”

Still, Ms. Marion’s pitch is largely about economic survival and quality
of life: Fix the roads. Expand broadband to the rural reaches. Send more
money to rural schools.

Small towns are struggling, she said, with populations shrinking,
schools closing and farmers wrestling with bankruptcies and a growing
suicide problem.

“In towns like this, we’re on the edge all the time,” she said. “We want
to stay here, but that is by no means a sure thing. It’s sort of like
we’re at a crossroads. What’s going to
happen?”
