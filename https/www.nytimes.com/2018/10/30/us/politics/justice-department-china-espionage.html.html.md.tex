WASHINGTON --- Intelligence officers in a small office in China's vast
intelligence-gathering network for years stole secrets from aerospace
companies in the United States and abroad, Justice Department officials
said on Tuesday in unsealing the third indictment in recent weeks that
detailed China's elaborate efforts to steal corporate secrets through
espionage and hacking.

Two Chinese intelligence officers and five hackers repeatedly broke into
corporate computer systems to steal intellectual property and other
information about the aerospace industry,
\href{https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/462-chinese-intelligence-officers-indictment/e73abcf72e5df6c6a996/optimized/full.pdf\#page=1}{according
to the indictment}, which had been under seal since June.

From January 2010 to May 2015, they stole turbofan engine plans and
other confidential business information from 13 companies, according to
court documents. They included Capstone Turbine, a gas turbine
manufacturer based in Los Angeles, and other unnamed companies in Los
Angeles and San Diego as well as Massachusetts, Arizona, Oregon and
Wisconsin and overseas in Britain, France and Australia.

At the time, a Chinese government-owned aerospace company was developing
a comparable commercial aircraft engine, the government said.

The officers worked in the Jiangsu Province office of the Ministry of
State Security, China's primary domestic and foreign
intelligence-gathering agency. That office was also at the heart of the
two other recent cases involving China's efforts to steal information
from the American aerospace industry.

China has long pilfered American corporate, academic and military
information to bolster its position in the global economy, and the three
cases show the Justice Department's continued crackdown on China's
efforts to steal corporate data for China's commercial gain, Adam L.
Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of
California, said in a statement.

``The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase,
commercially available products should offend every company that invests
talent, energy and shareholder money into the development of products,''
he said.

This month, Yanjun Xu, a deputy division director in the office, was
charged with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/us/politics/china-spy-espionage-arrest.html}{trying
to steal secrets from GE Aviation}. Mr. Xu was arrested in Belgium in
April, about a year after he began grooming a GE employee to obtain and
deliver corporate secrets, prosecutors said. The case was the first time
a Chinese intelligence official was extradited to the United States to
be tried in federal court.

In September, the department arrested Ji Chaoqun, a United States Army
reservist from China, on charges that he
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/us/politics/ji-chaoqun-china-spy.html}{secretly
provided information about aerospace industry employees} after meeting
Chinese intelligence officers from the Jiangsu office in 2013. One of
those officers, who was arrested in April, was Mr. Xu, according to an
American official briefed on the investigation.

The information Mr. Ji provided would have been used in the Chinese
government's efforts to recruit those employees as informants, the
Justice Department said.

The indictment unveiled on Tuesday accused the two intelligence
officers, Zha Rong and Chai Meng, and other co-conspirators in the
Jiangsu office of working with hackers to steal turbofan technology used
in American and European commercial airliners. They also accused them of
working with two employees in a Jiangsu Province office of the unnamed
French aerospace manufacturer, Gu Gen and Tian Xi, who had been
recruited to act as spies by the Chinese intelligence officers. They
were also charged.

An unidentified American company and the French manufacturer oversaw the
turbofan engine project, according to court papers.

The hackers --- Zhang Zhang-Gui, Liu Chunliang, Gao Hong Kun, Zhuang
Xiaowei and Ma Zhiqi --- also infiltrated other companies that made
turbofan jet engine parts, prosecutors said, and leased a global network
of servers to hide their movements.

The hackers sent spearphishing emails to company employees and planted
malware into corporate computer networks, according to the indictment.
They also turned their corporate websites into malicious sites that
would compromise the computers of anyone who visited them, law
enforcement officials said.

From November 2013 to February 2014, they also groomed Mr. Tian and Mr.
Gu, employees in the French aerospace company's China office, to work
with Chinese intelligence officers, according to the indictment.

Mr. Tian planted malicious software into his employer's computer systems
for the Chinese intelligence officials, according to court documents.

Mr. Gu, his office's head of information technology and security, told
Chinese intelligence officers that law enforcement officials had noticed
the presence of malware in the company's systems, prosecutors said. The
warning allowed the conspirators to try to hide their identities.

Mr. Zhang was also charged in a separate case claiming that he and
another Chinese citizen used some of the stolen information for their
own criminal scheme. The Justice Department intends to bring more such
corporate theft cases, said John C. Demers, the head of the National
Security Division at the agency.
