Republicans moved toward expanding their control of the Senate as
Democrats took power in the House, with incomplete election results
pointing toward a reaffirmation of a deeply divided nation.

The Republicans flipped seats in three states — Indiana, Missouri and
North Dakota — that President Trump had won by a large margin in 2016,
and won an open seat in Tennessee. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held off a
surprisingly strong challenge from Beto O’Rourke.

Money and momentum favored the Democrats, who seized more than a dozen
of the 23 seats they needed to take the House in early returns.
Democrats faced mixed results in the governor’s races, picking up
governorships in Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico and
Wisconsin, but failing to claim the coveted battleground of Florida.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The returns provided fresh evidence of the partisan split in American
political life with Democrats seizing Republican House seats in suburban
districts where affluent educated voters had been vocal in their
opposition to Mr. Trump.

## Democrats win the House

**Democrats won control of the House**, a significant victory for a
party locked out of power since the 2016 elections.

The Democratic win means a deadlocked Congress — with Republicans in
control of the Senate and Democrats in the lower chamber — and is a
setback for the Trump administration, which is likely to face an
onslaught of congressional investigations. Even before the election,
House Democrats had begun [preparing a flurry of hearings, subpoenas and
inquiries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/politics/democrats-trump-impeachment.html)
into nearly every aspect of the president and his White House.

While Democrats were favored to win back the House, their victory was
far from assured.

## It’s not over yet

The special election for the **Mississippi
Senate<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>advanced to a runoff**
between Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Republican, and Mike Espy, a Democrat,
according to The Associated Press.

The state uses a so-called jungle primary system, where if no candidate
reaches a 50 percent threshold, the top two vote-getters face each other
in a runoff election. Neither Ms. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to fill
Senator Thad Cochran’s seat, nor Mr. Espy broke that bar. Chris
McDaniel, a conservative, failed to make the cutoff.

Their runoff is scheduled for Nov. 27.

## Ballot initiatives: Marijuana and the minimum wage

Candidates weren’t the only things on the ballot on Tuesday night.
Voters weighed in on more than 150 ballot initiatives.

• **Florida restored voting rights to 1.5 million people** who had been
convicted of felonies but had completed their sentences. The new voters
could change the political dynamics for the 2020 race in the perennial
battleground state.

• Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum that **would have repealed
a 2016 law preventing discrimination based on gender identity** in
public spaces, including bathrooms.

• Missouri voters **legalized medical marijuana** while North Dakota
voters **decided not to legalize** recreational marijuana.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• Voters in Arkansas and Missouri **raised the minimum wage**. In
Missouri, the wage will rise to $11 from $8.50; Arkansas’s will increase
to $12 from $7.85.

## A late night in Nevada

Two and a half hours after the polls were scheduled to close in Nevada,
people were still waiting in line to vote.

The Elections Division of the Nevada secretary of state’s office said it
would not release results from anywhere in the state until the last
voter cast a ballot.

At 7:43 p.m. local time, well past the scheduled closing time of 7,
voters were still waiting in Clark, Elko, Lyon and Washoe Counties. Elko
finished by 8:13; Lyon by 9:16. Clark — the state’s largest county, home
to Las Vegas and Henderson — wrapped things up by 9:21. But in Washoe
County, home to Reno, the doors did not close until around 10 p.m., when
the final voters were done.

When the ballots were counted, Jacky Rosen defeated Senator Dean Heller.

## Mitt Romney is going to Washington after all

Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 presidential
candidate, **won the Utah Senate race**, according to The Associated
Press.

Mr. Romney defeated Jenny Wilson, the Democrat, in his largely
uncompetitive race. Moderate Republicans hope he’ll be a check on the
president, given his vocal criticism of Mr. Trump during the 2016
campaign. [Read more about why he ran

## A surprise in the Oklahoma Fifth

In one of the most surprising upsets of the night, Kendra Horn, a
Democrat, defeated the Republican incumbent Steve Russell in Oklahoma’s
Fifth District, which includes Oklahoma City. The victory came in a
state that is one of the reddest in the country. President Trump won by
36 points two years ago, and Republicans had held — until now — every
congressional seat.

But there have been signs of discontent. A plunge in oil prices matched
with years of tax-slashing led to school districts going to four-day
weeks and rural hospitals shutting down. The Republican governor, Mary
Fallin, has low approval ratings.

All of this has led to some backlash. Discontent has especially risen in
cities, once the homeland of Oklahoma Republicans. Democrats this summer
won several statehouse special selections in Republican-held districts
around Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Ms. Horn significantly outraised her
opponent. Still, few expected Ms. Horn, who has a background working for
nonprofits and in the aerospace industry, to win.
