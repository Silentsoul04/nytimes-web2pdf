WEST FARGO, N.D. — Representative Kevin Cramer, who latched onto Donald
J. Trump even before he was president and never let go, ousted North
Dakota’s incumbent Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp, on Tuesday,
flipping a key seat that was vital to Republican efforts to hold the
Senate.

In an election that largely became a referendum on the president, voters
here cast out the centrist Ms. Heitkamp, replacing an increasingly rare
moderate voice in the Senate with a proud and fiercely conservative
partisan.

Mr. Cramer’s win affirmed the state’s support for Mr. Trump, who swept
North Dakota in 2016 with a 36-percentage-point margin of victory. Eager
to defeat Ms. Heitkamp, considered the Democrats’ most vulnerable
senator, the president rallied here three times in support of the
congressman in an effort to energize the Republican base.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Cramer painted Ms. Heitkamp as a liberal
extremist out of touch with the state’s values, and positioned himself
as a steadfast supporter of the president’s agenda. He offered a stark
contrast between her voting record and his own — he has voted with Mr.
Trump’s position almost 99 percent of the time.

“Can you imagine going home and telling your wife, ‘I’ve been faithful
to you 55 percent of the time?’” Mr. Cramer [told a local radio
show](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/04/politics/kevin-cramer-faithful-cheating/index.html)
in April. “Are you kidding me? Being wrong half the time is not a good
answer.”

Ms. Heitkamp tried to fight back by touting her willingness to reach
across the aisle, coaxing voters to embrace moderation and compromise,
betting that voters, weary of biting partisanship and division, would
reject demands for ideological purity and endorse her brand of centrism.
The bet has historically been a safe one in North Dakota.

“We were famous for ticket splitting and judging the individual on their
own merits,” said former Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat who
served in the House from 1993 to 2011 and campaigned in support of Ms.
Heitkamp.

Pollsters were already forecasting an uphill battle for the incumbent
senator, facing national political headwinds and an environment more
open to unapologetic partisanship. But her political fate may have been
sealed last month when she voted against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s
confirmation. The vote [yielded her a $12 million fund-raising windfall
from
Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/politics/heitkamp-kavanaugh-fund-raising.html)
across the country and buoyed her get-out-the-vote effort.

But it earned her scorn from many of the Republican-leaning voters she
needed.

There were unforced errors from her campaign, too. Ms. Heitkamp had
touted her advocacy for women and invoked her own mother’s experience
with sexual assault after the Supreme Court vote, taking a swipe at Mr.
Cramer, who called the \#MeToo movement a “movement toward
victimization.” But [she was forced to publicly
apologize](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/heitkamp-north-dakota-ad-apology.html)after
her staff released the names of survivors of sexual assault in a
campaign advertisement without their permission.

In the days ahead of the election, Ms. Heitkamp was sanguine. She had
been doubted before and prevailed, she said, referring to her 2012
victory in which she eked out a win by 3,000 votes. But she also
acknowledged that there were voters in the state she had never been able
to win over.

“I think people who are going to vote straight Republican, they aren’t
people who will ever be persuaded one way or the other,” she said in an
interview after a rally Monday night. “They’ve joined a team.”
