They marched, they ran, and on Election Day, they won.

Women led a parade of victories and unexpected upsets Tuesday to[win
control of the House for the
Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/midterm-elections-results.html).

It was the culmination of two years of anger, frustration and activism
driven by women appalled by Donald J. Trump’s election and presidency.
[Women poured into grass-roots groups determined to
regain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/politics/women-activism-midterms.html?fbclid=IwAR0HEkwChpr-ouNizi4LoqrMMQC5n5AA1dzZI5uG0Lw8zyTN2DEAMW14wYw)
Democratic control of Congress and flooded organizations that trained
them to run for office. As candidates, women broke the rules and upended
conventional political wisdom. As activists, they expanded the
definition of women’s issues beyond education and reproductive rights to
include health care, immigration, gun violence and the environment.

It was a litany of [historic
firsts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/election-history-firsts-blackburn-pressley.html),
most of them by Democrats: In Massachusetts, Ayanna Pressley became the
first woman of color in her state’s congressional delegation. Rashida
Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota will be the first Muslim
women in Congress. Sharice Davids toppled a Republican man in Kansas and
Deb Haaland prevailed in New Mexico, becoming the first Native American
women elected to Congress. In Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn, a Republican,
became the state’s first woman elected to the Senate.

But several prominent women were also defeated — Senator Claire
McCaskill lost to Josh Hawley in Missouri, Amy McGrath lost a closely
watched House race in Kentucky, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp lost her
re-election race in North Dakota. Stacey Abrams of Georgia, who had
hoped to become the first black woman in the country to be elected
governor, was trailing her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp.

Pennsylvania, which had no women in its 21-member congressional
delegation, will now have four. Democratic women flipped three
Republican-held seats: Mary Gay Scanlon, Chrissy Houlahan and Susan
Wild; and Madeleine Dean won an open
seat.

Two women helped Democrats pick up seats in Florida: Debbie
Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, a member of former President Bill
Clinton’s cabinet. Ms. Houlahan was one of four female military veterans
and political newcomers to win seats for Democrats; the others were
Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, and Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger in
Virginia. Lauren Underwood in Illinois helped Democrats produce another
unexpected victory.

“I urge you to work for a better future long after tonight,” Ms.
Sherrill said before a thunderous crowd that included dozens of women
who had spent months canvassing and phone banking. “The thousands of
women who are ready to join me to make sure we have a better future for
our kids, for New Jersey and for the United States of America.”

She told how she had asked her daughter Maggie, the oldest of her four
young children, if she was “O.K. with this.” Her daughter, she said,
“asked, ‘If you don’t run, who will?’”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was striking to consider just how far women had come since the
women’s marches across the country the day after President Trump’s
inauguration. Women like Ms. Sherrill and Ms. Davids had started as long
shots, but their victories seemed assured by Election Day.

With a Democratic majority in the House, women will wield more
institutional power — Representative [Nancy
Pelosi](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/house-democrats-nancy-pelosi.html)
is expected to beat back a leadership challenge to again become speaker,
the only woman to ever hold that post. Representative Nita Lowey,
Democrat of New York, would chair the Appropriations Committee, and
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, would chair the
Financial Service
Committee.

The energy among Democratic women made it harder for Republican women to
emerge as candidates.

And in the first big defeat of the evening for Republicans,
Representative Barbara Comstock lost by wide margin to a Democrat,
Jennifer Wexton, in the Virginia suburbs. Ms. Comstock, a prolific
fund-raiser, had survived previous challenges in the blue district.

A challenge from a Democratic woman threatened the highest-ranking
Republican woman in the House, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of
Washington.

According to [figures tallied by the Center for American Women and
Politics at
Rutgers](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/potential-candidate-summary-2018), 428
women ran for Congress or governor as Democrats, compared with 162
Republicans. Of these, 210 Democratic women and 63 Republican women
remained nominees by Election Day.

Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at the Rutgers center, the surge of
women had changed American politics.

“For some women, that meant not waiting their turn,” she said. “For
other women, it also meant running in ways that embraced gender and race
as an asset they bring to candidacy and office-holding, instead of a
hurdle they have to overcome to be successful in what has been a man’s
world of electoral politics.”

This cycle, the first since the defeat of the first female major party
presidential candidate, many women ran without being asked. [And they
ran differently, ignoring the timeworn advice to female candidates to
talk about your

and pretend you don’t have a personal life. Instead, they featured their
children in ads, offered personal testimony about sexual harassment and
abuse, and opened up about family struggles with drug addiction and
debt, to connect to many Americans with the same struggles.

Women shattered records and precedents. One-third of the female nominees
for the House were women of [color, the highest
ever.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/us/politics/midterm-election-candidates-diversity.html)

## 13 Questions About Women and the Midterms

The 2018 election season has raised new questions about gender and power
that could affect the outcome Tuesday for the record numbers of women
seeking office. Here are a few of those questions that might reshape
conventional wisdom about women and politics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But as many more women ran, it was perhaps inevitable that many more
would lose, as well. Heightened political activism in the Trump era
brought out many more men running for office, too, and many of the
female candidates were Democrats running in districts that are
gerrymandered or all but assured to vote Republican. In Florida, two
challengers, Lauren Baer and Mary Barzee Flores, lost to Republican
incumbents.

Despite being more than half the population and the voters, women were
still less than a third of all candidates for Congress, the governors’
offices and other statewide executive seats.

Women running for governor, from Idaho to Texas to Maine, [faced the
steepest hurdles of
all](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/06/us/politics/women-governors-primaries.html?smid=fb-share&fbclid=IwAR2lTEirDusEZmi8R2-zcuYy7h4VuHKLGL06q0HKv63QnhbDSVw8GxVr7oY).
Twenty-two states have never elected a woman as governor — six states
have female governors now — and research has shown voters are more
reluctant to choose women as chief executives than as legislators. Janet
Mills became the first woman elected governor of Maine. Gretchen Whitmer
was elected governor in Michigan, Laura Kelly in Kansas and Michelle
Lujan Grisham in New Mexico.

In a political season in which disgust with Washington runs high, many
women hope their lack of traditional political credentials will enhance
their outsider appeal: Jahana Hayes, a former teacher of the year, was a
surprise winner of a Democratic House primary in Connecticut and on
Tuesday became the state’s first black woman elected to Congress.

The elections also could bring a younger generation to Washington: Ms.
Ocasio-Cortez as well as Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat running for a House
seat in Iowa, are both in their late 20s.

President Trump was elected by the largest gender gap on record, and
women have moved even more leftward throughout the first two years of
his presidency, even as men have gravitated toward the Republican Party.

In a Gallup survey of registered voters in September, while men favored
Republicans over Democrats, 50 percent to 44 percent, women preferred
Democrats by 58 percent to 34 percent. That 24-point split had widened
from eight points in June. The gap between the genders is even more
striking among millennials. Earlier this year, a Pew poll found that 70
percent of millennial women affiliated with or leaned toward the
Democrats, up from 56 percent four years ago. Just under half of
millennial men did.
