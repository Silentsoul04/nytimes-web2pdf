WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump was more involved in discussions over a
potential Russian business deal during the presidential campaign than
previously known, his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen said Thursday [in
pleading guilty to lying to
Congress](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/501-michael-cohen-court-transcript/ddd84d2b0f5a3425ebc5/optimized/full.pdf#page=1).
Mr. Trump’s associates pursued the project as the Kremlin was escalating
its election sabotage effort meant to help him win the presidency.

Mr. Trump’s participation in discussions about building a grand
skyscraper in Moscow showed how the interests of his business empire
were enmeshed with his political ambitions as he was closing in on the
Republican nomination for president. During the early months of 2016,
when the business discussions were taking place, he was publicly
pressing for warmer relations between the United States and Russia and
an end to economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, policy
positions that might have benefited his family business.

Court documents made public by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller
III, detailed new accusations against Mr. Cohen, the president’s former
fixer, who [already pleaded guilty this
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-guilty-plea-trump-takeaways.html)
to committing campaign finance violations and financial crimes. Mr.
Cohen was the point person at the Trump Organization for negotiating a
deal for the Moscow project, and on Thursday he admitted lying to
congressional investigators about the duration of the negotiations and
the extent of the involvement of Mr. Trump — who is identified in the
court documents as “Individual 1.”

After pleading guilty in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday morning, Mr.
Cohen said that he made the false statements to Congress out of loyalty
to the president and to align with Mr. Trump’s “political messaging.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cohen’s cooperation with the special counsel’s investigation raises
the possibility that he might have information about the central focus
of the inquiry: whether President Trump or any of his associates
conspired with Russia’s efforts to disrupt the 2016 election. And it was
the second time that Mr. Cohen has imperiled the presidency; he said in
court in New York in August that Mr. Trump [directed hush money
payments](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html)
during the 2016 campaign to conceal potential sex scandals.

The Trump Tower discussions were occurring as Russia ramped up [its
sabotage
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html),
the information provided on Thursday by Mr. Cohen showed, though the
documents do not say whether any of Mr. Trump’s advisers were aware of
the Russian disruption effort. According to a grand jury indictment made
public this year, Russian intelligence operatives hacked the emails of
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman in March 2016. That same month, an
obscure professor whom Mr. Mueller’s team has identified as a likely
cutout for Russian intelligence [began courting a Trump campaign
aide](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html),
George Papadopoulos.

Mr. Cohen admitted that the discussions about Trump Tower Moscow went on
for at least six months after he [had told
Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/trump-russia-michael-cohen.html)
they had ended. They lasted until at least June 14, 2016, when Mr. Cohen
met in New York with an associate who had been trying to arrange his
trip to Russia, and told him he would not be traveling “at that time,”
court documents said. Mr. Cohen also discussed the deal in a 20-minute
phone call with a Russian government employee.

That same day, The Washington Post
[reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html?utm_term=.bc6441d4b944)
that Russian operatives had infiltrated the computer network of the
Democratic National Committee — the first public evidence of Moscow’s
campaign to disrupt the
election.

## The Special Counsel’s Charges Against Michael Cohen

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cohen said on Thursday that he discussed the status of the project
with Mr. Trump on more than the three occasions he had previously
acknowledged and briefed Mr. Trump’s family members about it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of those exchanges, which continued until January 2016, included
the president’s children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., both of whom
are executives at the Trump Organization, according to three people
familiar with the documents that the company turned over to Mr.
Mueller’s team.

In one email exchange in 2015, Ms. Trump made a suggestion about the
architecture, according to two of the people familiar with the messages.

Donald Trump Jr. appeared to have replied to only one message, saying
“Cool” in response to an update about the project, the people said.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen discussed Mr. Trump himself traveling to Russia
after the Republican National Convention, though that trip never
materialized.

Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions,
brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at
the time he was hoping to become president.

“There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would
have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of
opportunities?” he said to reporters as he left Washington for the Group
of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We decided — I decided ultimately — not to do it,” he said, adding,
“There would have been nothing wrong if I did do
it.”

## Roger Stone and Everyone Charged in the 2016 Election Investigations

Roger J. Stone Jr., one of six Trump advisers convicted in cases
stemming from the investigation by the special counsel, was sentenced to
more than three years in prison.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump accused his former fixer of lying to receive a reduced
sentence for the crimes he has pleaded guilty to. Under his earlier plea
agreement, Mr. Cohen faced about four to five years in prison.

“He was convicted of various things unrelated to us,” Mr. Trump said,
adding, “He’s a weak person and what he’s trying to do is get a reduced
sentence.”

The proceedings in Lower Manhattan appeared to have global
repercussions. After Mr. Cohen’s appearance in court, [Mr. Trump
abruptly
canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/trump-putin-meeting-g20.html)
a planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia while both
leaders are in Argentina. The president said he called off the meeting
because of [Russia’s recent hostilities with
Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kerch-strait.html).

*\[*[*Read about Trump associates’ connections with Russia and
Ukraine.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html)*\]*

The new revelations were certain to increase the strain between Mr.
Trump and the Justice Department. In recent days, the president and his
lawyers have [increased their
attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/us/politics/trump-mueller-russia-inquiry.html)
on the department and the Russia investigation, including Mr. Mueller.
This week, the special counsel’s office [accused Mr. Trump’s onetime
campaign
chairman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/mueller-paul-manafort-cooperation.html),
Paul Manafort, of repeatedly lying to investigators in breach of his
plea agreement.

The acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, was told of Mr.
Cohen’s impending plea Monday or earlier, a person familiar with the
special counsel’s investigation said. The White House learned of it late
Wednesday, people close to Mr. Trump said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new revelations also came a week after Mr. Trump’s lawyers provided
Mr. Mueller with written responses to a set of questions.

The special counsel identified Mr. Cohen’s false statements to Congress
in testimony and materials that Mr. Cohen provided to the Senate and
House Intelligence Committees, which have been conducting their own
investigations into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and
Russia.

“There’s a reason people shouldn’t lie when they’re in front of a
congressional investigation,” Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina,
the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday. The
committee’s top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said that the
panel had made additional criminal referrals to Mr. Mueller, but he gave
no specifics.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump said on Thursday that discussions about the Moscow project
took place in early 2016, but that he did not know exactly when he
decided to stop pursuing it.

*\[*[*Read about Mr. Trump’s attempts to chase business deals in
Russia.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-business.html)*\]*

The president has previously said that there would be no problem if he
continued to run his business from the White House. “I have a
no-conflict-of-interest provision as president,” Mr. Trump said in
[January 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html),
adding, “I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve
stayed away.”

Mr. Cohen’s new guilty plea in Federal District Court is the first time
the office of the special counsel has charged him. In exchange for
pleading guilty and continuing to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, he may
hope to receive a lighter sentence.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He is scheduled to be sentenced in two weeks. It is unclear what
additional time he could face with the new guilty plea.

During his plea hearing in August, Mr. Cohen admitted to making a
$130,000 payment to an adult film actress, Stephanie Clifford, better
known as Stormy Daniels, to keep her quiet about an affair she said she
had with Mr. Trump.

The payment amounted to an illegal contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign,
prosecutors argued, since her silence bolstered his election hopes and
campaign finance law prohibits individuals from donating more than
$2,700 to a presidential candidate.

He said that the payments to Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former
Playboy model, were made “in coordination with, and at the direction of,
a candidate for federal office” — a reference to Mr. Trump.

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Cohen’s plea on Thursday only
added urgency for congressional investigators who plan to begin an
inquiry into Mr. Trump’s foreign business dealings when Democrats take
control of the House in January.

“If the president and his associates were being untruthful in real time
as they were pursuing this deal,” Mr. Schiff told reporters on Thursday,
“what does it mean now on how much we can rely on what the president is
saying about any continuing Russian financial interest?”
