About an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I
experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven’t felt in a long time while
on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected
with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile.

Was this … *happiness*?

TikTok — a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the
TV segment “Carpool Karaoke” — is a refreshing outlier in the social
media
universe.

A so-called challenge video on TikTok, from the user @spellmantwinz,

food to the beat of a song.

There are no ads. There’s no news, unless you count learning about viral
dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking
weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars
clips.

Instead, TikTok — a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until
ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in
2017 and merged it with a video app it owned — has a simple premise.
Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing
or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects
to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that
allows users to send virtual “gifts” to their favorite creators, which
can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app
— followers, hashtags, likes and comments.

It doesn’t sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well
be the only truly pleasant social network in existence.

I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for
a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy
slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists
and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many
Facebook memes.

TikTok has none of that. Instead, it’s that rarest of internet
creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly
with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without
being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified
misinformation. It’s a throwback to a time before the commercialization
of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless
weirdos trying to make each other laugh.

“It’s a bit of an escape,” said Billy Mann, a [TikTok

uses the platform to make comedy videos for his more than 650,000

“It’s a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and
being like, ‘I need silliness,’” he said.

TikTok’s earnest goofiness has [turned
off](https://theoutline.com/post/6383/tiktok-will-never-replace-vine)
some skeptics. But it’s hard to argue with the numbers. The app
[recently
passed](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18095446/tiktok-jimmy-fallon-tony-hawk-downloads-revenue)
six million users in the United States, according to a report from the
market research firm Sensor Tower. As of Friday, it ranked No. 4 among
free apps in Apple’s app store, ahead of Snapchat, Netflix and Facebook
Messenger. Globally, the app, whose Chinese version is called Douyin,
had [500 million monthly active
users](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201807/17/WS5b4d6057a310796df4df6e3c.html)
as of July, making it bigger than Twitter and about half the size of
Instagram.

Currently, TikTok makes money through virtual gift sales and brand
collaborations, such as a Guess-sponsored “[fashion
takeover](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180831005348/en/GUESS-TikTok-Launch-First-of-Its-Kind-Fashion-Partnership).”
There are no ads inside the app, although the company's [privacy
policy](https://www.tiktok.com/i18n/privacy/#how-use) leaves room for
them in the future. TikTok, which is privately held, does not disclose
financial information, but Sensor Tower
[estimates](https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-revenue) that it took in
roughly $3.5 million in October.

TikTok’s success has spawned legions of influencers, users with millions
of followers and household-name status among teenagers. And it has
propelled ByteDance, which also owns a suite of other social media and
news apps, to a [reported
valuation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/bytedance-fundraising-toutiao-tiktok.html)
of $75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the
world.

TikTok’s global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement
that the company’s mission was to “capture and present the world’s
creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile
phone.”

In perhaps the clearest sign that TikTok is on to something, Facebook is
trying to kill it. Last month, the company [quietly released
Lasso](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18080280/facebook-lasso-tiktok-competitor-app),
a clunky clone that borrowed many of TikTok’s core features and even
tried to siphon off some of its power users. Lasso got off to a slow
start, and is now the 687th most downloaded photo and video app in the
United States, according to the mobile data company AppAnnie. The
executive leading the Lasso team, Brady Voss, [left the
company](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/facebook-lasso/) shortly
after the app was released. (Facebook declined to comment, and Mr. Voss
did not respond to a request for comment.)

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Before I go any further, let’s get one thing out of the way: If you’re
reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on
TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but
judging from what’s on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to
hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely
concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far
as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as
if they are chaperoning a high school dance.

Officially, TikTok users must be 13 or older to join. But the
age-verification process is easy to circumvent, and while browsing the
platform, I stumbled upon several videos starring people who appeared to
be much younger. In its previous incarnation as Musical.ly, TikTok [drew
fire from some privacy
advocates](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/business/media/a-social-network-frequented-by-children-tests-the-limits-of-online-regulation.html),
who accused it of pushing the limits of the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act, a law that prohibits the collection of certain types of
information from users younger than 13.

“It’s clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue
of kids being significantly too young for it,” said James P. Steyer, the
chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech
products for families. “It’s not that the content on TikTok isn’t O.K.
for your 15-year-old. It’s what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old.”

While using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment.
(Both of which are prohibited by TikTok’s community guidelines, as is
sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of
videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively — which, if you are
a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly
unsettling.

A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and
positivity on the platform is “our top priority.” She added, “we
periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and
moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users.”

Last year, after two other apps owned by ByteDance were [criticized by
Chinese
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html)
for promoting objectionable content, the company’s chief executive,
Zhang Yiming, said that it would increase the ranks of its content
moderation team to 10,000 moderators, from 6,000. The TikTok spokeswoman
declined to say how many of those moderators work for TikTok, or whether
content standards for American users differ from those for users in
China, where [famously strict censorship
laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/china-toutiao-censorship.html)
apply.

Free-speech advocates might bristle at TikTok’s Chinese ownership, and
privacy hawks have raised questions about how the company handles users’
personal data. But perhaps because it is more heavily moderated than
other networks, TikTok mostly feels safe and wholesome. Julia Alexander,
a fellow TikTok convert at The Verge, [called
it](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18009260/tiktok-musically-youtube-challenge-vine)
“a rare social app that isn’t infested with hateful rhetoric.”

One popular genre of TikTok video is the “challenge,” a kind of video
skit that is acted out en masse. One challenge,
[\#eatonthebeat](http://vm.tiktok.com/JfUMLQ/), encouraged users to make
videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a
song.

screen.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then there are the running jokes attached to specific songs — like “Good
Girls Bad Guys,” a song by the band Falling in Reverse, which is used
for a genre of video in which a user appears first in nerdy,
unattractive clothes, and then [cuts abruptly to a made-over
version](http://vm.tiktok.com/JfVfbM/) of himself in sunglasses, leather
jackets or other bad-boy attire.

Despite TikTok’s teens-only vibe, some adults have started to trickle
on. Jimmy Fallon, the late-night TV host, recently joined the site and
started [posting his own
challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kpmrqssFE). The comedian
Amy Schumer recently made a [TikTok
video](https://m.tiktok.com/v/6627958333363981573.html), and prominent
YouTubers like Jake Paul have tested the waters.

Is TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in
its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal
than more populist social platforms.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to
monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off
its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive — it has built
a social network that is genuinely fun to use.

There might be a lesson there.
