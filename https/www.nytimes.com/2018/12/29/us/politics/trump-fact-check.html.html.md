# Deciphering the Patterns in Trump’s Falsehoods

</div>

We review how President Trump bent the truth this year by repeating and
inflating falsehoods, shifting his statements, embellishing or omitting
details, and offering misleading attacks.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Trump has a well-documented problem telling the truth.

Fact checkers have compiled lists of all of Mr. Trump’s falsehoods since
he took office (The Washington Post [counts
over 7,500](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?utm_term=.f0fb3ee77790),
and The Toronto Star
[over 3,900](http://projects.thestar.com/donald-trump-fact-check/)),
rounded up his [most egregious
whoppers](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/dec/11/trump-file-10-top-falsehoods-2018/)
in [year-end
lists](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/12/the-whoppers-of-2018/) and
scrutinized his claims in real time with [television
chyrons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/style/how-cable-news-chyrons-have-adapted-to-the-trump-era/?utm_term=.5d2df35f9e33).

Here at The New York Times, [we have also
fact-checked](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/fact-checks) countless
campaign rallies, news conferences, interviews and Twitter posts. After
nearly two years of assessing the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s statements, we
can draw some conclusions not just about the scale of the president’s
mendacity, but also about how he uses inaccurate claims to advance his
agenda, criticize the news media and celebrate his achievements.

## Repetition and Inflation

Mr. Trump refuses to correct most of his inaccurate claims, instead
asserting them over and over again. They become, by sheer force of
repetition, “alternative facts” and staples of his campaign rallies and
speeches.

Examples abound. He has falsely characterized the December 2017 tax cuts
as the “largest” or the “biggest” in American history over 100 times
([several others were
larger](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/fact-check-trump-tax-cuts.html)).
He has misleadingly said over 90 times that his promised wall along the
southern border is being built ([construction has not
begun](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/fact-check-trump-border-wall.html)
[on any new
section](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/us/politics/trump-misleadingly-says-construction-has-already-begun-on-his-border-wall.html)).
He has falsely accused Democrats of supporting “open borders” over 60
times (Democratic lawmakers [support border
security](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/fast-check-donald-trump-democrats-open-borders.html),
but not his border wall). And he has lobbed [over 250 inaccurate
attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/politics/fact-check-trump-russia-election-interference-.html)
on the investigation into Russian election interference.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet Mr. Trump does not rely on repetition alone. He also embellishes
talking points to amplify his achievements.

Take his repeated fabrication about the construction of new steel mills.
After his administration [announced tariffs on steel and aluminum
imports](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/trump-tariffs.html)
in March, the president claimed in June that United States Steel was
“[opening six new
plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/politics/fact-check-trump-north-dakota-rally.html).”
A month later, the number rose to
[seven](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-economy/).
He has also occasionally cited
[eight](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-strengthening-retirement-security-america/),
possibly
[nine](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/)
or a vague “many plants,” and he claimed once that plants were “[opening
up literally on a daily
basis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-dinner-business-leaders/).”
To date, United States Steel has yet to open or build one new plant,
though the company has restarted idled components of some plants.

Mr. Trump often pairs his misleading claim that his border wall is being
built with the statement that he received $1.6 billion from Congress to
fund it — though a spending bill from March stipulated that the money,
for border security, could not be used for the wall. In August, he
[added another $1.6
billion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izMFU8g6uBo) to the count, with
no evidence. And despite [criticizing a spending
bill](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1042740913968164864)
passed in September for not appropriating any money for the wall, Mr.
Trump told campaign rally audiences in
[Illinois](https://www.c-span.org/video/?453628-1/president-trump-campaigns-republicans-illinois&start=1920),
[Texas](https://www.c-span.org/video/?453256-1/president-trump-campaigns-senator-ted-cruz-houston&start=1526)
and
[Mississippi](https://www.c-span.org/video/?452371-1/president-trump-holds-rally-mississippi&start=2935)
in October that his administration had secured a “third $1.6 billion.”

In some cases, true claims morph into false ones in Mr. Trump’s telling.
In December 2017, he was largely accurate in [saying a military spending
law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-helicopter-squadron-one/)
would give troops the largest raise [in eight
years](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IF10260.pdf#page=2). In March, he
then exaggerated that time frame to “[over a
decade](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/fact-check-military-pay-immigrants.html).”
And in May, as he addressed Naval Academy graduates at Annapolis, Mr.
Trump wrongly characterized the wage increase as not just the largest,
but the “[first in 10
years](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/politics/fact-check-trump-naval-academy-speech.html).”

## Shifting and Deflecting

In the face of controversy or criticism, Mr. Trump has defended initial
falsehoods with additional dubious claims.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This approach is evident in his shifting statements about the payment
that Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer, made to a pornographic film
actress to keep her from speaking about their alleged affair. In April,
Mr. Trump [falsely denied knowing about the
payment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-gaggle-en-route-washington-d-c/).

After the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen’s office, Mr. Trump [acknowledged on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/991992302267785216)
in May that Mr. Cohen received reimbursement for the payment and
asserted that it had nothing to do with his presidential campaign. Mr.
Cohen would later tell prosecutors that he acted at Mr. Trump’s
direction and to influence the election.

After the release of [an audio
recording](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen-recording.html?module=inline)
of the two men discussing a hush-money payment to another woman, Mr.
Trump [claimed in an August interview on “Fox &
Friends”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/fact-check-trump-fox-interview.html)
that he did not know about the payments until “later on” and that Mr.
Cohen “made the deals.” He then misleadingly compared Mr. Cohen’s
actions — a willful violation of campaign finance law — to a civil
infraction incurred by former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.

By December, Mr. Trump’s defense had shifted further: “[I never directed
Michael Cohen to break the
law](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1073205176872435713).”

## Misleading Vagueness and Fanciful Details

The president is known for being unscripted and loose with language, but
he sometimes shows tactical restraint.

After Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court and
in the days before the midterm elections, Mr. Trump told rallygoers [in
Missouri](https://www.c-span.org/video/?453853-1/president-trump-holds-missouri-rally-rush-limbaugh-sean-hannity&start=3234)
that “the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he
never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she
made up the story, it was false accusations.”

The omission of a name and the use of the words “the accuser” may give
the misleading impression that Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to
Congress that Justice Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they
were teenagers, had recanted her account. But in fact, Mr. Trump was
referring to another little-known accuser named Judy Munro-Leighton, who
recanted her claim of sexual assault.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump also regales his audience with elaborate stories. Some — like
his tales of unnamed “strong” or “tough” men, miners or steelworkers
crying and thanking him — may have occurred but are impossible to
verify.

Others, like his frequent attacks on Senator Richard Blumenthal,
Democrat of Connecticut, contain invented details. Not content with just
accurately pointing out that Mr. Blumenthal falsely claimed to have
served in Vietnam, Mr. Trump adds — with no evidence — that Mr.
Blumenthal said he had “[charged up Da
Nang](https://www.c-span.org/video/?452582-1/president-trump-rally-topeka-kansas&start=3080),”
[dodged
bullets](https://www.c-span.org/video/?453851-1/president-trump-campaigns-republicans-indiana&start=698)
and [saved the lives of fellow
soldiers](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4754001/president-trump-criticizes-senator-blumenthal).

## Inventing Straw Men

The usual target of this particular strain of falsehoods is the news
media, which Mr. Trump suggests purposely underestimates or
misinterprets him.

Mr. Trump often lauds [strong job
growth](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ces0000000001?output_view=net_1mth)
under his watch and says that the “fake news” would have deemed such
numbers “impossible” or “ridiculous” during the 2016 campaign. Yet he
neglects to mention that the number of jobs added in the 22 months after
his inauguration — 4.2 million — is lower than the 4.8 million jobs
added in the 22 months before he took office, undermining the premise of
his retrodiction.

In another example, Mr. Trump turned a hypothetical talking point first
into a purported reality and then — after headlines debunking his claim
appeared — into a joke that he implied reporters had failed to grasp.

[At an October rally in
Arizona](https://www.c-span.org/video/?453287-1/president-trump-campaigns-mesa-arizona),
Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for allowing undocumented immigrants to
apply for driver’s licenses. “Next thing you know, they’ll want to buy
’em a car,” he speculated. “Then they’ll say the car’s not good
enough, we want — how about a Rolls-Royce?”

A day later, [at a campaign rally in
Nevada](https://www.c-span.org/video/?453249-1/president-trump-campaigns-nevada-republican-senator-dean-heller),
Mr. Trump presented this theory as reality, telling supporters that
Democrats wanted to give cars and licenses to undocumented immigrants in
addition to free health care and education.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the claim was
[debunked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/democrats-free-cars-immigrants/)
[by news
outlets,](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-democrats-want-give-cars-undocum/)
Mr. Trump responded by ridiculing the news media for mentioning the
Rolls-Royce, which was not the actual subject of the fact checks.

“They said he gets a Pinocchio for that,” Mr. Trump [said to laughter at
a campaign rally in
Mississippi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1318&v=0ri5QQVhJhg),
referring to The Washington Post’s rating system for false claims. “They
got me\!”
