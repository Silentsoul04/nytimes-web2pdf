[Carlos
Ghosn](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/business/carlos-ghosn-france-extradite.html)
was tired. At 64 years old, the chairman of an auto empire that spanned
several continents and included Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi wasn’t
bouncing back from jet lag the way he used to. Melatonin wasn’t working
anymore, and he had bouts of insomnia, phoning his children in the
middle of the night or going on long walks around his Tokyo or Paris
neighborhood. He planned to retire soon, stepping back from spending his
life on an airplane, albeit a luxurious one paid for by
[Nissan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/business/carlos-ghosn-france-extradite.html).

Last month, just before Thanksgiving weekend, [Mr.
Ghosn](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/business/carlos-ghosn-france-extradite.html)
headed to Tokyo to meet his youngest daughter and her boyfriend and
attend a board meeting. He was scheduled to land at Haneda Airport at 4
p.m.

The daughter, Maya Ghosn, 26, had spent most of her childhood in Japan
and wanted to introduce her boyfriend, Patrick, to her favorite places.
Bringing a boyfriend home is a common rite of passage, but a
particularly intimidating prospect when growing up Ghosn — a child of
one of the most romanticized and ruthless chief executives the global
business community has ever seen.

Ms. Ghosn had made a 7:30 dinner reservation at Jiro, the
Michelin-starred sushi counter hidden in a basement in the city’s Ginza
district.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On the tarmac in Beirut, Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn opened WhatsApp and texted
his four children on a group chain labeled “Game of Ghosns,” for his
favorite TV show, “Game of Thrones,” the bloody HBO drama about
dynasties under siege. “On my way to Tokyo\! Love you guys\!” Mr. Ghosn
texted as his jet lifted off.

He never made it to dinner.

On Nov. 19, Japanese prosecutors surrounded Mr. Ghosn’s Gulfstream after
its arrival and arrested him on allegations that for years he had
withheld millions of dollars in income from Nissan’s financial filings.

Ms. Ghosn was staying at her father’s corporate apartment, and when he
didn’t show up she checked with his longtime driver at Nissan, who
assured her his flight had probably been delayed. She texted: “Hey, just
heard your flight got delayed. Please let me know when you land, worried
about you.”

*\[Breaking a silence,* *[Mr. Ghosn’s daughters
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/business/carlos-ghosn-nissan-children.html)*
*they suspected that the charges against him were part of a revolt
within Nissan.\]*

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Exhausted from jet lag, she took a nap. Patrick woke her when he saw a
tweet about Mr. Ghosn’s arrest. “I was in shock,” she said in an
interview.

Minutes later, the doorbell rang. Two Japanese men in black suits
slipped off their shoes to enter the two-bedroom apartment and showed
Ms. Ghosn a brief note in English.

“There is a case against your father,” it read, according to Ms. Ghosn’s
account. “The Tokyo judge has warranted us access to search the house.
We need a witness. Thank you for cooperating.”

Fifteen men, also in suits, followed. They locked the front door, told
Ms. Ghosn that they were prosecutors, warned the couple not to use their
phones and suggested that they might tap the apartment. They rummaged
through Mr. Ghosn’s drawers, studying family photos, Maya’s 10th-grade
report card, personal letters, her parents’ divorce
papers.

“I wanted my dad to know that in this situation I was polite and handled
it maturely, and I didn’t want to give them any reason to feel satisfied
by an ounce of despair in my eyes,” Ms. Ghosn said. “But inside, I was
shaking. I couldn’t stand up. I had to hold the wall.”

Six and a half hours later, at 11:30 p.m., the men left.

Worried that anything they said was being recorded, Ms. Ghosn and her
boyfriend went into the bathroom, climbed into the shower fully clothed,
turned on the water and whispered about what to do next. She called her
siblings to figure out how to tackle Japan’s labyrinthine legal system.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Told by the authorities that she was forbidden to contact her father,
Ms. Ghosn waited at the apartment for nearly two days until an American
lawyer working for her family called.

“We got very clear instructions to leave as soon as possible for fear of
being detained or interrogated to extort my dad,” she said. “So we got
on the first flight out.”

## ‘A Person Who Was Above the Clouds’

Carlos Ghosn wasn’t supposed to succeed in Japan, but he wasn’t supposed
to fail like this. He first made headlines in 1999 when, in a nation
known for its distrust of outsiders, Mr. Ghosn, a brash Brazilian-born
and Lebanese- and French-educated engineer, showed up in sunglasses and
a pinstripe suit with plans to carry out an American-style restructuring
of a failing Nissan. The Japanese carmaker had $35 billion in debt,
provided lifetime employment to a bloated work force and produced a
fleet of the kind of cars you’d dread getting at the rental counter.

Mr. Ghosn, then 45 and a vice president at Renault, had helped oversee a
turnaround at the middling French automaker, which had agreed to spend
$5.4 billion to buy a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan Motors.

John Casesa, then a top auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, advised Mr. Ghosn
to rent a house in Tokyo rather than buy one.

“The widely held consensus was that he would fail, that Nissan wasn’t
worth saving and it couldn’t be done,” Mr. Casesa said.

At the time, Bob Lutz, the loquacious vice chairman of General Motors,
[assessed the deal this
way](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/ghosn-scandal-could-trigger-crises-for-nissan-renault-mitsubishi.html):
Renault would be better off “taking $5 billion, putting it on a barge
and sinking it in the middle of the ocean.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Ghosn, with his severe black eyebrows and puffed chest, was
undeterred. He closed factories, slashed suppliers, laid off 14 percent
of the work force and invested in design. Six years later, Nissan had
surpassed Honda to become Japan’s No. 2 automaker, its market
capitalization had quintupled and its operating margin had risen
tenfold. Altima sedans, Titan pickup trucks and Murano S.U.V.s made
Nissan a major player in the United States market — an achievement that
Wall Street once deemed impossible.

By the early 2000s, Mr. Ghosn was head of the Renault-Nissan alliance
and the first person to simultaneously serve as chief executive of two
Fortune Global 500 companies, the type of chief executive who even if
you didn’t know how to pronounce his name (rhymes with phone), you’d
know his
products.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The enigmatic “gaijin” (as foreigners are called in Japan) had achieved
a status bestowed on only a handful of chief executives, akin, at least
in Japan, to Steve Jobs, Warren E. Buffett or Elon Musk. Paparazzi
swarmed. Fans asked for autographs. Japanese businessmen, eager to
emulate the Nissan chief, inquired where Mr. Ghosn had bought his
rectangular sunglasses and custom suits.

In 2004, Emperor Akihito awarded Mr. Ghosn a Blue Ribbon Medal for his
extraordinary contributions, making him the first foreign business
leader to receive the honor. A manga comic book, “[The True Story of
Carlos
Ghosn](https://www.archynety.com/business/when-carlos-ghosn-was-a-manga-hero/),”
heralded a shadowy hero from a faraway land. Lebanon put Mr. Ghosn’s
face [on a postage
stamp](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/23/business/carlos-ghosn-lebanon-icon/index.html).

But even as many in Nissan celebrated the comeback, others scoffed at
Mr. Ghosn’s celebrity.

From the start, he faced distrust from the Japanese policymaking and
business establishment. The very idea of an outsider’s bringing
free-market capitalism to Japan’s quasi-socialist corporate culture
jabbed at historical wounds.

“When MacArthur came after World War II, the Japanese just surrendered
to his leadership,” a retired Nissan executive [told
Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/can-company-be-saved-167730).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Ghosn pulled on a white jumpsuit to tour factory floors, but beyond
the photo ops, there were signs that his splashy — some would say
autocratic — presence was out of sync with modest Japanese culture. In
2004, Mr. Ghosn grazed a motorbike [while driving a
Porsche](https://www.autonews.com/article/20040209/REG/402090904/nissan-ceo-ghosn-in-accident-driving-porsche)
in the Roppongi area of Tokyo, a haven for moneyed foreigners. (The
couple on the bike had minor injuries.) The Japanese media groused that
Mr. Ghosn wasn’t driving a Nissan.

Then the man whose militant approach to cutting jobs (21,000, if you’re
counting) earned him the nickname “Le Cost Killer” spent more than $200
million for Nissan to be a sponsor of the Rio Olympics in 2016, [casting
himself in the Olympic torch
relay](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/national-post-latest-edition/20160809/282054801421333).
He hopped between homes paid for by Nissan. In 2017, he paid a Lebanese
artist and friend $888,000 to create a statue, “[Wheels of
Innovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCLqEI8VURo),” for the
entrance of Nissan’s Yokohama headquarters. (Having a lavish second
wedding reception in Versailles the same year, with Marie
Antoinette-themed costumes and, [yes, lots of
cake](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/weddings/a9634/versailles-wedding/),
did not help.)

“He was a person who was above the clouds,” said Yuichi Ishino, who
worked in Nissan’s finance department from 2002 to 2005. “No one dared
to say anything that would confront his opinions.”

The stickiest issue was always Mr. Ghosn’s pay.

In Japan, salarymen slave away at the kaisha (or company) with a sense
of communal pride almost as important as the salary. Last year, Mr.
Ghosn [made $16.9
million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nissan-ghosn-compensation-factbox/factbox-how-carlos-ghosns-pay-compares-with-other-top-auto-executives-idUSKCN1NS0P5)
($8.4 million from Renault, $6.5 million from Nissan and $2 million from
Mitsubishi). That’s nearly 11 times what the chairman of Toyota, the
world’s largest carmaker, earns but well below the $21.96 million paid
to Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors.

In 2008, the same year that Japanese law began requiring companies to
disclose directors’ pay in their annual reports, Nissan’s shareholders
voted to set an annual cap of about $27 million on compensation for all
board directors combined.

After that, Mr. Ghosn made the case to the public that he was underpaid
— instructing Nissan to hand out background materials reminding
investors and the news media that he made significantly less than his
counterparts at other global automakers.

At the company’s most [recent annual meeting, in
June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTL7yOit6U0&feature=youtu.be), Mr.
Ghosn stressed to shareholders that the company’s compensation policy
was “designed to reward performance and to attract, promote and retain
the best management talent in the auto industry.” He added that while
Nissan tried to reward senior management “competitively,” the company
remained “financially very disciplined.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked by the Financial Times that same month if he was overpaid, Mr.
Ghosn laughed. “You won’t have any C.E.O. say, ‘I’m overly
compensated,’” [he
said](https://www.ft.com/content/e3acccf2-6e20-11e8-92d3-6c13e5c92914).

Such brazenness rankled employees and the public in Japan.

“Even when a company is a global multinational company, it’s still
stamped by its country of origin and the place where it has its
headquarters,” said Sanford M. Jacoby, a professor of management at the
University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied Japanese
corporate culture. The Japanese, he said, put more weight “on
egalitarian policies of government and pay and other things.”

In France, where the government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault,
shareholders have also taken issue with Mr. Ghosn’s pay. “We believe
that anyone making 240 times more than the minimum pay of his employees
is out of control,” said Pierre-Henri Leroy, the head of Proxinvest, a
French shareholder advisory group.

In October, a whistle-blower inside Nissan said he had evidence that Mr.
Ghosn had been instructing Greg Kelly, a top aide and a board member,
and a small group of confidants at Nissan to effectively create two
salary pots for Mr. Ghosn’s
compensation.

One pot would be paid in the current year and reported in the company’s
annual report and securities filings. Another amount would be designated
to be paid out after Mr. Ghosn left Nissan, according to a person
familiar with Nissan’s internal investigation. The whistle-blower’s
findings were sent to Hiroto Saikawa, the company’s chief executive, and
an internal auditor.

Nissan went to prosecutors with allegations that Mr. Ghosn, working
directly with Mr. Kelly, who was once the head of human resources at
Nissan, had underreported his income from 2009 to 2017, according to a
person with knowledge of the internal investigation. Nissan’s
investigation found that the underreporting had occurred when some of
the compensation, though committed, was deferred and not reported in
securities filings.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nissan also told prosecutors that it had evidence Mr. Ghosn and Mr.
Kelly developed plans to pay Mr. Ghosn a further $124 million in cash
and other financial instruments, some as compensation for a future
advisory position for Mr. Ghosn.

Hari Nada, a Nissan executive and confidant of Mr. Kelly’s, sent a
private jet to fly him from Nashville to Tokyo for the same board
meeting that Mr. Ghosn planned to attend. The two men were arrested
hours apart. Mr. Kelly’s family said Mr. Nada had assured him that he
would be back in Nashville by Thanksgiving, in time for scheduled neck
surgery.

Nissan would not comment about the Kelly family’s statements about Mr.
Nada. Mr. Nada did not answer phone calls seeking comment.

Mr. Kelly was released on Christmas after his family cited his ill
health and posted bail of 70 million yen (about $640,000). His lawyer in
Nashville, Aubrey Harwell Jr., said his client denied wrongdoing. Mr.
Kelly and Mr. Ghosn “had conversations regarding legal ways they could
defer compensation,” Mr. Harwell said.

Mr. Ghosn, Mr. Kelly and Nissan itself all face charges they violated
financial reporting laws. The company’s board removed Mr. Ghosn and Mr.
Kelly as representative directors, positions with power to sign company
documents.

Thirty-two days after Mr. Ghosn’s initial arrest, when his [release on
bail](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/world/asia/carlos-ghosn-bail-japan.html?module=inline)
appeared likely, the Japanese authorities rearrested him on new charges
that he shifted personal losses during the 2008 financial crisis
temporarily onto Nissan’s books. On Monday a court extended his
detention until Jan. 11.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

That Mr. Ghosn may have deceived regulators while enriching himself runs
afoul of cultural norms in Japan, where the public is more likely to
forgive corporate cover-ups when executives appear to be protecting the
company.

“Although you don’t see it written down, there is almost a social
consensus that ‘OK, you did your crime, but you did it for the
company,’” said Seijiro Takeshita, dean and professor at the School
of Management and Information at the University of Shizuoka.

Or as Jesper Koll, who has worked in Japan for decades as an economist
and is head of Japan for WisdomTree investments in Tokyo, said: “The one
thing that Japan does not want and would never tolerate is personal
greed.”

## ‘As the World Ghosns’

Mr. Ghosn’s longtime driver has been out of touch since shortly after
the arrest. The driver told the Ghosn children the day after their
father was detained that the Japanese authorities had found his car in
Tokyo. They tore up the leather seats and found only cat food.

Mr. Ghosn’s chief of staff, Frédérique Le Greves, who arrived in Tokyo
the same day as Mr. Ghosn, has not made any statement and returned to
France after she learned of the arrest, a person close to the Ghosn
family said.

Their silence is one of many plot twists in the corporate saga. A person
close to the family has started to call it “As the World Ghosns.”

Under Japanese law, only Mr. Ghosn’s Japanese lawyer and representatives
from the French, Brazilian and Lebanese Embassies have been allowed to
visit or talk to him.

Mr. Ghosn’s allies view his incarceration, with no foreseeable chance
for bail, as revenge by Nissan (and, by extension, Japan) on a foreign
adversary. He lives in a 16-by-10-foot cell with a tatami mat, a toilet
in a corner and the lights always on, in the same facility that once
housed the [death-row
inmates](https://www.autonews.com/article/20181122/COPY01/311229975/ghosn-said-to-be-held-in-cold-detention-cell-as-misconduct-allegations-are-investigated)
who committed a deadly sarin attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.

The frustration has led a few of Mr. Ghosn’s longtime friends in France
to some extreme and possibly culturally insensitive metaphors. Two of
them compared the meticulously planned surprise arrest to the 1941
attack on Pearl Harbor, which killed 2,400 Americans.

Mr. Ghosn’s children have learned from his visitors that he has lost
weight, at least 20 pounds. Prosecutors question him daily. Several
requests to the jail authorities for a mattress were denied, but a
Lebanese diplomat succeeded in getting him a thin cot and vitamin C
pills.

The books that Mr. Ghosn is reading in jail — including “When Things
Fall Apart,” by Pema Chodron; “Teachings of the Buddha,” by Jack
Kornfield; and “A Little Life,” a dark novel by Hanya Yanagihara — speak
to his state of mind. He has been denied other items, including family
photos, a pen and paper, dental floss (“He is a big flosser,” his
daughter Maya said) and an iPod Nano loaded with music by his favorite,
Phil Collins.

Mr. Ghosn’s defenders, largely in the business community, contend that
he is being treated harshly because he is a foreigner. They claim that
the latest charge, rooted in dealings from 2008, was beyond the statute
of limitations for Japanese citizens. According to Japanese law, the
statute is tied not to citizenship but to how much time the accused has
spent outside Japan.

His defenders also said Japanese executives at Takata and Toshiba, who
were embroiled in serious accounting scandals in 2014 and 2015, didn’t
receive the same harsh treatment or any jail time. (Three executives
from
[Olympus](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/business/global/corporate-japan-rocked-by-scandal-at-olympus.html?module=inline)
were detained for nearly six weeks in 2012 and convicted of accounting
fraud but served no prison time.)

“It seems really strategic. It’s a political fight,” said Ralph Jazzar,
a banker in Paris and Mr. Ghosn’s first cousin. He recited an expression
in French and then translated it: “He who wants to get rid of a great
dog pretends the dog has the plague.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Jazzar and Mr. Ghosn grew up together in a middle-class neighborhood
in Beirut. Mr. Ghosn, who was born in Rio de Janeiro, was 6 when his
Lebanese father moved the family to Beirut.

His sister, Claudine Bichara de Oliveira, said he was fascinated by cars
at an early age. She remembers him lying in the back seat of the family
car, “closing his eyes and guessing the kind of car just by hearing its
horn.”

From Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn went to Paris to attend France’s most
prestigious schools, Lycee Saint-Louis and the Ecole Polytechnique. And
then he worked his way up Michelin.

Whether in Lebanon or France, Mr. Ghosn always assumed the role of the
ambitious outsider. In 1989, he perfected his English and added America
to his résumé, soon becoming the chief executive of Michelin’s North
American operations. Mr. Ghosn moved his young family to Greenville,
S.C. He took a road trip to see the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and Los
Angeles, studying the world’s largest tire market along the way.

If there was any community in which Mr. Ghosn seemed to finally fit, it
was the global elite, a coterie of chief executives and billionaire
philanthropists who have yachts in the south of France and standing
invitations to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (“If
Davos Were a Person, It Would Be Carlos Ghosn” was the headline of a
Bloomberg profile last year.) [Mr. Ghosn’s new wife,
Carole](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/business/carlos-ghosn-escape.html)
Nahas, persuaded him to take ski lessons at age
60.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Ghosn’s unabashed globalism clashed with the current era of
inequality and off-with-their-heads isolationism. In 2015, Emmanuel
Macron, then the French finance minister, criticized Mr. Ghosn, calling
his $8 million salary at Renault “excessive.” Early this year, an
auditor at Nissan began investigating the homes that a company
subsidiary had bought for Mr. Ghosn’s personal use, according to a
person with knowledge of the investigation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an internal investigation, Nissan learned that a subsidiary set up in
the Netherlands ostensibly to fund venture capital investments had been
used to buy or rent corporate properties that Mr. Ghosn lived in when he
traveled, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Nissan
had invested 73 million euros (currently equivalent to about $83
million) in the venture, known as Zi-A, and Mr. Kelly was put in charge
of it.

In addition to a 5,400-square-foot flat in Paris’s elegant 16th
arrondissement, Zi-A bought an apartment in Rio in 2011 for $6 million.
(The Ghosn family planned to spend Christmas there this year with his
ailing mother.) In Beirut, there is a salmon-hued mansion on a
tree-lined street that Zi-A paid $8.75 million for in 2012, followed by
$6 million in renovations and furnishings, according to a person briefed
on Nissan’s investigation.

Mr. Ghosn’s family said Nissan had known about the homes. “Over 19
years, the company put these things in place to maximize his
productivity,” his eldest child, Caroline Ghosn, 31, said in an
interview.

Mr. Ghosn hasn’t been charged with any illegal activity related to his
corporate residences. Caroline Ghosn said media accounts about the homes
were part of Nissan’s and Japanese prosecutors’ efforts to “muddy the
waters” in a public-relations campaign against her father.

Nissan declined to comment, but a person familiar with its investigation
said the fact that the Dutch subsidiary was buying homes rather than
paying for car-related start-ups was among the red flags for internal
auditors. The person also pointed out that Nissan did not have
substantial operations in Beirut, the location of one of the disputed
homes.

## ‘What Have You Done for Us Lately?’

“Do not take this as a coup d’état,” Mr. Saikawa, the current chief
executive of Nissan, whom Mr. Ghosn had mentored, told reporters hours
after the arrest.

Mr. Saikawa said he felt “strong anger and despair” over Nissan’s
findings, but analysts and investors closely watching the company
believed that complicated interpersonal dynamics were at play.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Critics inside and outside Nissan had started to question whether Mr.
Ghosn’s star had faded. In recent years, sales had slowed. The
miraculous turnaround he orchestrated started to stall. One former
executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, summed up the new
sentiment spreading inside the company as “What have you done for us
lately?”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Midway through a plan known as Power 88, which Mr. Ghosn unveiled to
much fanfare in 2011, it became clear that Nissan would fall short of
the ambitious targets he had set. He wanted Nissan to reach 8 percent
profit margins and 8 percent market share in the countries where it
operated. Dealers complained that they were losing money and that Mr.
Ghosn’s big incentives to buyers to meet his targets were eating into
their margins. They also grumbled that Nissan was selling too many
vehicles to rental companies that then would flood the secondary buyers’
market.

“They would sell cars in any manner and in any way without any regard
for what the long-term implications were,” said Steve Kalafer, chief
executive of a chain of auto dealerships in New Jersey. After 36 years
of owning a Nissan dealership, Mr. Kalafer said, he sold it two years
ago because he objected to Mr. Ghosn’s policies.

Mr. Ghosn’s daughters said that in the past few years he had started on
a succession plan to help cement his legacy and plan for his retirement.
Mr. Ghosn explored what he called a “reimagining of the alliance” that
would permanently bind Nissan and Renault. And he picked Mr. Saikawa,
his close confidant, to succeed him as chief executive.

“He is like Carlos Ghosn in many ways,” Patrick le Quément, a former
head of design at Renault, said of Mr. Saikawa. “Not much feeling.”

But as Mr. Ghosn sought to integrate Nissan’s operations more closely
with Renault, maybe connecting them permanently, the relationship was
getting shaky. Some Nissan executives, engineers and marketing staff
began to resent what they saw as Renault’s unfairly piggybacking on
Nissan’s technology, research and brand strength, according to three
former managerial employees.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The French saw things another way, accusing Mr. Ghosn of favoring the
Japanese and Nissan and blocking Renault’s expansion into China, the
world’s largest car market, to clear the field for Nissan.

“We felt he was escaping us,” Mr. le Quément said. “A lot of decisions
were being taken that were to the detriment of Renault.”

Asked about merger discussions, a Nissan spokesman, Nicholas Maxfield,
said, “It is true that the ‘Alliance 2022’ six-year plan [announced last
year](https://www.alliance-2022.com/news/alliance-2022-announcement/)
calls for additional synergies and further convergence among member
companies in specific operational areas.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As tensions grew, Mr. Ghosn mused about getting out. On his long walks
around Tokyo when he couldn’t sleep, he would pass an old man playing
the shakuhachi, an end-blown bamboo flute that dates to seventh-century
Japan. Mr. Ghosn told his children that in retirement he hoped to learn
how to play it. A Byzantine Empire buff, he said he also might write
history books or lecture M.B.A. students.

Then late in 2017, speculation spread that Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Saikawa’s
relationship had become strained after Nissan faced accusations that it
had been using uncertified technicians for vehicle inspections, leading
to a recall and [halts in
production](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/business/nissan-japan-suspends-production.html).
Mr. Ghosn left Mr. Saikawa to take the blame. As the new chief executive
offered a deeply apologetic bow, as is customary in Japan, and told a
voracious news media that the carmaker had “done something inexcusable,”
Mr. Ghosn was nowhere to be seen.

Caroline and Maya Ghosn used to joke that Nissan was the “very demanding
fifth child” in their family. To them, Mr. Saikawa’s statements (without
an apologetic bow) the night of their father’s arrest were proof that
his fall was akin to a palace coup.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What doesn’t make sense to Mr. Ghosn’s friends and family is how the man
with a preternatural talent for seeing around every corner — whether
maneuvering through Japanese bureaucracy, managing French ministers or
designing a midsize S.U.V. — didn’t see this coming. Maybe, they
theorized, it was the jet lag and the 100 days a year he spent on an
airplane, and that old man with the flute whom he saw himself becoming.

Mr. Jazzar, his cousin, said Mr. Ghosn had failed, in the end, at the
“P.Y.A.” approach to management: Protect Your Ass.

“God only knows what is going on inside his head,” Mr. Jazzar said.
