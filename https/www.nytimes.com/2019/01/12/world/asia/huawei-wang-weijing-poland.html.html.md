BEIJING — The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has fired an
employee who was [arrested in
Poland](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/europe/poland-china-huawei-spy.html)
on charges of spying for the Chinese government, saying in a statement
late Saturday that the worker had brought “disrepute” to the company.

Huawei said that the alleged actions that the employee, Wang Weijing,
had been accused of had nothing to do with the company.

“In accordance with the terms and conditions of Huawei’s labor contract,
we have made this decision because the incident in question has brought
Huawei into disrepute,” a company spokesman, Joe Kelly, said.

The Polish authorities announced the arrests of Mr. Wang and a Polish
telecommunications worker on Friday. That move came at a time of
[growing concern among the United States and its
allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/technology/huawei-arrest-meng-wanzhou.html)
about Chinese technology suppliers, and after the December arrest in
Canada of Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the
company’s founder.

Huawei’s equipment is used in mobile phone and internet networks around
the world. But American officials have for years considered the company
to be vulnerable to efforts by Beijing to spy on Americans or sabotage
their communication systems.

Huawei denies that it operates as an extension of Beijing. Still, as the
company has grown to become the world’s top supplier of
telecommunications gear, the United States government has worked to
discourage American mobile carriers and consumers from buying its
equipment. Washington has shared its security concerns with allied
governments in Europe and elsewhere.

On Dec. 1, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested
in Canada at the request of the United States. American investigators
have accused her of [deceiving financial
institutions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/huawei-meng-hsbc-canada.html)
about Huawei’s business in Iran, causing them to inadvertently violate
United States sanctions. The Canadian legal authorities have not yet
decided whether Ms. Meng will be extradited to the United States.

Diplomatic tensions between China and Canada jumped after Ms. Meng’s
arrest, with Beijing detaining several Canadians in what were seen as
tit-for-tat arrests.[Among those still being held in
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/world/canada/china-detained-spavor-kovrig.html)
are Michael Kovrig, an experienced diplomat and Sinophile who had spent
years investigating sensitive subjects like the human rights of minority
groups in China; and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur with high-level
contacts in North Korea.

The second person arrested by the Polish authorities this past week was
an employee of Orange, the French telecommunications company. Orange’s
office was raided, and the employee’s belongings were seized. Polish
officials did not offer more details about what the two men were accused
of, but said that they would be held for three months while the
investigation continued.

Poland is Huawei’s headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe and the
Nordic region.

A LinkedIn profile for Mr. Wang showed he has been employed by Huawei’s
Polish division since 2011 and previously served as attaché to the
Chinese general consul in Gdansk from 2006 to 2011, according to
Reuters.

Europe has been an important market for Huawei. Largely shut out of the
United States, the company has found many eager customers in Europe,
[both for its
smartphones](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/china-smartphones-iphone.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fraymond-zhong&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=collection)
and for its telecommunications equipment.

As cellular providers around the world prepare to build networks using
fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology, Huawei has tested new
equipment with a number of major European carriers.
