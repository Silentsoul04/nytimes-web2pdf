LONDON — The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was dealt another
blow on Friday when one of the world’s largest wireless carriers
suspended its purchases from the company in Europe over security
concerns about its ties to the Chinese government.

Vodafone Group, which is based in London, said it would temporarily stop
buying Huawei equipment for core parts of its next-generation wireless
networks, [known
as 5G](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/personaltech/5g-what-you-need-to-know.html?module=inline).
Nick Read, Vodafone’s chief executive officer, said the pause was
necessary while European governments considered whether to ban the use
of Huawei equipment.

Mr. Read said Vodafone’s decision reflected political factors rather
than any newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Huawei has been
dogged by a campaign led by United States officials, who have argued
that Beijing could use the company’s gear for spying.

“The noise level is at an unhealthy level across Europe,” Mr. Read said
during a conference call with reporters.

Europe has become a key battleground for Huawei, the world’s largest
supplier of telecommunications equipment. The region is the company’s
second-largest market after China, largely because of lucrative
partnerships with carriers that, in addition to Vodafone, include BT
Group, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica. In contrast to its strained
relationship with the United States, Huawei has also enjoyed strong ties
to European governments, thanks in part to [investments
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/technology/huawei-europe-china.html)
has made throughout the region.

The United States has [pressured its European
allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/technology/huawei-arrest-meng-wanzhou.html)
to increase their scrutiny of Huawei. The American authorities have
cited moves by President Xi Jinping of China to take more control of the
country’s economy and the enactment of laws that could require network
operators to defend Chinese national security interests.

Last month, [Canada detained a Huawei
executive](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/huawei-cfo-arrest-canada-extradition.html),
Meng Wanzhou, a daughter of the company’s founder, at the request of the
United States on charges that she participated [in a scheme to violate
sanctions against
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/technology/huawei-meng-wanzhou-fraud.html).
Federal prosecutors in Seattle are also investigating Huawei over
allegations of [intellectual property
theft](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/huawei-investigation-trade-secrets.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fraymond-zhong&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=inline&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection).

Suspicions about Huawei have led countries like Britain, France and
Germany to re-evaluate their relationships with the company. [A Huawei
employee was arrested and charged with espionage in Poland this
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/europe/poland-china-huawei-spy.html).
(The company [fired the
employee](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/world/asia/huawei-wang-weijing-poland.html)
shortly after he was arrested.)

Vodafone’s announcement followed one last month by BT to remove Huawei
gear from parts of its network. Deutsche Telekom has also said it is
re-evaluating its relationship with suppliers to account for the growing
security concerns.

Getting boxed out of the 5G market in Europe would be painful for
Huawei. Wireless companies in the region plan to spend billions of
dollars to upgrade their networks to 5G, a potential windfall for
suppliers of equipment for the underlying infrastructure.

Huawei said Vodafone’s move affected only a small amount of equipment.

“Vodafone and Huawei are long-term strategic partners that have worked
together since 2007,” Huawei said in a statement. “We are grateful to
Vodafone for its support of Huawei, and we will endeavor to live up to
the trust placed in us.”

Vodafone said its decision would be limited to equipment at the core of
its network that handles much of the sensitive data related to calls and
internet traffic. The company will continue to rely on Huawei for
ancillary gear like cellular antennas.

Mr. Read called Huawei a “strong partner” and expressed frustration
about the debate over the possible security threat it posed. “I don’t
think everyone is being clear enough and being fact based,” he said. He
added that Vodafone would continue to use Huawei as it hadin other
markets, including Africa.

He also warned that if regulators imposed a broad ban on Huawei that
affected antennas and other equipment, it would delay the introduction
of the faster networks in Europe. Such a move, he said, “would have
significant financial costs, have significant customer disruption and
would ultimately be delaying the 5G launch in many countries.”
