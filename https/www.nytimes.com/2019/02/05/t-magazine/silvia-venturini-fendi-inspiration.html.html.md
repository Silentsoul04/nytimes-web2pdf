“I always say that I was born into a very special yet very peculiar
family,” says Silvia Venturini Fendi, whose official involvement with
the storied Italian fashion house her grandparents founded in 1925 began
at age 6, when she appeared in a Fendi ad wearing a beaver bomber jacket
and matching hat. “I didn’t quite understand what my family did for a
living, but I knew I just had to be a part of it.” It was Venturini
Fendi’s mother and four aunts who hired [Karl
Lagerfeld](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/t-magazine/karl-lagerfeld-interview.html)
as creative director in 1965 and turned the company, which got its start
selling umbrellas and leather trunks out of a small *pellicceria* (or
fur shop) on Rome’s Via del Plebiscito, into an international force.
Lagerfeld scribbled a sketch of the iconic (and once again ubiquitous)
logo of double F’s upon his arrival, and added women’s ready-to-wear
just over a decade later. To Venturini Fendi, Lagerfeld has been a
lifelong mentor.

When she was in her early 20s — after stints answering phones,
gift-wrapping and picking up stray sewing pins off the atelier floors
with a magnet — Venturini Fendi decided to try her own hand at
designing. Her biggest coup came in 1997, when she created the Baguette,
an oblong, short-strapped pochette meant to be tucked just under the
shoulder. The “it” bag of the ’90s, with more than 1,000 iterations made
with everything from embroidered silk to mosaiclike beadwork, it
reappeared on the runway last fall. “I had been seeing all the cool kids
posting their mothers’ Baguettes on Instagram,” explains Venturini
Fendi, who since 2000 has overseen the brand’s men’s wear, an eccentric
mix of graphic street styles and more traditional Italian tailoring that
exuberantly plays with expectations. That distressed denim shirt? It’s
actually bonded leather. Those crocodile panels on a biker jacket? Turns
out they’re neoprene. This element of surprise extends to the Rome-based
designer’s larger ideas about masculinity, too: “I like to accentuate a
man’s more vulnerable sides,” she says. “And to create elusive things
that always leave you wanting to know more.”

“That’s me. The portrait was taken in October near our Fendi
headquarters, which is in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome, a
de Chirico-like marble building commissioned by Mussolini in 1943. I
hate seeing pictures of myself, but I like what I’m wearing: a caramel
coat with Fendi’s Zucca logo on the collar and a super-geometric silk
shirt from my recent men’s collection.”

Vascellari](http://www.nicovascellari.com/) in the entrance of my home,
a very old house in the center of Rome that once belonged to my
grandmother Adele. Nico is my daughter [Delfina
Delettrez](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/t-magazine/fashion/delfina-delettrez-fendis-whimsical-jewelry-and-many-inspirations.html)’s
partner and shares my strange sense of humor, which you see in his
cheeky anagrams like this one, called “Dream Merda.” When I come home at
night, the hall is always illuminated bright red, which makes me feel as
though I’ve entered another dimension.”

Amsterdam-based studio
[Formafantasma](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/t-magazine/design/studio-formafantasma-andrea-trimarchi-simone-farresin.html).
It incorporates pig and cow bladders — the designers make use of waste
from the food industry. It’s poetic but also primitive and strong, which
is very Fendi.”

Delfina, who’s a jewelry designer, all the time. Though I’m partial, I
think she’s so imaginative. The brilliance of the piece is that it’s
totally flexible, so it moves whenever you move, almost like an actual
beetle. Even its little legs come alive. I like to dress like a nun, but
when I pin it on a simple black shirt, it becomes the conversation of
the evening.”

*Right:* “Here is the entire Fendi family in 1989 at a traditional Roman
trattoria. Obviously, there are a lot of us — you can see my mother, my
aunts, my sisters. I’m in the back, on the right, with Delfina on my
lap. We have big lunches and dinners like this all the time, so we can
talk about work ideas in an informal way. There’s nothing more Italian
than sitting around a table eating pasta.”

show](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2018/09/20/fashion/runway-womens/fendi-spring-2019.html)
drew on anagrams — ‘Fendi’ became ‘Fiend’ and ‘Roma’ became ‘Amor’ —
alchemical symbols and the dual realms of hell and paradise. It was also
about elevating street wear. This white guayabera shirt looks like a
simple cotton, but it’s actually a fantastic suede, while the intarsia
of colorful stripes is made of leather. I like things that appear a
certain way but are entirely different when you touch them. Like little
magic tricks.”

*Right:* “Karl Lagerfeld took this Polaroid of me in the late ’70s at
his house in Monte Carlo. Everything was Memphis-style (he was an early
adopter), including the boxing ring where we are having tea before going
to dinner at the Hôtel de Paris. Though I was still a wild party girl at
the time, I’d just started working for the brand and was in Monaco for
the weekend to pick up Karl’s sketches for a new collection. Things took
so much longer before email, but they were much more personal.”

image of Wall Street summer interns eating lunch in the late ’80s. The
collection was about pairing street wear and tailoring, as in wearing a
business shirt and tie on top with Bermuda shorts below. I call that
‘the Skype look.’”

everyone in Havana goes for ice cream — the ’60s-era structure was built
around nature, with lush jungle greens juxtaposed against the clean
modern lines. Being a Roman, I need to have my gelato.”

*Center:* “This 2000 edition of the Baguette was made with the [Lisio
Foundation](https://www.fondazionelisio.org/en/), which manufactures
fabrics on looms from the 19th century. The chestnut and grape brocade
was done by hand — the artisans could only do about 15 centimeters’
worth a day. The buckle is real gold, but this bag isn’t bling-bling —
it’s more of a museum piece.”

[Design
Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/arts/design-miami-2018-art-basel-.html)
for 10 years now and, in 2016, teamed up with the architect and
furniture designer [Cristina Celestino](http://cristinacelestino.com/),
who made cocktail tables topped with graphic Roman travertine, red
Lepanto marble and onyx. The best thing about them is their satin brass
bases, shaped to resemble the backs of giant studded earrings.”
