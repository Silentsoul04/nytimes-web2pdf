# Parkland Shooting: Where Gun Control and School Safety Stand Today

</div>

The Parkland students became a force for gun control legislation and
boosted the youth vote. Here’s how they changed America’s response to
mass shootings.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Feb. 14, 2018, a former student slaughtered 17 people at Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

The next day, David Hogg, a student who survived the attack, [expressed
his
frustration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/david-hogg-florida-shooting.html)
at the pattern of political inaction that seems to follow mass shootings
in the United States. He was not surprised that there had been another
school shooting, he said, and that fact alone “says so much about the
current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.”

“We need to do something,” he said. In the course of the next year,
students would change the way the nation handles mass shootings,
spurring new gun legislation and school safety measures, and holding to
account the adults they felt had failed them.

Here’s a look at where they made those changes happen, and where they
were disappointed.

## The Students Take the Lead

With Parkland, it was the students who set the agenda. Their [openness
about their
pain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/florida-shooting-parkland-students.html)
made them formidable leaders of the movement for gun control, and their
displays of [strength and utter
grief](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/parkland-shooting-yearbook.html)
struck a chord with a nation numbed by repeated acts of violence.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the weeks after the shooting, busloads of Stoneman Douglas students
took their case [to the Florida
capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/us/parkland-students-shooting-florida.html)
and [to
Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/us/parkland-students-shooting-florida.html).
With a rallying cry of “Never Again,” they gathered support from other
[young
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/columbine-mass-shootings.html)
and activists, and their [March for Our
Lives](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/students-lead-huge-rallies-for-gun-control-across-the-us.html)
campaign spurred huge rallies and hundreds of protests, including a
nationwide [school
walkout](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/school-walkout.html). The
students’ pleas reached the [White
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shooting.html),
imploring President Trump to better protect schools and limit access to
guns.

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The protests calling for stricter
gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the
momentum they have gained makes them stand
out.</span>](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/27/autossell/27video/AP_18053052510952-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the movement brought youth activism to a new age — finding [global
power in social
media](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/us/parkland-students-social-media.html)
and pushing public officials to [acknowledge their
accountability](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/arts/television/school-shooting-town-hall-cnn.html).

*\[Read how the Parkland massacre has* [*changed the lives of the
survivors*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/parkland-anniversary-marjory-stoneman-douglas.html)
*in their own words.\]*

Three months after the massacre in Parkland, 10 people were killed in
yet another school shooting, this one in [Santa Fe,
Tex](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/us/santa-fe-shooting-students-parkland.html).,
compounding the Stoneman Douglas students’ [outrage and
resolve](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/santa-fe-parkland-shooting.html),
and placing them in a new role: consoling those who were suffering as
they were. “Something about Parkland has been different,” said [Melissa
Strassner](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/mass-shooting-survivors-march-lives-.html),
a survivor of the Columbine school shooting in 1999. “They truly have
inspired a nation.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## The Adults Are Held to Account

Stoneman Douglas students and parents were outraged by what they viewed
as gross incompetence on the part of school and law enforcement
officials. Video showed that a sheriff’s deputy assigned to the school
[did not enter the
building](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/nikolas-cruz-florida-shooting.html)
as the attack unfolded. Seven other deputies remained outside as
gunshots rang out, a [state
commission](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/parkland-shooting-florida-commission-report.html)
found. And another officer [prevented paramedics from
entering](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/us/parkland-shooting-paramedic-police-response.html).

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Surveillance video showed the only
armed sheriff’s deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in
Parkland, Fla., remaining outside during the massacre on Feb. 14,

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The school district also appeared to have missed [several warning
signs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/nikolas-cruz-baker-act.html)
about the former student charged in the massacre, Nikolas Cruz. The
parents of two 14-year-old students who were killed [decided to run for
the school
board](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/us/parkland-parents-school-board.html)
to fix what they thought went wrong. One of them
[won](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/us/parkland-school-board-election.html).

And in January, Florida’s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis,
[suspended Sheriff Scott
Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/parkland-shooting-desantis-scott-israel.html)
for his “neglect of duty” and “incompetence.” Mr. Israel, who is a
Democrat and a vocal opponent of the National Rifle Association,
continues to insist that the criticism of him is politically motivated
and that “there was no wrongdoing on my part.” Multiple deputies have
also been suspended, and one ultimately resigned.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## A New Focus on Mental Health and Red Flag Laws

In the case of Mr. Cruz, the warning signs were many. There were the
boasts about killing animals, the
[expulsion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/us/nikolas-cruz-florida-shooting.html),
the stalking of a female classmate, the [repeated
calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/nikolas-cruz-florida-shooting.html)
from his mother to the police. School counselors and a sheriff’s deputy
[decided at one point that he should be forcibly
committed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/nikolas-cruz-baker-act.html)
for psychiatric evaluation, only to apparently change their minds the
next day. Multiple tips to the F.B.I. were [left
uninvestigated](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/fbi-nikolas-cruz-shooting.html)
— one [woman told the bureau’s tip
line](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/fbi-tip-nikolas-cruz.html)
she was worried about Mr. Cruz going “into a school and just shooting
the place up.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At that time, there was no law in Florida that would have prevented Mr.
Cruz from buying a gun or would have allowed the police to take away his
weapon. A [gun control
bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/florida-gun-bill.html) the
state passed in March now allows law enforcement — with judicial
approval — to bar a person deemed dangerous from owning guns for up to a
year. Florida courts granted more than 1,000 such orders in the first
nine months after the law took effect, according to [The Associated
Press](http://www.newser.com/article/206dca91a0e845269f3b3838df1b6c40/gun-seizure-laws-grow-in-popularity-since-parkland-shooting.html).
Eight other states have [passed similar “red flag”
laws](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/14/us/politics/gun-control-laws.html)
in the last year, bringing the total with such laws to 14. Several more
states are expected to take up measures in 2019.

## Gun Control Proves Harder at the National Level

[State
legislatures](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/14/us/politics/gun-control-laws.html),
both Republican- and Democratic-controlled, passed 76 gun control laws
in the past year — from bans on bump stocks and caps on magazine sizes
to new minimum-age requirements and expanded background checks. Among
the victories for gun control advocates was an omnibus bill in
[Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/us/florida-shooting-gunman-indicted.html)
that raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm in the state to 21 and
extended the waiting period to three days. In all, more than half the
states passed at least one gun control measure in 2018, with
[Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/washington-state-new-gun-law.html)
and [New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/nyregion/gun-laws-new-york.html)
joining the trend in 2019.

At the same time, there were significantly fewer new state laws
expanding gun rights in 2018 than the year before, according to an
[end-of-year
report](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Giffords-Law-Center-Year-End-Trendwatch-2018_Digital-Spreads.pdf)
by the national advocacy group Giffords. Data provided by the N.R.A.
also indicated that the number of enacted gun control measures
outnumbered pro-gun measures for the first time in at least six years.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But at the federal level, any momentum for change was quickly stymied by
[partisan
gridlock](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/congress-inaction-guns.html).
Republican leaders in Congress [remained
silent](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/politics/gun-control-congress-governors.html)
as their Democratic colleagues called, once again, for changes in the
wake of a mass shooting. The White House [flip-flopped on
promises](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/us/politics/trump-gun-control-national-rifle-association.html)
to raise the minimum age to purchase rifles and to enforce universal
background checks. And the N.R.A. [pressed
lawmakers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/us/politics/nra-gun-control-florida.html),
[including the
president](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/us/politics/trump-republicans-gun-control.html),
to give priority to the interests of gun owners.

*\[Nearly 1,200 children have been killed by gun violence since the
shooting in Parkland.* [*Read how teenage journalists told their
stories.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/parkland-obituaries-students.html)*\]*

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the end, the only significant national change was a [ban on bump
stocks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/trump-bump-stocks-ban.html)
— which members of both parties had been calling for since the [Las
Vegas
shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/02/us/vegas-guns.html)
in October 2017.

The House of Representatives, where Democrats took power in January, has
now made [gun safety a
priority](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/house-democrats-gun-control.html),
and the Judiciary Committee passed two gun-control bills on Wednesday
that would strengthen background checks and close a loophole that
allowed Dylann S. Roof to buy a gun that he used in the Charleston
church massacre in 2015.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>But
with a Republican Senate and president, the chances of either measure
moving beyond the House are virtually nil.

## Arming Teachers, and Other Approaches to School Security

In the days after Parkland, a [flood of threats and false
alarms](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/threats-schools-shootings.html)
heightened the focus on school security nationwide. Schools have turned
to an array of measures: hiring [armed
guards](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/guns-in-schools.html),
requiring students to carry [clear
backpacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/us/florida-school-shooting-clear-backpacks.html),
arming teachers with [baseball
bats](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/erie-bats-school-shooting.html).
Some campuses have added more [cameras and metal
detectors](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/us/back-to-school-security-guns.html)
or hired companies to [monitor students’ social
media](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/social-media-monitoring-school-shootings.html)
for potential threats — all of which has created a [lucrative
market](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/business/school-security-industry-surges-after-shootings.html)
for school security.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president voiced support in the days after Parkland for [arming
teachers with
guns](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shootings.html)
as a way to prevent further massacres. It was an early indicator of the
tack that he and congressional Republicans would take in [addressing the
shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/congress-school-safety-gun-control-house-vote.html).
In March, Mr. Trump [announced the creation of a federal
commission](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/us/politics/trump-guns-school-training.html)
to examine school safety proposals, including raising the minimum age
for buying certain firearms. But two months later, Education Secretary
Betsy DeVos [informed a Senate
committee](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/us/politics/devos-guns-school-safety-commission.html)
that the commission would not look at the role guns play in school
violence. Its final report played down the role of guns, and advised
schools to improve mental health services and train school personnel to
use firearms.

## From Protests to the Polls

When it became clear that Congress would not act on guns, the Parkland
students turned their attention to [rallying young voters and increasing
turnout](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/march-for-our-lives-gun-control.html)
in the midterm elections in November.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Madison Leal, a student at Stoneman Douglas, said in March about
politicians who would not take action: “I’m going to vote them out of
office. And so is my entire generation. And they’ll be sorry then.”

In the summer, a [busload of students traveled the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/us/politics/parkland-students-voting.html)
on a Road to Change tour aimed at registering young voters. In tandem
with various voter groups and celebrities promoting registration, the
Parkland students helped [spike record numbers for young voter
registration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/politics/young-voters-registration-parkland.html),
registering thousands of voters at their rallies. The March for Our
Lives campaign reported a [10 percent increase in youth
turnout](https://marchforourlives.com/) in 2018, compared with the
previous midterm elections in 2014.

[Two dozen pro-gun candidates were
defeated](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/elections-gun-control-florida.html)
in contests for House seats, though 88 of the 129 candidates backed by
the N.R.A. did win. Gun control featured prominently as an issue in the
midterms, and underdog candidates like Lucy McBath of Georgia, Jason
Crow of Colorado and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia [won seats in the
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/gun-control-california-shooting.html)
after campaigning strongly for gun control measures.

One thing was clear from the midterms: Young voters were energized. The
results of that may continue to be felt in the years and decades to
come.
