\emph{UPDATE: This article was updated November 20.} When
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/sports/football/nfl-protest-colin-kaepernick-activism.html}{Colin
Kaepernick} sat during the national anthem at an N.F.L. preseason game
in 2016, it began a controversy that would involve dozens of players and
owners, athletes in other sports and politicians, including the
president of the United States.

His gesture has led to two and a half years of protests, formal
grievances and vigorous denunciations.

In the latest twist,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout.html}{the
N.F.L. organized a workout} so Kaepernick could show teams how his
skills have held up, only to have Kaepernick
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout.html}{abruptly
move} its location amid a dispute.

Kaepernick hasn't played since New Year's Day, 2017.

A timeline:

Kaepernick, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-49ers-stand.html}{remains
seated during the national anthem} for a home preseason game.

``I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that
oppresses black people and people of color,'' he tells
\href{http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-protest-of-national-anthem}{NFL
Media}.

Kaepernick had been outspoken about issues like protests by white
supremacists and police shootings of unarmed black men.

``If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I
stood up for what is right,'' he says.

The league initially responds by saying, ``Players are encouraged but
not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem.''

Kaepernick's act draws praise and criticism. Drew Brees, the quarterback
of the New Orleans Saints,
\href{http://www.espn.com/blog/new-orleans-saints/post/_/id/23063/drew-brees-wholeheartedly-disagrees-with-colin-kaepernicks-method-of-protest}{tells
ESPN}: ``He can speak out about a very important issue. But there's
plenty of other ways that you can do that in a peaceful manner that
doesn't involve being disrespectful to the American
flag.''\textbackslash{}

Kaepernick
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-kneels-national-anthem-protest.html}{kneels
for the anthem} in a preseason game in San Diego, instead of sitting,
and is joined by a teammate, Eric Reid. He also announces he will donate
\$1 million to charitable organizations.

``Once again, I'm not anti-American,'' Kaepernick says. ``I love
America. I love people. That's why I'm doing this. I want to help make
America better.''

Kaepernick is booed throughout the game by the home Chargers fans.

President Barack Obama
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/sports/obama-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem.html}{defends
Kaepernick}, saying, ``I think he cares about some real, legitimate
issues that have to be talked about.''

Two days later, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L.,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-nfl-roger-goodell.html}{is
more equivocal}. Referring to Kaepernick, he
\href{https://pro32.ap.org/article/goodell-doesnt-agree-kaepernicks-actions}{tells
The Associated Press}, ``I don't necessarily agree with what he's
doing.''

``I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we
don't live in a perfect society,'' he adds. ``On the other hand, we
believe very strongly in patriotism in the N.F.L. I personally believe
very strongly in that.''

In Week 1 of the regular season, several
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/sports/colin-kaepernick-athlete-protests.html}{more
players kneel or raise a fist}during the anthem. Four days later, Megan

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/sports/soccer/megan-rapinoe-in-an-american-uniform-kneels-for-the-anthem.html}{kneels

next month,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/national-anthem-protests-high-schools.html}{some
high school} players.

Kaepernick protests throughout the N.F.L. season. He winds up starting
11 games, and the 49ers finish 2-14. Though the team is bad,
Kaepernick's adjusted yards per pass figure is a respectable 7.2. He has
not played since.

\hypertarget{march-2017}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{March

Kaepernick
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/sports/football/free-agent-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest.html}{opts
out of his contract}, hoping for a better situation. But no offers come,
though very average quarterbacks like Mark Sanchez, Mike Glennon, Josh
McCown and E.J. Manuel find jobs.

Many suggest Kaepernick is being blackballed.

The preseason begins with Kaepernick still unsigned.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/sports/football/malcolm-jenkins-chris-long-eagles-anthem-protest.html}{Anthem
protests continue}, in part prompted by deadly violence in
Charlottesville, Va. ``The national anthem is a special moment to me,''
Goodell says. ``It's a point of pride. That is a really important
moment. But we also have to understand the other side that people do
have rights and we want to respect those.''

Anthem protests
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/sports/trump-national-anthem-nfl.html}{reach
their peak} after President Trump says those players who do not stand
for the anthem should be fired. Many players skip the national anthem
altogether. Dozens of others kneel or lock arms on the sideline, joined,
in some cases, by team owners.

Protests continue through the season, and Trump continues to fault the
league for not disciplining players.

Kaepernick, still unsigned,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/sports/colin-kaepernick-nfl-collusion.html}{files
a grievance} against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to
keep him out of the league.

\hypertarget{april-25-2018}{%

N.F.L. owners, players and league executives meet to discuss the
protests. An audio recording
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/sports/nfl-owners-kaepernick.html}{obtained
by The New York Times} reveals that players are aggrieved that
Kaepernick has not found a job. Owners are intent on finding a way to
avoid Trump's continued criticism and say that large numbers of fans and
sponsors have become angry about the protests.

\hypertarget{may-2-2018}{%

Reid, one of the players at the N.F.L. meeting,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/sports/football/eric-reid-grievance.html}{files
a grievance} against the N.F.L., saying the league has blackballed him.
He is joined by the players' union. (Reid is signed by Carolina in late
September and plays in 13 games.)

N.F.L. owners
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/sports/nfl-anthem-kneeling.html}{rule
that players can no longer kneel} during the national anthem without
leaving themselves open to punishment. But the league also says athletes
can stay in the locker room while it is being performed.

Trump says that he is pleased with the N.F.L.'s new policy, but that he
does not think the players should be staying in the locker room in
protest. If a player is not standing for the national anthem, Trump
says, ``maybe you shouldn't be in the country.''

In July, the union files a grievance over the policy.

condemnation.

The N.F.L. reaches settlements with Kaepernick and Reid in their
grievance cases. Terms of the settlements are not disclosed, and the
players and the league reach a confidentiality agreement.

\hypertarget{march-22-2019}{%

News emerges that the settlement with Kaepernick and Reid is for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/sports/colin-kaepernick-nfl-settlement.html}{much
less than \$10 million}, two people with knowledge of the agreement told
The Times. Much of the settlement would go to cover lawyers' fees.

plans} to produce a sneaker with a 13-star flag, a design known as the
Betsy Ross flag. Kaepernick had privately criticized the design to Nike
because the flag had been co-opted by racist groups.
