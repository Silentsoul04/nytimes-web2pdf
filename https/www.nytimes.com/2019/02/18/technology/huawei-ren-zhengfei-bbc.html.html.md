# Huawei Founder Slams U.S. Charges as ‘Politically Motivated’

Ren Zhengfei had previously avoided passing judgment on the case, citing
respect for the legal process. Now he appears to be sharpening his
language.

BEIJING — Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the Chinese technology giant
Huawei, has accused the United States of having political motivations in
leveling criminal charges against the company and his daughter, a top
Huawei executive.

The comments, made in [an interview with the
BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47274679) that was published
Monday, mark a rhetorical escalation. Mr. Ren and the firm had
previously declined to say much on the case, citing respect for the
legal process. But he appears to be sharpening his language as a hearing
nears on whether his daughter should be sent to the United States to
stand trial.

“I object to what the U.S. has done,” Mr. Ren told the BBC. “This kind
of politically motivated act is not acceptable.”

Late last month, the Justice Department [unveiled sweeping
charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/meng-wanzhou-huawei-iran.html)
against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, outlining
yearslong efforts by the Chinese firm to steal American industrial
secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions
against Iran.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Meng, who is Mr. Ren’s elder daughter, was [arrested in December by
Canadian
authorities](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/huawei-cfo-arrest-canada-extradition.html)
acting at the request of the United States. She remains in Canada while
awaiting a decision by its legal authorities about whether she will be
extradited to the United States to face charges.

The criminal case against Huawei and Ms. Meng coincides with [a campaign
by American officials to pressure Western
governments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html)
not to use Huawei’s equipment in their mobile networks. Washington has
long held that the company’s networking gear could be used to help
Beijing spy on Americans, charges that Huawei has consistently denied.

Relations between China and the United States have already been tense as
efforts to resolve [their monthslong trade
war](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/trump-china-us-trade.html)
plod forward.

Mr. Ren, 74, has generally preferred to avoid the spotlight as he built
Huawei into the world’s largest supplier of the equipment that enables
modern telecommunications.

[In an interview last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei.html)
with a group of journalists from international news outlets, Mr. Ren
said: “I trust that the legal systems of Canada and the United States
are open, just and fair, and will reach a just conclusion. We will make
our judgment after all the evidence is made public.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Ren’s latest comments appear to be aimed at a Canadian audience. A
Canadian judge is set in the coming weeks to hear arguments about
whether Ms. Meng should be extradited.

One issue that is likely to factor into the Canadian authorities’
decision is whether her arrest was politically motivated. Chrystia
Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, [has warned the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/world/canada/china-huawei.html)
not to use the extradition process to pursue political ends. And last
month, John McCallum, Canada’s ambassador to China at the time, said Ms.
Meng had a good chance of avoiding extradition because of [remarks by
President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/trump-meng-wanzhou-huawei-extradition.html),
who had said he was willing to intervene if it would help secure a trade
deal.

Mr. McCallum backpedaled on his observation. But [he was pushed out of
his
job](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/canada-ambassador-china-huawei.html)
soon after.
