\section{Remembering Emmett Till: The Legacy of a
Lynching}\label{remembering-emmett-till-the-legacy-of-a-lynching}}

More than six decades after Emmett Till was murdered, locals are
grappling with how to memorialize him. In this virtual reality
documentary, we look at that effort and what it can tell us about racial
reckoning in America.

In August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till of Chicago was accused of
whistling at a white woman at a grocery store in Mississippi. He was
later kidnapped, tortured, lynched and dumped in a river. Today, more
than six decades later, the local communities in towns closely connected
to Emmett's story are grappling with the legacy of the lynching.

This 360-degree video, narrated by Audra D.S. Burch, a national
enterprise correspondent for The New York Times, explores this cultural
reckoning and examines the role physical structures related to the
Emmett Till case play in the efforts to memorialize him.

Read more about the cultural and racial reckoning taking place in
Mississippi and the efforts to preserve Bryant's Grocery \& Meat Market,
