NEW ORLEANS --- The Justice Department will escalate its crackdown on
illegal foreign influence operations in the United States, a senior
Justice Department official said on Wednesday, violations that
prosecutors have targeted with renewed vigor in recent years.

Prosecutors plan to pursue more cases of covert foreign influence, John
C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department's national security
division, said at a conference in New Orleans on white-collar fraud.

The move, one of the first significant initiatives under Attorney
General William P. Barr, shows that the Justice Department has made a
priority one of the targets pursued by the special counsel, Robert S.
Mueller III: potential violations of the Foreign Agents Registration
Act, or FARA, which requires lobbyists and others to disclose any work
they do to further the interests of foreign governments. Prosecutors had
for decades mostly ignored such violations as lobbyists accepted
millions of dollars from other nations.

Mr. Demers said that the department was overhauling its FARA enforcement
unit and would assign Brandon L. Van Grack, a former prosecutor on Mr.
Mueller's team and a deputy chief in the national security division's
counterespionage unit, to oversee it. The new role shows that the
department has shifted ``from treating FARA as an administrative
obligation and regulatory obligation to one that is increasingly an
enforcement priority,'' Mr. Demers said.

Mr. Van Grack was involved in some of the special counsel's most
high-profile prosecutions, including the cases against Paul Manafort and
Michael T. Flynn, former top aides to President Trump.

The lobbying world had long been dismissive of the threat of
prosecutions related to foreign influence or violations of FARA. For
nearly a half-century, from 1966 until 2015, the Justice Department
pursued only seven FARA cases, the department's inspector general said
in a report.

Mr. Van Grack temporarily left the Justice Department's national
security division to work with Mr. Mueller's team, returning to his
previous post in August after working on the indictments of Mr. Flynn,
who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html}{pleaded
guilty in late 2017} to lying to investigators, and Mr. Manafort. Mr.
Manafort is due to be sentenced on Thursday in Northern Virginia on a
conviction of financial crimes in a case that stemmed from his
consulting work for a former pro-Russian president of Ukraine. During
that trial, an unsavory picture emerged of the lawyers and consultants
who netted big paydays for their work on behalf of foreign governments.

The abrupt end to Mr. Manafort's career, which included work with
foreign clients who wanted a say in American politics, had a chilling
effect on the lobbying world.

As it delved into the work that occurs on behalf of foreign governments
in the lobbying world,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/fara-foreign-agents-mueller.html}{the
special counsel's office also investigated lawyers and lobbyists} who
worked on behalf of Ukranian entities, including Gregory B. Craig, the
White House counsel under President Barack Obama and a lawyer for the
firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher \& Flom. Mr. Craig left Skadden last
spring.

In January, the law firm
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/us/politics/skadden-arps-ukraine-lobbying-settlement.html}{paid
\$4.6 million to settle} a Justice Department investigation into whether
its Ukraine-related work violated lobbying laws.
