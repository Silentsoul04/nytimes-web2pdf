# How Our Former Beijing Bureau Chief Found Himself on a Bullet Train in Saudi Arabia

</div>

There was a certain dissonance in the fact that the ruling Communist
Party of China, officially atheist and repressive toward the country’s
Muslims, had helped build a railway connecting the holiest sites in
Islam.

MEDINA, Saudi Arabia — One thing I learned from working for 13 years as
a foreign correspondent is that getting to and from a place can teach
you a lot about a country. Even [in a war
zone](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/23/world/middleeast/flight-15-to-basra-fewperks-but-no-bombs.html).
It’s a cliché to say it’s the journey that matters and not the
destination, but there is truth in that statement.

So it was that I found myself canceling a plane ticket from Medina to
Jeddah in Saudi Arabia in January in favor of taking the train.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was not just any train.

I had discovered, while on a trip to report on [a high-end concert
series](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-tourism-music-festival.html)
in the remote Al Ula region, that in October Saudi Arabia had opened a
high-speed railway between Medina and Mecca, the most important
pilgrimage sites for Muslims. It ran a total distance of 281 miles.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I had a flight from Jeddah that night back to Washington, where I now
work as a diplomatic correspondent. If I boarded the train around noon,
I could get to Jeddah by midafternoon, have time to walk around the old
town and seaside corniche, maybe get dinner and catch my flight.

Booking a ticket was as easy as making a reservation on Amtrak. From my
hotel room in a desert canyon in Al Ula, I got on the website of the
[Haramain High Speed
Railway](https://www.hhr.sa/sites/sro/Pages/home.aspx), clicked on the
English-language option and looked at the schedule. There was a train
departing at noon the next day that would get me into Jeddah at 2:16
p.m. All economy-class tickets were sold out so, using an American
credit card, I booked a business-class seat for 220.5 Saudi riyals, or
$59.

I’ve always enjoyed train travel, but there was a particular reason this
railway intrigued me. When I was Beijing bureau chief, my job at The
Times before this one, I researched commercial projects abroad that
involved Chinese companies. Chinese state-owned enterprises were getting
infrastructure contracts in many countries, even before President Xi
Jinping began heavily promoting his [Belt and Road
Initiative](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/world/africa/china-loans-africa-usa.html).

I came across the fact that a Chinese state-owned enterprise was
involved in the first phase of building a high-speed railway between
Medina and Mecca. There was a certain dissonance here: The ruling
Communist Party of China, officially atheist and [repressive toward many
of the country’s
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/world/asia/us-china-sanctions-muslim-camps.html),
was helping build a railway connecting the holiest sites in Islam.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I emailed an official at the Saudi Embassy in Washington about getting a
visa to go report in Saudi Arabia, but nothing came of it. The country
usually does not issue tourist visas, and journalist visas are hard to
get.

That was years ago. Now I had a visa, granted so I could cover [a trip
by Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/middleeast/pompeo-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman.html)
to the kingdom. And at the end of the assignment, after four days of
reporting in Riyadh and Ula, I had a train ticket to Jeddah.

On the morning of Jan. 17, a driver took me south from Al Ula to Medina.
We were careful to skirt north around the bustling heart of Medina to
the high-speed train station. Non-Muslims are forbidden from entering
central Medina. Even on the outskirts, I saw more minarets than I had
seen in any other city I had visited in years.

The first thing that struck me at the station were the pilgrims.
Outside, men in white robes and women in full black dress, often with
their faces covered, wheeled suitcases. A few times I saw Muslims who
appeared to be from as far away as Southeast Asia.

The cavernous station was busy but not crowded. A sign pointed to a
mosque. Pillars and archways pulled the eye toward the dark, soaring
ceilings, decorated with diamond-shaped motifs that let in sunlight. The
floor tiles gleamed.

I scanned the electronic ticket on my phone at a turnstile to be let
into the platform area.

In China, I had taken [many high-speed
trains](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/business/global/23rail.html),
and these looked similar. There was a bullet-shaped car at the front and
a string of passenger cars behind it. They resembled, too, the
high-speed trains I had taken in Japan and France.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Each train had 417 seats.

I walked to a business-class car and got on. The cabin was nearly full.
I sat down in a wide seat. All the seats had a seat-back television
screen. This train had been designed and built by a Spanish company.

Leaving Medina, the train steadily picked up speed, until it reached
about 190 miles per hour. It zipped through flat, dry countryside dotted
with shrubs. Waiters in white shirts, black vests and white gloves
served dates and Arabic coffee. Then they came by with lunch: a chicken
roll, a sweet cake and more coffee.

“What do you think of all this?” asked an older man with a thick beard
and a traditional red-checkered headdress sitting in front of me. “It’s
a smooth ride?”

The scenery became hillier as we approached the Hijaz Mountains parallel
to the Red Sea, before continuing south along the coast. At 1:30, we
sped through a station in King Abdullah Economic City. Soon afterward,
we pulled into Jeddah.

I wanted to travel on to Mecca, but — as with central Medina —
non-Muslims are barred from entering the city. I stepped off the train
with my bag.

As I walked to the taxi stand with the pilgrims, I saw a poster with
large photos of King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the
train, plus the words Saudi Vision 2030. A family took cellphone photos
of themselves standing in front of it.

Saudi Vision 2030 is the catchphrase for an ambitious economic
development program spearheaded by the crown prince. In the West, he is
now known more for violent acts — carrying on [a war against rebels in
Yemen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html)
that has resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and,
[according to the
C.I.A.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html),
ordering the murder last October of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident
and Washington Post columnist. The Saudi government has denied the crown
prince’s involvement in the murder.

The train presented a different glimpse of the complexities of the
kingdom.

I got into a taxi and looked back at the pilgrims streaming from the
station as we drove off toward the Red Sea.
