Representative José E. Serrano, who is currently the nation’s
longest-tenured Hispanic congressman, said on Monday that he would not
run for re-election, citing the effects of Parkinson’s disease.

Mr. Serrano, who has served in Congress since 1990 and represents the
southern Bronx, one of the poorest districts in the country, has
repeatedly won re-election with more than 90 percent of the vote. But
with the Democratic Party seeking a younger brand of progressives, there
was talk that he might have faced a serious primary challenge next year.

Two powerful members of the Bronx political establishment praised Mr.
Serrano while predicting a wide open race for his seat; Ritchie Torres,
a Bronx councilman often described as a rising star, [said last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/ny-congress-primaries-2020.html)
that he was exploring a primary challenge to Mr. Serrano.

“I’m sure there will be a lot of people who are now going to want to run
for Congress,” said Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx assemblyman who serves as
speaker of the State Assembly. “And I will not be one of them.”

Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, [the borough’s party
chairman](http://bronxdems.org/executive-board/) who, like Mr. Serrano,
was born in Puerto Rico, called the congressman “a legendary figure in
Latino politics, Puerto Rican politics, Bronx politics.”

Mr. Serrano said in a written statement that he had initially planned to
stay in Congress despite the disease, but that he recently changed his
mind. “I’ve come to the realization that Parkinson’s will eventually
take a toll and that I cannot predict its rate of advancement,” the
statement said. He said that he would serve out his current term, which
runs through the end of next year.

Mr. Serrano sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee and is the
chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee. He is also
known for advocating for Puerto Rico, including a [recent
push](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/nyregion/politicians-with-puerto-rican-roots-challenge-trump-in-push-for-aid.html)
to have the Trump administration improve relief efforts for the island
after Hurricane Maria.

“I always tried to speak for those who are marginalized in our society,
to give them a voice and a vote here in Washington,” he said, citing his
efforts to bring federal funding to the Bronx, increase educational
funding for minority students, clean up the polluted Bronx River and end
the use of Vieques Island as a military bombing range.

Mr. Serrano, who had previously been a state assemblyman, was first
elected to Congress in 1990 in a special election to fill the seat of
[Representative Robert
Garcia](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/nyregion/robert-garcia-dead-bronx-congressman.html),
who was convicted of extorting money from Wedtech, a Bronx military
contractor. Mr. Garcia’s conviction [was later
overturned](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/30/nyregion/garcias-extortion-convictions-are-reversed-by-appeals-panel.html?module=inline).
(Another Bronx congressman, Mario Biaggi, [was also
convicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/nyregion/mario-biaggi-10-term-new-york-congressman-who-went-to-prison-dies-at-97.html)
in the Wedtech scandal; his granddaughter, Alessandra Biaggi, [was
elected](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/nyregion/state-senate-election-results-idc-klein.html)
last year to the New York State Senate.)

Mr. Serrano was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and moved with his family
to the South Bronx when he was seven years old. He said that, as a child
in Puerto Rico, he learned English by singing along to Frank Sinatra
records. Mr. Serrano lived in public housing in the Bronx and did not
receive a college degree.

“He is an icon, not only to the Bronx but to Latinos throughout the
country,” said Mr. Torres. “As a young Latino who ran for public office
when I was 24 years old, I would not be where I am today were it not for
trailblazers like José Serrano who paved the way.”

Mr. Torres, 31, declined to say definitively whether he would run for
Mr. Serrano’s seat. “I’d rather keep the focus on his legacy,” he said.
“He secured the federal funding that led to the cleanup of the Bronx
River, which is an enormous legacy to leave on.”

Mr. Serrano’s son, José M. Serrano, a Democratic state senator, said he
would not seek his father’s seat because he did not want to be away from
his wife and two children.

The younger Mr. Serrano praised his father’s faith in their borough.
“When I was a child growing up in the 1970s, the Bronx was burning,”
he said. “Now it’s thriving.”
