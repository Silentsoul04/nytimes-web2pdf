WASHINGTON — After years of effort, scientists at the Fish and Wildlife
Service had a moment of celebration as they wrapped up a comprehensive
analysis of the threat that three widely used pesticides present to
hundreds of endangered species, like the [kit
fox](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-08/documents/san-joaquin-kitfox.pdf)
and the [seaside
sparrow](https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/csss.htm).

“Woohoo\!” Patrice Ashfield, then a branch chief at Fish and Wildlife
Service headquarters, [wrote to her
colleagues](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p42/a488261 "August 2017 email from Patrice Ashfield to her Fish & Wildlife boss")
in August 2017.

Their analysis found that two of the pesticides, malathion and
chlorpyrifos, were so toxic that they “[jeopardize the continued
existence](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-endangered-species-act "EPA webpage explaining the Endangered Species standard")”
of more than 1,200 endangered birds, fish and other animals and plants,
a conclusion that could lead to tighter restrictions on use of the
chemicals.

But just before the team planned to make its findings public in November
2017, something unexpected happened: Top political appointees of the
Interior Department, which oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service,
blocked the release and set in motion a new process intended to apply a
much narrower standard to determine the risks from the pesticides.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Leading that intervention was David Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary
of the interior and a former lobbyist and oil-industry lawyer. In
October 2017, he abruptly summoned staff members to the first of a rapid
series of meetings in which the Fish and Wildlife Service was directed
to take the new approach, one that pesticide makers and users had
lobbied intensively to promote.

Mr. Bernhardt is now President Trump’s nominee to become interior
secretary. The Senate is scheduled to hold a hearing on his confirmation
[Thursday](https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-and-business-meetings?ID=35F3BA18-1860-4227-8C1B-A7C5891D14E1 "Notice of Senate confirmation hearing").

This sequence of events is detailed in more than [84,000
pages](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html "Here is a collection of some of these documents assembled by The New York Times")
of Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency documents
obtained via Freedom of Information requests by The New York Times and,
separately, by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental
group that [sued the federal
government](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/amphibians/California_red-legged_frog/pdfs/RFL2-order_entering_settlement.pdf)
to force it to complete the pesticide studies.

The documents provide a case study of how the Trump administration has
been using its power to second-guess or push aside conclusions reached
by career professionals, particularly in the area of public health and
the environment.

The decision to block the release of the report represented a victory
for the pesticide industry, which has industry allies and former
executives sprinkled through the administration. Among those with the
most at stake were Dow AgroSciences, a manufacturer of chlorpyrifos,
which is used on dozens of fruits and vegetables, and FMC Corporation, a
manufacturer of malathion, which is used against mosquitoes as well as
chewing and sucking insects that attack a [range of
crops](http://www.fmccrop.com/grower/Products/Insecticides-Miticides/cheminova-malathion-57ec.aspx "malathion use from FMC")
including tomatoes, strawberries and walnuts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dow, which was recently renamed
[Corteva](https://www.corteva.com/who-we-are/our-merger.html "Corporate site"),
donated [$1
million](https://www.opensecrets.org/trump/inauguration-donors "Contributors to Trump inauguration")
to Mr. Trump’s inauguration committee. E.P.A. and Interior Department
records show that top pesticide industry executives had regular access
to senior agency officials, pressing them to reconsider the way the
federal government evaluates the threat pesticides cause to endangered
species.

A Dow spokesman said the shift in policy was unrelated to the $1 million
contribution. The new approach will result in “a better understanding of
where and how pesticides are being used,” said Gregg M. Schmidt, a
Corteva spokesman.

Spokesmen for [FMC](http://www.fmc.com/ "Corporate site") and
[Adama](https://www.adama.com/en/ "Corporate site") — the other primary
makers of the pesticides being studied — as well as their lawyers and
CropLife America, the trade group that represents them, declined to
comment.

Asked if Mr. Bernhardt’s intervention was appropriate or motivated by a
desire to serve the industry’s interests, an Interior Department
spokeswoman said his actions had been “governed solely by legitimate
concerns regarding the legal sufficiency and policy.”

Before he joined the Trump administration, Mr. Bernhardt worked as a
[lawyer and
lobbyist](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5779173-Bernhardt-Ethics-Letter-and-Disclosure-Report.html "Bernhardt recusal and financial disclosure documents detailing his former clients")
representing clients including the oil and gas industry. He was
frequently [paid to
challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/climate/david-bernhardt-endangered-species.html "Top Leader at Interior Dept. Pushes a Policy Favoring His Former Client")
endangered species-related matters, including one involving a tiny
silvery blue fish called the delta smelt whose protection by the federal
government has resulted in limits on water use by California farmers.

Agency records suggest Mr. Bernhardt, after having had only limited
involvement in the issue, had nine meetings or calls on his schedule
with Fish and Wildlife staff in October and November 2017, and helped
write the letter saying the Interior Department was no longer prepared
to release the draft.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, the E.P.A. official at the time who ran the
office in charge of toxic chemicals and pesticides, said the sudden
change in regulatory philosophy was part of a [broader trend across the
government](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/us/trump-epa-chemicals-regulations.html "NYT Story: Why Has the E.P.A. Shifted on Toxic Chemicals? An Industry Insider Helps Call the Shots")
after Mr. Trump’s election.

“It is certainly similar to the pattern we saw in toxic chemicals as
well, where the regulated industry had a more sympathetic ear in the new
administration,” said Ms. Hamnett, who left the E.P.A. in late 2017,
after a 38-year career with the agency. “And that resulted in a shift in
approach as to how these issues would be handled.”

Gary Frazer, the top endangered species official at the Fish and
Wildlife Service, whose schedule says he participated in all nine of the
late 2017 discussions with Mr. Bernhardt, and who subsequently directed
his staff to revise the study, said he did not believe the change in
direction was politically driven.

“It was an entirely appropriate role,” he said in an interview, as two
of the agency’s public affairs officials listened in. “There was no
arm-twisting of any kind.”

The endangered species review is required as part of the re-registration
of pesticides, a process that [occurs every 15
years](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-reevaluation/registration-review-process "EPA Review of Pesticide Re-Registration Process").

Experts at the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Commerce Department’s
National Marine Fisheries Service were supposed to determine if any of
the pesticides might “jeopardize the continued existence of any
endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or
adverse modification of habitat of such species,” a standard created
[under federal
law](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-7.html "Fish and Wildlife description of endangered species program").

Much of the work focuses on questions like whether a wildfire management
program in the Florida Everglades [hurt endangered
species](https://ecos.fws.gov/tails/pub/document/2303919 "2015 study of impact on endangered species of proposed Everglades National Park Fire Management")
such as the American crocodile or the West Indian manatee. The Fish and
Wildlife Service rarely makes so-called jeopardy findings; [a 2015
study](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/15844 "Data contradict common perceptions about a controversial provision of the US Endangered Species Act")
of nearly 7,000 cases found that only two concluded with a finding that
a species was in jeopardy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The pesticide industry, as well as groups representing farmers who rely
on its products, began to mobilize as the endangered species review got
underway during the Obama administration.

With Mr. Trump’s election, the industry escalated its campaign. In April
2017, its lawyers [sent a letter to Ryan
Zinke](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p21/a488251 "Pesticide industry letter to Ryan Zinke"),
then the interior secretary; Scott Pruitt, then the E.P.A.’s
administrator; and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, asking them to
“direct that any effort to prepare biological opinions,” as the
process is called, “be set aside,” arguing that the analysis was
“fundamentally flawed.”

The industry’s central argument was that the federal scientists were not
sufficiently taking into account the difference between how the
pesticides could legally be used and how they were actually used.

Staff members at the Fish and Wildlife Service, emails show, did have
access to actual pesticide usage, as well as other information, such as
[measurements of pesticide
concentrations](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5779584-2017-05-30-1355-Email-Ambient-Monitoring-for.html "Ambient Monitoring for Pesticides in Washington State Surface Water: 2015 Technical Report ")
found in salmon-bearing streams in Washington State.

But the agency staff — working from dozens of field offices like Hawaii
and Maine as well as the headquarters — generally built its predictions
of a “jeopardy” threat to endangered species by assuming the pesticides
were being used to the maximum extent possible as allowed by their
labels.

That is because “unlike most other types of product labels, pesticide
labels are legally enforceable,” [according to E.P.A.
policy](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-labels/introduction-pesticide-labels "E.P.A. rules regarding pesticide labels").
And historic usage data, the agency staff said in its documents, is not
sufficient to predict how these pesticides might be used — and cause
harm — in the coming 15 years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The pesticides, particularly chlorpyrifos and malathion, are “high
toxicity” for all animals, and their effect on endangered species would
be both direct and indirect, via contamination of food sources, for
example, [the staff
concluded](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p88/a488287 "Fish & Wildlife details toxic threat from pesticides").
The E.P.A. [has separately
considered](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/epa-insecticide-chlorpyrifos.html "E.P.A. Chief, Rejecting Agency’s Science, Chooses Not to Ban Insecticide")
banning chlorpyrifos because of potential harm to
humans.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Fish and Wildlife staff cited the San Joaquin kit fox, a tiny animal
that weighs about five pounds, with a slim body, large ears and a long,
bushy tail. Decades ago, it inhabited large parts of California’s San
Joaquin Valley, an area today of intensive farming and pesticide use.
But most of those fox populations are now gone, in part because
pesticides like diazinon contaminated birds and grasses the foxes fed
on, [the agency
concluded](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p101/a488289 "Jeopardy call regarding San Joaquin kit fox").

The Cape Sable seaside sparrow, another endangered species located
mostly now in Florida, was found to be in jeopardy as a result of
drifting sprays of chlorpyrifos. “For many vulnerable species, a single
exposure could be catastrophic,” an October 2017 [summary of the staff’s
findings
said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p100/a488288 "Jeopardy call regarding Seaside sparrow from the pesticide").

Agency records show repeated contacts in early 2017 by the pesticide
industry with administration officials. Among those targeted, the emails
show, was Daniel Jorjani, a top Interior Department lawyer who had spent
[six years
working](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4873360-Daniel-Jorjani-Resume.html)
for groups connected to the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H.
Koch.

Aaron Hobbs, a [onetime
lobbyist](http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/pdfform.aspx?id=300343238) for
CropLife, the leading pesticide industry trade association, who now
works for an affiliate of the industry-funded group, [reached out to Mr.
Jorjani](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p28/a488253 "Pesticide trade group, RISE, reaches out to Interior lawyer")
and invited him to an April 2017 meeting with industry officials to
discuss the endangered species effort — shortly after sending the letter
asking the agency to kill the Fish and Wildlife Service’s work. He
followed up [again in
July](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p37/a488258 "Follow up email from pesticide industry trade group to Interior lawyer")
in an attempt to set up another meeting.

Top officials from the E.P.A. and Interior and Agriculture Departments
began a series of meetings in June 2017, often involving representatives
from the White House.

Among the other [participants in these meetings, the records
show](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p35/a488257 "EPA, Interior, USDA officials discuss endangered species program"),
was Rebeckah Adcock, who until April 2017 had been a [director of
government
affairs](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4824481-Rebeckah-Adcock-Resume.html)
and registered lobbyist for CropLife and who now works as a senior
adviser at the Agriculture Department.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Adcock joined the discussions even though the [ethics
agreement](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4193032/Rebeckah-Adcock-Ethics-Agreement-1.pdf)
she signed said she would not participate “personally and substantially
in any particular matter” involving CropLife for one year. An
Agriculture Department spokesman said this did not violate that ban
because she had not specifically lobbied on endangered species matters
for CropLife.

Even as these meetings were taking place, staff members inside the Fish
and Wildlife Service were wrapping up the enormous task of assessing the
threat presented by these pesticides, email records show.

The team [had
concluded](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p1/a488282 "Summary of final draft findings by Fish & Wildlife accidentally released by agency in a Freedom of Information response.")
that chlorpyrifos put 1,399 species — a mixture of animals and plants —
in jeopardy, while malathion put 1,284 of them in jeopardy and diazinon,
a third pesticide that was evaluated, placed 175 species in jeopardy.
There are [1,663
species](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/box-score-report "List of all endangered species in the United States")
listed as endangered or threatened in the United States, meaning that
two of the pesticides may be putting most of them in jeopardy. (This
information, agency officials said, was accidentally released in a
Freedom of Information response obtained by The Times. They intended to
keep this tally a secret, because the assessment was not final.)

The agency staff was not recommending that the pesticides be banned.
Instead, they were proposing changes in how the pesticides could be
used, including possible restrictions on their use in areas where
endangered species are found, or at certain times of year, the documents
say.

Lawyers who work for the interior secretary’s office wanted a very
different approach. They advocated abandoning the presumption that use
of a pesticide by a farmer or a golf course might directly cause the
death of or harm to an endangered species, officials said.

Their argument was that because farmers, for example, do not manufacture
the pesticide, their use of it means that any harm caused is an indirect
effect, as defined under federal law. There is a much higher standard of
proof needed to demonstrate that an indirect effect has harmed an
endangered species. The law requires that this harm be shown to be
“[reasonably certain to
occur](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/section7/s7process/s7glossary.html).”
The revised approach is almost certainly going to result in fewer plants
and animals being judged to be in jeopardy of extinction as a result of
continued pesticide use.

The shift in approach goes far beyond a single Fish and Wildlife Service
analysis. In early 2018, Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Zinke and Mr. Ross [agreed to
work](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p125/a488281 "Internal emails and memos discussing this shift")
toward a new framework for all endangered species evaluations, a move
that [CropLife
called](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p133/a488285 "CropLife comments on Trump administration plan")
“a positive step towards solving this important and complex issue.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Documents show that the administration does not now expect to make
public any draft results of the revised [assessment until April
2020](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p161/a488286 "E.P.A. letter to pesticide manufacturers with April 2020 date"),
two and a half years later than had been planned.

On Tuesday, after this article was published online, three House
Democrats, including Representative Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona, the
chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, [sent a letter to
Mr.
Bernhardt](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5778894-Trump-Era-Shift-Evaluating-Pesticide-Threats-to.html#document/p163/a489246)
asking him to release the draft reports immediately.
