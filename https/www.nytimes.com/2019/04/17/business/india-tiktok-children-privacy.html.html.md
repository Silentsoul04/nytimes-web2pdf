MUMBAI, India —
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/technology/india-china-tiktok.html),
the Chinese video app whose growth has been as viral as one of its
lip-synced dance clips, has encountered a roadblock in
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/technology/india-china-tiktok.html).

Google and Apple removed TikTok from their app stores in India late
Tuesday after the country’s Supreme Court refused to block a lower court
order halting new downloads. The lower court, based in Tamil Nadu State,
is hearing a petition seeking a ban on the app, on the grounds that it
spreads pornography and threatens the well-being of children.

TikTok, which has 120 million users in India and more than half a
billion worldwide, has been [particularly popular with children and
young
adults](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html)
because its tools make it easy to record, share and watch short videos.

*\[How TikTok is* [*changing social
media*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html)*.\]*

But it has also come under increasing scrutiny from governments around
the world, including the United States, for allowing users to post
objectionable content and for pushing children to share too much
information with strangers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In India, the app has been caught up in a bigger debate over[the
inability of social media to stop the spread of false
information](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/india-elections-facebook.html),
the dangers to children posed by mobile technology and the vast
influence of American and Chinese technology giants.

The Indian court hearing the TikTok case issued a [rambling
order](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/tiktok-mobile-application-download-prohibited-144046)
this month reciting the petitioner’s claims that TikTok was filled with
pornography, exposed young people to sexual predators, spoiled the mind
and prompted people to commit suicide.

“The government has the social responsibility to prevent these kinds of
applications,” the two-judge panel wrote as it ordered an interim ban on
downloads of the app. The court issued its initial order without giving
TikTok a chance to respond to the allegations.

“We have faith in the Indian judicial system,” TikTok said in a
statement on Wednesday. The company noted that it had stepped up its
efforts to remove objectionable content and had already taken down six
million videos in India.

TikTok’s lax controls have also incurred the wrath of American
regulators. In February, the [Federal Trade Commission announced a $5.7
million settlement with
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/ftc-tiktok-child-privacy-fine.html?searchResultPosition=4)
over accusations that it obtained and shared personal information such
as names and photos from children under 13 without parental consent.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Internet companies in the United States are supposed to seek such
consent before allowing children to use their services, but India has no
such regulations. That has left communities struggling to cope with
technology’s influence on their children.

Last month, several cities and districts in Gujarat, the home state of
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, banned PUBG, another app popular
with young people. Officials argued that the game, a mobile multiplayer
shooter owned by the Chinese conglomerate Tencent, distracted children
from their studies. About 20 people, many of them students, have been
charged with violating the ban, according to local news reports.

More broadly, India’s central government is wrestling with an overhaul
of its rules governing online services. It is considering [requiring
tech companies to automatically censor a wide range of
content](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html?searchResultPosition=1)
and [other policies that would promote Indian firms and rein in foreign
tech
companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html?searchResultPosition=5).

TikTok, which is owned by Bytedance, a company based in Beijing, has
come under additional scrutiny in India because of its national origin.
Some Indian officials suspect that
[China’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/technology/india-china-tiktok.html)
government is using popular Chinese apps to scoop up private data on
Indians.

“There is a belief that Chinese apps are a threat to national security,"
said Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at
TechLegis in New Delhi.

But India and the United States are not the only countries concerned
about the app. Bangladesh banned it two months ago as part of a
crackdown on pornography. Indonesia prohibited it last July, citing
objectionable content, but restored access a week later.

Mr. Waris said that restricting an app like TikTok over content it
couldn’t control was a slippery slope. Other major internet platforms
like Facebook, WhatsApp and Google’s YouTube struggle with the same
issue and could theoretically face similar bans.

The Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group in New Delhi,
wrote to India’s technology ministry on Wednesday, denouncing the
blanket bans as “reactionary and disproportionate” and saying they
violated Indians’ right to free speech. However, the group also urged
the government to begin a public process to create a formal technology
policy to protect children.

Meanwhile, the hashtag \#TikTokban was a trending topic on Twitter for
much of Wednesday. Fans and detractors weighed in with memes, jokes and
TikTok videos to [mourn its
suspension](https://twitter.com/bhuvanhere/status/1118527243460890625)
or [celebrate
it](https://twitter.com/KainaatTanga/status/1118533471553478656).
