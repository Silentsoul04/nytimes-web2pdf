BEIJING — Two Canadian men detained in China since December have been
formally arrested on espionage charges, the Chinese Foreign Ministry
said on Thursday, a move likely to ratchet up tensions between China and
Canada that broke out with the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in
Vancouver.

Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who was [detained while visiting
Beijing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/world/asia/michael-kovrig-china-canada.html),
was arrested on suspicion of “gathering state secrets and intelligence
for abroad,” and Michael Spavor, a business consultant who was [detained
in northeastern
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/asia/michael-spavor-canadian-detained-china.html),
was accused of “stealing and providing state secrets for abroad,” Lu
Kang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said at a regularly
scheduled news briefing.

The vague reference to unspecified overseas entities left open the
question of whether the men were suspected of working for a government
or for some other organization.

Mr. Lu did not provide further details and said only that the arrests
had been made recently.

“Everything in China is done in accordance with law,” Mr. Lu said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Responding to a reporter’s question about Canadian officials’ criticism
of how China handled the cases, he said: “We hope Canada will not
interfere with or comment casually on China’s legal system and lawful
practices.”

Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticized the initial
detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor [as
“arbitrary”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/asia/michael-spavor-canadian-detained-china.html)
and [politically
motivated](https://www.citynews1130.com/2019/01/10/trudeau-detention-canadians-politically-motivated/);
on Thursday, Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry,
denounced their arrests.

“Canada strongly condemns their arbitrary arrest as we condemned their
arbitrary detention,” Brittany Fletcher, a spokeswoman for Global
Affairs Canada, said in an emailed statement. “Canada continues to
express its appreciation to those who have spoken in support of these
detained Canadians and the rule of law.”

Supporters of the two men and foreign legal experts have said their
detentions appeared to be retaliation for the arrest in Canada in
December of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, China’s
biggest telecommunications company.

Ms. Meng was arrested at the request of the United States, which wants
to extradite her on fraud charges.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor were seized by the police in December, days
after [Ms. Meng was
arrested](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/huawei-cfo-arrest-canada-extradition.html)
while changing planes in Vancouver. The Chinese government was incensed
by Ms. Meng’s arrest, and the charging of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor
makes it more likely that they will face trial and conviction, deepening
the standoff with Mr. Trudeau’s administration.

Many in Canada have reacted with consternation at China’s treatment of
the two Canadians, who have been denied access to lawyers and been
confined in secret detention centers, without visits from family
members. Canadian diplomats have been allowed to visit them about once a
month.

Mr. Lu, the foreign ministry spokesman, did not respond to questions
Thursday about where the two men were being held.

Their circumstances are a striking contrast to those of Ms. Meng, who is
[out on
bail](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/world/canada/huawei-meng-wanzhou-extradition.html),
has been living in Vancouver in a six-bedroom home valued at 6 million
Canadian dollars, and is free to roam largely about the city with a GPS
tracker on her ankle.

In addition to the diplomatic tensions, the Meng case and detentions of
the two Canadians have fueled economic tensions between the two
countries.

China, which bought about $2.7 billion worth of canola oil from Canada
last year, recently halted shipments of Canadian canola oil, saying they
were contaminated.

According to the [Canada China Business
Council](https://ccbc.com/ccbc-canada-china-business-survey-2018-2019/),
which promotes business, trade and investment between Canada and China,
20 percent of Canadian companies have been adversely affected by the
dispute as demand from China for Canadian products shrinks.

A former Canadian ambassador to China, [Guy
Saint-Jacques,](https://www.ualberta.ca/china-institute/about/people/senior-fellows/guy-saint-jacques)
said the formal arrest of the two men signaled a worsening in relations
with China and would make it even more challenging for Canada to secure
their release.

“In 95 percent of cases the accused are found guilty, and this formal
arrest signals the gravity of the situation,” he said. “We are in for a
long period of difficulties with China in which pressure from the
Chinese will increase.”

Mr. Saint-Jacques said that while China’s economic might outweighed
Canada’s, Canada could retaliate by taking action against China at the
World Trade Organization over the canola issue, and by rallying its
allies internationally to make it clear to China that its actions
against the two Canadians came at a price.

But he also added that the hope by some in Canada that improved trade
relations between the United States and China could help clear the way
for the men’s eventual release had diminished given the intensifying
friction between the two countries.

Human rights advocates on Thursday denounced the arrests of Mr. Kovrig
and Mr. Spavor.

“Their cases show again how the Chinese criminal system violates the
human rights of detainees,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher for Amnesty
International in Hong Kong. He called on Chinese officials to release
the men, absent “credible and concrete evidence” of crimes.

Before the latest announcement, Chinese officials had signaled that Mr.
Kovrig and Spavor [could be charged with espionage
offenses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/world/asia/china-canada-michael-kovrig-huawei.html).

Mr. Kovrig worked for the United Nations and the Canadian foreign
service before 2017, when he [joined the International Crisis
Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-kovrig), a
nonprofit organization that tries to defuse conflicts between
states.

He focused on Chinese foreign policy, Asian regional politics and North
Korea, and was often quoted in foreign news outlets and invited to
meetings in China.

Mr. Spavor was a consultant for companies and people interested in North
Korea, [including Dennis
Rodman](https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/kim-jong-un-meet-the-nhl/),
the former basketball star who has befriended the North’s leader, Kim
Jong-un.

Mr. Spavor was detained in Dandong, the Chinese city on the North Korean
border where he was based.

In early March, a [legal affairs
committee](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/world/asia/china-canada-michael-kovrig-huawei.html)
within China’s ruling Communist Party said investigators believed that
Mr. Kovrig had been “stealing and spying to obtain state secrets and
intelligence,” and that Mr. Spavor had supplied him with information.

But China’s definition of state secrets can be sweeping and opaque, and
the International Crisis Group has said Mr. Kovrig’s work for it was in
no way nefarious.

“Nothing Michael did was harmful to China,” the group’s president,
Robert Malley, said on Thursday. “On the contrary, his work helped
inform both China’s global policies and those around the world who make
policies toward China in a manner that contributes to preventing and
resolving conflict.”

The cases of Ms. Meng and the two Canadians are playing out as the
United States is pressuring allies not to use Huawei’s technology,
arguing that China could use it to spy on other countries.

Those efforts intensified on Wednesday, when President Trump [moved to
ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection)
American telecommunications companies from installing foreign-made
equipment that could pose risks to national security. The measure seemed
aimed at blocking sales by Huawei, though it did not explicitly single
out any nation or company.

Canada’s security agencies have been undertaking a national security
review to determine whether [Huawei’s
technology](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/world/canada/huawei-5g-meng-wanzhou-china.html)
should be used as Canada develops its 5G telecommunications network.

In January, American prosecutors
[indicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/meng-wanzhou-huawei-iran.html?module=inline)
Ms. Meng and Huawei, laying out what they said were efforts by the
company to steal commercial secrets, obstruct a criminal inquiry and
engage in bank fraud while trying to evade American sanctions on Iran.

Huawei has denied breaking the law, and the Chinese government has
repeatedly said that the charges were politically driven.

The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, [said at a news
conference](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-03-08/beijing-backs-huaweis-lawsuit-against-us-government-101389531.html)
in early March that the case against Huawei and Ms. Meng was “by no
means a purely judicial case, but rather a deliberate political case”
intended to bring down Huawei.

Mr. Trudeau and Canadian and United States officials have said that the
case against Ms. Meng is a [legal
matter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/world/canada/canada-huawei-china-ambassador.html),
not a political one. But President Trump [veered from that
position](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/trump-meng-wanzhou-huawei-extradition.html)
in December, when he suggested that he could intervene in the case if
that helped to seal a trade agreement with China.
