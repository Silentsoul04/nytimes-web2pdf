HARROW, Ontario — Barry Zekelman, a Canadian billionaire whose business
is mostly in the United States, is not a guy who likes to lose — or go
slow.

On days off, he likes to race his Ferrari 488 sports cars. Or he might
climb aboard his Gulfstream IV jet to fly to the Bahamas to visit his
121-foot superyacht, which he named “Man of Steel” in a nod to his role
as chief executive of Zekelman Industries, North America’s largest
steel-tube manufacturer.

So when Mr. Zekelman saw a chance to address his greatest frustration —
a flood of cheap steel tube imports into the United States that was
undermining sales at his family-owned, Chicago-based company — he went
all out to win in another intensely competitive arena: influencing
policy in Washington.

He called on well-placed connections, including a lawyer who had done
work for him and had gone on to a senior position helping oversee trade
policy in the Trump administration. He put his Washington-based lobbyist
into action, and his company took a high-profile role with a trade group
that was backing his cause. He funded his own [advertising
campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXuG8tvi2W4 "American Metal campaign")
to build public support for his efforts to protect makers of steel tube
in the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And Zekelman Industries made political donations in the United States —
skirting or possibly violating a ban on contributions by foreigners —
including $1.75 million last year to a group supporting President Trump.

That lobbying effort was how he and his wife found themselves being
ushered into a private dining room at the Trump International Hotel in
Washington last spring for a small dinner with the president and his son
Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Zekelman said they discussed quotas the United
States was about to impose on imports of steel from competitors in South
Korea.

“He’s attacking the problems that should have been attacked for many
years,” Mr. Zekelman, 52, said of Mr. Trump in an interview.

His status as a foreigner seeking to promote protectionist policies in
the United States makes him unusual. But Mr. Zekelman’s effort amounts
to a case study in how to gain and employ access in Mr. Trump’s
Washington, where an ideological commitment to aiding business meets an
open door to lobbyists, interest groups and donors — especially those
from industries, like oil and gas, chemicals, casinos and steel, that
are strong supporters of Mr. Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The United States government has put the industry in charge of trade
policy on steel,” said Julie C. Mendoza, a lawyer whose clients include
Borusan Mannesmann, a manufacturer of steel tube whose imports to the
United States from Turkey have prompted Zekelman Industries to lodge
protests with the administration. “It’s just not right.”

The lobbying campaign has, at times, come close to the edge of the
federal rules, including the law that prohibits foreigners from donating
to election campaigns, an examination by The New York Times found. But
it has also proved highly successful in encouraging actions that have
benefited Mr. Zekelman’s company’s bottom line and his American
employees.

The administration has ruled in favor of Zekelman Industries on a series
of claims the company has made against foreign competitors. Sales and
profits have surged at the privately held company, which has annual
revenues of nearly $3 billion. Employment at the company’s 14 plants in
the United States — in Illinois, Pennsylvania, California, Ohio and
other states, which operate under names including Wheatland Tube, Sharon
Tube and Atlas Tube — has increased by 600, and he hopes to add another
500 jobs this year.

“In the 33 years I have been in business, I have never been more
encouraged,” said Mr. Zekelman, who took over the business at 19, when
his father died.

Mr. Trump has won backing — [and political
donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/contributors?id=N00023864)
— from a number of steel companies, including executives at Nucor, the
nation’s largest steel producer, and AK Steel.

But Zekelman Industries now stands out as the biggest steel industry
donor to Mr. Trump’s [affiliated political
committees](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2018&cmte=C00637512 "AmericaFirst Action SuperPAC donors"),

The $1.75 million in contributions were delivered in three chunks last
year to [America First Action SuperPAC](https://www.a1apac.org/), which
was created in January 2017 by former Trump campaign aides to push Mr.
Trump’s agenda.

Federal Election Commission rules prohibit any foreigner from
“directing, dictating, controlling, or directly or indirectly
participating in the decision-making process” related to any campaign
contribution, [including super
PACs](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/taking-receipts-pac/contributions-to-super-pacs-and-hybrid-pacs/ "FEC rule").

Mr. Zekelman, who does not have United States citizenship, said in an
interview that he did not play a role in the decision to donate. But he
added that he did discuss the matter with other company executives,
after a representative from America First Action approached one of
Zekelman Industries’ lawyers and asked for a contribution.

“They contacted our people, our people brought it to me,” Mr. Zekelman
said. “I said, great, I would love to find a way to support him.”

Mr. Zekelman said the donation was legal because the final decision was
made by members of his board who are American citizens or legal
residents of the United States, and the money was donated through
Wheatland Tube, a United States-based subsidiary of Zekelman Industries,
which he owns with his two brothers.

After The New York Times raised questions about the donation, Mickey
McNamara, general counsel at Zekelman Industries and president of
Wheatland Tube, said he did not recall discussing the matter with Mr.
Zekelman. Mr. McNamara said he decided to make the donation without
consulting with Mr. Zekelman.

In a statement, Brian O. Walsh, the president of America First Action,
said the organization did not accept foreign contributions. “All
contributors are expressly asked to affirm they are a U.S. citizen or
permanent resident,” he
said.

Adav Noti, a former associate general counsel at the Federal Election
Commission, said that if Mr. Zekelman had discussed the matter with
colleagues at work, he had most likely violated federal law, even if the
formal decision to donate was made by others.

“This sounds pretty clearly unlawful to me,” said Mr. Noti, now chief of
staff at Campaign Legal Center, which monitors election law compliance.

Mr. Zekelman’s drive to get help from the Trump administration started
just 10 days after Mr. Trump took office in 2017, email records show,
and more than a year before his company made its first donation to
America First Action.

He reached out to Stephen P. Vaughn, then the acting United States trade
representative, who had been a lawyer at King & Spalding, where his
clients included Zekelman Industries.

“I would like to bring Barry Zekelman by to meet you at 3:30 or 4 p.m.
on Wednesday, February 1,” Bonnie Byers, a lobbyist at King & Spalding
who still represents Zekelman Industries, [wrote to Mr.
Vaughn](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6015721-Zekelman-Visit-With-Acting-United-States-Trade.html#document/p1/a501810 "Emails obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests"),
her former colleague. “Hope that will be doable. I know how busy you are
and we will not take much time.”

Three minutes later Mr. Vaughn wrote back: “Let’s plan to meet Wednesday
at 4 p.m.”

[Mr. Vaughn’s
calendar](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6015721-Zekelman-Visit-With-Acting-United-States-Trade.html#document/p4/a501811 "Excerpt from calendar")
is blacked out for the time of the meeting. But [a
log](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6015721-Zekelman-Visit-With-Acting-United-States-Trade.html#document/p5/a501812 "USTR headquarters entry sign in sheet")

signed in shortly before the scheduled meeting.

prohibit senior administration officials from having meetings or
communications with a former employer or former client for one year
unless it is a public event “open to all interested parties.” White
House officials said Mr. Vaughn did not receive a waiver for the
meeting. Asked about the visit, the trade representative’s office said
it was “a brief personal meeting, not a business
meeting.”

But Mr. Zekelman said his business message to Mr. Vaughn during that
visit was clear.

“Imports are a real issue, hurting the industry, and they have got to be
dealt with,” he said, recalling the pitch he made to his former lawyer.
“Find a way to dig in and get after these things and start to hold
these countries and companies accountable.”

Mr. Vaughn, who until this month served as general counsel in the trade
representative’s office, is far from the only contact that Mr. Zekelman
has inside the administration.

[Gilbert B.
Kaplan](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4387599-Gilbert-Kaplan-Financial-Disclosure.html "Financial Disclosure report for Mr. Kaplan listing Zekleman Industry as former client"),
a lawyer who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits or complaints on
behalf of Zekelman Industries, was named under secretary of commerce for
international trade, a role in which he helps oversee trade negotiations
related to the steel industry.

Agency records show the extensive access that Mr. Zekelman and his
executives have had to top trade officials, including Commerce Secretary
Wilbur Ross; the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro; Robert
Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; and officials at the
Customs and Border Protection agency, which enforces trade laws.

Some of those meetings, including one with Mr. Ross last week, were
organized by a trade group called the Committee on Pipe and Tube
Imports, [led for the past year by Tony
Frabotta](https://www.steel.org/-/media/doc/steel/policy/testimony/steel-caucus-march-2018/032118-steel-caucus-cpti-frabotta-testimony.ashx "Testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives by Tony Frabotta"),
a vice president at Zekelman Industries. The group has also reached out
to Capitol Hill for support — including visits to dozens of
congressional offices this month — requests sometimes followed up with
campaign contributions by the committee, [records

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Zekelman Industries also began [its own influence
campaign](https://www.chooseamericanmetal.com/) — television and radio
spots with patriotic music and shots of Mr. Zekelman — about the need to
protect American steel makers. “It’s time for US to show our support,”
said one of the ads, a message that dovetails with Mr. Trump’s.

The most important step the administration has taken to help the
industry is a 25 percent tariff on imports, which resulted in a surge in
sales from Zekelman’s United States plants. This [came in March
2018](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-adjusting-imports-steel-united-states/ "Presidential Proclamation on Adjusting Imports of Steel into the United States"),
weeks before Zekelman Industries wrote its first check to America First
Action, for $1
million.

The tariff was followed by a [cap on steel
imports](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/quota/bulletins/qb-18-137-absolute-quota-steel-mill-articles-argentina-brazil-and-south-korea "Absolute Quota for Steel Mill Articles: Argentina, Brazil and South Korea")
from three countries, including South Korea, which had been a major
competitor for Mr. Zekelman.

The administration has also been moving aggressively on complaints that
companies are trying to import goods from nations like Thailand, Turkey,
Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates where manufacturing is government
subsidized or gets other unfair benefits, said Roger B. Schagrin, a
lawyer [and
lobbyist](https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=50FA9571-88E2-4AA1-8EFB-8464A0AD7534&filingTypeID=51)
who represents Mr. Zekelman and other American-based steel tube makers.

“Whack-a-mole” is how Mr. Zekelman described his effort to head off
subsidized imports, given that as soon as he managed to get punitive
action against one competitor, another emerged.

Steel tube imports from Turkey have been a particular target.

One case involved a request to the administration by Borusan Mannesmann
to import steel tube tariff free from Turkey while it completed the
expansion of a steel pipe mill in Texas. Zekelman Industries objected,
telling the Commerce Department that a Zekelman plant in Arkansas could
make the steel Borusan needed.

Department overseen by Mr. Kaplan, the former Zekelman lawyer [and

sided with Zekelman, recommending that Borusan’s request be denied,
[documents
show](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6003752-BIS-June-19-2018-Decision-Memo-BIS-2018-0006-0034.html).
A spokeswoman said Mr. Kaplan had honored all ethics requirements, which
would prohibit him from helping a recent client.

Mr. Trump [announced last
summer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/us/politics/trump-turkey-tariffs-currency.html)
that he would double tariffs on steel from Turkey to 50 percent. Those
imports — including steel tube — [dropped 48 percent last
year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-adjusting-imports-steel-united-states/ "Adjusting Imports of Steel into the United States")
as a result, a drop so big that Mr. Trump moved last week to return the
tariff to 25 percent.

Mr. Zekelman said he played no role in asking for the temporary doubling
of the tariff on Turkey, but each of these moves helped his business.
The company is also making structural steel pipe for use in the parts of
the border wall Mr. Trump intends to build with emergency government
funds.

On Friday, the administration [reached a
deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/business/tariffs-metals-canada-mexico.html)
to eliminate the 25 percent tariffs on steel imports from Canada and
Mexico, while leaving them in place for most of the rest of the world.
The decision will benefit Mr. Zekelman, whose biggest manufacturing
plant is in Harrow, Ontario, meaning the company will now be able to
ship Canadian-made pipe into the United States tariff free, even as Mr.
