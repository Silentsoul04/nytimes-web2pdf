WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to circumvent
Congress to allow the export to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates of billions of dollars of munitions that are now on hold,
according to current and former American officials and legislators
familiar with the plan.

[Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/politics/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo.html)
and some political appointees in the State Department are pushing for
the administration to invoke an emergency provision that would allow
President Trump to prevent Congress from halting the sales, worth about
$7 billion. The transactions, which include precision-guided munitions
and combat aircraft, would infuriate lawmakers in both parties.

They would also further inflame tensions between the United States and
Iran, which views Saudi Arabia as its main rival and has been supporting
the [Houthi rebels in
Yemen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html)
in their campaign against a Saudi-led military coalition that includes
the United Arab Emirates.

American legislators from both parties remain incensed by the Trump
administration’s equivocal response to the grisly killing last October
by Saudi agents of [Jamal
Khashoggi](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-prince.html),
a Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident. They are also
frustrated by the administration’s role in supporting the Saudi-led
coalition in the [Yemen
war](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-yemen.html),
a four-year conflict that the United Nations has deemed the world’s
worst humanitarian crisis, with [thousands of civilians killed and
millions suffering from
famine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/20/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-invisible-war-yemen.html?module=inline).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

This spring, [both the House and Senate
approved](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/yemen-war-end-vote.html)
bipartisan legislation to cut off military assistance to Saudi Arabia’s
war in Yemen using the 1973 War Powers Act, only to see [it vetoed in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html).

Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who sits on the Foreign
Relations Committee, said that circumventing Congress on a Middle East
arms sale would be “a big mistake,” though he added that he would need
to see the specifics of such a deal.

“We have a gold standard for that sort of arrangement, and to violate it
for Saudi Arabia is going to open the door for it to happen in multiple
other places,” he said.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an outspoken
ally of the president, told reporters Thursday that he would “not do
business as usual with the Saudis until we have a better reckoning” with
the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, whom American intelligence
agencies consider to be responsible for the killing of Mr. Khashoggi and
the Saudi role in the Yemen war.

No other foreign policy issue has created as large a rift between Mr.
Trump and Congress, and the move on the arms sales, which could take
place within days, would deepen the divide. [Mr.
Pompeo](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/us/politics/pompeo-christian-policy.html)
would oversee the action, and the State Department is bracing for
lawmakers to stall confirmations on all State Department nominees if it
is implemented. Within the department, veteran Foreign Service officers
have strongly opposed Mr. Pompeo’s position.

The proposal emerged publicly on Wednesday when Senator Christopher S.
Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, [criticized
it](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/trump-murphy-saudi-arms-deal/index.html)
on Twitter.

Members of Congress ordinarily are given a review period during which
they can pass legislation modifying or prohibiting a prospective arms
sale. But a provision in the [Arms Export Control
Act](https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Arms%20Export%20Control%20Act.pdf)
allows the president to bypass congressional review if he deems “an
emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national
security interest of the United States.”

“It sets an incredibly dangerous precedent that future presidents can
use to sell weapons without a check from Congress,” Mr. Murphy said in
an interview on Thursday. “We have the constitutional duty to declare
war and the responsibility to oversee arm sales that contravene our
national security interests. If we don’t stand up to this abuse of
authority, we will permanently box ourselves out of deciding who we
should sell weapons to.”

Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee, warned that he would “pursue all appropriate
legislative and other means to nullify these and any planned ongoing
sales should the administration move forward in this manner.”

Mr. Menendez withheld his support last summer for a Trump administration
plan to sell precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, effectively blocking
it.

Mr. Pompeo’s emergency declaration would be based on what he says is a
heightened threat against American interests in the region from Iran.
Mr. Pompeo took the extraordinary step this month of [ordering a
withdrawal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/us-iraq-embassy-evacuation.html)
of almost all American diplomats from the Baghdad embassy and Erbil
consulate in Iraq. European allies and Iraqi leaders have [expressed
skepticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html)
about American alarm over Iran.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked about the proposal, Morgan Ortagus, the main State Department
spokeswoman, said, “We do not comment to confirm or deny potential arms
sales or transfers until Congress is formally notified.”

Tensions between the United States and Iran have soared since May 5,
when John R. Bolton, the national security adviser and an Iran hawk,
[announced that the White
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/middleeast/us-iran-military-threat-.html)
was ordering an aircraft carrier strike group and bombers to speed up
their movement to the Persian Gulf. In the days afterward, American
officials told reporters that they had gotten [several strands of
intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/world/middleeast/iran-war-usa.html)
about potential attacks on American troops or diplomats by Iranian
forces or Arab militias with Iranian ties.

Mr. Bolton issued an expansive warning against Iran, saying that “any
attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met
with unrelenting force.” Critics of the escalation, which was supported
by Mr. Pompeo, said the Trump administration had provoked Iran by
withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear containment deal, [reimposing harsh
sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/middleeast/us-iran-oil-sanctions-.html)
and [designating an arm of the Iranian
military](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html)
as a terrorist organization.

Tensions in the Persian Gulf also rose this month after four oil tankers
were attacked with explosives. Two of the tankers are from Saudi Arabia,
one is from the United Arab Emirates and the fourth is from Norway; the
countries have not revealed the results of investigations, but Mr.
Pompeo said this week, without presenting evidence, that it was “quite
possible that Iran was behind these.”

On Thursday, the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, said Mr.
Trump might send more troops to the Middle East because of the tensions
with Iran.

“The U.S. and Iran are entering into an escalatory dynamic from which it
will become increasingly difficult to escape,” said [Robert
Malley](https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/robert-malley-0),
the president of the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that tries
to defuse
conflict.

[Dalia Dassa
Kaye](https://www.rand.org/about/people/k/kaye_dalia_dassa.html), a
Middle East analyst at RAND Corporation, a research group, said,
“Pushing through arms sales at this moment would not just escalate
tensions with Congress but also with Iran, and likely undermine peace
efforts in Yemen.”

The end run around Congress would come just weeks before the White House
is [expected to
unveil](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/us/politics/trump-middle-east-peace-plan.html)
a plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law
and main Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, is seeking support from
Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations for the plan, which will probably
include economic aid for the Palestinians but will not address their
aspirations to nationhood. King Salman of Saudi Arabia voiced his
disapproval of any White House plan after Mr. Trump [recognized the
contested city of
Jerusalem](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html)
as the capital of Israel in December 2017.

“It was only a matter of time before the administration might try to
push back against congressional upset with Saudi over Yemen and the
Khashoggi murder to resume arms sales,” said [Aaron David
Miller](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/aaron-david-miller), a
former State Department Middle East adviser and negotiator in Democratic
and Republican administrations. “What better justification than a
semi-manufactured national security war scare with Iran?”

Lawmakers have never successfully blocked an arms sale through the
passage of a joint resolution when the president has invoked a national
security justification, according to [Melissa
Dalton](https://www.csis.org/people/melissa-dalton), the director of the
Cooperative Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, and instead have typically registered their
disapproval privately.

But the invocation of the emergency provision is “pretty unusual,” Ms.
Dalton said, because “normally Congress has a good sense of what is
coming. Typically there isn’t any surprise or need to invoke this unless
there has been some controversy in the broader bilateral relationship.”

In Washington, citing Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers has called for a prohibition of certain weapons sales to
Riyadh and a blanket prohibition on the refueling of Saudi-led coalition
aircraft engaged in the civil war in Yemen.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a winding and remarkable [statement
released](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-standing-saudi-arabia/)
last year after the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, Mr. Trump argued that
punishing Saudi Arabia would jeopardize $110 billion in military sales
to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other military contractors. “If
we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the
enormous beneficiaries — and very happy to acquire all of this newfound
business,” he said.

While the Pentagon and State Department [have
denied](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/9/17671386/yemen-airstrikes-saudi-arabia-coalition-pentagon)
knowing whether American bombs were used in Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes in
Yemen — which have struck weddings, mosques and funerals — a former
senior State Department official said last year that the United States
had access to records of every airstrike since the early days of the
war.
