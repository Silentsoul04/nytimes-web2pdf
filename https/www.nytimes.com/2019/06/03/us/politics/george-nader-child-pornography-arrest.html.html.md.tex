WASHINGTON --- A
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/george-nader-special-counsel-mueller-cooperating-seychelles.html}{cooperating
witness} in the special counsel investigation into Russian election
interference has been charged with possession of child pornography,
according to court documents unsealed on Monday.

George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman who acted as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/us/politics/george-nader-mueller-investigation-united-arab-emirates.html}{an
informal adviser} to the United Arab Emirates' powerful crown prince,
was arrested on Monday after he landed at Kennedy International Airport
in New York, according to a Justice Department news release. The child
pornography charges were unsealed after his arrest.

According to the court documents, Mr. Nader was caught early last year
with iPhones containing sexually explicit videos of young boys. The
phones were discovered after he was stopped by federal agents at an
airport and questioned about his efforts to arrange meetings between
intermediaries from several foreign governments and Trump transition
officials in the weeks after the November 2016 election. Mr. Nader had
traveled to the United States to attend a party at Mar-a-Lago
celebrating President Trump's first year in office.

Mr. Nader received partial immunity in exchange for his testimony, and
he ended up spending hours before a grand jury being questioned by
prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

Mr. Nader faces 15 to 40 years in prison if he is convicted, according
to the Justice Department. A lawyer for Mr. Nader did not immediately
respond to a message seeking comment.

Index}\label{read-the-mueller-report-searchable-document-and-index}}

The findings from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, are now
available to the public. The redacted report details his two-year
investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential
election.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html}{Mueller
report} depicts Mr. Nader as a shadowy emissary who moved easily between
power centers in the Middle East and Russia, and who used those
connections to try to broker meetings with people associated with Mr.
Trump both during the campaign and after he was elected president.

Prosecutors
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/george-nader-russia-uae-special-counsel-investigation.html}{were
particularly focused} on a relationship Mr. Nader had with Kirill
Dmitriev, the head of a Russian investment fund who is close to
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. According to the Mueller report,
Mr. Nader told prosecutors that Mr. Dmitriev had said ``that his and the
government of Russia's preference was for candidate Trump to win, and
asked Nader to assist him in meeting members of the Trump campaign.''

After the election, Mr. Nader helped set up a meeting in the Seychelles
Islands off the coast of eastern Africa between Mr. Dmitriev, Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates and Erik Prince,
the former head of Blackwater who was serving as an unofficial adviser
to the Trump transition.

Months earlier, Mr. Nader and Mr. Prince had met Donald Trump Jr. at
Trump Tower. During that meeting, in August 2016, Mr. Nader told the
younger Mr. Trump that both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
were eager to help his father be elected president.

As an adviser to Prince Mohammed, Mr. Nader used his patron's vast
fortune to try to influence foreign policy during the early months of
the Trump administration. Working with Elliott Broidy, a top Republican
fund-raiser seeking Emirati and Saudi contracts for his security firm,
Mr. Nader
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/us/politics/george-nader-elliott-broidy-uae-saudi-arabia-white-house-influence.html}{helped
steer the White House} to take a hard line against Qatar --- the small
Persian Gulf nation engaged in a bitter dispute with Saudi Arabia and
the Emirates.

He also met frequently with Stephen K. Bannon and Jared Kushner, who at
the time were both senior advisers to President Trump. Mr. Bannon left
the White House in 2017.

Mr. Nader was also indicted in 1991 for violations of transporting child
pornography.
