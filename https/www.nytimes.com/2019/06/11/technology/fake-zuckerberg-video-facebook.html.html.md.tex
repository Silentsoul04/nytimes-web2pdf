SAN FRANCISCO --- Two weeks ago, Facebook declined to remove a doctored
video in which the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, seemed to
drunkenly slur her speech. Over the weekend, two British artists
released a doctored video of Facebook's chief executive, Mark
Zuckerberg, as a sly comment on the spread of false information online.

Posted to the Facebook-owned social network Instagram, the video shows
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/ByaVigGFP2U/?utm_source=ig_embed\&utm_campaign=embed_video_watch_again}{Mr.
Zuckerberg speaking directly} into the camera, boasting of nefarious
motives behind his online empire.

``Imagine this for a second: one man, with total control of billions of
people's stolen data, all their secrets, their lives, their futures,''
he appears to say. ``I owe it all to Spectre. Spectre showed me that
whoever controls the data controls the future.''

The video is easily recognizable as a fake, in part because the voice
paired with the image sounds only marginally like Mr. Zuckerberg. And
Spectre is a reference to a fictional, evil organization in James Bond
lore. But it serves both as a piece of digital commentary and as a test
of the way Facebook handles the spread of false information on its
social network.

The two artists behind the video, Bill Posters and Daniel Howe, did not
immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. Nor did
Canny AI, an Israeli advertising start-up that helped create the video.

A spokeswoman for Instagram said the fake video of Mr. Zuckerberg would
receive the same treatment as the fake video of Ms. Pelosi and other
misinformation.

``If third-party fact checkers mark it as false, we will filter it from
Instagram's recommendation surfaces like Explore and hashtag pages,''
said Stephanie Otway, a spokeswoman for the company.

The website Vice.com
\href{https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywyxex/deepfake-of-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-video-policy}{reported
on the video} earlier on Tuesday.

Facebook has been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/technology/facebook-ai-schroepfer.html}{under
pressure} to deal with the steady stream of false and misleading content
on its social network. Late last month, the video of Ms. Pelosi was
shared millions of times across Facebook and other services.

After many urged Facebook to remove the video, it declined to do so,
saying the video did not violate its policies, which also allow people
to freely express themselves online. Twitter said something similar,
while YouTube, owned by Google, removed the video.

Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials have said that artificial
intelligence technology will ultimately allow the company to control the
spread of false information, but the doctored video of Ms. Pelosi showed
disagreement among big social media companies on what is worthy of
removal.

The doctored video of Mr. Zuckerberg shows that A.I. technology is also
being used to create disinformation. Researchers are increasingly
concerned that so-called deep-learning technology can be used to create
``deep fake'' videos that are hard to distinguish from the real thing.

Canny AI
\href{https://www.fxguide.com/featured/canny-ai-imagine-world-leaders-singing/}{has
said that it can use A.I. techniques} to doctor videos, and once posted
a video of world leaders singing John Lennon's ``Imagine'' to show what
was possible.
