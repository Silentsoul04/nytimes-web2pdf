*Updated June 20, 2019*

WASHINGTON — Iran’s shooting down of an American surveillance
[drone](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/trump-iran.html)
on Thursday and the attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week
have again sent the United States and
[Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-uranium.html),
two longtime adversaries, [hurtling toward potential
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-iran-tanker-hormuz.html).
The challenges are diplomatic and economic as well as military.

But that course was set a year ago, foreign policy experts say, when
[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/trump-iran.html),
enforcing his “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran, withdrew the
United States from an Obama-era agreement meant to rein in [Iran’s
nuclear](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-uranium.html)
ambitions.

“Iran was getting repeatedly punched in the face by the [Trump
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/trump-iran.html),
and they’ve been warning for months there will be consequences,” said
Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. “The Iranian economy has long been riddled by
endemic mismanagement, corruption, cronyism, and brain drain. Sanctions
makes all these problems worse.”

Here’s a look at how the United States turned up the pressure on Iran.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## May 8, 2018

Mr. Trump made good on his campaign promise, and announced that he was
[withdrawing the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html)
from the Iran nuclear deal, dismantling the signature foreign policy
achievement of President Barack Obama. Mr. Trump said that the United
States would reimpose the stringent sanctions it had
on[Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-uranium.html)
before the deal and would consider new sanctions against it.

The nuclear deal had tightly restricted
[Iran’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/trump-iran.html)
nuclear ambitions in return for ending sanctions that had crippled its
economy.

The other signatories to the deal, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and
China, said they would remain in the agreement. But Mr. Trump put allies
on notice that European companies would face American sanctions if they
did business with Iran, and would have to choose between the United
States and Iran.

“This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been
made,” [Mr. Trump
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-speech-iran-deal.html).
The decision drew a public rebuke from Mr. Obama, who warned that the
American withdrawal would leave the world less safe, forced to face “a
losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle
East.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### **Response**

President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said that his country would continue to
abide by the terms of the deal. He criticized Mr. Trump for pulling out
of the pact as well as other international treaties.

-----

## April 8, 2019

Mr. Trump, over the objections of Pentagon officials, announced that he
was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military, its Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps, as a [foreign terrorist
organization](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html).

It was the first time that the United States named part of another
country’s government as that type of official threat. The designation
imposed wide-ranging economic and travel sanctions on the group, which
carries out operations across the Middle East, trains Arab Shiite
militias and oversee businesses in Iran. The sanctions also applied to
organizations, companies and individuals with ties to the Revolutionary
Guards.

The designation, which went into effect April 15, “will significantly
expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian
regime,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
opposed the move, arguing that it would allow Iranian leaders to justify
operations against Americans overseas, especially Special Operations
units and paramilitary units working under the C.I.A. But Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser,
pushed for it.

### **Response**

Iran’s Supreme National Security Council said it was designating as a
terrorist organization the United States Central Command, which oversees
American military operations in the Middle East.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

American officials said they began seeing stepped-up threats against
their forces in the region, as well as reports that Iranian-backed
Shiite militias were considering attacks on American troops in Iraq.

Meanwhile, Iran’s oil exports fell by more than half since Mr. Trump
announced he was pulling out of the nuclear deal, to under one million
barrels a
day.

Mr. Bolton announced that the United States was [sending an aircraft
carrier strike
group](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/middleeast/us-iran-military-threat-.html)
and Air Force bombers to the Middle East because of “troubling and
escalatory indications and warnings” related to Iran.

In a statement released on a Sunday night, Mr. Bolton said that the
deployment was intended to “send a clear and unmistakable message to the
Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of
our allies will be met with unrelenting force.”

### Response

Four oil tankers [were
attacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-oil-tanker-sabotage.html)
in the Persian Gulf a week later; Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton said Iran
was responsible. Two of the tankers belonged to Saudi Arabia and one to
the United Arab Emirates; both are adversaries of Iran and allies of the
United States. The fourth tanker is owned by a Norwegian company.

## May 8, 2019

One year after announcing he was pulling out of the nuclear deal, Mr.
Trump placed a [new round of sanctions on
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal.html),
targeting the country’s metals industry, its largest source of
nonpetroleum revenue.

“Today’s action targets Iran’s revenue from the export of industrial
metals — 10 percent of its export economy — and puts other nations on
notice that allowing Iranian steel and other metals into your ports will
no longer be tolerated,” Mr. Trump said in a
statement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Around that time, the Trump administration also hit Iranian oil exports,
by [effectively
ordering](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/middleeast/us-iran-oil-sanctions-.html)
countries worldwide to stop buying oil from the country or face
sanctions of their own. Brian Hook, the State Department’s special envoy
for Iran, said the United States would not grant waivers on sanctions to
any countries that buy Iranian oil.

“Iran has a choice,” Tim Morrison, a White House arms control adviser,
told a conference organized by a Washington-based think tank. “At some
point, even the mullahs will get it.”

### **Response**

Iran ramped up its [production of nuclear
fuel](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/iran-iaea-nuclear-fuel.html),
following through on a threat to begin walking away from the nuclear
deal.

## May 24, 2019

Mr. Trump ordered 1,500 [additional troops to the Middle
East](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/middleeast/trump-troop-increase-middle-east-iran.html)
to increase protection of American forces already there. He also
circumvented Congress and declared an emergency over Iran, moving ahead
with arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan
that had been blocked by Congress since last year.

### **Response**

Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of United States Central Command, [told
reporters traveling with him aboard the aircraft
carrier](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/06/08/carrier-sends-message-to-iran/)
Abraham Lincoln in the Persian Gulf this month that because the United
States deployed the carrier, Iran may now be “recalculating” previous
plans to attack American interests in the region.

“They are looking hard at the carrier because they know we are looking
hard at them,” Gen. McKenzie said.

## June 13, 2019

Explosions crippled two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday; the
United States military released video footage that Central Command said
shows a Revolutionary Guards patrol boat pulling up alongside one of the
stricken ships several hours after the initial explosion, and removing
an unexploded limpet mine in broad daylight. The video, American
officials said, proves that Iran was behind the attack.

### **Response**

Crude oil prices rose more than 3 percent, indirectly bolstering Iran’s
revenue as an oil producer.

## June 17, 2019

The Pentagon [authorized the
deployment](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-compliance.html)
of an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East, bringing with them
surveillance assets, missile batteries and fighter jets described
as<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“deterrence capabilities.”

### Response

Hours before the troop announcement in Washington, Iran said that it was
within 10 days of violating the 2015 containment deal. Its stockpile of
low-enriched uranium was set to exceed what was originally authorized.

-----

## June 20, 2019

In the early morning hours, an Iranian surface-to-air missile [slammed
into](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html)
a Navy RQ-4 Global Hawk, an unpiloted surveillance drone, flying over
the Strait of Hormuz at high altitude. Iran immediately accused the
United States of patrolling over its territorial waters. The Pentagon
called the strike “unprovoked” and said that the aircraft was well
within international airspace. Both Washington and Tehran released
images trying to support their
claims.

In the White House and the Pentagon, officials scrambled to come up with

Trudeau of Canada, seemed to ease off the idea of a retaliatory strike
or an escalation that could lead to war.
