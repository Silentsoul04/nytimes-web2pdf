It’s easy to see tech companies as a monolithic villain in the battle
over consumer privacy. But in fact, there are [countless tech
companies](https://spreadprivacy.com/ccpa-privacy-for-all-act/), like
mine, that believe that people have a fundamental right to avoid being
put under surveillance and that it should be easy for them to exercise
that right. By contrast, it is the big ad-tech companies — especially
Facebook and Google — that do not want to make it easy for consumers to
avoid profiling, because their business models rely on it. They are
resisting change to other proven models of advertising, even though
other companies are showing that it works.

This distinction between Big Ad Tech and everyone else in tech is
important to keep in mind as policymakers consider new regulations
intended to protect consumers’ privacy. Executives of these big
companies may individually make public statements [welcoming federal
regulation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.0a706aa010da),
but in practice they are doing everything they can to weaken existing
laws and shape new ones in their own interests. This strategy is very
obvious to the rest of us in the tech industry. And it’s essential to
get these privacy laws right today, so that people have the opportunity
to opt out of online tracking now.

The most significant example of Big Ad Tech’s influence on privacy
regulation is in California, which passed the California Consumer
Privacy Act in 2018. Industry groups representing Big Ad Tech are
leading the charge to weaken the law through
[amendments](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB753)
that would exempt the sharing of personal data for ads, as [Fast Company
recently
reported.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338036/how-big-tech-is-trying-to-shape-californias-landmark-privacy-law)
This type of “exemption” is not a minor change; it would weaken the law
so much as to make it almost meaningless. As Jacob Snow of the A.C.L.U.
of Northern California [put
it](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338036/how-big-tech-is-trying-to-shape-californias-landmark-privacy-law),
“A privacy law shouldn’t have a targeted advertisement exception for the
same reason that an environmental law shouldn’t have a coal mining
exception.”

Groups like the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which
has board members from [several big tech
companies](https://itif.org/people/board), are
[lobbying](https://itif.org/publications/2019/01/14/grand-bargain-data-privacy-legislation-america)
in Washington for similar ad-tech exemptions federally, as [The Verge
has
reported.](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182051/data-privacy-congress-grand-bargain-proposal-democrats-amazon-google-facebook-ccpa-coppa-hipaa)
They argue that strong privacy laws would hurt the digital ad market,
create high costs for businesses and curb innovation.

These are all weak arguments. There is no reason to fear that sites
cannot still make money with advertising. That’s because there are
already two kinds of highly profitable online ads: contextual ads, based
on the content being shown on screen, and behavioral ads, based on
personal data collected about the person viewing the ad. Behavioral ads
work by tracking your online behavior and compiling a profile about you
using your internet activities (and even your offline activities in some
cases) to send you targeted ads.

Contextual advertising doesn’t need to know anything about you: Search
for “car” and you get a car ad. Over the past decade, contextual ads
have been displaced by behavioral ads, aided by the rise of real-time
bidding technology that auctions off each ad on a site based on user
profiling. These behavioral ads are the ones that leave a bad taste in
your mouth. They follow you around from website to mobile app based on
your private information and, intentionally or not, enable online
[discrimination](http://fortune.com/2019/03/28/facebook-hud-discrimination/),
[manipulation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-for-the-first-time-acknowledges-election-manipulation/)
and the creation of [filter
bubbles](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles).

Strong privacy laws will force the digital advertising industry to
return to its roots in contextual advertising. That’s a good thing,
since contextual advertising does not affect privacy in the same way.
(My company uses only contextual advertising, and we compete with
Google.)

In fact, Google search advertising began and still largely operates this
way. When you enter a search request in Google, it displays ads that are
relevant to that particular search, without needing to collect
information about your search, location, purchase or browsing history.
However, Google still collects all this information because it also
powers non-search behavioral ads across the whole internet, on [more
than two million websites and
apps](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856?hl=en-GB) that use
Google’s ad services and on Google’s non-search properties, [such as
YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2454017?hl=en). Once
people are allowed to opt out of behavioral advertising, then online ads
for those who do can go back to being more like non-creepy contextual
search ads.

*\[If you use technology, someone is using your information. We’ll tell
you how — and what you can do about it.* [*Sign up for our limited-run
newsletter*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

This shift back to contextual advertising need not reduce profitability.
A [recent
poll](https://digiday.com/media/digiday-research-most-publishers-dont-benefit-from-behavioral-ad-targeting/)
by Digiday of publishing executives found that 45 percent of them saw no
significant benefit from behavioral ads, and 23 percent said they
actually caused a decline in revenue.

What about compliance costs? Companies are quickly realizing that good
privacy practices are a boon for business. People increasingly want to
[reduce their digital
footprint](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/)
and so choose companies that help them do so. Companies with good
privacy practices in their DNA do not face significant compliance costs.

And if there is anything stifling innovation in Silicon Valley, it is
the dominance of Big Ad Tech, wrought by the [surveillance
capitalism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/surveillance-capitalism-has-gone-rogue-we-must-curb-its-excesses/2019/01/24/be463f48-1ffa-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.5e058ae81558)
business model. When contextual advertising regains prominence, more
companies will be able to compete against Facebook’s and Google’s ad
networks because they won’t need huge troves of personal data to do so.
Additionally, strong privacy laws will spur innovations to help
companies use data in a privacy-respecting manner. In some fields, such
as services that help businesses analyze how people use their sites,
this innovation and resurgence of competition has [already
begun](https://www.fastcompany.com/90300072/its-time-to-ditch-google-analytics).

I am reminded of the arguments made in the 1960s and ’70s about laws to
reduce toxic emissions from cars. Companies profiting from less
regulation lobbied against those laws, and yet, [once they were
enacted](https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/accomplishments-and-success-air-pollution-transportation),
Americans’ health improved, innovations such as the modern catalytic
converter entered the market, and big companies met the new emissions
targets without catastrophic expense. If we enact strong privacy
regulation, I believe we can be similarly hopeful about the future of
privacy.
