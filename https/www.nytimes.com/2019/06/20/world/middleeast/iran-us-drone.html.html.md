WASHINGTON — President Trump approved military strikes against
[Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/trump-iran-vote.html)
in retaliation for downing an American surveillance
[drone](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/iranian-drone-shot-down.html),
but pulled back from launching them on Thursday night after a day of
escalating tensions.

As late as 7 p.m., military and diplomatic officials were expecting a
strike, after intense discussions and debate at the White House among
the president’s top national security officials and congressional
leaders, according to multiple senior administration officials involved
in or briefed on the deliberations.

Officials said the president had initially approved attacks on a handful
of Iranian targets, like radar and missile batteries.

The operation was underway in its early stages when it was called off, a
senior administration official said. Planes were in the air and ships
were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand
down, the official said.

*\[Update:* [*Facing intensifying confrontation with
Iran*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/world/middleeast/trump-iran.html)*,
Trump has few appealing options.\]*

The abrupt reversal put a halt to what would have been the president’s
third military action against targets in the Middle East. [Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/trump-iran-vote.html)
had struck twice at targets in Syria, in 2017 and 2018.

It was not clear whether Mr. Trump simply changed his mind on the
strikes or whether the administration altered course because of
logistics or strategy. It was also not clear whether the attacks might
still go forward.

Asked about the plans for a strike and the decision to hold back, the
White House declined to comment, as did Pentagon officials. No
government officials asked The New York Times to withhold the article.

The retaliation plan was intended as a response to the shooting down of
the unmanned, $130 million surveillance drone, which was struck Thursday
morning by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, according to a senior
administration official who was briefed on the military planning and
spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential plans.

The strike was set to take place just before dawn Friday in Iran to
minimize risk to the Iranian military and civilians.

But military officials received word a short time later that the strike
was off, at least
temporarily.

*\[*[*The U.S. and Iran are once again hurtling toward potential crisis.
Here’s a
timeline.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/us-iran.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)*\]*

The possibility of a retaliatory strike hung over Washington for much of
the day. Officials in both countries traded accusations about the
location of the drone when it was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile
launched from the Iranian coast along the Gulf of Oman.

Mr. Trump’s national security advisers split about whether to respond
militarily. Senior administration officials said Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo; John R. Bolton, the national security adviser; and Gina Haspel,
the C.I.A. director, had favored a military response. But top Pentagon
officials cautioned that such an action could result in a spiraling
escalation with risks for American forces in the region.

Congressional leaders were briefed by administration officials in the
Situation Room.

The destruction of the drone underscored the already tense relations
between the two countries after Mr. Trump’s recent accusations that Iran
is to blame for explosions last week that damaged oil tankers traveling
through the strait, the vital waterway for much of the world’s oil. Iran
has denied that accusation.

Iran’s announcement this week that it would soon breach one of the key
limits it had agreed to [in a 2015
pact](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html)
intended to limit its nuclear program has also fueled tensions. Mr.
Trump, who [pulled the United States out of the 2015
pact](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html),
has vowed that he will not allow Tehran to build a nuclear weapon.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump insisted that the United States’ unmanned
surveillance aircraft was flying over international waters when it was
taken down by an Iranian missile.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This drone was in international waters, clearly,” the president told
reporters on Thursday afternoon at the White House as he began a meeting
with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. “We have it all
documented. It’s documented scientifically, not just words.”

Asked what would come next, Mr. Trump said, “Let’s see what happens.”

Iran’s government fiercely disputed the president’s characterization,
insisting that the American drone had strayed into Iranian airspace.
Iran released GPS coordinates that put the drone eight miles off the
country’s coast, inside the 12 nautical miles from the shore that Iran
claims as its territorial waters.

Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in
a letter to the Security Council that the drone ignored repeated radio
warnings before it was downed. He said that Tehran “does not seek war”
but “is determined to vigorously defend its land, sea and air.”

Congressional Democrats emerged from the president’s classified briefing
in the Situation Room and urged Mr. Trump to de-escalate the situation.
They called on the president to seek congressional authorization before
taking any military action.

“This is a dangerous situation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “We are
dealing with a country that is a bad actor in the region. We have no
illusions about Iran in terms of their ballistic missile transfers,
about who they support in the region and the rest.”

Iran’s destruction of the drone appeared to provide a boost for
officials inside the Trump administration who have long argued for a
more confrontational approach to Iran, including the possibility of
military actions that could punish the regime for its support of
terrorism and other destabilizing behavior in the region.

But in his public appearance, Mr. Trump initially seemed to be looking
for a way to avoid a potentially serious military crisis. Instead of
directly accusing the leaders of Iran, Mr. Trump said someone “loose and
stupid” in Iran was responsible for shooting down the drone.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president said he suspected it was some individual in Iran who “made
a big mistake,” even as Iran had taken responsibility for the strike and
asserted that the high-altitude American drone was operating over
Iranian air space, which American officials denied.

Mr. Trump said the episode would have been far more serious if the
aircraft had been a piloted vehicle, and not a drone. It made “a big,
big difference” that an American pilot was not threatened, he told
reporters.

Last year, Mr. Trump [pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear
pact](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html?module=inline)
with Iran, over the objections of China, Russia and American allies in
Europe. He has also imposed punishing economic sanctions on Iran, trying
to cut off its already limited access to international trade, including
oil sales.

Iran has warned of serious consequences [if Europe does not find a way
around those
sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/world/europe/iran-us-nuclear-europe.html),
though it has denied involvement in the attacks on tankers near the
vital Strait of Hormuz. On Monday, Iran said it would soon stop abiding
by a central component of the nuclear deal, the limit on how much
enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile.

Both Washington and Tehran said the downing of the drone occurred at
4:05 a.m. Thursday in Iran, or 7:35 p.m. Wednesday in Washington. The
drone “was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while
operating in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz,” the
United States Central Command said in a statement. “This was an
unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international
airspace.”

*\[Update: Almost a month after Iran shot down an American spy drone,
President Trump said the American military* [*downed an Iranian
drone*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/iranian-drone-shot-down.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Iran’s ability to target and destroy the high-altitude American drone,
which was developed to evade the very surface-to-air missiles used to
bring it down, surprised some Defense Department officials, who
interpreted it as a show of how difficult Tehran can make things for the
United States as it deploys more troops and steps up surveillance in the
region.

Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, the Air Force commander for the Central
Command region in the Middle East, said the attack could have endangered
“innocent civilians,” even though officials at Central Command continued
to assert that the drone was over international waters. He said that the
closest that the drone got to the Iranian coast was 21 miles.

Late Thursday, the Defense Department released additional imagery in an
email to support its case that the drone never entered Iranian airspace.
But the department incorrectly called the flight path of the drone the
location of the shooting down and offered little context for an image
that appeared to be the drone exploding in midair.

It was the latest attempt by the Pentagon to try to prove that Iran has
been the aggressor in a series of international incidents.

Iran’s foreign affairs minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a post on
Twitter that he gave what he said were precise coordinates for where the
American drone was targeted.

“At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian
airspace,” he [said in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1141772824086028288) that

Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office reflected
the longstanding tension between the president’s desire to be seen as
tough on the world stage and his campaign promise to make sure that the
United States did not get tangled in more foreign wars.

The president has embraced a reputation as someone who punches back when
he is challenged. Only months into his tenure, Mr. Trump [launched 59
Tomahawk cruise
missiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/us-said-to-weigh-military-responses-to-syrian-chemical-attack.html)
at an air base in Syria after a chemical weapon attack.

But he has often talked about ending American involvement in
long-running conflicts abroad, describing his “America First” agenda as
having little room for being the world’s police force. [In a tweet in
January](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082484663216730113),
he said he hoped that “Endless Wars, especially those which are fought
out of judgement mistakes” would “eventually come to a glorious end\!”

According to Iranian news media, a foreign minister spokesman there said
that flying a drone into Iranian airspace was an “aggressive and
provocative” move by the United States.

Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, said crossing the country’s border was “our red line,” the
semiofficial [Mehr news agency
reported](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/146678/IRGC-releases-details-of-downing-the-intruding-US-drone).

“We are not going to get engaged in a war with any country, but we are
fully prepared for war,” Mr. Salami said at a military ceremony in
Sanandaj, Iran, according to a translation from Press TV, a state-run
news outlet. “Today’s incident was a clear sign of this precise message,
so we are continuing our resistance.”

Iranian news media said the drone had flown over Iranian territory
unauthorized, and reported that it had been shot down in the Hormozgan
Province, along the country’s southern coast on the Persian Gulf and the
Gulf of Oman.

Both the United States and Iran identified the aircraft as an RQ-4
Global Hawk, a surveillance drone made by Northrop Grumman.

“This was a show of force — their equivalent of an inside pitch,” said
Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense for international
security affairs during the Obama administration, speaking of Iran’s
decision to shoot down the drone.

[James G.
Stavridis](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/politics/james-stavridis-hillary-clinton-vice-president.html),
who retired as a four-star admiral after serving as the supreme allied
commander at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warned that the two
countries were in a dangerous game that could quickly spiral out of
control. He described Iran’s downing of the drone, which costs about
$130 million, as a “logical albeit highly dangerous escalatory move by
Iran.”
