WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors have intensified their wide-ranging
federal investigation into Elliott Broidy, a top fund-raiser for
President Trump, signaling the Justice Department’s continued interest
in questions about foreign influence on the administration.

In recent months, federal authorities have searched Mr. Broidy’s
Southern California office and subpoenaed records related to him from a
onetime business partner and from Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. They
have reportedly asked the authorities in Romania for assistance
investigating associates with whom Mr. Broidy worked to win military
intelligence contracts potentially worth as much as $64 million.

They have also charged four people who worked with Mr. Broidy on plans
to influence the administration, including on behalf of interests in
Asia, the Middle East and Europe. While the charges against three of his
associates were unrelated to their work with Mr. Broidy, most have been
asked about their relationships with him, according to several people
familiar with the investigation.

Taken together, the steps suggest mounting pressure on Mr. Broidy. And
they underscore the legal questions raised by his efforts to [parlay his
access into business
advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/elliott-broidy-trump-access-circinus-lobbying.html)
in the frenetic weeks after Mr. Trump’s election, and then to [influence
the new
administration’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/us/politics/george-nader-elliott-broidy-uae-saudi-arabia-white-house-influence.html)
policies toward the Middle East, where he was pursuing contracts worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The scrutiny comes as the Justice Department has stepped up its
[enforcement of foreign lobbying
laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/fara-task-force-justice-department.html)
and continues to investigate whether [foreign money was illegally
funneled](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html)
into Mr. Trump’s super PAC or inaugural committee.

Mr. Broidy’s lawyers have contended that he did not do anything that
would require him to lobby. One of the lawyers, Chris Clark, said in an
email on Monday that he dismissed as “utterly false” the idea that his
client used his connections to Mr. Trump to drum up business.

During Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and transition, few establishment power
brokers had ties to him, creating a vacuum that gave tremendous
influence to the relatively small group of people who could demonstrate
real connections.

While Mr. Broidy had initially supported a succession of Mr. Trump’s
Republican presidential rivals, he enthusiastically joined Mr. Trump’s
campaign when he emerged as the party’s presumptive nominee. After
helping raise money for Mr. Trump’s campaign, Mr. Broidy became a
finance vice chairman of Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee, helping it
raise a record-shattering $107 million.

Mr. Broidy, who bought a defense intelligence company called Circinus in
2015, marketed his access to Mr. Trump and his inauguration to
prospective government clients around the world, including some with
unsavory records, according to dozens of interviews and thousands of
documents stolen from Mr. Broidy’s accounts and provided to The New York
Times and other news outlets.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Three weeks before the inauguration, Mr. Broidy emailed invitations to
coveted inaugural events to Angolan officials. He also sent them a
version of a proposal under which Angola would pay Circinus as much as
$64 million for security services over five years. The Angolans
submitted a $6 million payment to Circinus three days before the
inauguration, correspondence shows, though the company did not collect
any additional funds from Angola, according to people close to Mr.
Broidy.

One of the Angolan officials invited by Mr. Broidy, André de Oliveira
João Sango, who was then serving as the director of external
intelligence, [was identified by The Times’s TV show, “The
Weekly,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/the-weekly/trump-inauguration-expensive.html)
on the red carpet at a candlelight dinner attended by Mr. Trump the
night before the inauguration. Another of the Angolan invitees, João
Lourenço, has since been elected the country’s president.

At an informal inauguration week dinner at the Trump International Hotel
near the White House, Mr. Broidy introduced Mr. Trump to two politicians
from Romania, from which Circinus was seeking contracts valued at more
than $200 million. One of the Romanian politicians, Liviu Dragnea, was
facing corruption charges that have since led to a three-and-a-half-year
prison sentence.

Mr. Dragnea, Mr. Lourenço and Mr. Sango were among the individuals named
in a subpoena sent to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee in April.

The Embassies of Romania and Angola in Washington did not respond to
requests for comment. But Romanian news outlets [have
reported](https://www.g4media.ro/exclusiv-vizita-lui-dragnea-si-grindeanu-in-america-la-ceremonia-de-inaugurare-a-presedintelui-trump-in-atentia-anchetatorilor-americani-plus-legatura-dintre-elliot-broidy-si-cristian-burci.html)
that the Justice Department has asked Romanian authorities for
assistance in collecting information from Mr. Dragnea and others about
their inauguration week visit to Washington.

Also named in the subpoena was Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the longtime
president of the Republic of Congo**,** who has been accused of funding
a lavish lifestyle with public resources. He was invited by Mr. Broidy
to a handful of inauguration week events, including the candlelight
dinner, while Circinus was pursuing business in that country. The
business never materialized**,** and Mr. Sassou-Nguesso declined the
invitation to the inauguration festivities, according to people close to
Mr. Broidy.

The inaugural committee has responded to the subpoena, a person familiar
with the committee said. The subpoena to the committee was [first
reported by The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-intensify-scrutiny-of-trump-fundraiser-elliott-broidy-11561109521)
and was issued by the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A person close to Mr. Broidy rejected the suggestion that the subpoena
represented an escalation of or an expansion in the investigation of Mr.
Broidy. The person said that for the past year, Mr. Broidy has been the
subject of an investigation being conducted by the public integrity
section of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, using a grand
jury empaneled in Washington.

The public integrity section late last year issued a subpoena to Lisa
Korbatov, a Los Angeles conservative activist who worked with Mr. Broidy
on his arrangement with the Angolan government, for documents related to
Mr. Broidy, Circinus and other companies, according to a person familiar
with the investigation.

But, highlighting the overlap between the work of different federal
prosecutors, Ms. Korbatov was also named in the Brooklyn prosecutors’
subpoena of the inaugural committee. So, too, were two other Broidy
associates involved in the Angola arrangement — Dolapo Asiru, a
Nigeria-born California investment banker, and Nickie Lum Davis, a
political fund-raiser who has retained the prominent trial lawyer Abbe
D. Lowell to represent her.

Ms. Davis and Mr. Broidy have also attracted scrutiny in a related
matter being handled by the Justice Department’s public integrity
section — the investigation into an alleged scheme to [launder millions
of dollars into the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/broidy-trump-foreign-money.html)
to help a flamboyant Malaysian financier known as Jho Low end a Justice
Department investigation.

Another figure in that investigation, the entertainer and businessman
Pras Michel, was [charged in
May](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/pras-michel-jho-low-campaign-finance.html)
with conspiring to funnel millions of dollars of Mr. Low’s money into
the 2012 presidential election. Mr. Michel, a former member of the
Fugees, a defunct hip-hop group, has pleaded not guilty. He has been
asked by prosecutors for information on what Mr. Broidy did to help the
financier, according to a person familiar with the investigation.

Mr. Broidy’s lawyers have said he never lobbied the Trump administration
to end the investigation into the Malaysian fund.

Two other associates of Mr. Broidy’s have cooperated with prosecutors
after being caught up in the investigation of the special counsel,
Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016
presidential election.

Rick Gates, who was [paid at least $125,000 by Mr.
Broidy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/us/politics/rick-gates-elliott-broidy-trump-payments.html)
for advice on navigating the Trump administration, [pleaded
guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/us/politics/rick-gates-cooperation-sentencing-delay.html)
to conspiracy and lying to the F.B.I. And George Nader, a political
adviser to the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates who [helped
Mr. Broidy’s
company](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/us/politics/george-nader-elliott-broidy-uae-saudi-arabia-white-house-influence.html)
win contracts worth at least $200 million with the oil-rich gulf nation,
[cooperated with Mr. Mueller’s
team](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/george-nader-special-counsel-mueller-cooperating-seychelles.html)
before being [arrested last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/us/politics/george-nader-child-pornography-arrest.html)
on child pornography charges.
