<div class="css-53u6y8">

Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who toyed with the idea of a
Democratic presidential campaign before [announcing in January that he
would not
run](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-trump-2020.html),
has changed his mind and intends to enter the 2020 contest on Tuesday,
according to multiple people who have been told of his plans.

Word of a possible Steyer candidacy was a surprise to the Democratic
political world, which has counted on the 62-year-old’s largess to
finance super PACs in recent years, and has grown used to his plotting
and then discarding his own ambitions for elected office.

The news that Mr. Steyer is again entertaining entering the race himself
came as a fellow northern Californian, Representative Eric Swalwell,
said that he was ending his bid for the Democratic nomination for
president, becoming the first candidate to do so since the field
expanded to historically large proportions. Mr. Swalwell, 38, made the
announcement Monday at an afternoon news conference at his campaign
headquarters in Dublin, Calif., just three months after [he declared his
candidacy in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/eric-swalwell-president-2020.html).

“We have to be honest about our own candidacy and viability,” he said.
“Today ends our presidential campaign.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

”I have no regrets,” he added later. “I’m excited about what we’ve
done.”

Mr. Swalwell had been scheduled to visit New Hampshire and attend
several events there on July 3 and 4, but a campaign spokeswoman told
The Times last week that he had canceled his plans and instead spent the
holiday with family.

Ending his presidential campaign early will allow Mr. Swalwell to shift
his attention to seeking a fifth term in the House representing Northern
California’s East Bay. He had [previously
hinted](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Eric-Swalwell-Running-for-president-if-I-m-14017678.php)
that he would assess his standing in the presidential primary in
December — California’s registration deadline to run for Congress — and
make a decision about a House run at that time. But during his news
conference Monday, he confirmed that he would seek re-election.

\[*The On Politics newsletter looks at* [*which 2020 candidates may be
eyeing other
races*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/on-politics-eric-swalwell.html)*.*\]

Mr. Steyer, on the other hand, has no other clear electoral prospects.
Though he has repeatedly toyed with running for high office, including
the governorship of California and a Senate seat there, this moment
appears to be all about entering the Democratic primary
field.

In recent weeks he instructed advisers to conduct polling and other

said. He has designated a longtime aide, Heather Hargreaves, as his
campaign manager-in-waiting, and recorded a television ad that could air
in the early voting states in the event he becomes a candidate. That
launch, associates said, could happen as soon as this week.

## Who’s Running for President in 2020?

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also advising Mr. Steyer is Doug Rubin, a Massachusetts-based strategist
who counseled Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, on a
potential 2020 campaign before Mr. Patrick announced he would not run.
Neither adviser would comment on Mr. Steyer’s plans or their own roles.

There is considerable skepticism across the Democratic Party about Mr.
Steyer’s seriousness about the presidential race, and his associates
warn not to count him as a candidate until his filing papers are signed
and submitted.

Since breaking onto the political scene by backing several high-profile
statewide initiatives in California in 2010, Mr. Steyer has engaged in a
series of heavily funded, attention-grabbing crusades, most recently
spending tens of millions of dollars to promote a campaign demanding
[President Trump’s
impeachment](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html).
That effort has flagged over the past few months, frustrating Mr.
Steyer, according to people familiar with his thoughts. He has been
among the most prolific funders of Democratic groups, though party
leaders and strategists have grumbled frequently about his penchant for
inserting his own image into television ads.

One ad for Need to Impeach, Mr. Steyer’s organization dedicated to
removing Mr. Trump, featured Mr. Steyer standing in Times Square in
front of one of his own electronic billboards, discussing his push to
impeach the president.

In January, he trekked to Iowa to make a highly promoted political
announcement, only to reveal upon arriving that he would not run.

That decision also came at a moment of personal turbulence for Mr.
Steyer: In November, he told
[Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/article/tom-steyer-interview-impeaching-donald-trump?verso=true)
that he and his wife of 32 years, Kat Taylor, were “going to try living
apart.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the years, Mr. Steyer has rotated through a formidable cast of
political consultants and advisers, hiring some of the biggest names in
Democratic politics and then discarding them — with varying degrees of
cordiality — sometimes in a matter of months. He has lost a number of
staffers in recent months to other presidential campaigns, particularly
those of Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and former Representative Beto
O’Rourke of Texas. There are significant gaps in the political
operation that surrounds him now.

Should he run, Mr. Steyer would likely face a far more searching
examination of his record than he has to date, including his background
as a hedge fund manager who invested heavily in fossil fuels. Several
populist candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have consistently signaled
that they would respond aggressively to any billionaire who entered the
race and sought to finance a candidacy with a personal fortune.

Mr. Steyer could use that vast personal wealth, estimated by Forbes
magazine at $1.6 billion, to fund a television advertising campaign
beyond the reach of anyone else in the field. His political groups spent
more backing Democratic candidates in 2018 than any other individual
except former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.

Despite those personal funds, Mr. Steyer may struggle to qualify for the
Democratic Party’s next round of debates. His name has not been included
in qualifying polls and it is highly unlikely he could attract 65,000
donors by July 16, the deadline to do so for the next set of debates
July 30 and July 31.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Swalwell’s brief candidacy illustrated the limits of simply making
the debates. Though he qualified for and participated in the first
Democratic debates in June, Mr. Swalwell barely registered in the polls,
earning 1 percent support just three times.

A member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, Mr.
Swalwell had sought to gain a following by [focusing his campaign around
gun control and gun
safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/eric-swalwell-gun-control.html).
His campaign [released an eight-part plan focused on the
issue](https://ericswalwell.com/endgunviolence/) in June that included a
call for a mandatory nationwide buyback program for assault weapons.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday in a statement he said bringing attention to the issue of gun
violence had been his priority and said he was proud of his contribution
to the Democratic policy agenda.

But neither his buyback plan, nor [verbal jabs at former Vice President
Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg during the June
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/democratic-debate-live.html),
gave him significant traction.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, another presidential contender,
[called](https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1148327721690370048)
Mr. Swalwell a “great fighter,” adding “we are a stronger nation because
of your work to protect our children and our communities from gun
violence.”

It was not immediately clear what effect, if any, Mr. Swalwell’s
departure or Mr. Steyer’s arrival would have on other candidates in what
may still be a crowded 24-person field.

[Politico reported last
week](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/hickenlooper-2020-campaign-1395051)
that several campaign staff members for former Gov. John Hickenlooper of
Colorado had left or were departing, and that he had drawn the support
of only about 13,000 donors. Mr. Hickenlooper acknowledged the turmoil
on Sunday, saying “the vast majority of the problem with the campaign
was me.” But he also pledged to stay in the race and become a better
candidate, according to [The Associated
Press](https://apnews.com/610a9549881a4aec9acb011c6560694b).

But Mr. Hickenlooper is far from the only candidate who may now be
confronting hard questions about campaign viability. Second quarter
fund-raising reports are due to the Federal Election Commission next
week, and those disclosures will make it known which candidates are
struggling financially.

In the meantime, the Democratic National Committee has [toughened debate
qualification standards](https://democrats.org/press/third-debate/) such
that more than half the remaining field is likely to be left out of the
third debate in September.

With his announcement on Monday, Mr. Swalwell became the first candidate
to withdraw from the field since Richard Ojeda, a former state senator
in West Virginia, [suspended his short-lived campaign in late
January](https://www.facebook.com/RichardOjeda2020/posts/today-i-want-to-thank-from-the-bottom-of-my-heart-all-the-people-who-have-suppor/2329884223911515/).
At that time, only a handful of candidates had officially entered the
race.
