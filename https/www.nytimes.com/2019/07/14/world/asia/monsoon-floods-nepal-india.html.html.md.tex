At least 47 people have died in Nepal and 25 more in India, with
hundreds of thousands of others displaced from their homes, after severe
flooding driven by heavy

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/world/asia/monsoon-asia-bangladesh-india.html}{South
Asia}, officials said on Sunday.

In Nepal, the areas affected worst by the deluge were in the west of the
country, Bed Nidi Kfanal, the head of the country's national emergency
operation center, said in a phone interview on Sunday.

The number of dead could rise in the coming days, he said, adding that
at least 29 people were missing and 28 others injured. The security
forces have had to stage numerous rescues.

Every year, from June to September, monsoon season brings heavy rains
that pummel South Asia, regularly provoking deadly flooding. July is
often the wettest month.

Though floods are common in Nepal during the rains, the levels of
inundation this year have been higher than usual. With the rainfall
finally beginning to ease, Mr. Kfanal expressed hope that the flooding
would recede. For now, the authorities were doing the best they could,
he said.

Neighboring countries, particularly India but also Bangladesh and
Myanmar, have also been affected.

Mohamad Farukh,

chief executive of Rapid Response}, a nongovernmental charity focusing
on disaster relief, said that at least 25 people had died so far in
India, adding that this number could increase significantly in the
coming days.

Around one million have been displaced from their homes, he said in a
text message on Sunday.

``It's in the beginning stage,'' he said of the flooding, which he
called more intense than normal. ``It is getting worse day by day
because of continuous rains and overflowing rivers,'' he added.

``Once the water recedes, then they go back home,'' he said. ``It will
take weeks, sometimes months in some areas.''

In India, the worst-affected areas were in the states of Assam and
Bihar, in the northeast, according to government officials. Around 750
people from the two states have been rescued by the country's disaster
response unit, the government

in a news release on Saturday}.

In Bangladesh, tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees living in
makeshift camps after fleeing violence in Myanmar were left especially
vulnerable to flooding. The International Organization for Migration, a
United Nations agency, said the severe rains were the worst the camps
had seen this year.

Thousands had been displaced and homes and infrastructure damaged, and
the risk of waterborne illnesses was high, the agency said.

``The rain and wind are causing misery on the ground and our teams are
working day and night to provide emergency services and relocations to
affected people,'' Manuel Pereira, the agency's deputy chief of mission
for Bangladesh,
