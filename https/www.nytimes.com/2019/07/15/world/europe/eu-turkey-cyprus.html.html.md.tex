BRUSSELS --- Turkey's relationship with the West suffered a fresh blow
on Monday when the European Union decided to suspend contacts between
high-level officials, as well as to pull financial aid, in response to
Turkey's gas exploration in Cypriot national waters.

European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said they would
suspend about \$164 million in aid to Turkey and shelve talks on an
aviation accord. They also asked the European Investment Bank to review
its lending to the country, which amounted to nearly \$434 million in
2018.

Turkey has been benefiting from European Union funding as part of its
now-stalled bid to join the bloc, while the aviation agreement that was
under negotiation would have led to more passengers using Turkish
airports, in particular the main international airport in Istanbul, as a
transit hub.

The European Union
\href{https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/07/15/turkish-drilling-activities-in-the-eastern-mediterranean-council-adopts-conclusions/}{measures}
came just days after the country's relationship with the United States
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/world/europe/turkey-russia-missiles.html}{took
a hit}, with the first shipment of a Russian-made surface-to-air missile
system to Turkey, a NATO member. Washington had warned that it would
penalize Turkey for the purchase, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
went ahead with it anyway.

The measures announced on Monday by European foreign ministers stopped
short of all-out sanctions against Turkish companies involved in
drilling in the eastern Mediterranean, one of the bloc's most
strategically sensitive corners and a flash point in relations between
European and Middle Eastern powers.

But they come as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/business/turkey-economy-crisis.html}{Turkey's
economy is struggling} and could face painful, protracted economic
sanctions from the European Union and the United States.

Cyprus has been partitioned between the ethnically Greek south and
ethnically Turkish north since Turkey invaded in 1974. The
administration of northern Cyprus is recognized only by Ankara.

Turkey said that Cyprus, a European Union member, and the
internationally recognized government that controls most of the island,
does not have rights to unilaterally explore for gas. It says Cyprus
must follow a plan proposed by the Turkish Cypriot leader to share gas
revenue, and it claims to have the right to carry out exploratory
missions itself, without approval from the government in the capital,
Nicosia.

Multiple peacemaking efforts have failed to resolve the Cyprus conflict
or unify the island, and the large gas find offshore has only made
matters worse.

This month, Turkey sent a second ship to drill for gas off the coast of
Cyprus, causing outrage in Nicosia, which successfully lobbied Brussels
for support. The European Union labeled the Turkish exploration in
Cypriot waters illegal before announcing the specific measures against
Ankara on Monday.

``The council deplores that, despite the European Union's repeated calls
to cease its illegal activities in the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey
continued its drilling operations west of Cyprus and launched a second
drilling operation northeast of Cyprus within Cypriot territorial
waters,'' the foreign ministers said in a statement after meeting and
adopting the measures late Monday.

The broader sea area around Cyprus --- which washes the shores of
Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel --- not only contains
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/energy-environment/israel-natural-gas-offshore.html}{major
natural gas deposits}, but is also strategically important to the
military forces of regional and world powers.

Cyprus is home to a permanent British military base, Russia has a major
naval base on the Syrian shore less than 90 miles from the island, and
naval forces from the United States and several other countries operate
in or pass through Cypriot waters while on missions in Africa and the
Middle East.

The European Union has a complex relationship with Turkey, as it relies
on Ankara to manage the arrival of migrants to Greece's borders, which
double as frontiers for the entire bloc.

In 2016, as the refugee crisis fueled by the Syrian war continued, the
European Union
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/world/europe/european-union-turkey-refugees-migrants.html}{agreed
to a deal} under which Turkey would take back migrants and would in turn
receive \$6.6 billion in funding. The deal, criticized by migrant-rights
organizations, is thought to have helped reduce the flow of people into
Europe and ease the congestion at migrant arrival points in Greece and
elsewhere.
