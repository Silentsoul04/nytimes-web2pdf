\textbf{Name:} MaYaa Boateng

\textbf{Age:} 28

\textbf{Hometown:} Hyattsville, Md.

\textbf{Now lives:} In a three-bedroom apartment in the Astoria
neighborhood of Queens that she shares with two roommates.

\textbf{Claim to fame:} Ms. Boateng is a young actress who uses the
theater to dissect race and politics. She appears in the play
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/theater/review-theater-as-sabotage-in-the-dazzling-fairview.html?module=inline}{Fairview},''
which won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in drama (and is currently at the
\href{https://www.tfana.org/}{Theater for a New Audience} in Brooklyn
through Aug. 11). Ms. Boateng hopes her provocative performances make
her audience sweat. ``I don't think it's a mistake that I find myself in
unconventional and unapologetic theater,'' she said. ``As an artist,
discomfort is my sweet spot.''

\textbf{Big break:} At the age of 9, she joined a local Christian
performance troupe, where she learned how to step dance and performed at
nearby churches and homeless shelters. ``Even at a young age, I was
always at the center of performance and social justice,'' she said. Her
first professional role (before getting her master of fine arts degree
at \href{https://tisch.nyu.edu/grad-acting}{New York University's Tisch
School of the Arts}) was in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/theater/reviews/a-midsummer-nights-dream-gets-a-harlem-spin.html}{a
free outdoor production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''} at Marcus
Garvey Park in Harlem in 2013. ``I learned how fearless I wanted to
become because I was surrounded by artists who had a handle and facility
with the text and their bodies in ways I didn't, but I was eager to
get,'' she said.

\textbf{Latest project:} Without giving away too much of ``Fairview,''
Ms. Boateng plays Keisha, the sporty daughter of an upper-middle-class
black family who is trying to take time off between high school and
college. Her performance has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/theater/review-theater-as-sabotage-in-the-dazzling-fairview.html}{earned
high praise}. ``I don't believe you should come to the theater to be a
spectator,'' Ms. Boateng said. ``I believe you should be a
participant.''

\textbf{Next thing:} She makes her small-screen debut, appearing in the
gritty crime drama ``\href{https://www.sho.com/city-on-a-hill}{City on a
Hill}'' on Showtime, and the
\href{https://twitter.com/OITNB/status/1143896745924947968}{final}
\href{https://twitter.com/OITNB/status/1143896745924947968}{season} of
``Orange Is the New Black,'' which premieres on Netflix on July 26. The
latter was her first TV role. ``Every time I mentioned this, folks on
set would say, ``Wow, really? You look so relaxed and like you've been
doing this forever,''' she said. ``I didn't know set lingo and camera
specifics, but one thing I did know is that you've gotta be the most
prepared. And you've gotta be the calmest in the room.''

\textbf{Clean slate:} ``Fairview'' is so charged in its examination of
race relations that the play's producers hired a therapist for the cast.
``I had to learn that I am not responsible for what people walk away
with, positive or negative,'' she said. ``The therapist taught me simple
things like washing your hands after the show as a way of being able to
say to yourself, `I am done.'''
