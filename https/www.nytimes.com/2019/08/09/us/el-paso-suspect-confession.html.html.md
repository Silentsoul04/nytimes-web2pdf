The suspect in the El Paso shooting stepped out of a vehicle with his
hands up and declared “I’m the shooter” when he was arrested minutes
after the massacre at a Walmart that killed 22 people, the police said
in an affidavit filed Friday.

The suspect, Patrick W. Crusius, 21, who is white, also divulged to the
police that he had targeted Mexicans, according to the document, written
by Detective Adrian Garcia of the El Paso Police Department.

While responding to reports of an active shooter on Saturday morning,
the document said, rangers with the Texas Department of Public Safety
saw a vehicle stop at an intersection near the Walmart. It said a man
exited the vehicle and admitted opening fire on customers and employees
in the store.

After waiving his Miranda rights, Mr. Crusius said he had used an
AK-47-style rifle and brought multiple magazines with him from Allen,
Tex., to carry out the killings, Detective Garcia wrote. Mr. Crusius’
mother had [called the Allen Police
Department](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/us/el-paso-suspect.html)
in the weeks before the shooting, asking whether her son was mature
enough to handle the rifle he had recently
ordered.

The authorities have said that the gunman wrote a [four-page
manifesto](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/us/patrick-crusius-el-paso-shooter-manifesto.html)
that said he was carrying out the attack in “response to the Hispanic
invasion of Texas.” Latinos around the United States have said they were
deeply shaken by the shooting, the [deadliest attack to target Latinos
in modern American
history](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/el-paso-shooting-mexico-border.html).

Of the victims, seven were Mexican citizens, according to the El Paso
County medical examiner’s office. Fourteen were American and one was
German.

[*searching for warning signs they might have
missed*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/us/el-paso-suspect.html)*.\]*

The suspect is facing a state capital murder charge and is being held
without bond. The El Paso prosecutor has vowed to seek the death
penalty, and federal prosecutors are considering charging the suspect
under hate crime statutes, as well as firearm laws that can carry a
death sentence.

In the affidavit, which was written hours after the massacre, Detective
Garcia wrote that the suspect had been taken to an interview room, where
he agreed to speak with another detective about the shooting. The El
Paso police chief, Greg Allen, previously said that Mr. Crusius
“basically didn’t hold anything back” in interviews with investigators
and had told them he drove for 10 to 11 hours from Allen to El Paso. He
became lost in the border city and drove to the Walmart because he was
hungry, Chief Allen said.

The El Paso killings were one of three shootings in a week that are now
being investigated by federal authorities. A gunman in Dayton, Ohio,
[killed his sibling and eight other
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/us/dayton-shooting-nan-whaley.html)
near a bar, rattling the nation less than 12 hours after the El Paso
killings and drawing renewed calls for a federal ban on assault rifles.

An F.B.I. agent said the Dayton gunman, who was killed by the police,
[had been exploring “violent
ideologies.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/mass-shootings.html)
Agents also [opened a domestic terrorism
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/gilroy-calif-shooting-domestic-terrorism.html)
into a shooting in Gilroy, Calif., after discovering that the gunman,
who killed three people and himself, had made a target list of political
and religious organizations.

The El Paso suspect’s court-appointed lawyer, Mark Stevens, has
previously declined to comment on the charges. He did not immediately
respond to an email on Friday about the reported confession.

The magistrate judge presiding over the case, Penny J. Hamilton, on
Thursday approved a request from Mr. Stevens to appoint a second lawyer,
Joe Aureliano Spencer Jr., to represent the suspect.
