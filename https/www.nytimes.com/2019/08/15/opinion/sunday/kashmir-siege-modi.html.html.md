NEW DELHI — As India celebrates her 73rd year of independence from
British rule, ragged children thread their way through traffic in Delhi,
selling outsized national flags and souvenirs that say, “Mera Bharat
Mahan.” My India is Great. Quite honestly, it’s hard to feel that way
right now, because it looks very much as though our government has gone
rogue.

Last week it [unilaterally
breached](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/opinion/modis-majoritarian-march-to-kashmir.html)the
fundamental conditions of the Instrument of Accession, by which the
former Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir acceded to India in 1947. In
preparation for this, at midnight on Aug. 4, it turned all of [Kashmir
into a giant prison
camp](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan.html).
Seven million Kashmiris were barricaded in their homes, internet
connections were cut and their phones went dead.

On Aug. 5, India’s home minister proposed in Parliament that
[Article 370 of the Indian
Constitution](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/world/asia/india-pakistan-crisis.html)
(the article that [outlines the legal
obligations](https://thewire.in/law/murder-of-insaniyat-and-of-indias-solemn-commitment-to-kashmir)that
arise from the Instrument of Accession) be overturned. The opposition
parties rolled over. By the next evening the Jammu and Kashmir
Reorganization Act, 2019 had been passed by the upper as well as the
lower house.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The act strips the State of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status —
which includes its right to have its own constitution and its own flag.
It also strips it of statehood and partitions it into two Union
territories. The first, Jammu and Kashmir, will be administered directly
by the central government in New Delhi, although it will continue to
have a locally elected legislative assembly but one with drastically
reduced powers. The second, Ladakh, will be [administered directly from
New
Delhi](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/opinion/modis-majoritarian-march-to-kashmir.html)
and will not have a legislative assembly.

The passing of the act was welcomed in Parliament by the very British
tradition of desk-thumping. There was a distinct whiff of colonialism in
the air. The masters were pleased that a recalcitrant colony had
finally, formally, been brought under the crown. For its own good. Of
course.

Indian citizens can now buy land and settle in their new domain. The new
territories are open for business. Already India’s richest
industrialist, Mukesh Ambani, of Reliance Industries, has promised
several “announcements.” What this might mean to [the fragile Himalayan
ecology](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/opinion/himalayas-mountains-dams.html)
of Ladakh and Kashmir, the land of vast glaciers, high-altitude lakes
and five major rivers, barely bears consideration.

The dissolution of the legal entity of the state also means the
dissolution of Article 35A, which granted residents [rights and
privileges](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/kashmir-special-status-explained-articles-370-35a-190805054643431.html)
that made them stewards of their own territory. So, “being open for
business,” it must be clarified, can also include Israeli-style
settlements and Tibet-style population transfers.

For Kashmiris, in particular, this has been an old, primal fear. Their
recurring nightmare (an inversion of the one being peddled by Donald
Trump) of being swept away by a tidal wave of triumphant Indians wanting
a little home in their sylvan valley could easily come
true.

As news of the new act spread, Indian nationalists of all stripes
cheered. The mainstream media, for the most part, made a low, sweeping
bow. There was dancing in the streets and horrifying misogyny on the
internet. Manohar Lal Khattar, chief minister of the state of Haryana,
bordering Delhi, while speaking about the improvement he had brought
about in the skewed gender ratio in his state[,
joked](https://twitter.com/manakgupta/status/1160083098253455360): “Our
Dhakarji used to say we will bring in girls from Bihar. Now they say
Kashmir is open, we can bring girls from there.”

Amid these vulgar celebrations the loudest sound, however, is [the
deathly silence from Kashmir’s patrolled, barricaded
streets](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan.html)
and its approximately seven million caged, humiliated people, stitched
down by razor wire, spied on by drones, living under a complete
communications blackout. That in this age of information, a government
can so easily cut off a whole population from the rest of the world for
days at a time, says something serious about the times we are heading
toward.

Kashmir, they often say, is the unfinished business of the “Partition.”
That word suggests that in 1947, when the [British drew their famously
careless
border](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/opinion/india-pakistan-partition-imperial-britain.html)through
the subcontinent, there was a “whole” that was then partitioned. In
truth, there was no “whole.” Apart from the territory of British India,
there were hundreds of sovereign principalities, each of which
individually negotiated the terms on which it would merge with either
India or Pakistan. Many that[did not wish to
merge](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24159594) were forced to.

While Partition and the horrifying violence that it caused is a deep,
unhealed wound in the memory of the subcontinent, the violence of those
times, as well as in the years since, in India and Pakistan, has as much
to do with assimilation as it does with partition. In India the project
of assimilation, which goes under the banner of nation-building, has
meant that there has not been a single year since 1947 when the Indian
Army has not been deployed within India’s borders against its “own
people.” The list is long — Kashmir, Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur,
Hyderabad, Assam.

The business of assimilation has been complicated and painful and has
cost tens of thousands of lives. What is unfolding today on both sides
of the border of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir is the
unfinished business of assimilation.

What happened in the Indian Parliament last week was tantamount to
cremating the [Instrument of
Accession](https://thewire.in/history/public-first-time-jammu-kashmirs-instrument-accession-india).
It was a document with a complicated provenance that had been signed by
a discredited king, the Dogra Hindu King, Maharaja Hari Singh. His
unstable, tattered kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir lay on the fault lines
of the new border between India and Pakistan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rebellions that had broken out against him in 1945 had been
aggravated and subsumed by the spreading bush fires of Partition. In the
western mountain district of Poonch, Muslims, who were the majority,
turned on the Maharaja’s forces and on Hindu civilians. In Jammu, to the
south, the Maharaja’s forces assisted by troops borrowed from other
princely states, massacred Muslims. Historians and news reports of the
time estimated that somewhere between [70,000 and 200,000 were
murdered](https://kashmirlife.net/circa-1947-a-long-story-67652/) in the
streets of the city, and in its neighboring districts.

Inflamed by the news of the Jammu massacre, Pakistani “irregulars”
swooped down from the mountains of the North Western Frontier Province,
burning and pillaging their way across the Kashmir Valley. Hari Singh
fled from Kashmir to Jammu from where he appealed to Jawaharlal Nehru,
the Indian prime minister, for help. The document that provided legal
cover for the Indian Army to enter Kashmir was the [Instrument of
Accession](https://thewire.in/history/public-first-time-jammu-kashmirs-instrument-accession-india).

The Indian Army, with some help from local people, pushed back the
Pakistani “irregulars,” but only as far as the ring of mountains on the
edge of the valley. The former Dogra kingdom now lay divided between
India and Pakistan. The Instrument of Accession was meant to be
[ratified by a referendum](https://undocs.org/S/RES/47\(1948\)) to
ascertain the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. That promised
referendum never took place. So was born the subcontinent’s most
intractable and dangerous political problem.

In the 72 years since then, successive Indian governments have
undermined terms of the Instrument of Accession until all that was left
of it was the skeletal structure. Now even that has been shot to hell.

It would be foolhardy to try to summarize the twists and turns of how
things have come to this. Let’s just say that it’s as complicated and as
dangerous as the games the United States played with its puppet regimes
in South Vietnam all through the 50s and 60s.

After a long history of electoral manipulation, the watershed moment
came in 1987 when New Delhi flagrantly rigged the state elections. By
1989, the thus far mostly nonviolent demand for self-determination grew
into a [full-throated freedom
struggle](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/09/21/death-in-kashmir/).
Hundreds of thousands of people poured onto the streets only to be cut
down in massacre after massacre.

The Kashmir valley soon thronged with militants, Kashmiri men from both
sides of the border, as well as foreign fighters, trained and armed by
Pakistan and embraced, for the most part, by the Kashmiri people. Once
again, Kashmir was caught up in the political winds that were blowing
across the subcontinent — an increasingly radicalized Islam from
Pakistan and Afghanistan, quite foreign to Kashmiri culture, and the
fanatical Hindu nationalism that was on the rise in
India.

The first casualty of the uprising was the age-old bond between
Kashmir’s Muslims and its tiny minority of Hindus, known locally as
Pandits. When the violence began, according to the Kashmiri Pandit
Sangharsh Samiti, or the K.P.S.S., an organization run by Kashmiri
Pandits, about 400 Pandits were targeted and murdered by militants. By
the [end
of 1990](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-kashmiris-want-a-fair-probe-into-the-killings-of-pandits-prosecution-of-guilty-4786855/),
according to a government estimate, 25,000 Pandit families had left the
valley.

They lost their homes, their homeland and everything they had. Over the
years thousands more left — [almost the entire
population](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/2011724204546645823.html).
As the conflict continued, in addition to tens of thousands of Muslims,
the K.P.S.S. says 650[Pandits have been
killed](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/201176134818984961.html)in
the conflict.

Since then, great numbers of Pandits have lived in miserable refugee
camps in Jammu city. Thirty years have gone by, yet successive
governments in New Delhi have not tried to help them return home. They
have preferred instead to keep them in limbo, and stir their anger and
understandable bitterness into a mephitic brew with which to fuel
India’s dangerous and extremely effective nationalistic narrative
about Kashmir. In this version, a single aspect of an epic tragedy is
cannily and noisily used to draw a curtain across the rest of the
horror.

Today Kashmir is one of the most or perhaps *the* most densely
militarized zone in the world. More than a half-million soldiers have
been deployed to counter what the army itself admits is now just a
handful of “terrorists.” If there were any doubt earlier it should be
abundantly clear by now that their real enemy is the Kashmiri people.
What India has done in Kashmir over the last 30 years is unforgivable.
An estimated 70,000 people, civilians, militants and security forces
have been killed in the conflict. [Thousands have been
“disappeared,”](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2008/0201/p07s03-wosc.html)
and tens of thousands have passed through torture chambers that dot the
valley like [a network of small-scale Abu
Ghraibs](http://jkccs.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TORTURE-Indian-State%E2%80%99s-Instrument-of-Control-in-Indian-administered-Jammu-and-Kashmir.pdf).

weapon of choice for crowd control. Most militants operating in the
valley today are young Kashmiris, armed and trained locally. They do
what they do knowing full well that the minute they pick up a gun, their
“shelf life” is unlikely to be more than six months. Each time a
“terrorist” is killed, Kashmiris turn up in their tens of thousands to
bury a young man whom they revere as a *shaheed*, a

These are only the rough coordinates of a 30-year-old military
occupation. The most cruel effects of an occupation that has lasted
decades are impossible to describe in an account as short as this.

In Narendra Modi’s first term as India’s prime minister, his hard-line
approach exacerbated the violence in Kashmir. In February, after a
[Kashmiri suicide
bomber](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/opinion/sunday/kashmir-india-pakistan.html)
killed 40 Indian security personnel, India launched an airstrike against
Pakistan. Pakistan retaliated. They became the first two nuclear powers
in history to actually launch airstrikes against each other. Now two
months into Narendra Modi’s second term, his government has played its
most dangerous card of all. It has tossed a lit match into a powder keg.

If that were not bad enough, the cheap, deceitful way in which it did it
is disgraceful. In the last week of July, 45,000 extra troops were
[rushed into
Kashmir](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/before-abolishing-article-370-indian-army-identified-possible-trouble-spots-in-kashmir/articleshow/70583869.cms)on
various pretexts. The one that got the most traction was that there was
a Pakistani “terror” threat to the [Amarnath
Yatra](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pilgrimage/india-boosts-hindu-pilgrimage-to-holy-cave-in-conflict-torn-kashmir-idUKKCN1UN04Q)
— the annual pilgrimage in which hundreds of thousands of Hindu devotees
trek (or are carried by Kashmiri porters) through high mountains to
visit the Amarnath cave and pay their respects to a natural ice
formation that they believe is an avatar of Shiva.

On Aug. 1, some Indian [television networks
announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ta1Dj9LHgM) that a land mine
with Pakistani Army markings on it had been found on the pilgrimage
route. On Aug. 2, the government published a notice asking all pilgrims
(and even tourists who were miles from the pilgrimage route) to [leave
the valley
immediately](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/leave-kashmir-j-k-administration-issues-security-advisory-for-amarnath-pilgrims-1576494-2019-08-02).
That set off a panicky exodus. The approximately 200,000 Indian migrant
day laborers in Kashmir were clearly not a concern to those supervising
the evacuation. Too poor to matter, I’m guessing. By Saturday, Aug. 3,
tourists and pilgrims had left and the security forces had taken up
position across the
valley.

By midnight Sunday, Kashmiris were barricaded in their homes, and all
communication networks went down. The next morning, we learned that,
along with several hundred others, three former chief ministers, Farooq
Abdullah, his son, Omar Abdullah of the National Conference and
[Mehbooba Mufti of the People’s Democratic
Party](https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/mehbooba-mufti-omar-abdullah-arrested-after-scrapping-of-article-370-1565015217174.html),
had been arrested. Those are the mainstream pro-India politicians who
have carried India’s water through the years of insurrection.

Newspapers report that the Jammu & Kashmir police force [has been
disarmed](https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/disarmed-fall-guys-of-article-370/cid/1696748).
More than anybody else, these local police men have put their bodies on
the front line, have done the groundwork, provided the apparatus of the
occupation with the intelligence that it needs, done the brutal bidding
of their masters and, for their pains, earned the contempt of their own
people. All to keep the Indian flag flying in Kashmir. And now, when the
situation is nothing short of explosive, they are going to be fed to the
furious mob like so much cannon fodder.

The betrayal and public humiliation of India’s allies by Narendra Modi’s
government comes from a kind of hubris and ignorance that has gutted the
sly, elaborate structures painstakingly cultivated over decades by
cunning, but consummate, Indian statecraft. Now that that’s done — it is
down to the Street vs. the Soldier. Apart from what it does to the young
Kashmiris on the street, it is also a preposterous thing to do to
soldiers.

The more militant sections of the Kashmiri population, who have been
demanding the right to self-determination or merger with Pakistan, have
little regard for India’s laws or constitution. They will no doubt be
pleased that those they see as collaborators have been sold down the
river and that the game of smoke and mirrors is finally over. It might
be too soon for them to rejoice. Because as sure as eggs are eggs and
fish are fish, there will be new smoke and new mirrors. And new
political parties. And a new game in town.

On Aug. 8, four days into the lockdown, [Narendra Modi appeared on
television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0bNYhPJnxk) to address an
ostensibly celebrating India and an incarcerated Kashmir. He sounded
like a changed man. Gone was his customary aggression and his jarring,
accusatory tone. Instead he spoke with the tenderness of a young mother.
It’s his most chilling avatar to
date.

His voice quivered and his eyes shone with unspilled tears as he listed
the slew of benefits that would rain down on the people of the former
State of Jammu and Kashmir, now that it was rid of its old, corrupt
leaders, and was going to be ruled directly from New Delhi. He evoked
the marvels of Indian modernity as though he were educating a bunch of
feudal peasants who had emerged from a time capsule. He spoke of how
Bollywood films would once again be shot in their verdant valley.

He didn’t explain why Kashmiris needed to be locked down and put under a
communications blockade while he delivered his stirring speech. He
didn’t explain why the decision that supposedly benefited them so
hugely was taken without consulting them. He didn’t say how the great
gifts of Indian democracy could be enjoyed by a people who live under a
military occupation. He remembered to greet them in advance for Eid, a
few days away. But he didn’t promise that the lockdown would be lifted
for the festival. It wasn’t.

The next morning, the Indian newspapers and several liberal
commentators, including some of Narendra Modi’s most trenchant critics
gushed over his moving speech. Like true colonials, many in India who
are so alert to infringements of their own rights and liberties, have a
completely different standard for Kashmiris.

On Thursday, Aug. 15, in his Independence Day speech, Narendra Modi
boasted from the ramparts of Delhi’s Red Fort that his government
finally had achieved India’s dream of “[One Nation, One
Constitution,](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-india-independenceday-modi/indias-modi-trumpets-kashmir-muslim-marriage-moves-in-independence-day-speech-idUKKCN1V50K4)”
with his Kashmir move. But just the previous evening, [rebel groups in
several troubled states in the north east of
India](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kashmir-effect-rebel-groups-ban-independence-day-celebrations-in-northeast-1580947-2019-08-14),
many of which have Special Status like the erstwhile State of Jammu and
Kashmir, announced a boycott of Independence Day. While Narendra Modi’s
Red Fort audience cheered, about seven million Kashmiris remained locked
down. The communication shutdown, we now hear, could be extended for
some time to come.

When it ends, as it must, the violence that will spiral out of Kashmir
will inevitably spill into India. It will be used to further inflame the
[hostility against Indian
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/opinion/india-muslims-hindus-partition.html)
who are already being demonized, ghettoized, pushed down the economic
ladder, and, with terrifying regularity,
[lynched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFRuKs7ZfEk). The state will
use it as an opportunity to close in on others, too — the activists,
lawyers, artists, students, intellectuals, journalists — who have
protested courageously and openly.

The danger will come from many directions. The most powerful
organization in India, the far-right Hindu nationalist [Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh, or the
R.S.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/magazine/the-other-face-of-fanaticism.html),
with more than 600,000 members including Narendra Modi and many of his
ministers, has a trained “volunteer” militia, inspired by Mussolini’s
Black Shirts. With each passing day, the R.S.S. tightens its grip on
every institution of the Indian state. In truth, it has reached a point
when it more or less *is* the state.

In the benevolent shadow of such a state, numerous smaller [Hindu
vigilante
organizations](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-rss-bhonsala-military-school-dhirendra-k-jha),
the storm troopers of the Hindu Nation, have mushroomed across the
country, and are conscientiously going about their deadly business.

[Intellectuals and
academics](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/magazine/gauri-lankesh-murder-journalist.html)
are a major preoccupation. In May, the morning after the Bharatiya
Janata Party won the general elections, Ram Madhav, a general secretary
of the party and a former spokesman for the R.S.S., wrote that the
“remnants” of the “pseudo-secular/liberal cartels that held a
disproportionate sway and stranglehold over the intellectual and policy
establishment of the country … [need to be
discarded](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-result-narendra-modi-bjp-government-congress-5745313/)from
the country’s academic, cultural and intellectual landscape.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Aug. 1, in preparation for that “discarding,” the [already
draconian](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/07/27/back-future/indias-2008-counterterrorism-laws)
Unlawful Activities Prevention Act was amended to expand the definition
of “terrorist” to include individuals, not just organizations. The
amendment allows the government [to designate any individual as a
terrorist](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/uapa-amendment-bill-gets-rajya-sabha-approval/article28796520.ece)without
following the due process of a First Information Report, charge sheet,
trial and conviction. Just who — just what kind of individuals it means
— was clear when in Parliament, Amit Shah, our chilling [home
minister,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnd_ELCFhCM)said: “Sir, guns
do not give rise to terrorism, the [root of terrorism is the
propaganda](https://thewire.in/rights/uapa-bjp-terrorist-amit-shah-nia)
that is done to spread it … And if all such individuals are designated
terrorists, I don’t think any member of Parliament should have any
objection.”

Several of us felt his cold eyes staring straight at us. It didn’t help
to know that he has done time as the main accused in a series of murders
in his home state, Gujarat. His trial judge, Justice [Brijgopal
Harkishen Loya](https://caravanmagazine.in/tag/loya), died mysteriously
during the trial and was replaced by another who acquitted him speedily.
Emboldened by all this, far-right television anchors on hundreds of
India’s news networks, now openly denounce dissidents, make wild
allegations about them and call for their arrest, or worse. “Lynched by
TV,” is likely to be the new political phenomenon in India.

As the world looks on, the architecture of Indian fascism is quickly
being put into place.

I was booked to fly to Kashmir to see some friends on July 28. The
whispers about trouble, and troops being flown in, had already begun. I
was of two minds about going. A friend of mine and I were chatting about
it at my home. He is a senior doctor at a government hospital who has
dedicated his life to public service, and happens to be Muslim. We
started talking about the new phenomenon of mobs surrounding people,
Muslims in particular, and forcing them to chant “[Jai Shri
Ram](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-48882053)\!” (“Victory
to Lord Ram\!”)

If Kashmir is occupied by security forces, India is occupied by the mob.

He said he had been thinking about that, too, because he often drove on
the highways out of Delhi to visit his family who live some hours away.

“I could easily be stopped,” he said.

“You must say it then,” I said. “You must survive.”

“I won’t,” he said, “because they’ll kill me either way. That’s what
they did to [Tabrez
Ansari](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/tabrez-ansari-18th-mob-violence-victim-in-jharkhand-in-three-years-5808122/).”

These are the conversations we are having in India while we wait for
Kashmir to speak. And speak it surely will.
