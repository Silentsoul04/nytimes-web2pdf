\textbf{Name:} Dizzy Fae

\textbf{Age:} 21

\textbf{Hometown:} St. Paul

\textbf{Now lives:} In a one-bedroom apartment in South Minneapolis

\textbf{Claim to fame:} Ms. Fae makes
\href{https://soundcloud.com/dizzy-fae}{genre-defying R\&B} music that
drifts between experimental electronica, jazz and the sensual grooves of
``The Velvet Rope''-era Janet Jackson. ``I create music that is
evolving,'' she said. Her uncategorizable sound comes naturally to her
as a young biracial woman who identifies as queer. ``I never question
sharing my authenticity with anyone,'' she said.

\textbf{Big break:} She wrote her debut single,
``\href{https://soundcloud.com/dizzy-fae/color-me-bad}{Color Me Bad},''
when she was just 16. When Zane Lowe, the influential BBC Radio 1 D.J.,
\href{https://twitter.com/dizzyfae/status/717788243094216705}{premiered}
the track on his Beats 1 radio show in 2016, Ms. Fae was in the middle
of a senior-year vocal class at the Saint Paul Conservatory For
Performing Artists. ``My teachers were worried because I kept running to
the bathroom to check my phone,'' she said. Shortly after graduation,
she joined
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/style/lizzo-truth-hurts.html}{Lizzo}
on her nationwide tour. In 2018, she dropped her debut mixtape
``\href{https://soundcloud.com/dizzy-fae/sets/dizzy-fae-free-form-mixtape}{Free
Form}.'' ```Free Form' is a free-flowing spirit doing whatever she wants
and calling it a mixtape,'' she said.

\textbf{Latest project:} Her new mixtape,
``\href{https://soundcloud.com/dizzy-fae/sets/no-gmo-mixtape-1}{No
GMO},'' was released in June. The project's title refers to her interest
in avoiding unnecessary additives, whether in the kitchen or recording
studio. ``It's important to stay clean,'' she said. ``You are what you
eat.''

\textbf{Next thing:} Ms. Fae is putting together a club night in her
hometown called ``Dizzyland'' and an European tour that will kick off in
October. ``I am a very spontaneous person,'' she said. ``Each day I wake
up not knowing what will happen.''

\textbf{Double rainbow:} In celebration of this year's World Pride in
New York, she performed the headlining set at
\href{https://outbuzz.com/gay-parties/leslie-pride-2019/}{Leslie Pride
2019}, a queer party held in \href{https://www.conceptny.com}{the cellar
of Hotel 50 Bowery}. ``It had been raining that day and I looked up at
the sky and there were two rainbows,'' she said. ``It was one of those
days I will be talking about for years to come.''
