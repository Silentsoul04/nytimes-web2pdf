A dozen residents' deaths were ruled homicides by a medical examiner
after the nursing home's air-conditioners failed in 2017.

The police in Hollywood, Fla., plan to charge four employees of a
nursing home in the deaths of a dozen residents who succumbed to heat
exposure there in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in 2017, lawyers for
three of the employees said on Saturday.

Among those charged will be Jorge Carballo, the administrator of the
nursing home, as well as a charge nurse and two other nurses, the
lawyers said.

Eight people died on Sept. 13, 2017, at the nursing home, the
Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, after air-conditioners failed
in the wake of the powerful hurricane. Several more died in the
following weeks. A local medical examiner ruled that 12 of the
heat-related deaths were homicides.

The center was shut down, and investigations by the state and Senate
found that some nurses had failed to properly record patient
information, including vital signs and temperatures. The investigations
also found that poor state and federal oversight and regulation had led
to ``questionable decision-making by facility administrators.''

In one instance, a patient was described as ``resting in bed'' with
``even and unlabored'' breathing when the patient was already dead, a
state report said. Nursing home officials have said they
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/us/florida-nursing-home.html}{tried
to alert state authorities} and the power company that they needed help
restoring the air-conditioning system --- and got none. More than 100
patients were transferred from the nursing home to hospitals.

The governor criticized the home for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/us/nursing-home-deaths-911.html}{not
calling 911} until residents were suffering respiratory distress, and in
some cases were near death. A lawyer for the nursing home responded that
patients were constantly monitored and that there was no reason to call
911 before they actually became ill.

David Frankel, a lawyer for the charge nurse, said he believed his
client would be charged with 12 counts of manslaughter. The other
lawyers said they had not been told what charges would be filed, but
they expected manslaughter to be among them.

The Hollywood Police Department did not return a call seeking comment on
Saturday.

Jim Cobb, a lawyer for Mr. Carballo said he was outraged by the
\href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/hollywood/fl-ne-arrests-tip-hollywood-nursing-home-deaths-20190824-743bjqf63fchdbcvunctelb6uq-story.html?outputType=amp}{planned
charges}. He said the police were going after people who were trying to
help in the days after the hurricane devastated Caribbean islands and
resulted in the deaths of 129 people,
\href{https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL112017_Irma.pdf}{according to
the National Hurricane Center}.

``It's the government scapegoating and going as far down the food chain
as they can possibly go to absolve themselves of the problems that were
caused,'' Mr. Cobb said. ``This is just wrong.''

Lawrence Hashish said he was representing one of the nurses who would
face charges. Mr. Cobb and Mr. Hashish said they expected their clients
to surrender on Monday after the police obtain an arrest warrant.

``This has been a two-year investigation and now they're bringing the
charges?'' Mr. Hashish said. ``If there was neglect, they would have
known 22 months ago.''

It is rare for authorities to bring criminal charges against health care
professionals in deaths during natural disasters. After Hurricane
Katrina in 2005, prosecutors in Louisiana
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/us/nationalspecial/owners-of-nursing-home-charged-in-deaths-of-34.html}{charged}
a couple with negligent homicide after 34 people
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/us/nationalspecial/in-nursing-home-a-fight-lost-to-rising-waters.html}{died}
in their nursing home in New Orleans. But a jury
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/us/nationalspecial/08nursing.html}{acquitted
the husband and wife two years later} after four hours of deliberation.

Mr. Cobb led the couple's defense team then, and had sought to blame the
state and federal government for the deaths of the trapped residents,
which made up the single deadliest episode of the storm that led to
\href{https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL122005_Katrina.pdf}{1,833
deaths}.

On Saturday, Mr. Cobb said he planned to use a similar strategy to
defend Mr. Carballo.

``I can assure you we will be blaming lots of folks,'' Mr. Cobb said.
