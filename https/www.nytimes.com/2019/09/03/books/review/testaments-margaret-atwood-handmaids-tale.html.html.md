**THE TESTAMENTS**  
By Margaret Atwood

The most chilling — and timely — lines in “The Handmaid’s Tale” occur
near the beginning of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel. Offred and her
shopping partner Ofglen are walking past the Wall — a landmark that once
belonged to a famous university in Cambridge, Mass., and is now used by
the rulers of Gilead to display the corpses of people executed as
traitors. As she looks at six new bodies hanging there, Offred remembers
the unnerving words of their warden and teacher Aunt Lydia: “Ordinary,”
she said, is “what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you
now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary.”

Nothing changes instantaneously, Offred observes: “In a gradually
heating bathtub you’d be boiled to death before you knew it.” How did
the United States of America become the totalitarian state of Gilead — a
place where women are treated as “two-legged wombs”; where nonwhite
residents and unbelievers (that is, Jews, Catholics, Quakers, Baptists,
anyone who does not embrace the fundamentalist extremism of Gilead) are
resettled, exiled or disappeared; where the leadership deliberately uses
gender, race and class to divide the country? It started before ordinary
citizens like herself were paying attention, Offred remembers: “We
lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn’t the same as ignorance, you
have to work at it.”

In “The Testaments,” Atwood’s compelling sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale”
— which takes place a decade and a half later — Offred makes only the
briefest of appearances, speaking a scant three sentences. But she has
attained almost mythic status in Gilead, where she’s been declared a
terrorist and enemy of the state: The regime has already made at least
two assassination attempts on her life, and it’s turned Baby Nicole, the
daughter Offred (in the TV series adaptation) had smuggled across the
border to Canada, into a poster girl martyr.

The main story line in “The Testaments” is a kind of spy thriller about
a mole inside Gilead, who is working with the Mayday resistance to help
bring down the evil empire. It’s a contrived and heavily stage-managed
premise — but contrived in a Dickensian sort of way with coincidences
that reverberate with philosophical significance. And Atwood’s sheer
assurance as a storyteller makes for a fast, immersive narrative that’s
as propulsive as it is melodramatic.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

*\[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of September.*
[*See the full
list*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/books/new-september-books.html)*.
\]*

That story unfolds through three overlapping narratives. One is told by
Nicole, now a young woman of 16 living in Canada under another name. One
is told by Agnes Jemima, Offred’s older daughter (known as Hannah in the
TV series), who, at the age of 5, was snatched away from Offred as she
and her husband, Luke, were attempting to flee to Canada, and who has
since grown up in Gilead with foster parents. And one is told by Aunt
Lydia, the implacable enforcer, who has imposed Gilead’s draconian rules
on the Handmaids with vengeful relish.

The Hulu TV adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale” has awkwardly tried to
make Aunt Lydia more than a cartoonish villain by sketching in her back
story, suggesting that loneliness and shame in her own life fueled her
cruelty. In “The Testaments,” Atwood makes a more convincing case for
Lydia’s complexity: She has made Lydia (like Offred, Offred’s daughters
and so many characters in the author’s earlier novels like “Surfacing”
and “Cat’s Eye”) a survivor, someone who’s done what she thinks is
necessary to avoid death or further loss. To save herself in the early
days of Gilead, Lydia became a collaborator with the regime, and she
rises within the leadership by playing coldblooded, hardball politics.
Her involvement in a Mayday resistance plot to undermine Gilead has as
much to do with deadly rivalries within the regime’s elite as it does
with her own disillusionment over growing corruption and hypocrisy in
the theocracy.

This is only one of myriad differences between Atwood’s fleet-footed
sequel and the television adaptation. Under the guidance of the
showrunner Bruce Miller, the TV series did a brilliant job in Season 1
of translating the novel to the screen, but in generating new story
lines for Seasons 2 and 3, the show’s writers have subjected Offred
(played by the gifted Elisabeth Moss) to a wearisome “Groundhog Day”
loop of tribulations, including several failed escape attempts,
repetitious, soap-opera confrontations with Serena and Aunt Lydia and
more and more preposterous situations calling for bad-ass heroics.

In the interests of heightening the depravity of the Gilead regime, the
TV writers have told an increasingly grisly story, which dwells, at
gruesome length, on sadistic tortures inflicted upon the Handmaids: In
addition to the ritualized rapes described in the novel, there are
finger amputations, Taser assaults, an excised eyeball, hands scorched
on hot stoves, muzzles and metal rings used to keep the women’s mouths
clamped shut — the sort of abominations more likely to be found in the
misogynistic horror porn that Offred’s activist mother wanted to burn,
than in a feminist allegory.

In both “The Handmaid’s Tale” (the novel) and “The Testaments,” Atwood
wisely focuses less on the viciousness of the Gilead regime (though
there is one harrowing and effective sequence about its use of emotional
manipulation to win over early converts to its cause), and more on how
temperament and past experiences shape individual characters’ very
different responses to these dire circumstances.

Atwood understands that the fascist crimes of Gilead speak for
themselves — they do not need to be italicized, just as their relevance
to our own times does not need to be put in boldface. Many American
readers and viewers of “The Handmaid’s Tale” are already heavily
invested in the story of Gilead because we’ve come to identify with the
Handmaids’ hopes that the nightmare will end and the United States —
with its democratic norms and constitutional guarantees — will soon be
restored. We identify because the events in Atwood’s novel — which not
so long ago felt like something that could only happen in the distant
past or in distant parts of the globe — now feel frighteningly real.
Because news segments on television in 2019 are filled with images of
children being torn from their parents’ arms, a president using racist
language to sow fear and hatred and reports of accelerating climate
change jeopardizing life as we know it on the planet. This also explains
why the scenes in “The Handmaid’s Tale” that feel most haunting today
are the flashbacks in which Offred remembers her former life in America,
when she and her friends took for granted the rights and freedoms they
enjoyed, when people reassured one another that whatever emergency
measures taken by the new government (in the name of protecting against
Islamic terrorism) were temporary and that normalcy would soon return.

Enduring dystopian novels look backward and forward at the same time.
[Orwell’s
“1984”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/books/why-1984-is-a-2017-must-read.html)
was at once a savage satire of the Soviet Union under Stalin — from its
rewriting of history to its cult of personality to its use of torture
and propaganda — and a shrewd anatomy of totalitarianism that foretold
the rise of the surveillance state and the fire hose of falsehood spewed
forth daily by Putin’s Kremlin and Trump’s White House in attempts to
redefine reality. Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” reflected its
author’s worries in the 1930s that individual freedom was threatened
by both communism and assembly-line capitalism, and it anticipated a
technology-driven future in which people would be narcotized and
distracted to death by trivia and entertainment.

Atwood, who began “The Handmaid’s Tale” in the Orwellian year of 1984,
decided that she would include nothing in the novel “that had not
already happened” somewhere, some time in history, or any technology
“not already available.” She extrapolated some of the trends she saw
in the 1970s and early ’80s, like the rising fundamentalist movement in
America. She imagined what she called “the heavy-handed theocracy of
17th-century Puritan New England — with its marked bias against women” —
reasserting itself during a period of social chaos. And she drew upon
historical horrors like the Nazis’ Lebensborn program and public
executions in countries like North Korea and Saudi Arabia to delineate
the malign machinery of the Gilead regime.

Atwood’s creation of Gilead, like her creation of the futuristic
wasteland that serves as a backdrop to “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of
the Flood,” was informed by her wide-ranging reading in dystopian
literature and related genres, lending these novels a faintly
postmodernist density and gloss. The stories of Nicole and Agnes in “The
Testaments” similarly reflect Atwood’s easy familiarity with Victorian
literature, which she studied in graduate school at Harvard in the
1960s.

The sisters’ quests to discover their family roots, for instance, mirror
the efforts made by so many of the orphans in 19th-century literature,
like Dickens’s Pip and Oliver Twist. Much the way that Offred struggled
in “The Handmaid’s Tale” to come to terms with the expectations of her
radical feminist mother, in “The Testaments” Nicole and Agnes find their
search for self-definition tied up in questions about their real
mother’s identity. Nicole is shocked to learn that the life she’s been
leading in Canada — as Daisy, the daughter of owners of a used-clothing
store — is “a forgery.” Agnes realizes that much of what she grew up
believing about Gilead has been a lie — that the regime’s corrupt
leaders have been rewriting the Bible in a Big Brother-like endeavor to
market and justify their dictatorial rule.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If Agnes comes across as willfully naïve in the opening sections of “The
Testaments,” Atwood appears to be making the point that Agnes begins as
a very ordinary girl. Ordinary in the way that Offred was ordinary in
“The Handmaid’s Tale” — a smart, resourceful young woman, more
concerned, initially, with the travails of daily life than with politics
or the larger world. Atwood’s Offred was not a rebel like her friend
Moira and not an ideologue like her mother. In fact, she asserted that
she didn’t want to be “the incarnation” of her feminist mother’s ideas,
didn’t want to have to “vindicate her life for her.”

Perhaps because some fans had complained that Atwood’s Offred was too
passive, the TV writers have been transforming her, in Seasons 2 and 3,
into a ferocious (and at times ruthless) warrior queen, willing to
compromise her own morals if it furthers her ends; a committed member of
the resistance whose quest has evolved from getting her own daughter
back, to trying to evacuate dozens of children to Canada.

But while this makes for a more dramatic heroine who can grow and change
over multiple seasons of TV, it’s worth remembering that the very
ordinariness of Atwood’s Offred gave readers an immediate understanding
of how Gilead’s totalitarian rule affected regular people’s lives. The
same holds true of Agnes’s account in “The Testaments,” which is less an
exposé of the hellscape that is Gilead than a young girl’s chronicle of
her family life and education there, and the unexpected turn of events
that lead her to play a pivotal role in determining the regime’s fate.

[In a 2017
essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html),
Atwood described writing Offred’s story in the tradition of “the
literature of witness” — referring to those accounts left by people
bearing witness to the calamities of history they’ve experienced
firsthand: wars, atrocities, disasters, social upheavals, hinge moments
in civilization. It’s a genre that includes the diary of Anne Frank, the
writings of Primo Levi, the choral histories assembled by the Nobel
Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich from intensive interviews with
Russians, remembering their daily lives during World War II, the
Chernobyl accident or the Afghanistan war. Agency and strength, Atwood
seems to be suggesting, do not require a heroine with the visionary
gifts of Joan of Arc, or the ninja skills of a Katniss Everdeen or
Lisbeth Salander — there are other ways of defying tyranny,
participating in the resistance or helping ensure the truth of the
historical record.

\[ *[Read Atwood’s essay “What ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Means in the Age of
Trump.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html)*
\]

The very act of writing or recording one’s experiences, Atwood argues,
is “an act of hope.” Like messages placed in bottles tossed into the
sea, witness testimonies count on someone, somewhere, being there to
read their words — even if it’s the pompous, myopic Gileadean scholars
who narrate the satirical epilogues to both “The Handmaid’s Tale” and
“The Testaments.”

As Atwood no doubt knows, one of the definitions given by Bible
dictionaries for “Gilead” is “hill of testimony.” And in testifying to
what they have witnessed, Offred, Nicole, Agnes and, yes, Lydia are
leaving behind accounts that will challenge official Gileadean
narratives, and in doing so, they are standing up to the regime’s
determination to silence women by telling their own stories in their own
voices.
