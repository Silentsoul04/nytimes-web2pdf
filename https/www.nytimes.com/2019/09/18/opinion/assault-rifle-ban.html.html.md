“Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” [Beto O’Rourke
exclaimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/us/orourke-debate-guns-take-ar15.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes)
at last week’s Democratic debate. The gathered crowd was enthusiastic
about the proposal, but other Texans were … less receptive.

One — Briscoe Cain, a Republican state legislator from the Houston
exburbs — responded with an ominous
[tweet](https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1172359875093061632/photo/1):
“My AR is ready for you Robert Francis” (addressing Mr. O’Rourke by his
given name).

Mr. O’Rourke first brought up the mandatory buyback idea shortly after
August’s string of mass shootings. Several well-known conservative
commentators met the proposal with a series of warnings, exposing
chilling and increasingly open hostility to majoritarian democracy on
the right.

“So, this is — what you are calling for is civil war,” [Tucker
Carlson](https://www.mediamatters.org/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-says-gun-buyback-program-will-lead-civil-war)
of Fox News said of Mr. O’Rourke’s comments. “What you are calling for
is an incitement to violence.” On ABC’s “The View,” [Meghan McCain
maintained](https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1168928087163248640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1168928087163248640&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motherjones.com%2Fpolitics%2F2019%2F09%2Fbriscoe-cain-beto-orourke%2F)
that “the AR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America, by far. I was
just in the middle of nowhere Wyoming. If you’re talking about taking
people’s guns from them, there’s going to be a lot of violence.” On
Twitter, the conservative writer [Erick Erickson
said](https://twitter.com/EWErickson/status/1169339895002914816): “I
know people who keep AR-15’s buried because they’re afraid one day the
government might come for them. I know others who are stockpiling them.
It is not a stretch to say there’d be violence if the gov’t tried to
confiscate them.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bear in mind a critical point: A buyback law could not take effect
without approval from majorities in both houses of Congress and
endorsement by the president. This is all but impossible without unified
Democratic control of government; in fact, because our electoral system
puts Democrats at a forbidding structural disadvantage, especially in
the Senate, Democrats would need to command overpowering supermajority
support to turn such a proposal into law.

In that light, all of these ominous “there will be violence” warnings
clearly imply that *it simply doesn’t matter* whether or not mandatory
buyback legislation is enacted by duly elected representatives of the
American people with an extraordinary popular mandate, because the
wildly outvoted minority would nevertheless be right to regard the law
as an intolerable injustice that warrants retaliatory violence. Just ask
them.

The likes of Erick Erickson jamming a cocked finger into his jacket
pocket and pointing it at democracy may not strike terror in your heart.
But the seditious principle behind these blustering, elliptical threats
is genuinely alarming.

Democracy is what we do to prevent political disagreement from turning
into violent conflict. But the premise of Trumpist populism is that the
legitimacy and authority of government is conditional on agreement with
the political preferences of a shrinking minority of citizens — a group
mainly composed of white, Christian conservatives.

Who, you may sensibly ask, granted Tucker Carlson’s target demographic
veto power over the legislative will of the American people? Nobody.
They got high on their own supply and anointed themselves the “real
American” sovereigns of the realm. But their relative numbers are
dwindling, and they live in fear of a future in which the law of the
land reliably tracks the will of the people. Therein lies the appeal of
a personal cache of AR-15s.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Weapons of mass death, and the submissive fear they engender, put teeth
on that shrinking minority’s entitled claim to indefinite power. Without
the threat of violence, what have they really got? Votes? Sooner or
later, they won’t have enough, and they know it.

Nearly every Republican policy priority lacks majority support. New
restrictions on abortion are
[unpopular](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/new-abortion-laws-are-too-extreme-for-most-americans-poll-shows).
Slashing legal immigration levels is unpopular. The president’s single
major legislative achievement, tax cuts for corporations and high
earners, is unpopular.

Public support for enhanced background checks stands at [an
astonishing 90
percent](https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2019/09/09/12/58/suffolk-university-usa-today-poll-guns-sept-2019),
and [60
percent](https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2019/9_9_2019_marginals_pdftxt.pdf?la=en&hash=643B7DFBB5697987D73D59B15DC83E5F7D584CDA)
([and
more](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/07/poll-most-voters-support-assault-weapons-ban-1452586))
support a ban on assault weapon sales. Yet Republican legislatures block
modest, popular gun control measures at every turn. The security of the
minority’s self-ascribed right to make the rules has become their
platform’s major plank, because unpopular rules don’t stand a chance
without it. Float a rule that threatens their grip on power, no matter
how popular, and it’s “my AR is waiting for you, Robert Francis.”

They’ll tell you their thinly veiled threats are *really* about
defending their constitutional rights. Don’t believe it. The
conservative Supreme Court majority’s 2008 decision in District of
Columbia v. Heller [found](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290) an
individual right to own guns for self-protection, but no civilian needs
a weapon [capable of shooting 26 people in 32
seconds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/dayton-shooter-video-timeline.html)
to ward off burglars. The Second Amendment [doesn’t grant the right to
own
one](https://beta.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/02/22/does-the-second-amendment-really-protect-assault-weapons-four-courts-have-said-no/)
any more than it grants the right to own a surface-to-air missile.

They’ll tell you their foreboding “predictions” of lethal resistance are
*really* about preserving the means to protect the republic against an
overweening, rights-stomping state. Don’t believe that, either. It’s
*really* about the imagined peril of a multicultural majority running
the show. Many countries that do more to protect their citizens against
gun violence are more, not less, free than we are. [According to the
libertarian Cato
Institute](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2018-revised.pdf),
16 countries enjoy a higher level of overall freedom than the United
States, and most of them ban or severely restrict ownership of assault
weapons. The freedom to have your head blown off in an Applebee’s, to
flee in terror from the bang of a backfiring engine, might not be
freedom at all.

I’m not too proud to admit that in my misspent libertarian youth, I
embraced the idea that a well-armed populace is a bulwark against
tyranny. I imagined us a vast Switzerland, hived with rifles to defend
our inviolable rights against … Michael Dukakis? What I slowly came to
see is that freedom is inseparable from political disagreement and that
holding to a trove of weapons as your last line of defense in a losing
debate makes normal ideological opposition look like nascent tyranny and
readies you to suppress it.

So it’s no surprise that the most authoritarian American president in
living memory, elected by a paltry minority, is not threatened in the
least by citizen militias bristling with military firepower. He knows
they’re on his side.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Democrats don’t want to grind the rights of Republicans underfoot. They
want to feel safe and think it should be harder for unhinged lunatics to
turn Walmarts into abattoirs. But when minority-rule radicals hear
determined talk of mandatory assault rifle buybacks, they start to feel
surrounded. They hear the hammers clicking back, imagine themselves in
the majority’s cross hairs.

That’s why they’re unmoved by the mounting heap of slaughtered
innocents, by schoolkids missing recess to rehearse being hunted. It’s a
sacrifice they’re willing to let other Americans make, because they
think democracy’s coming for their power, and they’re right.
