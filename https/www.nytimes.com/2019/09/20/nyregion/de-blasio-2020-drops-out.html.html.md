# De Blasio Quits Presidential Race; Trump Gloats

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, whose run for the Democratic

Mayor Bill de Blasio, who entered the Democratic presidential race on
the premise that his brand of liberal urban leadership in New York City
could appeal on a national scale, said on Friday that he was ending his
candidacy.

Mr. de Blasio had hoped to seize the progressive energy rippling through
the Democratic Party, using his accomplishments in New York — including
the introduction of universal prekindergarten and paid sick leave and
raising the minimum wage — to make his case.

But he remained in the bottom tier among nearly two dozen candidates,
unable to match the popularity of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth
Warren, the prime architects of his party’s leftward shift.

Mr. de Blasio said on Friday that he was satisfied that his message
seemed to resonate with people he met on the campaign trail. But his
continued candidacy, in the face of dismal poll and fund-raising
numbers, drew criticism from many circles, especially in New York.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I feel like I’ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and
it’s clearly not my time,”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>he
said during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. “I’m going
to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York
City, and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.”

Mr. de Blasio had focused his run on trying to improve the lives of
those people, proposing a [“workers’ Bill of
Rights”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/billdeblasio/bill-de-blasio-working-peoples-bill-of-rights)
to guarantee Americans paid time off and medical leave, and vowing to
[“tax the hell”](https://www.taxthehell.com/) out of wealthy people to
pay for his plan.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He tried to position himself as the most suitable Democrat to take on
President Trump, given his familiarity with Mr. Trump as a New York real
estate magnate. Mr. de Blasio branded the president “Con Don,” and
highlighted how he had already fought the Trump administration on issues
like climate change and immigration.

None of it worked.

Mr. de Blasio’s campaign, seen [as a quixotic, 100-to-1
shot](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/nyregion/de-blasio-2020-president-ny.html)
from its inception, never gained traction, not even in New York. Fliers
appeared at the gym in Park Slope, Brooklyn where he works out, urging
him not to run (and to wipe down the equipment after he finished using
it).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A recent poll of registered New York State Democrats by Siena College
found that fewer than 1 percent favored the mayor as the Democratic
nominee.

Mr. Trump greeted the news with sarcasm, characterizing Mr. de Blasio’s
withdrawal as “really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in
years\!”

“NYC is devastated," the president wrote on Twitter. “He’s coming

little bit
harder.”

“He dropped out of the presidential race a little while ago,” Mr. Trump
told reporters. “Too bad, he had tremendous potential. He only had one
real asset. You know what it was? Height. Other than that, he had
nothing going.”

Mr. de Blasio’s initial campaign finance filing showed that he had
raised only $1.1 million, with much of the money coming from the sole
city union supporting him. The union — like some of Mr. de Blasio’s
other donors — had, or could in the future have, business before the
city.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In one fund-raising period, another Democratic presidential hopeful,
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.[raised twice as much money from
New York City
residents](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/pete-buttigieg-2020-de-blasio-mayor.html)
as Mr. de Blasio raised nationally.

Even as better-financed rivals like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New
York [dropped out of the
race](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/08/28/us/politics/ap-us-election-2020-gillibrand.html)
after concluding that it was “important to know when it’s not your
time,” Mr. de Blasio held on and argued that one viral moment on
social media could give his campaign a lift.

“People go from unheard-of to totally famous in 72 hours in America
now,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference in September, when he
[first
acknowledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/nyregion/de-blasio-2020-president.html)
that the end of his candidacy might be in sight.

But it soon became apparent to the mayor that he would not qualify for
the fourth Democratic debate next month after failing to qualify for the
previous debate, in September.

“As we went over the last few weeks, every day that passed, it got
tougher,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference outside Gracie Mansion
on Friday, standing next to his wife, Chirlane McCray. “There wasn’t
more progress. We were watching the polling to see if anything was
moving. It just wasn’t moving.”

Combative [interviews with the Fox News hosts Sean
Hannity](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/nyregion/de-blasio-sean-hannity-fox-news.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjeffery-c.-mays&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=7&pgtype=collection)
and Tucker Carlson did not increase his standings in the polls or his
ability to raise money. Protesters, upset that Mr. de Blasio had refused
to fire the police officer who placed Eric Garner in a chokehold before
he died, interrupted both a national debate and a CNN town hall where
the mayor was a participant.

“This is what democracy looks like and no one said it was pretty,” the
mayor wrote on Twitter in response to the protest in July at the second
Democratic debate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even Mr. de Blasio’s successes on the campaign trail were marred by
mishaps. After being praised for his performance at the first debate, in
Miami, [Mr. de Blasio quoted the Cuban revolutionary Che
Guevara](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/nyregion/de-blasio-che-guevara.html),
during a union protest the next day, angering members of the local
anti-Castro Cuban community.

New Yorkers repeatedly questioned whether Mr. de Blasio should travel
from rural Iowa to the Nevada desert to address small groups about the
travails of working people when the largest city in the United States
was facing serious problems like rising homelessness and a [public
housing
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/nyregion/hud-nycha-deal.html).

The mayor’s whereabouts became an issue in July, when a 13,000-volt
cable fire caused 72,000 New Yorkers to [lose
power](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/nyregion/nyc-blackout-con-edison.html)
in Manhattan. At the time, Mr. de Blasio was delivering a stump speech
at a union hall in Waterloo, Iowa, and
[fretted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-nyc-blackout.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjeffery-c.-mays&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=6&pgtype=collection)[about
returning to the
city](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-nyc-blackout.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjeffery-c.-mays&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=6&pgtype=collection).

He offered a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>live update on
CNN, and allowed Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker [and a would-be
successor](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/nyregion/corey-johnson-bill-deblasio.html)to
Mr. de Blasio, to provide New Yorkers with constant and precise updates
via social media. The mayor was unable to return to New York until the
next day, hours after power had already been restored.

“New Yorkers want their mayor to be a national figure, but they want him
to do it from the steps of City Hall because they want the garbage
picked up,” said Sid Davidoff, a supporter of Mr. de Blasio’s who was
deputy campaign manager for John V. Lindsay, the last person to run for
president while being New York City’s mayor.

Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller who plans to run for
mayor in 2021, said that Mr. de Blasio’s presidential candidacy had
damaged his mayoralty.

“I think it’s a genuine setback,” Mr. Stringer said in an interview. “He
was chasing this notion of being a national progressive political icon,
but that ship had sailed in the name of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie
Sanders. He has the greatest job in the greatest city in the world. He
needs to come back and just govern the hell out of New York City.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. de Blasio expressed no regrets over his failed campaign, asserting
that he was one of a few progressive candidates who had helped move the
Democratic agenda to the left.

Jon Paul Lupo, Mr. de Blasio’s campaign manager, said that the mayor
would continue to try to influence national politics. Mr. Lupo said he
would now lead the mayor’s federal fund-raising entity, Fairness PAC, as
Mr. de Blasio sought to raise money for progressive Democrats. It was
unclear whether the mayor would still travel the country.

On Thursday, the Federal Election Commission sent Mr. de Blasio’s
campaign [a
letter](https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/058/201909190300048058/201909190300048058.pdf)
asking for an explanation of its use of money from his state political
action committee, NY Fairness PAC. A New York State ethics panel is also
[investigating](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/nyregion/de-blasio-2020-ethics.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjeffery-c.-mays&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection)
the mayor’s fund-raising practices.

As for his campaign, Mr. de Blasio said that if he had it to do again,
there was only one thing he would do differently: Enter the race sooner.

“I wish I had more time,” he said. “I wish I had more resources. I think
that would have made a difference. Earlier is
better.”
