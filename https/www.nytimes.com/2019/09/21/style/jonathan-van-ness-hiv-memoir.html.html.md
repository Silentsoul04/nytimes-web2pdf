The reality-show star says he’s living with H.I.V., and speaks about
being an addict and a sexual abuse survivor.

Jonathan Van Ness was having a late breakfast at the Empire Diner,
around the corner from his one-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea
neighborhood of Manhattan.

Seated in a window booth, he was serving what he calls his “16th-century
Jesus” look: Hollywood-starlet tresses, a mustache à la a Super Mario
villain and [fingernails](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1oDLPLA_Zr/)
painted with cartoon depictions from the 1996 film “The First Wives
Club.”

But Mr. Van Ness was not feeling his normal gorgeous self, the
boisterous “Yass queen” merman that fans of [“Queer
Eye](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/arts/television/queer-eye-netflix-review.html)”
adore. He was hung over.

And no, it wasn’t from partying too much. It was a “vulnerability
hangover,” to use a term coined by [Brené
Brown](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare),
a TED Talk-famous researcher, to describe feelings of dread after being
forthcoming.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’ve had nightmares every night for the past three months because I’m
scared to be this vulnerable with people,” Mr. Van Ness said.

For much of the summer, Mr. Van Ness, 32, has been mentally preparing
himself for the release of his piercing memoir, “[Over the
Top](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062906373/over-the-top/),” on
Sept. 24, in which a different image of Mr. Van Ness unspools with
remarkable transparency.

*\[The book is on our* [*nonfiction best-seller
list*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/books/review/jonathan-van-nesss-gorgeous-memoir-is-a-best-seller.html)*.\]*

Subtitled a “Raw Journey to Self-Love,” the book doesn’t so much explode
as offer psychological insight into the hirsute gay fairy godmother in
heels or, as he puts it, “the effervescent, gregarious majestic
center-part-blow-dry cotton-candy figure-skating queen” that he portrays
on “Queer Eye.”

“It’s hard for me to be as open as I want to be when there are certain
things I haven’t shared publicly,” he said. He cracked his knuckles as
he fidgeted from nerves. “These are issues that need to be talked
about.”

He ordered another cup of coffee, his fifth of the day, and began
tearing up as he spoke about a particularly painful memory, one of many
that he divulges in his book. When he was much younger, he was abused by
an older boy from church, during what was supposed to be a make-believe
play session.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“For a lot of people who are survivors of sexual assault at a young age,
we have a lot of compounded trauma,” he said.

Suddenly, a 20-something woman with a ponytail appeared at the table.
“I’m so sorry, I can’t take a picture right now,” he said,
discreetly wiping his eyes.

“Oh, that’s fine. I just want to say that I love the show,” she said.

“Thank you. Namaste. Have a nice day,” he said, clasping his hands in
prayer.

Mr. Van Ness exhaled and gently took a sip of coffee. “If you’re having
a terrible moment or in the middle of a conversation about something
serious, people don’t care,” he said. “They want their bubbly J.V.N. and
to get that major selfie.”

## Sex, Drugs and Hair

In a sense, the memoir was a way for Mr. Van Ness to tell his story
without interruption. There are certainly moments that may make some
readers pause.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Van Ness grew up in Quincy, Ill., a small port city along the
Mississippi River, where he was a self-described “little baby queen”
unafraid to embrace his femininity. It helped to have a mostly
supportive family, including a mother, Mary Winters, he considers a
lifelong best friend.

Ms. Winters’s family owns [Quincy
Media](https://quincymediacareers.com), a media company that operates 16
television stations in Illinois, Wisconsin and elsewhere, as well as two
local newspapers. She is the company’s vice president; Jonathan’s
father, Jon Van Ness, worked in sales. (They divorced when he was 5, and
his mother remarried four years later.)

At Quincy Senior High School (which he visits in the latest season of
“Queer Eye”), he leapt over social norms to become the school’s first
male cheerleader. Never mind the beer bottles thrown at him during
games.

He wasn’t exactly popular, and students spread rumors about his
friendship with a closeted boy from his swim class. Mr. Van Ness felt
humiliated. “I was too fat, too femme, too loud and too unlovable,” he
said.

His lack of self-esteem ran deep. As therapy would later reveal, the
abuse he experienced as a young child planted the seed for other
self-destructive behaviors. In his early teens, he spent hours in AOL
chat rooms (this was the 1990s) and met up with older men for sex. One
man, he recounts in the book, “turned whiter than Ann Coulter’s fan
base” after learning he was underage.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He found other ways to fill the void, including binge eating junk food
like doughnuts when his stepfather died (he [gained 70
pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhsBoWwhQtt/?utm_source=ig_embed) in
three months).

Eager to leave Quincy, he earned extra credit to skip senior year and
attended the University of Arizona in Tucson. But during his first
semester, he blew a monthly allowance of $200 from his mother on
cocaine, which he started doing on weekends.

Instead of asking his mother for more money (he was too ashamed and
reckless at the time), he advertised sex for money on Gay.com, a chat
and personals site.

He flunked out of college his first year — he was 19 — and sulked home
with his ponytail between his legs.

Unsure what to do with his life, he decided to take the skills honed
from styling the hair of his Barbie dolls to the next level and enrolled
in an 11-month beautician program at [the Aveda Institute in
Minneapolis](https://aveda.edu/locations/location/minneapolis-mn/),
where his first clients included many Somali refugees.

After getting his certificate, he moved to Scottsdale, Ariz. (to be near
his dying grandmother) and then to Los Angeles, where he supported
himself as an assistant at a Sally Hershberger salon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But his addiction to sex and drugs got worse. When he was in his early
20s, a couple he met on Grindr introduced him to smoking
methamphetamine. He went to rehab twice and relapsed both times.

One day, when he was 25, he fainted in a salon while highlighting a
client’s hair. The next day he went to Planned Parenthood to diagnose
his flulike symptoms. He tested positive for H.I.V.

“That day was just as devastating as you would think it would be,” he
writes.

## His Own Makeover

He cleaned up his act; he still drinks and smokes marijuana but says he
hasn’t done hard drugs in years. And, using money from a family trust,
he started anew in Los Angeles.

Appropriately enough, his foray into entertainment began at the hair
salon. During an appointment with his friend [Erin
Gibson](http://www.eringibson.com), a comedian who worked for Funny or
Die, the two came up with a parody series called “[Gay of
Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0yi0RQvEi0),” in which Mr. Van
Ness and a guest comedian offer campy, gay-themed recaps of “Game of
Thrones.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The show premiered in 2013 and became a hit. (It has been nominated for
three [Creative Arts Emmys](https://www.emmys.com/shows/gay-thrones) for
short-form variety series). Soon, Mr. Van Ness was offered roles as a
red-carpet commentator and as a host of other web series.

Then, in 2016, his manager called with news that would truly flip his
hair: Netflix was holding auditions for a reboot of “Queer Eye.” It took
many weeks, but Mr. Van Ness eventually won the producers over.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the show’s four seasons, the “Queer Eye” cast has gone from fringe
gay personalities to mainstream celebrities, with Mr. Van Ness as one of
the series’s breakout stars.

In a recent episode set in Kansas City, Mo., he confronts the shame
associated with [traction
alopecia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/fashion/braids-weaves-extensions-and-traction-alopecia.html),
a form of hair loss that predominantly affects black women. It’s a topic
rarely discussed on television, and even rarer by someone who is white.

On Twitter, [Tressie McMillan
Cottom](https://twitter.com/tressiemcphd/status/1153144560324923392), an
author and professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University,
wrote: “Jonathan treating this sister with traction alopecia with love
is more care than I can recall a regular black woman getting on TV
ever.” (When he was shown that tweet, he burst into tears.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Van Ness hopes to bring attention to what he calls “gorgeous beauty
moments” like that with his memoir, especially misperceptions about
being H.I.V. positive. He is healthy and now describes himself as an
out-and-proud “member of the beautiful H.I.V.-positive community.”

“When ‘Queer Eye’ came out, it was really difficult because I was like,
‘Do I want to talk about my status?,” he said. “And then I was like,
‘The Trump administration has done everything they can do to have the
stigmatization of the L.G.B.T. community thrive around me.’” He paused
before adding, “I do feel the need to talk about this.”

Just as he was about to take a bite of his eggs at the diner, Mr. Van
Ness was interrupted once again. This time it was a boyish young man who
poked his head in the window to profess his admiration.

After another “namaste,” which appears to be his shorthand for “kindly
leave,” Mr. Van Ness resumed his thoughts. “These are all difficult
subjects to talk about on a makeover show about hair and makeup,” he
said. “That doesn’t mean ‘Queer Eye’ is less valid, but I want people to
realize you’re never too broken to be fixed.”
