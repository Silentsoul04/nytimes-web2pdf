The day before her inaugural presentation in Milan, Margherita Maccapani
Missoni, scion of the knitwear dynasty and the new creative director of
her family’s [M Missoni brand](https://www.missoni.com/us/m-missoni),
arrives at her sun-filled showroom just south of the city’s Duomo.
Preternaturally calm after a car-ride meditation, she exudes an
easygoing, surfer vibe with long blond-tipped hair, a braided choker and
the remnants of a summer tan.

Hailing from a family whose surname has become synonymous with
colorfully zigzagged and space-dyed knits, the 36-year-old designer is
following in the footsteps of her grandmother, Rosita, who founded the
Missoni label with her husband, Ottavio, in 1953, and her mother,
Angela, the longtime creative director of the main brand. After serving
as a brand ambassador, muse and design assistant, before a break in
which she designed her own children’s wear line, Margherita’s
appointment to head up M Missoni — Missoni’s younger offshoot — seems to
fulfill a kind of filial destiny.

After the hourlong car ride into the city from Varese, the bucolic town
where she lives in proximity to the extended Missoni clan, the designer
peruses the showroom’s **** Styrofoam boards, pinned with photographs of
the 70 people — models, dancers, friends, employees and family members
of all ages — that she has cast for her show the next day. Instead of a
traditional presentation, the motley crew will pack a 1930s tram car as
it chugs around the city center, attired in M Missoni and strap-hanging
on a Missoni-carpeted aisle, while guests look on.

On her feet as she drinks a morning cappuccino, Margherita surveys
photos of the models she’ll outfit in the next few hours, selecting
looks from among her collection, which has been made using repurposed
knit scraps, leftover yarns and reproduced forgotten prints. “Everything
is from Missoni’s past,” she says, smoothing a sweatshirt’s patch of
vintage chevron knit. “I spent a lot of time in the archives even before
I accepted this post, and I realized there’s so much to Missoni beyond
the well-known prints of the ’60s and ’70s.” In the debut collection,
there are remakes of promotional prints produced for a Japanese golf
club in the ’80s and a perfume’s giveaway scarf from the ’90s. **** An
archival image she found of a Missoni-clad music group riding a tram
inspired the style of the presentation.

The “B-Side of Missoni,” as Margherita now calls it, M Missoni, founded
in 1998, is no longer the “diluted” offshoot that it became under a
former licensing agreement with the Valentino Fashion Group. Missoni’s
old stock is getting a promotion in her hands, upcycled to fresh
relevance instead of gathering dust on factory shelves. In her view, the
relaunch of M Missoni was destined to be a project founded on “reusing,
remixing and respecting” the brand’s inventory. “Starting from scratch
today, you can’t not think about sustainability,” she says.

Schooled in Missoni as she played in the factory and absorbed family
chatter about colors, weaves and proportions, the designer discerns
novel possibilities in the archives — sportier styles, ’90s references,
the apt recycling of discarded stock — that she translates into the
family’s signature visual language.

It’s a language that unites her with her mother and grandmother even
beyond the factory: “We have our shared flea-market hobby,” she points
out, rolling a cigarette by the showroom’s kitchen window. A matrilineal
obsession, the three Missoni women hunt for vintage finds on weekends,
filling their respective homes with vast medleys of kooky relics.
(Margherita collects daisies, her namesake in Italian, among other
kitsch.) “The markets are where my mother and grandmother taught me
about designers, about the feel of fabrics, about how things are made.”

“We all share a very similar aesthetic — the only real difference is
time, because our creative choices respond to the age in which each of
us lives,” says Margherita, as a couple of young dancers spin and
hip-grind in the showroom, testing out their tie-dye joggers and zigzag
crop tops. “I just want to update things for my times.”
