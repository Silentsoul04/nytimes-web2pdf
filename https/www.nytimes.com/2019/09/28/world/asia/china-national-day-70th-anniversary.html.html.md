BEIJING — Enormous flower arrangements in Beijing extol the signature
promise of China’s leader to realize the Chinese Dream. Red banners urge
people to “rally closer” to the Communist Party with “Comrade Xi Jinping
at its core.” The authorities have restricted live entertainment venues,
[ordered people to vacate
apartments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-communist-party-70th-anniversary.html)
and banned flying kites, sky lanterns and even homing pigeons, a
charming feature of many neighborhoods.

As the Communist Party of China prepares to celebrate the 70th
anniversary of its rule, [the state is
choreographing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/world/asia/china-national-day-hong-kong-protests.html)
the pomp and pageantry to exalt President Xi as the unassailable leader
of a rising nation and the indispensable bulwark against an array of
challenges that threaten to erode its iron grip on power.

On Tuesday, the country’s National Day, he will preside over a military
parade through Tiananmen Square whose preparations appear as ambitious
and, arguably, as grandiose as the leader himself. It will involve
15,000 soldiers and sailors, 160 fighter jets, bombers and other
aircraft, and 580 tanks and other weapons — some of them, military
commanders hinted coyly, never before seen in public.

For Mr. Xi, the anniversary has come at an opportune, and much-needed,
moment. It has given him a chance to bask in the party’s achievements at
a time when it is coming under increasing strain, especially from the
economic drag of the trade war with the United States. It is also
[fending

“The republic is built by each brick and tile like this,” Mr. Xi said on
Wednesday after riding an express train 25 miles south from the city
center to inaugurate [Beijing’s new international
airport](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/asia/china-beijing-daxing-airport.html),
one of the mega-projects that China has built as an affirmation of its
political and economic greatness. The airport, with seven runways and [a
star-shaped
terminal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-49750182)by the
famed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, is set to be the world’s largest.

On the occasion of a simple ribbon cutting, he sought to channel the
spirit of the founding of the People’s Republic of China by quoting from
one of Mao Zedong’s revolutionary war poems, [“Loushan
Pass,”](https://allpoetry.com/Loushan-Pass) about a battle in the
mountains of Guizhou in 1935.

> Idle boast the strong pass is a wall of iron

> With firm strides we are crossing its summit

In seven years in office, Mr. Xi has successfully consolidated his power
by purging rivals, crushing dissent and [removing the constitutional
limits on his
power](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/world/asia/china-xi-constitution-term-limits.html?searchResultPosition=1).
He has made the party the arbiter of all aspects of Chinese life and
urged greater ideological purity to gird the nation for what he
repeatedly describes as [a great and continuing
struggle](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/world/asia/china-hong-kong-xi-jinping.html).

“Xi gets it that the story matters,” Timothy Cheek, a professor of
Chinese history at the University of British Columbia, wrote in an
email. “He is facing what the Soviet bloc faced in the 1980s: lack of
belief in the professed values of the party in the face of obvious
contractions and corruption.”

That failure is a lesson that Mr. Xi and other leaders have studied
well. China has thrived in ways the Soviet Union did not, largely
because it managed a transition to a kind of free-market capitalism that
offered millions of Chinese greater material prosperity.

Sustaining that is now the greatest challenge facing Mr. Xi and the
party. China’s growth has slowed to its [weakest
point](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/business/china-economy-growth-gdp-trade-war.html)
in decades, as the trade war grinds on the economy and consumers pull
back. While trade talks continue, President Trump has continued to lash
out at China, calling it a “[threat to the
world](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/us/politics/trump-china-theat-to-world.html).”

“The weak link is not the lack of democracy,” Mr. Cheek said of the
foundations of the party’s power. “It is the prospect of an economic
downturn, of a failure to deliver to the ordinary citizen.”

The [expectation of protests in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/28/world/asia/hong-kong-protest.html),
the semiautonomous territory returned to Chinese sovereignty 22 years
ago, has already [created a

to the Communist Party’s birthday celebration. Around the world, the
televised cuts from Tuesday’s military parade in Beijing — and fireworks
in the evening — to another round of tear gas and gas bombs in Hong Kong
seem inevitable.

At the time, the civil war against the nationalists still raged, and the
Communist Party had few resources to govern so large an impoverished and
war-battered country. In one famous anecdote repeated by officials and
state news media this past week, some of the 17 aircraft that took part
in the first parade flew over Tiananmen Square a second time to make the
air force seem bigger than it really
was.

A military parade was held each National Day from 1949 to 1959, but the
tradition lapsed during the darkest years of Mao’s reign, which included
the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution. It resumed in 1984,
overseen by Deng Xiaoping, the leader who began the reforms that opened
up China’s economy.

“National Day parades and celebrations are carefully designed to
communicate the self-image the regime wants Chinese people and the world
to see,” said Susan L. Shirk, an expert on China at the University of
California, San Diego, who was in the bleachers on Tiananmen Square
during the 35th anniversary.

The party then wanted to promote capitalist policies to a generation
raised on communist ones, so the parade featured banners with slogans
like “Time Is Money” and floats promising material comforts. One float
carried a 20-foot-tall chicken, another a refrigerator stocked with cold
beer.

“Today,” Ms. Shirk added, “China has become more of a national security
state.”

The 40th anniversary fell only months after the massacre that put down
the student-led democracy movement on Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
The parade went on, but without the military hardware, “apparently
because Beijing residents had seen enough weaponry in recent months,”
The Times’s correspondent at the time, [Nicholas D. Kristof,
wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/people-s-china-celebrates-but-without-the-people.html).

Tuesday’s parade will not be the biggest by the number of participants,
military officials acknowledged at a briefing in Beijing this past week,
but they emphasized it would include new weapons, all of them made in
China, tested and ready to use.

Researchers scouring [satellite photos of staging
areas](https://www.frstrategie.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/images-strategiques/2019/strategic-imagery-military-parade-70th-anniversary-PRC-2019.pdf)
near Beijing have spotted a hypersonic drone and a new mobile
intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-41, which is capable of
hurling multiple nuclear warheads toward any city in the United States.

The parade will showcase a military that is, according to foreign
military analysts, more capable, more integrated and better equipped
than at any point in Chinese history.

“In the past 70 years, the development and growth of the Chinese
military is there for all to see,” the Defense Ministry’s spokesman,
Senior Col. Wu Qian, said in the briefing, when asked if the display of
weaponry was intended to send a message to potential adversaries. “We
have neither the intention nor the need to flex muscle through military
parades.”

He and the other officers emphasized the military’s obedience to the
Communist Party leadership — as if it were in question — and its embrace
of the [military
reorganization](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/asia/xi-jinping-military-china-purge.html)
overseen in recent years by Mr. Xi, whose many titles include chairman
of the Central Military Commission, despite some resistance in the
ranks.

The preparations have transformed the city, turning it into a stage to
glorify the country, the party and Mr. Xi himself. [Nothing has been
left to

Even the troops involved are chosen not only according to physical
standards — the male soldiers marching in formation should be 5 feet 9
to 6 feet 1 — but also for political ones, said Maj. Gen. Tan Min,
executive deputy director of the Military Parade Joint Command and
deputy chief of staff of the Central Theater Command.

They, too, face inconveniences. According to [an
article](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1163738.shtml) in The Global
Times, troops were given disposable diapers to wear during rehearsals
because there was no time allotted for bathroom breaks.

A salesman in Beijing, Zhang Sheng, said he very much looked forward to
the parade. “I want to come on that day, but probably can’t because
there are too many people.”

In fact, access to the parade is restricted to only those with passes.
Mr. Zhang, 35, brought roller skates to ride along the parade route
ahead of the festivities, but it was forbidden.
