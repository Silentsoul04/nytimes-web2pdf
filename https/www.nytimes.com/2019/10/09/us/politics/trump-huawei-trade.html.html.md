WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to soon issue licenses
allowing some American companies to supply nonsensitive goods to the
Chinese telecom giant Huawei, according to people familiar with the
matter, a step that could cool tensions between the United States and
China as trade talks resume this week.

In a meeting last week, President Trump gave the green light to begin
approving the licenses, which will allow a select few American companies
to bypass a ban his administration placed on Huawei this year.

In May, the Trump administration [placed Huawei and dozens of its
affiliates on the entity
list](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?module=inline),
citing national security concerns. That move blocked Huawei from buying
parts and obtaining technology updates from companies like Google and
Micron without seeking approval from the United States government.

The ban has not technically gone into effect. The administration issued
[a temporary
reprieve](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/huawei-trump.html)
to allow Huawei’s suppliers and users of its products more time to find
alternate arrangements. But the designation has been a significant
source of tension between the United States and China, which considers
Huawei central to its ambitions for building the next generation of
wireless networks, known as 5G.

The Trump administration originally said that it would approve licenses
to continue selling to Huawei after Mr. Trump met with President Xi
Jinping of China in Osaka, Japan, in June. But no licenses have since
been issued, raising speculation that the administration was withholding
them as leverage in trade talks.

A spokesman from the Commerce Department, which is responsible for the
licenses, said in an email that “as of right this moment, the status quo
holds.”

The administration’s decision to allow licenses could help smooth the
path to a trade deal. Negotiators from the United States and China are
meeting in Washington this week for their 13th round of trade talks and
officials are trying to agree on terms that would address Mr. Trump’s
criticisms of China’s economic practices but still be acceptable to
Beijing.

Mr. Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of
Chinese goods this month and to impose another slew of tariffs in
December if Beijing does not agree to concessions that Washington has
been demanding. But some in the Trump administration have been eager to
avoid further tariff increases and are pushing for a more limited
agreement, which would end a trade war that has dragged on for more than
a year.

It is not clear whether the president would agree to a limited pact or
whether such a deal can be struck. China has continued to resist many of
the administration’s demands to make more transformative changes to the
way it runs its economy. The two countries have been on the cusp of an
agreement before, only to have the arrangement fall apart.

Approving licenses that allow American companies to supply so-called
general merchandise to Huawei is likely to be seen as a gesture of good
will, though its practical effects may be limited. Despite the ban, many
American companies have [continued supplying goods to
Huawei](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html)
by finding ways to avoid labeling goods as American-made and channeling
more goods produced outside the United States to the company.

In an earnings call in June, the [chief executive of the American chip
maker Micron, Sanjay Mehrotra,
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html)
the company had briefly stopped shipments to Huawei, but then resumed
sales after Micron reviewed the entity list rules and “determined that
we could lawfully resume” shipping a subset of products.
