Linda Goode Bryant likes to get things done. A self-described
workaholic, the [filmmaker](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1326497/),
former art gallery owner and president of the nonprofit [Active Citizen
Project](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/grantee/active-citizen-project-inc/)
seems to dive into projects with two feet and not look back.

Take JAM, or Just Above Midtown, the former art gallery on West 57th
Street (and later, in TriBeCa). She opened the space for
African-American artists in the 1970s because the city’s major art
galleries weren’t showing their work. [Frieze New
York](https://frieze.com/fairs/frieze-new-york) had a tribute to the
pioneering space this year, while the [Museum of Modern
Art](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5078) is preparing an
exhibition on the gallery for 2022.

The idea for Ms. Bryant’s latest endeavor, an urban farm program called
[Project EATS](http://projecteats.org/), came to her while she was
filming a documentary about the 2004 presidential election.

“There were several issues that often came up: schools, immigration,
prisons and food,” said Ms. Bryant, who lives on Manhattan’s Upper West
Side. “Then we saw the world go through a food crisis in 2008 and I kept
wondering why we can’t grow our own food even if we’re surrounded by
concrete. Did I know anything about growing food before I started
Project EATS? Hell no. But I figured it out.”

**AGAINST THE FLOW** I typically get up around 5 or 5:30 during the
weekday, or about 6:30 on Sunday. I stretch, then head to Central Park
to do a little fast walking and light jogging. I love the park. I’ve
been doing this for so long that I know the regulars. I’ve noticed there
are a lot more people that practice for races, triathlons. To everyone’s
annoyance, I go in the opposite direction.

**LIFE AND ALL THAT COMES WITH IT** I have my weekly call with my
friend, the artist [Senga Nengudi](http://sengasenga.com/). I met her
when she had a show at JAM. Now she lives in Colorado Springs and she’s
having a resurgence and galleries are calling. Lately we talked about
her show in Munich. But we usually talk about life and all that comes
with it. It’s nice to know there’s someone I like, someone I can talk to
about anything.

**ART FROM ABOVE** I’m always working. I either head to my office on
West 37th Street, work from home, or schedule a work brunch. Today I’ll
go to the Lower East Side to look at our newest farm at the [Essex
Crossing](https://www.essexcrossingnyc.com/) development. I’ll meet Rick
Smith, the director of farm operations, and artist [Arthur
Jafa](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/t-magazine/arthur-jafa-in-bloom.html).
A.J. is in from Los Angeles and showed us some sketches and animation
for a sculpture that he’s going to make for the space. It’s art that’s
meant to be seen from above. It’s thrilling.

**DEER SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM** This is our first roof top farm. You
have such a different perspective when the farm isn’t on the ground. I
don’t exactly know how the food is going to grow here. I think we’ll
have more control over the weeds and less crop loss, but who knows. For
lunch, we have Moroccan food, which was my first time. It was delish.

**STREET LIFE** Usually I like walking and wandering around town after I
work. If there’s a film I’d like to see, I’ll head to a theater. The
city’s characters are inspiring. Even though this place has changed so
much, you still feel everyone’s vibes. It’s a marvel to see and I think
it makes me more creative.

**PARENTING IS HARD** I’ll meet my longtime friend [Anne
Delaney](https://www.annedelaney.com/) at the [Rubin Museum of
Art](https://rubinmuseum.org/). I was supposed to meet my son Kenneth
and my grandson Johnny for dinner but they came in early and will meet
us at the museum. Johnny seems to like the interactive pieces. The
exhibits aren’t what I call uptight art and it’s not just geared toward
adults. I thought we would all go out to dinner afterward but Kenneth
said Johnny was so good at the museum, he better take him home.
Parenting is hard.

**RERUNS** Full disclosure: I love watching television on Sunday nights.
I might start with some cable news, but I wander around the channels.
This summer was the best because the “[The Good
Fight](https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-good-fight/)” was on. I didn’t want
to pay to watch the show so I was glad to find the reruns. I think it is
as good as “The Good Wife.” I get to bed around 11 or midnight. I don’t
need much sleep.
