As Narendra Modi of India and Xi Jinping of China meet, a host of

NEW DELHI — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, swept into India on
Friday<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>for a quick meeting with
Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Frenemies,’’ is how a senior Indian
official has described the [India-China
relationship](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/world/asia/narendra-modi-xi-jinping-china-india.html).

The two giant countries are neighbors and strategic rivals. They’re
nuclear-armed, and their relationship is as complicated as ever. Mr. Xi
and Mr. Modi are the most dominating leaders their nations have produced
in decades, and both have outsize personalties. But with each other,
they have no choice but to
listen.

[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/india-china-border.html)
wants to keep India from drifting closer to the United States, where Mr.
Modi recently received a warm welcome from President Trump.
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/india-china-border.html)
wants China to rebalance trade flows by buying more Indian good and
services and to back away from the border disputes that have dogged
their countries for years. A good relationship would help both countries
in their aspirations to be world powers.

But it has been up and down for years. The two nations fought a short
but intense war in the 1960s (China won) and have supported insurgencies
in each other’s backyards and sparred over trade deficits (China is
winning that one as well).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This summit meeting almost did not happen. Mr. Xi kept Mr. Modi hanging
until the last minute, confirming just a few days ago that he was
actually coming to India. Apparently, China was upset with India about
some recent military exercises near the border.

It is scheduled to be a fast trip. Mr. Xi will be on the ground for
about 24 hours, landing in the southern city of Chennai around 2 p.m.,
visiting some Hindu monuments, attending a fancy dinner and then having
an hourlong one-on-one chat with Mr. Modi on Saturday morning.

They have no shortage of issues to untangle. Here are a few.

## Kashmir

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In August, Mr. Modi’s government essentially annexed Kashmir, a disputed
Himalayan territory that has long been a source of conflict between
India and Pakistan. But this also created “bad blood” with China, said
Brahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at the Center for
Policy Research in New Delhi.

Part of the reason is that China also claims a piece of Kashmir: a high
altitude plateau called Aksai Chin. Mr. Modi’s decision to strip away
the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir and split the territory into two new
federally controlled enclaves was seen as a hardening of India’s
position and a possible threat to China’s claims. Much of the
India-China border is disputed, which is likely to come up during this
meeting.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s ally, Pakistan, is India’s most bitter rival, and Pakistani
officials, including Prime Minister Imran Khan, have made a huge stink
about Kashmir. Pakistan also claims parts of Kashmir and has accused Mr.
Modi of genocide.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Modi is likely to reassure Mr. Xi that India does not plan to change
the international borders and that Kashmir is purely an internal issue.

Kashmir is such a sensitive issue in India and Pakistan that it would be
nearly impossible for Mr. Xi to say anything publicly on it without
angering one of
them.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This is probably going to be a whole separate discussion. India has been
on an intense lobbying campaign to discredit Pakistan, accusing Pakistan
of secretly supporting terrorists. In the next few days, a financial
task force based in Paris will be holding a meeting to review Pakistan’s
behavior. India wants China to join the effort to blacklist Pakistan,
which could bring Pakistan’s economy to its knees.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Xi’s<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>government has
invested billions of dollars in Pakistan and is rapidly turning the
country into a Chinese client state — selling Pakistan Chinese weaponry
and letting Pakistan in on secret Chinese technology. Despite the fact
that China is persecuting Uighur Muslims in its western Xinjiang region
and forcing them into camps, Pakistani officials rely on China too
heavily for much outcry on that issue.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just last week, a Chinese official said China would help Kashmiris “get
their fundamental rights and justice’’ and that “[China will stand by
Pakistan.](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/china-on-kashmir-lockdown-india-pakistan-6055722/)’’
That infuriated the
Indians.

## Trade Imbalance

Chinese phones. Chinese screws. Chinese plastic toys. China exports much
more to India than India does to China. The trade deficit has ballooned
to nearly $60 billion<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in
China’s favor.

Just 10 years ago, many people spoke of China’s and India’s economic
growth in the same breath. Not any more. China’s economy is now five
times bigger. While China has become the world’s manufacturer, India is
still largely agrarian.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Modi is likely to ask Mr. Xi to let in more Indian pharmaceuticals
and ease some of the trade barriers, but Chinese analysts do not
anticipate big changes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“India has worked very hard on the trade imbalance for a long time but
with no substantial improvement,’’ said Lu Yang, a South Asia scholar at
Beijing’s Tsinghua University.

If the economic gap widens, **“**India might end up as China’s Mexico, a
cheap-labor reservoir rather than an equal power,’’ said Jonathan
Holslag, professor of international politics at the Free University in
Brussels.

A little boss bonding is built into the program.

Mr. Modi plans to bring Mr. Xi to some monuments in Mamallapuram, an old
seaside town near Chennai. There’s also a private dinner and a
[“cultural
program,’](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narendra-modi-and-xi-jinping-aim-for-wuhan-encore/story-2zVlXsadCbHfhl8MUi3BFN.html)’
according to the Indian news media.

Last year, in Wuhan, China, during a similar summit meeting, the two
leaders tried their best not to look wooden as they strolled around a
lake and posed for pictures. It didn’t seem to work.

“One does not notice any special chemistry between them,’’ said Alka
Acharya, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.

Still, she said, they are trying and a “reasonable rapport has been
established.’’  

Sameer Yasir contributed reporting from New Delhi.
