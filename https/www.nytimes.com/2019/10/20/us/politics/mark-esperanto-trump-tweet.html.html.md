# Mark Esperanto? Trump Misnames His Defense Secretary in Tweet

</div>

Even for a president who often lards his online missives with typos,
caps-lock abuses and errant exclamation points, Sunday’s Twitter missive
on Syria contained an outsize number of errors.

WASHINGTON — President Trump shared an update on Sunday from his defense
secretary that outlined “minor skirmishes” between Turkish and Kurdish
fighters in northern Syria as American troops make their way out of the
area. It might have passed by with little notice in the rushing current
of Mr. Trump’s Twitter stream, but for one thing.

“Mark Esperanto, Secretary of Defense, ‘The ceasefire is holding up very
nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly,'” Mr.
Trump wrote on Twitter. “‘New areas being resettled with the Kurds.’ USA
soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil.
Bringing soldiers home\!”

Even for Mr. Trump, who often lards his online missives with typos,
caps-lock abuses, [occasional
gibberish](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/covfefe-trump-twitter.html)
and errant exclamation points, Sunday’s missive contained an outsize
number of errors. The first and most glaring: The president’s defense
secretary is actually named Mark *Esper.*

Questions arose. Was it a typo? How could Mr. Trump’s iPhone even make
the jump from “Esper” to “Esperanto” if it was an auto-correct
situation? It was a mystery that several White House officials could not
solve when asked by a reporter on Sunday.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The larger problem, of course, is that Mr. Trump made a series of false
or unsupported statements about a chaotic situation that has unfolded
since he stood by as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey advanced
his forces into the area. In recent days, the [vice president traveled
to
Turkey](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/world/middleeast/pence-pompeo-turkey-syria-troops.html)
to negotiate a brief cease-fire — a [nominal sacrifice from Mr.
Erdogan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/world/middleeast/trump-pence-syria-turkey-ceasefire.html)
that the White House has tried to frame as a win.

The quote Mr. Trump attributed to Mr. Esper could have come from a
private conversation between them. But it appeared that it might have
been a recounting — if not an entirely faithful one — of public comments
made by Mr. Esper, who [made an unannounced visit to meet with American
troops in
Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/world/asia/mark-esper-afghanistan.html)
this weekend and delivered his own assessment of what was happening in
Syria.

“I think overall the cease-fire generally seems to be holding,” Mr.
Esper said, [according to a Reuters
correspondent](https://twitter.com/idreesali114/status/1185911236036157440)
traveling with him. “We see a stabilization of the lines, if you will,
on the ground, and we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and
that, that doesn’t surprise me necessarily.”

At the end of the tweet, Mr. Trump added two confusing elements of his
own. The first was that United States had “secured the oil,” a claim he
has repeatedly made in recent days without any explanation. The White
House did not clarify what he meant by those remarks, and Mr. Trump has
ignored the question when asked about it by reporters. Last year, there
were about 2.5 billion barrels of oil in the fields in northern Syria,
[according to industry
estimates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-18/trump-baffles-with-claim-to-have-taken-control-of-mideast-oil).

The president also said that the United States was “bringing soldiers
home,” which is also not correct, at least not in the short term: Mr.
Esper has confirmed that the troops leaving Syria are heading to Iraq,
to continue operations against the Islamic State.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Separately, the Trump administration [said this
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-iran-troops.html)
that it would be committing additional troops to Saudi Arabia, a
decision the president has said was made because the Saudis agreed to
pay for the operation.

“A very rich country,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference with the
Italian president last week. “They should be paying. And so should many
other countries be paying if they want this kind of protection.”

Hours after the original tweet was posted to the presidential account,
the White House tried again, spelling Mr. Esper’s name correctly.
