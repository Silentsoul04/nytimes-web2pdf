# In Iowa, Amy Klobuchar Gets a Second Look After Debate

Mired in the polling doldrums, the Minnesota senator drew crowds and new
donors after attacking Elizabeth Warren for a “pipe dream.”

MASON CITY, Iowa — Before last week, Beth Kundel Vogel was undecided
when it came to the Democratic presidential hopefuls.

But in the debate on Tuesday, Senator [Amy
Klobuchar](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/amy-klobuchar.html)
of Minnesota impressed her by calling out Senator [Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html)
of Massachusetts for offering voters a “[pipe
dream](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren-debate.html?)”
rather than a plan to pay for universal health care.

And on Friday, Ms. Kundel Vogel heard Ms. Klobuchar speak passionately
in Davenport, Iowa, about one way of thinking about the 2020 race: the
need to win support beyond the party base. “We have to remember that
nearly 10 percent of Trump voters voted for Barack Obama,” Ms. Klobuchar
said. “It’s our job to bring them in.”

“Seeing her in person just closed the deal for me,” said Ms. Kundel
Vogel, 47, a human resources manager. “She understands what it’s going
to take to win, which is to win over independents and former Trump
voters.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Riding a post-debate wave of attention, Ms. Klobuchar blitzed New
Hampshire and Iowa last week, attracting new supporters and donors in
those two states with early nominating contests. After months stuck in
the polling doldrums, Ms. Klobuchar is getting a second look. But she
faces several challenges, among them that she is arguing how to win
general election swing states but has yet to show how she would win the
nomination first.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The renewed interest comes as the Democratic field undergoes something
of a shake-up. Ms. Warren and Senator [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
of Vermont are each jostling to consolidate the left wing, while the two
Midwest moderates in the race, Ms. Klobuchar and [Pete
Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html),
the mayor of South Bend, Ind., are trying to break into the top tier of
candidates after both enjoyed strong debate performances. Mr. Buttigieg
is well ahead of Ms. Klobuchar in recent Iowa polls, adding to the
pressure on her candidacy.

The competitive hunger on the campaign trail reflects a new urgency
especially among moderate candidates and voters seeking an alternative
to the ascendant Ms. Warren. Some donors and supporters of former Vice
President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
suddenly seem up for grabs.

In an interview on Saturday, Ms. Klobuchar drew an even sharper bead on
Ms. Warren, comparing her avoidance of how to pay for “Medicare for all”
with Mr. Trump’s habitual shirking of the truth.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“You’ve got a president that lies and doesn’t tell the truth, and I
think it puts it on us to say, hey, there’s a different kind of
president here where we’re going to be honest with you, look you in the
eye, tell you the truth,” Ms. Klobuchar said. (Ms. Warren
[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all.html)
on Sunday that she would release a plan to finance her “Medicare for
all” plan in the coming
weeks.)

For Ms. Klobuchar, the stakes couldn’t be higher. She has [yet to
qualify](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html)
for the next debate in November. She has hit 3 percent support in only
two qualifying polls, [including one of Iowa voters released Monday
morning](https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2019/10_21_2019_marignals_pdftxt.pdf?la=en&hash=F9C7E3EEE4E593F99F37585C0A7362D4007AE4C0);
she needs to reach that mark in two more national or early state polls.

She is counting on a debate surge to make the cut.

“We are very hopeful that it will; we have a whole month to get it
done,” Ms. Klobuchar said on her campaign bus as it headed to
Waterloo, Iowa, on Day 2 of a three-day swing.

She packed the rooms where she appeared with 150 to 200 voters, who
applauded warmly, even wildly at times, including when she said, “We
have a huge amount of momentum coming out of that debate.”

But as a reality check in a state where Ms. Klobuchar drew only 3
percent [in the latest Des Moines Register
poll](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/09/22/iowa-poll-election-2020-iowa-caucus-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-democrat-candidates/2370015001/),
Ms. Warren attracted more than 1,000 at an appearance on Sunday night in
Des Moines.

The Klobuchar campaign says it had its best 36 hours of fund-raising
following Tuesday’s CNN/New York Times debate, pulling in $1.5 million
in small-dollar donations. The money paid for a campaign bus wrapped in
green with “Amy” in huge letters, and for a five-figure [digital ad
campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2pEOIVWFm8&feature=youtu.be)
in Iowa. (She began her first TV ad here in early October.) Still, her
cash on hand is tight: As of this month, she had $3.7 million, putting
her [eighth in the
field.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/us/elections/democratic-q3-fundraising.html)

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She told Iowans that “many, many, many, many times” the ultimate nominee
was not the candidate leading in polls at this point, and she offered
examples: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama.

On Friday, more Iowans filled in cards at her events committing to
caucus for Ms. Klobuchar than any day of her candidacy.

Still, it is far from certain that post-debate momentum alone will make
her a viable candidate. If she fails to make the next debates, she said,
she will run at least through the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. When asked
how high a finish she would need to continue, she offered only a
tight-lipped chuckle.

She did not hint at any strategy shift to create a breakthrough. She
believes her best argument to be the nominee is that she is the most
electable, as a heartland senator with proven appeal to swing voters, as
shown in her re-election to a third term in 2018 when she carried
Minnesota regions that Mr. Trump had won by double digits.

Two voters who committed on Saturday to caucus for Ms. Klobuchar, Tom
and Dorinda Pounds, had watched earlier debates torn among her, Mr.
Buttigieg and Mr. Biden.

“This debate, she finally got a chance to talk, and the way she handled
herself really made a big difference,” Mr. Pounds, a retired county
administrator, said at a Klobuchar appearance in Waterloo.

During the debate, in addition to calling out Ms. Warren, Ms. Klobuchar
also attacked Mr. Trump more aggressively than Mr. Biden did. Ms.
Klobuchar’s newfound readiness to swing a saber appealed to many who
came out to hear her.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“With each candidate, I’m thinking how are they going to be on the
debate stage against Trump, and I think she will handle herself well,”
said Becky Langdon, a freelance writer in Davenport, who is on the fence
about who to support. “She showed some passion and wanting to fight for
it.”

Ms. Klobuchar was eager over the weekend to contrast herself with Mr.
Buttigieg, who has a far bigger campaign war chest and more committed
supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire.

“I am the one who has won statewide,” she said, referring to Mr.
Buttigieg’s defeat in a 2010 race for Indiana treasurer.

On Sunday in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Ms. Klobuchar
aimed a poison dart at Mr. Buttigieg over [a 2018
tweet](https://twitter.com/petebuttigieg/status/965396700511825920?lang=en)
of his in support of a “Medicare for all” bill.

Mr. Buttigieg had just told the host Jake Tapper on the same broadcast
that he later gave up backing “Medicare for all” after politicians
concluded that it meant eliminating all private insurance.

Ms. Klobuchar was unrelenting. “The bill has been very clear from the
beginning,” she said. “On page eight it says it will dismantle our
current insurance system. It says 149 million people will be kicked off
their current
insurance.”

On the stump, Ms. Klobuchar, 59, presents herself as the same
hard-working, results-driven politician as she was when she won her
first election in fourth grade, with the now-discarded slogan “All the
way with Amy K.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

She name-checks Republicans she teamed up with on more than 100 bills
that passed the Senate. She emphasizes her priorities of strengthening
election security, doubling Pell Grants for college students (but not
free college for all) and lowering medical costs through a public
option.

All her plans include proposals to pay for them, she notes, a point of
pride that reflects a fiscal responsibility that she acquired from her
family.

“I don’t come from money,” Ms. Klobuchar tells voters, recalling her
mother who taught second grade until she was 70 and her newspaperman
father who battled alcoholism.

While the Democratic base is fired up, Ms. Klobuchar argues that the
2020 nominee must carry the battleground states of the Midwest that
voted for Mr. Trump.

In Waterloo, speaking at a brew pub, she surmised there were people in
the crowd who voted for Mr. Trump.

“It’s important for us as a party to not shut everyone out, to bring
them with us, to bring back some of those conservative Democrats who
voted for him or stayed home,” she said. “To bring back some of our
base, our liberal Democrats who were disenchanted.”

A voter named Bob, whose written question was read out to Ms. Klobuchar,
put his finger on a core dilemma for a candidate who is running on a
message about winning the heartland.

“We need a moderate candidate to beat Trump,” Bob asked. “How will you
get through the primary?”

Ms. Klobuchar answered that she considers herself “a proven
progressive,” citing her liberal views on abortion, immigration and
the environment.

But rather than answering Bob in depth, she pivoted to talk about the
need for a civil tone in
politics.

Back on her campaign bus, she made the case more forcefully that someone
with a profile like herself — rather than Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders — is
best positioned to win 2020 swing states. She cited the example of the
2018 midterms, when Democrats flipped governorships in Wisconsin and
Michigan and gained a House majority by appealing to independents and
