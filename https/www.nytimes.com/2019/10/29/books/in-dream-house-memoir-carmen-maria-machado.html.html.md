All ornate appearances to the contrary, the gothic is a thrifty form.
Its first, and essential, ingredients, according to the scholar Mary Ann
Doane, are simply “woman plus habitation.” No special effects needed;
the horror of a woman finding fear where she expected safety is enough
to power an entire genre.

Variations abound. Add a deranged, possibly homicidal house and you have
Shirley Jackson’s “The Haunting of Hill House.” Throw in some fey,
freaky children and you get “The Turn of the Screw.” Merge the house and
the woman — watch the woman experience *her own body* as a haunted
house, a place of sudden, inexplicable terrors — and you are reading the
[blazingly
talented](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/books/vanguard-books-by-women-in-21st-century.html)
Carmen Maria Machado.

Machado’s previous book, the short story collection [“Her Body and Other
Parties”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/books/review-her-body-and-other-parties-carmen-maria-machado.html)
(2017), a finalist for the National Book Award, is one of the most
original and exuberantly celebrated debuts of recent years. The stories
are louche, mischievous and very queer — fairy tales scrambled with fan
fiction and body horror. In “Difficult at Parties,” a woman attends a
housewarming. She pokes around the house, exploring, until her host
stops her. “That room is being renovated,” she is warned. “There’s no
floor. You could go in there, but you’d go straight down to the cellar.”

Welcome to the House of Machado. Proceed directly into the forbidden
room; enjoy the view as the floor gives way.

Her new book, “In the Dream House,” is a memoir of her frightening and
abusive relationship with another woman while in graduate school. It is
a book in shards. Each chapter hews to the conventions of a different
genre: road trip, romance novel, creature feature, lesbian pulp novel,
stoner comedy. The technique borrows a bit from Raymond Queneau’s 1947
“Exercises in Style,” 99 retellings of the same story in different
genres. What could seem gimmicky — I confess I braced myself at first —
quickly feels like the only natural way to tell the story of a couple.
What relationship exists in purely one genre? What life?

*\[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of November.* [*See
the full
list*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/books/new-november-books.html)*.
\]*

Machado has described herself as a “form vampire,” obsessed with
structures, real and narrative, and with mingling techniques from
fiction and nonfiction. This book is a hive of frenetic experimentation,
tactics and tricks; nested essays on film scholarship, queer villains in
Disney films, “Star Trek,” the campaigns addressing domestic violence in
lesbian relationships in the early ’80s. It’s narrated in the second
person, with Machado addressing her younger self, tenderly and severely.
Each section comes heavily footnoted, indicating the appearance of
traditional folk tale motifs — taboos, odd
coincidences.

There is something anxious, and very intriguing, in the degree of
experimentation in this memoir, in its elaborately titivated sentences,
its thicket of citations. The flurry — the excess — feels deliberate,
and summons up the image of the writer holding a ring of keys, trying
each of them in turn to unlock a resistant story, to open a door she
might be hesitant to enter. (*“There’s no floor. You could go in there,
but you’d go straight down to the cellar.”*)

In the beginning, of course, Machado cannot believe her good fortune.
The woman she falls for (who remains unnamed) has white-blonde hair and
is “that mix of butch and femme that drives you crazy.” She is not
Machado’s first female lover, but it’s the first time Machado has been
loved in *that* way, with ravenous, mutual obsession. “Sometimes when
you look at your phone, she has sent you something stunningly filthy,
and there is a kick of want between your legs. Sometimes when you catch
her looking at you, you feel like the luckiest person in the whole
world.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The look of love turns quickly to scrutiny, and then to blame.
“Sometimes when you look at your phone, she has sent you something
stunningly cruel, and there is a kick of fear between your shoulder
blades. Sometimes when you catch her looking at you, you feel like she’s
determining the best way to take you apart.”

The woman reveals herself in all her paranoia, possessiveness and fury.
She rages, calls Machado names, throws things at her — shoes, a suitcase
— forces her to barricade herself in a bathroom. The woman retreats and
returns later, undressed, warm and seductive, to ask, “Why are you
crying?*”* Her voice is so concerned, so sweet that “your heart splits
open like a peach.”

There will be an end to all this — even a happy ending. Machado lets her
younger self glimpse into the future, at love again, marriage to a
beautiful woman, “a sun-soaked apartment.” But she remains bedeviled by
her questions. “Was she trained to find you, or were you trained to be
found? Was it the fact that you’d already been tenderized like a pork
chop by: never having been properly in love, being told you should be
grateful for anything you get as a fat woman, getting weird messages
that relationships are about fighting and being at odds with each
other?”

This is to say nothing of the questions she imagines others might ask:
“Maybe it was rough, but was it really abusive? What does that mean,
anyway?”

“In the Dream House” is written into the silence surrounding violence in
queer relationships, the silences around emotional and psychological
abuse. Did lesbians of the past “hurl inkwells and figurines?” Machado
asks. “Did any of them wonder if what had happened to them had any name
at all?” She begins to cobble together a language for what she has
experienced. What queer abuse feels most like, she realizes, is
homophobia, the same way abuse in heterosexual relationships can feel
like sexism: “I am doing this because I can get away with it; I can get
away with it because you exist on some cultural margin, some societal
periphery.”

Machado repeatedly returns to the idea of the archive — the places where
stories are enshrined, entered into an official record. The word itself
refers to a kind of structure; “archive” derives from the ancient Greek
*arkheion*, “house of the ruler.” There was no such record for Machado
to draw on. “I toss the stone of my story into a vast crevice; measure
the emptiness by its small sound,” she writes. That is, of course, how
she begins the book. At its conclusion, what does she leave us but a
library in miniature — those long-invisible, long-suppressed stories now
culled from every quarter of history, and explored in every conceivable
genre — a living archive of her own loving, idiosyncratic design.
