A federal appeals panel said on Monday that President Trump’s accounting
firm must turn over [eight years of his personal and corporate tax
returns to Manhattan
prosecutors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html),
a setback for the president’s attempt to keep his financial records
private.

Almost immediately after the ruling, one of the president’s personal
lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said Mr. Trump would appeal to the Supreme Court.
The president maintains that the Constitution shields him from any
criminal investigation.

“The issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our republic,” Mr.
Sekulow said. “The constitutional issues are significant.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The case will almost certainly be the first one involving Mr. Trump’s
personal conduct and business dealings to reach the high court. The
court is not required to hear the case, but the significance of the
issues involved suggests that it will. A decision on the case may come
by June, as the presidential election enters its final stages.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other cases involving Mr. Trump are also in the pipeline. They involve
matters as diverse as demands from House Democrats for tax and business
records, a request for access to redacted portions of the report
prepared by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, and challenges
to Mr. Trump’s business arrangements under the Constitution’s emoluments
clauses.

Last month, for instance, a divided three-judge panel of the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit [ruled that
Mr. Trump’s accounting firm must
comply](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/mazars-trump-tax-returns.html)
with the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s demands for eight years
of his financial records. Mr. Trump [has asked the full appeals
court](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/10/25/document1.pdf) to rehear
that case.

In a different case last month, [a federal judge in Washington
ruled](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/us/politics/house-impeachment-subpoenas.html)
that the House Judiciary Committee was entitled to see secret grand jury
evidence gathered by Mr. Mueller.

[Mr. Trump has fought vigorously to shield his financial
records](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/politics/trump-house-lawsuits.html?module=inline),
and prosecutors in Manhattan have agreed not to seek the tax returns
until the case is resolved by the Supreme Court.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In its ruling on Monday, the three-judge appeals panel did not take a
position on the president’s biggest argument — that he was immune from
all criminal investigations. A lower court had called that argument
“repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional
values.”

Instead, the appeals court said the president’s accounting firm, not Mr.
Trump himself, was subpoenaed for the documents, so it did not matter
whether presidents had immunity.

“We emphasize again the narrowness of the issue before us,” the decision
read. “This appeal does not require us to consider whether the president
is immune from indictment and prosecution while in office, nor to
consider whether the president may lawfully be ordered to produce
documents for use in a state criminal proceeding.”

Although the panel did not rule on the question of a president’s
immunity from investigation, the judges still made it clear they
disagreed with Mr. Trump and thought he was unlikely to prevail on that
argument.

## Read the decision

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on President Trump’s attempt
to shield his tax
returns.

![36 pages, 0.34

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Judge Robert A. Katzmann noted in the unanimous ruling that Mr. Trump
had conceded that his immunity would last only as long as he held office
and he could therefore be prosecuted after stepping down.

“There is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a
president during his term and, with the information secured during that
search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office,”
Judge Katzmann wrote for the panel of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By keeping the ruling narrowly focused on the subpoena directed at Mr.
Trump’s accounting firm, the effect may be to allow the Supreme Court to
uphold the decision without having to issue a far broader ruling against
the president.

The Second Circuit appeals court typically considers cases with
three-judge panels. In addition to Judge Katzmann, the court’s chief
judge, the panel included Judge Denny Chin and Judge Christopher F.
Droney.

Judge Katzmann was placed on the appeals court by former President Bill
Clinton. Judges Chin and Droney were appointed by former President
Barack Obama.

The legal fight began in late August after the office of the Manhattan
district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, subpoenaed Mr.
Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns and those of
his family business dating to 2011.

Prosecutors in the office are [examining the role of the president and
his business in hush-money
payments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/nyregion/trump-cohen-stormy-daniels-vance.html)
made to two women just before the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Vance’s office sought the records in connection with an
investigation into whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr.
Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed his former
lawyer and fixer, [Michael D. Cohen, for payments he
made](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html)
to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had an affair
with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cohen was also involved in money paid to [Karen
McDougal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/fox-news-mcdougal.html),
a Playboy model who also said she had a relationship with Mr. Trump. The
president has denied the relationships.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Mr. Trump’s lawyers sued to block the
subpoena](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/nyregion/trump-tax-returns-lawsuit.html),
writing that the criminal investigation of the president was
unconstitutional. They asserted that presidents have such unique power
and responsibility that they cannot be subject to the burden of
investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the
criminal process for political gain.

They pointed to impeachment as the correct way to address any potential
wrongdoing by a president. Mr. Trump’s lawyers also have called the
district attorney’s action an “effort to harass the president by
obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information, not a
legitimate attempt to enforce New York law.”

A spokesman for Mr. Vance said the office had no comment on the appeals
court decision.

The immunity argument has never been tested in court. Federal
prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a crime
because the Justice Department has decided that presidents have
temporary immunity from prosecution while they are in office.

But that policy has not precluded investigations of the president. Mr.
Trump and other sitting presidents have been the subjects of federal
criminal investigations, and local prosecutors like Mr. Vance have not
been bound by the policy.

On Oct. 7, [Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in
Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/nyregion/trump-tax-returns-new-york.html)
issued a 75-page opinion, rejecting Mr. Trump’s position.

Mr. Trump appealed to the Second Circuit, and in oral arguments last
month, William S. Consovoy, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, told the panel, “We
view the entire subpoena as an inappropriate fishing expedition not made
in good faith.”

During the arguments, the president’s immunity claim seemed to
crystallize when Judge Chin cited an audacious statement Mr. Trump once
made — that he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, without
being hurt politically.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Judge Chin asked Mr. Consovoy about the potential effect of the
president’s immunity claim in such a hypothetical situation. “Local
authorities couldn’t investigate?” Judge Chin asked, adding: “Nothing
could be done? That’s your position?”

“That is correct. That is correct,” Mr. Consovoy said.

The [Justice Department, led by William P. Barr, had also weighed
in](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/nyregion/trump-taxes-lawsuit.html?module=inline),
writing in court filings that Mr. Vance’s subpoena should be blocked for
now but not adopting Mr. Trump’s absolutist view that a sitting
president could never be subject to criminal investigation.

Although the United States is not a party to the lawsuit, it has the
right to give its views.

In an appellate brief, the Justice Department wrote that Mr. Vance’s
office should not be able to obtain the president’s personal records
unless it could show that they were central to the investigation, not
available elsewhere and were needed immediately, rather than after Mr.
Trump leaves office.

“A subpoena directed at a president’s records should be permitted only
as a last resort,” the department wrote.

Under a deal reached by Mr. Trump’s lawyers with Mr. Vance’s office, the
subpoena will not be enforced while Mr. Trump seeks review of the
appellate ruling in the Supreme Court, provided that he asks that the
court hear the case in its current term, which ends in June.
