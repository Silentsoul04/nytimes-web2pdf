\textbf{Name:} Joel Kim Booster

\textbf{Age:} 31

\textbf{Hometown:} Born in South Korea and raised in Plainfield, Ill.,
by adoptive parents.

\textbf{Now lives:} In a sparsely decorated one-bedroom apartment in the
Thai Town area of Los Angeles.

\textbf{Claim to fame:} \href{http://www.ihatejoelkim.com/}{Mr. Kim
Booster} is a stand-up comedian and actor who currently stars in
``\href{https://www.nbc.com/sunnyside/video/sunnyside-official-trailer/3953479}{Sunnyside},''
a sitcom created by Kal Penn about six immigrants pursuing the American
dream. His unfiltered jokes on topics like Grindr hookups and
Korean-American stereotypes have made him a favorite of late-night
television. (During a routine on
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3t6kUbhpMI\&feature=youtu.be}{The
Late Late Show With James Corden},'' he said: ``My dad did have two sons
and they both turned out gay, and I don't think there is a clearer sign
from God that he is done with this bloodline.'') ``I don't approach
comedy in terms of, `Oh, will this alienate Middle America?''' he said
in a recent interview. ``But I have to make sure there is something
universal in all of the truths that I'm speaking about.''

\textbf{Big break:} So how does the adopted son of an Evangelical
conservative family end up as a potty-mouthed comic? ``It seems like a
cliché now, but all you need is a religious background and you're forced
into comedy,'' he said. After graduating from Millikin University in
Decatur, Ill., he moved to Chicago to become an actor. He was frustrated
with being typecast as the ``silent, exoticized foreigner'' or a ``lab
technician on shows like `Chicago P.D.,''' he said. A friend encouraged
him to write stand-up to reclaim his narrative as an openly gay
Asian-American man. During a ``sad, barely-attended'' TBS comedy
showcase at Flappers in Burbank in 2016, a booker for ``Conan'' invited
him to \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_W09RejL1c}{perform his
routine}. ``It was a moment where I felt like O.K., this is it, I can do
this,'' he said.

\textbf{Latest project:} In ``Sunnyside,'' he plays a ``catastrophically
dumb'' fashionista of mysterious origins (``our dad lives in
international waters''). ``The show doesn't shy away from showing how
the immigration process overlaps with things like affordable housing and
lack of health care in this country,'' he said.

\textbf{Next thing:} He is developing
\href{https://deadline.com/2019/09/fire-island-comedy-series-trip-from-joel-kim-booster-jax-media-in-works-at-quibi-1202744032/}{a
romantic comedy} inspired by ``Pride and Prejudice,'' only set on Fire
Island, for the streaming-video platform Quibi. ``I am a huge Jane
Austen fan,'' he said. He also started a podcast with his friend and
fellow comedian \href{https://www.mitrajouhari.biz}{Mitra Jouhari}
called
``\href{https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/urgent-care-with-joel-kim-booster-mitra-jouhari/id1483879124}{Urgent
Care}.'' The show's aim is to bestow ``unqualified, completely-unhinged
advice'' to ``people who apparently have nowhere else to turn,'' he
said.

\textbf{Clothes minded:} Mr. Kim Booster is a bit of a fashionista in
real life, too. ``I'm in this weird spot where my really tuned-in
fashion friends would say I'm just riding the trends,'' he said. ``And
any of my really basic friends would say I look insane.''
