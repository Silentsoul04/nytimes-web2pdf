</div>

Mr. Kent, the department’s top Ukraine official, is known for pushing
good governance causes without regard for whom he might offend.

WASHINGTON — As the senior State Department official in charge of
[Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html),
[George P.
Kent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html)
was so alarmed by what he viewed as [President
Trump’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html)
efforts to initiate “politically motivated prosecutions” there that he
wrote a memo about it over the summer — weeks before an anonymous
whistle-blower’s explosive complaint prompted the [impeachment
inquiry](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearing-day-1.html).

On Wednesday, he became [one of the first public
witnesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html)
in the investigation.

In his [closed-door
interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/hunter-biden-ukraine.html)
with the House Intelligence Committee last month, Mr. Kent suggested the
president was engaged in behavior the United States would never tolerate
in nations with corrupt governments.

“There is an outstanding issue about people in office in those countries
using selectively politically motivated prosecutions to go after their
opponents,” Mr. Kent said, according to [a transcript released last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/07/us/politics/george-kent-transcript.html).
“And that’s wrong for the rule of law regardless of what country that
happens.”

## Full Video and Analysis of Day 1 of Impeachment Hearing Testimony

William B. Taylor Jr., the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George P.
Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy,
are testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee in the first
public hearing of the impeachment inquiry. Our correspondents are
following every revelation and providing live analysis and insights.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A Harvard graduate and career diplomat who speaks Ukrainian, Russian and
Thai, Mr. Kent joined the State Department in 1992 and now holds the
title of deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs.
He has a deep knowledge of corruption in Ukraine from his time as an
anticorruption coordinator in the State Department’s European Bureau in
2014 and 2015, and later as deputy chief of mission in the United States
Embassy in Kiev from 2015 until 2018.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kent is known for pushing for good governance causes without regard
for whom he might offend. He once told former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr.’s staff that it “could create the [perception of a conflict of
interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/joe-biden-ukraine.html)”
that Mr. Biden’s son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company
that had been accused of corruption. He also accused a Ukrainian
prosecutor of [taking a
bribe](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/impeachment-george-kent-state.html)
to drop a case against the oligarch who owned that gas company.

And he fought vigorously to defend Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former
ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted by Mr. Trump, calling a different
Ukrainian prosecutor’s criticism of her “complete poppycock” in an email
to other State Department officials.

On the day of his deposition, Mr. Kent strode into the Capitol wearing
[a bow-tie and dark three-piece
suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/style/george-kent-bow-tie.html),
and spent more than seven hours with investigators. He made clear that
he was deeply troubled by the way Mr. Trump and his allies were pushing
Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, and complained that Mr. Trump’s inner
circle had sidelined him.

He was all but cut out of decisions regarding Ukraine, he told
investigators, after a May meeting organized by Mick Mulvaney, the
acting White House chief of staff.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kent was especially disturbed at the role of Rudolph W. Giuliani,
Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, whom he viewed as running a rogue foreign
policy operation in Ukraine that excluded career diplomats. He had
[warned colleagues as far back as
March](https://twitter.com/kenvogel/status/1184146566346661889?lang=en)
about what he described as “disinformation” being spread by Mr. Giuliani
and Trump allies in the conservative news media to smear both Mr. Biden
and Ms. Yovanovitch.

Mr. Giuliani, he told investigators, was running “a campaign of lies.”

In his private testimony, he offered new detail that appeared to
underscore the idea that Mr. Trump’s actions were politically motivated,
saying he was told that the president wanted to hear President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine say the name “Clinton” in connection with potential
wrongdoing.

Using the acronym for president of the United States, he told
investigators, “POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go
to microphone and say, investigations, Biden and Clinton.”
