WASHINGTON --- As the senior State Department official in charge of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html}{Ukraine},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html}{George
P. Kent} was so alarmed by what he viewed as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html}{President
Trump's} efforts to initiate ``politically motivated prosecutions''
there that he wrote a memo about it over the summer --- weeks before an
anonymous whistle-blower's explosive complaint prompted the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearing-day-1.html}{impeachment
inquiry}.

On Wednesday, he became
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html}{one
of the first public witnesses} in the investigation.

In his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/hunter-biden-ukraine.html}{closed-door
interview} with the House Intelligence Committee last month, Mr. Kent
suggested the president was engaged in behavior the United States would
never tolerate in nations with corrupt governments.

``There is an outstanding issue about people in office in those
countries using selectively politically motivated prosecutions to go
after their opponents,'' Mr. Kent said, according to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/07/us/politics/george-kent-transcript.html}{a
transcript released last week}. ``And that's wrong for the rule of law
regardless of what country that happens.''

\subsection{Full Video and Analysis of Day 1 of Impeachment Hearing
Testimony}\label{full-video-and-analysis-of-day-1-of-impeachment-hearing-testimony}}

William B. Taylor Jr., the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George P.
Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy,
are testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee in the first
public hearing of the impeachment inquiry. Our correspondents are
following every revelation and providing live analysis and insights.

A Harvard graduate and career diplomat who speaks Ukrainian, Russian and
Thai, Mr. Kent joined the State Department in 1992 and now holds the
title of deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs.
He has a deep knowledge of corruption in Ukraine from his time as an
anticorruption coordinator in the State Department's European Bureau in
2014 and 2015, and later as deputy chief of mission in the United States
Embassy in Kiev from 2015 until 2018.

Mr. Kent is known for pushing for good governance causes without regard
for whom he might offend. He once told former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr.'s staff that it ``could create the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/joe-biden-ukraine.html}{perception
of a conflict of interest}'' that Mr. Biden's son was serving on the
board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been accused of corruption. He
also accused a Ukrainian prosecutor of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/impeachment-george-kent-state.html}{taking
a bribe} to drop a case against the oligarch who owned that gas company.

And he fought vigorously to defend Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former
ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted by Mr. Trump, calling a different
Ukrainian prosecutor's criticism of her ``complete poppycock'' in an
email to other State Department officials.

On the day of his deposition, Mr. Kent strode into the Capitol wearing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/style/george-kent-bow-tie.html}{a
bow-tie and dark three-piece suit}, and spent more than seven hours with
investigators. He made clear that he was deeply troubled by the way Mr.
Trump and his allies were pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, and
complained that Mr. Trump's inner circle had sidelined him.

He was all but cut out of decisions regarding Ukraine, he told
investigators, after a May meeting organized by Mick Mulvaney, the
acting White House chief of staff.

Mr. Kent was especially disturbed at the role of Rudolph W. Giuliani,
Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, whom he viewed as running a rogue foreign
policy operation in Ukraine that excluded career diplomats. He had
\href{https://twitter.com/kenvogel/status/1184146566346661889?lang=en}{warned
colleagues as far back as March} about what he described as
``disinformation'' being spread by Mr. Giuliani and Trump allies in the
conservative news media to smear both Mr. Biden and Ms. Yovanovitch.

Mr. Giuliani, he told investigators, was running ``a campaign of lies.''

In his private testimony, he offered new detail that appeared to
underscore the idea that Mr. Trump's actions were politically motivated,
saying he was told that the president wanted to hear President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine say the name ``Clinton'' in connection with
potential wrongdoing.

Using the acronym for president of the United States, he told
investigators, ``POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go
to microphone and say, investigations, Biden and Clinton.''
