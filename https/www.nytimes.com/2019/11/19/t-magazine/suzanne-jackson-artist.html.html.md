[Suzanne Jackson](http://www.suzannefjackson.net/) isn’t fond of the
term “overachiever,” though you wouldn’t be wrong to call her one. At
75, she has had a long, storied, multi-hyphenate career as a painter,
poet, dancer, teacher, curator and theater designer. She’s not a fan of
the word “career” either: “It’s my life’s work,” she says. “There’s just
a lot of things to be interested in.” Jackson traces that attitude back
to her childhood in 1940s and ’50s pre-statehood Alaska, where a certain
pioneering spirit prevailed. “We just *did* things,” she remembers. She
went to college at San Francisco State University at 17, studying art,
drama and dance; toured South America as a ballerina; and in 1967, ****
moved to Los Angeles, where she tooled around town in a Buick Hearse,
took drawing classes from [Charles
White](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/t-magazine/art/charles-white-moma-retrospective.html),
began showing her paintings at the influential Ankrum gallery and, in
1968, opened Gallery 32, the community-minded space she ran out of her
studio near MacArthur Park for two years. There, she hosted exhibitions
by emerging black artists like [David
Hammons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/t-magazine/art/steve-cannon-david-hammons.html)
and [Betye
Saar](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/arts/design/betye-saar.html),
as well as a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers. As a single mother in
her 40s with her son in tow, she earned a graduate degree in theater
design at Yale, worked on productions with the Kennedy Center and the
Berkeley Repertory Theater and eventually settled in Georgia in the
mid-90s to teach at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She has now
lived and worked in the city for two decades, in a rambling,
three-story, double-wide 1890s house that she owns in the historic
Starland district.

Though she has made paintings since she was a child, and exhibited since
the late 1960s, Jackson has had something of a banner year. In June, she
mounted a career survey at Savannah’s [Telfair
Museums](https://www.telfair.org/); in September, she [won a
grant](https://joanmitchellfoundation.org/artist-programs/artist-grants/painter-sculptors/2019/suzanne-jackson)
from the Joan Mitchell Foundation; and this month, she opens a [solo
show](http://www.ortuzarprojects.com/exhibitions/suzanne-jackson/works?view=slider)
at Ortuzar Projects in Lower Manhattan, an exhibition that focuses on
her boundary-pushing recent work: otherworldly, dimensional paintings
composed entirely of acrylic paint — with no canvas beneath — embedded
with bits of household detritus and personal ephemera.

Jackson first began using acrylics during her years in Los Angeles,
after her car was broken into and her oil paints stolen. She initially
**** deployed it almost like watercolor, setting down layer upon layer
of washy pigment to build up dreamy images of black figures commingling
with birds, flowers and hearts. In more recent decades, her art has
become abstract and more driven by materials. During the years she
worked as a theater designer, Jackson began incorporating discarded
bogus paper — the sheeting used to protect a stage while painting sets —
into her increasingly textural surfaces. Then it was leftover deer
netting from her garden, ballet netting from her costume designs and
produce bags and wood salvaged from renovating her house. Eventually she
figured out that she could put paint down directly onto a table covered
in plastic, then peel it up and hang the drying film as her canvas,
allowing her to paint acrylic straight onto acrylic. The result, which
looks delicate but is not — “you can kick it, stomp on it, it’s not
going to be harmed,” says Jackson — blurs the line between painting and
sculpture. Upcycling remains central to her process. She even peels the
paint from her hands and stores the dried flakes for future use. In this
way, her synthetic medium “becomes organic,” she explains, “because I’m
reintegrating paint that would go into nature and destroy it.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When we speak over the phone in late October, Jackson has just come
inside after trying to help a butterfly with a broken wing that got
caught in her screen door. She bemoans the gentrification that’s
changing her leafy neighborhood, the interlopers who seem intent on
cutting down trees and installing newfangled businesses, like a
shipping-container food court that, she says, “looks like a prison.”
(Not all the neighbors are so terrible: At the brewery across the
street, the proprietors named a beer in her honor — “Ms. Suzanne,” a
Guinness-like concoction that’s best served in a wine glass.) Her own
home sits on three lots, her backyard lush with pomegranate trees, grape
vines, woodpeckers, turtles, feral cats, possums, raccoons and snakes.
“Everyone wants it, but they’re not going to have it,” Jackson says of
the property. She chuckles. “That’s just the way it is.” Sitting in one
of her studio rooms on the west side of the building, her 8-year-old
Siamese, Lexi, on her lap, she answers T’s artist’s questionnaire.

**What is your day like? How much do you sleep? What is your work
schedule?**

Last night, I didn’t go to bed until 2. Sometimes I can wake up at 4. I
listen to NPR until 8 in the morning. My bedroom is on the second floor,
so I come downstairs and through the studio to see what I’m doing. And I
may end up climbing a ladder to work on something before I get around to
the kitchen to have a cup of coffee or some breakfast. Then I have to
feed all the cats. I come back into the studio and fiddle around some
more before I get dressed. I work less now at night. My neighborhood is
very noisy at night, almost like a circus with all these clubs and
parties.

**How many hours of creative work do you do in a day?**

All day long. If I’m not physically putting paint on something, I’m
writing or reading, thinking about it. And even when I’m supposed to be
sleeping, I’m thinking about what I’m going to do, how I’m going to
accomplish a structural idea, what should the title be, what’s next. And
then, because I don’t have assistants, I’m also having to think about
the calendar, the schedule of things going on. Sometimes I think I
really *should* have an assistant, but I make my work so that I can get
up on the ladder and take it down. I believe my hand should be in the
work, and not somebody else’s, unless I want to share the credit with
them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What is the worst studio you ever had?**

Physically the worst studio might be my very first one, for $40 a month
on Temple Street in Los Angeles. It was like a storefront on the front
of a beautiful Victorian house. I had to put a parachute over my bed
because there were holes in the floor from the house upstairs, and the
kids would throw little pebbles down. I just remember my mother and
father sitting there, my dad in his suit, my mother in her nice little
dress, like, “What has happened to our daughter?” To me, that wasn’t a
bad studio. It was my first studio, and it was really wonderful.

**What is the first work you ever sold, and for how much?**

That was a piece that I sold at the Laguna Beach art museum in 1968 ****
for $300. I think it was called “Gypsy Girl.” It was a watercolor. I
have a feeling that when they had the fires in Laguna Beach, that
painting could have been destroyed. I don’t even know who bought it.

**When you start a new piece, where do you begin? What is the first
step?**

Sometimes I’m working on three or four things at a time. One or two
pieces may be drawing, and then I’m working on something else. Sometimes
it’s just, put down the brush stroke or a big palette knife on
something, then see what happens. Walk away and come back. Try to be
focused, and then try to be unfocused.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**How do you know when you’re done with a piece?**

With these new pieces that are pure acrylic, I watch to see where the
stress is. Maybe there are places where the paint is thinner, or the
weight of the paint may pull. Sometimes I’ll go back, but usually the
piece just tells me that it doesn’t want to be touched anymore.

**What music do you play when you’re making art?**

Lots of jazz. I used to start with [Yo-Yo
Ma](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/yoyo-ma) in the morning, and
then it would evolve into jazz, and then maybe by 3 in the morning it
would be [Jimi
Hendrix](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jimi-hendrix). I met \[the
Savannah radio veteran\] Ike Carter, and in 2013, we started this group,
bringing in music that we like for a radio program \[“Listen Hear,”
hosted by Savannah State University Radio\]. He’s kind of a maestro of
blues and African-American classical music.

**Is there a meal you eat on repeat when you’re working?**

My lazy food is a veggie burger. I like really grainy Ezekiel or spelt
bread, and then I put on tomatoes and lettuce. I grew up with Miracle
Whip instead of mayo, and the strongest grainy mustard. That’s my fast
food. With a glass of wine, maybe.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Are you bingeing on any shows right now?**

I love
“[Poldark](https://www.nytimes.com/watching/recommendations/poldark).”
That’s my Sunday night splurge.

**What is the weirdest object in your studio?**

Probably me? This is an odd building. On the third floor on the east
side there’s a sign that says “This Room is Haunt” \[sic\]. One day,
this man came by in a truck and said, “I used to live in that house when
I was a little boy, and we wrote a sign because we thought that room was
haunted.” So that’s left over.

**What’s the last thing that made you cry?**

I was at the dentist the morning that the Joan Mitchell Foundation
called. When I got home, there was an email from them. I’m so used to
getting rejection notes. When I opened it up, I couldn’t believe it. I
think I just said, “Oh my God,” and broke out in tears. Before that, the
last time I really cried was when my son passed away unexpectedly \[in
2016, of congestive heart failure\]. Then I couldn’t cry very long
because all his friends were there, and I had to console them. But I
broke out in tears when I realized I had actually, for the first time in
my life, won a real grant with money attached. I just sat there crying
all by myself.

**What do you bulk buy with most frequency?**

As soon as I got my grant money, I ordered five gallon buckets of
acrylic medium from Nova Color in California. I also buy 60 pounds of
cat food on a regular schedule. And bird feed. I have subscriptions for
that, and I have a subscription for wine. That’s my other thing.

**Do you exercise, other than climbing up and down ladders?**

Well, I have a lot of steps to run up and down. I *was* a dancer, and I
was really toned. I think the last time I danced was when I taught
modern dance in 1994. People don’t seem to dance anymore, even social
dancing. They just stand and hoot and holler. They don’t move. I can’t
forgive myself for not being as toned as I was when I was younger, when
I weighed 105 pounds and hadn’t had a baby. It’s part of being a woman:
You grow up and you have a body. I’ve become less unforgiving about it,
but I’m still always trying to breathe in. Sometimes in the morning when
I wake up I try to stretch in bed, which is cheating.

**What are you reading right now?**

Aberjhani, who wrote a poem for my Telfair catalog, has a book called
“[Dreams of the Immortal City
Savannah](https://www.author-poet-aberjhani.info/dreams-of-the-immortal-city-savannah)*.”*
That’s the one I’ve read recently. I just bought this big volume of
George Herriman’s “Krazy Kat.” I said I was not going to buy any more
books at my age, but I had to have that one, because that’s how I
learned to read. And I think the social commentary may have
subconsciously influenced my life.

**What’s your favorite artwork by someone else**?

Oh, that’s so hard\! I love Mary Lovelace O’Neal’s paintings. [Ruth
Asawa](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/arts/design/ruth-asawa-an-artist-who-wove-wire-dies-at-87.html)
is another of my favorites. We were on the California Arts Council
together. [Mary
Corse](https://www.lehmannmaupin.com/artists/mary-corse). Her work is so
subtle. [Senga Nengudi](http://sengasenga.com/). It’s really hard. You
know the drawing that really affected me when I first saw it? The one by
Charles White of a woman with books spread out on the table. Of course
he was my teacher. I love [Lee
Bontecou](https://www.moma.org/artists/670)’s work. And [Augusta
Savage](https://americanart.si.edu/artist/augusta-savage-4269). There
are just so many lovely things in the world, and people who help you to
think and see. You can’t just choose one.
