# Vindman’s Lawyer Asks Fox News to Retract Espionage Allegation

</div>

A guest on the ‘Ingraham Angle,’ a Fox show, suggested that Lt. Col.
Alexander S. Vindman, a key figure in the impeachment hearings, was
guilty of spying.

[Lt. Col. Alexander S.
Vindman](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-white-house.html)
is hitting back at the
[smear](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/business/media/fox-news-alexander-vindman.html)
[campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-vindman-twitter.html)
against him.

A lawyer for [Colonel
Vindman](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/vindman-trump-ukraine-impeachment.html),
the National Security Council’s Ukraine expert, sent [a warning
letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6555531-VIndman-Boies-LETTER.html)
to Fox News on Wednesday seeking a retraction or correction of an
October segment hosted by one of the network’s biggest personalities,
Laura Ingraham, which baselessly suggested that the colonel, a decorated
Iraq war veteran, might be guilty of espionage.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The letter sent by David Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner,
the law firm run by David Boies, also highlighted inflammatory
statements made on the network by others, including President Trump’s
son Donald Trump Jr., who has repeatedly attacked Colonel Vindman, and
Tucker Carlson, another prominent Fox host.

“LTC Vindman and his family have been forced to examine options,
including potentially moving onto a military base, in order to ensure
their physical security in the face of threats rooted in the falsehood
that Fox News originated,” Mr. Pressman wrote in the letter.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Pressman’s letter mainly focused on an [Oct. 28
segment](https://www.mediamatters.org/trump-impeachment-inquiry/laura-ingraham-guest-suggests-congressional-witness-lt-col-vindman-may-be)
of “The Ingraham Angle,” a show hosted by Ms. Ingraham, featuring an
exchange between her and John Yoo, who was a top lawyer in the George W.
Bush administration.

During their exchange, Ms. Ingraham said, “Here we have a U.S. national
security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the
White House, apparently against the president’s interest, and usually,
they spoke in English. Isn’t that kind of an interesting angle on this
story?”

“I found that astounding,” Mr. Yoo replied. “Some people might call that
espionage.”

Espionage is a felony punishable by death, Mr. Pressman wrote, adding
that before the Fox segment, Colonel Vindman “had never in his decorated
20-year career of service to his country been accused of having dual
loyalties or committing espionage.”

Colonel Vindman was not trying to silence the news media, Mr. Pressman
wrote. “He wants, as any responsible news organization would want, to
see the truth published,” he said. “And Fox News is in a unique position
to correct its falsehoods with truth.”

The segment “sparked a torrent of republications and copycat false
charges,” he added.

A statement released Wednesday by Fox said that “as a guest on Fox News,
John Yoo was responsible for his own sentiments, and he has subsequently
done interviews to clarify what he meant.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In [an opinion
article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/11/01/john-yoo-alexander-vindman-ukraine-espionage-testimony-column/4111757002/)
in USA Today, under the headline, “No, I didn’t call Alexander Vindman a
spy,” Mr. Yoo wrote that he was accusing Ukraine of conducting an
espionage operation.

“Despite what might appear on twitter, I didn’t say that Lt. Col. was a
spy or that he had committed espionage,” he wrote in an email. “I had no
reason to question that he was doing his duty as an officer. But I think
the Ukrainians are engaged in espionage against us.”

Mr. Pressman, in his letter, wrote that “Mr. Yoo’s argument that he did
not intend to accuse LTC of Vindman of ‘espionage’ — that he was
accusing the nation of Ukraine instead — is as legally irrelevant as it
is factually incredible.”

Much of the right-wing criticism of Colonel Vindman accuses him of being
partisan, despite his long career of nonpartisan military service, or
that he has divided loyalties, since he immigrated from Ukraine when he
was 3.

The president himself [has
suggested](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-74/)
that the colonel is a “Never Trumper,” without evidence. And critics
like Ms. Ingraham have seized on the fact that he had high-level
contacts with Ukrainian officials and provided guidance to them on
American policy, even though a key part of his job at the National
Security Council is to interact with the Ukrainian government and
communicate security policy.

The letter also said that Mr. Trump had “built on and amplified Fox
News’ falsehoods” in [his Twitter
posts](https://twitter.com/Scavino45/status/1196860213233684480), and
cited a segment in which Donald Trump Jr., referred to the colonel as “a
leftist,” though a Fox News [host
interjected](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/468144-trump-jr-attacks-vindman-total-absolution-if-you-are-a-leftist)
to say “we don’t know if he’s a leftist.”

In testimony on Tuesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel
Vindman said that he twice reported his concerns about the Trump
administration’s dealings with Ukraine to N.S.C. officials. At the
hearing, Republicans ominously highlighted an episode where the
Ukrainians sounded out the colonel about becoming the country’s defense
minister, an offer the colonel said he rejected immediately and reported
to his supervisors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the aftermath of his appearance, attacks against Colonel Vindman
escalated, including from Donald Trump Jr., who [called the
colonel](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1196845403129421824)
“a low level partisan bureaucrat and nothing more.”

Mr. Carlson and Ms. Ingraham seized on Ukraine’s job offer, with Mr.
Carlson saying on-air, according to the letter, “Now we learn that the
Ukrainian government repeatedly asked Vindman to take formal control of
the entire Ukrainian military, which, for the record, is a very strange
thing to ask of an active duty American military officer.”

Mr. Pressman lamented such insinuations about his client’s loyalty.

“Not once in his twenty-year career has LTC Vindman sought out the
public eye,” he wrote. “LTC Vindman came into the public not because of
his actions, but despite them.”
