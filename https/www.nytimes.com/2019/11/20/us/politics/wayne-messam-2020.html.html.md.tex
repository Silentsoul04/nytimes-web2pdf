Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., has ended a presidential
campaign that barely got off the ground.

Mr. Messam, 45, announced his decision on Wednesday
\href{https://medium.com/@WAYNEMESSAM/i-am-suspending-my-2020-presidential-campaign-but-im-not-finished-yet-60f72ece2b49}{in
a post on Medium}.

``I jumped in an already crowded field of capable candidates to change
the direction of this nation caused by the dysfunction of Washington and
the poor leadership of the current presidency,'' he said. ``I knew the
odds were a steep hill to climb but I have always fought for what is
right and will continue to break barriers never broken.''

Mr. Messam declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on March
28, discussing student debt, prescription drug costs and clean air, and
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/wayne-messam-announces-2020-bid/index.html}{telling
CNN} that he wanted to provide ``the leadership that will make these
issues a priority and have the political will to solve these issues for
the American people.''

He touted his background as a son of Jamaican immigrants, a former
professional football player, a small-business owner and a mayor. But he
did not articulate a vision that distinguished him from the many other
candidates in the field, most of them better known and more politically
experienced.

He rarely registered 1 percent in the polls, and he
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html}{did
not qualify} for any of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/democratic-debates}{Democratic
debates}.

\emph{{[}Who's in? Who's out?}

up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker}.{]}}

Mr. Messam was one of three sitting mayors to enter the race, along with
Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Bill de Blasio of New York. (Mr.
de Blasio has since dropped out, but his predecessor, Michael R.
Bloomberg of New York, appears likely to enter.)

He cast that as an advantage, saying that under his leadership, Miramar
had grappled with many of the same challenges the country faces: It
increased the minimum wage for city workers, declared itself a ``safe
zone'' for undocumented immigrants, sued the Florida government in an
effort to overturn a permissive gun law, and pledged to continue to
support the Paris climate accords after President Trump rejected them.

But the odds for Mr. Messam were always extraordinarily long: Besides
his low name recognition, no sitting mayor
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/23/us/politics/presidential-experience.html}{has
ever been elected president}.

In October, he
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/wayne-messam-5-dollars.html}{reported
raising just \$5 in the third fiscal quarter} --- an error that his
campaign corrected a month later. In an amended report to the Federal
Election Commission this week, he said he had actually raised \$15,000
--- lagging the next-lowest fund-raiser by more than \$300,000.
