Campaign}\label{joe-sestak-ends-presidential-campaign}}

Mr. Sestak, a Democrat, entered the race late and walked 105 miles
across New Hampshire in search of votes, but he never gained any
traction in a crowded field.

Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, a former Navy admiral who
made history in 2006 as the highest-ranked military officer elected to
Congress, announced on Sunday that he was dropping out of the
presidential race.

Mr. Sestak, a Democrat, had promoted himself as a candidate with the
``global experience'' needed to ``restore America's leadership in the
world,'' with a message focused on the economy and rural communities.
Among the centerpieces of his platform were a job training guarantee for
employees displaced by technological advances and outsourcing, and a
system of public hospitals in underserved areas.

But his campaign began late and never got off the ground. He raised less
than \$500,000, and his polling average in the Democratic primary was 0
percent.

``Thank you for this priceless opportunity as I end our campaign
together,'' Mr. Sestak said in a statement. ``Without the privilege of
national press, it is unfair to ask others to husband their resolve and
to sacrifice resources any longer.''

Mr. Sestak, 67, who served two terms in the House before losing a bid
for the Senate in 2010,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/joe-sestak-2020-candidates.html}{entered
the presidential race} in June, far later than most other candidates. He
said he had delayed his entry while his daughter received treatment for
brain cancer.

But without national name recognition or billions of dollars in personal
wealth, Mr. Sestak was unable to make even small inroads in an
impossibly saturated field: 24 candidates when he entered.

In October, he walked across New Hampshire --- 105 miles in seven days,
from Chesterfield to Portsmouth --- to try to draw attention to his
campaign. In earnest, almost plaintive email missives to supporters, he
ticked off the miles, described the scenery and asked for donations.

``The rain is pouring, and the wind is blowing, but I'm still walking
across New Hampshire,'' he wrote on Oct. 16 under a subject line that
began, ``Walking in your shoes --- in a nor'easter.''

``I have walked 12 miles so far today --- but I've got another 6 miles
to go, **** and am just coming up to Purgatory Falls Road,'' he wrote.
``Will you donate to ensure that as I walk in New Hampshirites' shoes
across the Granite State, I can keep my ads on the air in the Granite
State?''

It was a tactic he had tried before, in 2015, when he walked across
Pennsylvania to open a second campaign for the Senate.

It did not work then either.
