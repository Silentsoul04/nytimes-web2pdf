# Steve Bullock Drops Out of 2020 Presidential Race

</div>

Mr. Bullock, who won two terms as governor in a red state, didn’t catch
on with Democratic primary voters. An aide said he would not run for
Senate in Montana, as many Democrats have hoped.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who argued
relentlessly that his track record of winning in a deep red state made
him the Democrat best positioned to beat President Trump in 2020,
announced on Monday that he would end his presidential bid.

“While there were many obstacles we could not have anticipated when
entering this race,” Mr. Bullock said in a statement, “it has become
clear that in this moment, I won’t be able to break through to the top
tier of this still-crowded field of candidates.”

An aide said Mr. Bullock would not challenge Senator Steve Daines, a
Montana Republican facing re-election in 2020, as has been the hope of
many Democrats in Washington.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bullock, 53, was unable to overcome a late and slow start that
hobbled his campaign. Democratic voters never bought into his argument
that winning election in a state carried by Mr. Trump was sufficient
evidence that he should be the party’s presidential
nominee.

## Who’s Running for President in 2020?

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Having started without a national fund-raising list or much exposure
outside his home state’s one million residents, Mr. Bullock failed to
break out of the third-tier pack of candidates. He never registered more
than 1 percent support in the dozens of polls the Democratic National
Committee used to determine which candidates qualified for the party’s
televised debates.

Mr. Bullock’s pragmatic message of Trump-state success didn’t catch on
with the party’s donors, either. He had raised
[just](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/us/elections/democratic-q3-fundraising.html)[$4.4

the end of
September](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/us/elections/democratic-q3-fundraising.html),
a pittance for a modern national campaign. Former Representative Beto

of the race last month, [raised more on his first

The failure of Mr. Bullock’s campaign illustrates how presidential
primaries have been nationalized in recent cycles. Bill Clinton was able
to rise from a small-state governorship to the presidency — in a race
with a Republican incumbent — by concentrating on New Hampshire early in
the 1992 contest. But Mr. Bullock, who focused on Iowa this year, barely
got noticed by Democrats there, even though he is a popular two-term
governor with accomplishments that included pushing a Medicaid expansion
through a Republican-controlled state legislature — a task that delayed
his entry into the race.

Even one of Iowa’s highest-profile endorsements, from Attorney General
Tom Miller, could not move the needle for Mr. Bullock among Iowa
Democrats, many of whom [had been saying for months that they were
overwhelmed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/iowa-democrats-2020.html)
by the number of candidates in the race.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bullock flew from his home in Helena, Mont., to Des Moines on Sunday
to inform his staff personally there that he was ending his campaign.

“I entered this race as a voice to win back the places we lost, bridge
divides and rid our system of the corrupting influence of dark money,”
Mr. Bullock said Monday. “While the concerns that propelled me to enter
in the first place have not changed, I leave this race filled with
gratitude and optimism, inspired and energized by the good people I’ve
had the privilege of meeting over the course of the campaign.”

Mr. Bullock in May became the [22nd Democrat to enter the 2020
presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/steve-bullock-2020.html)
— and both the size of the field and his relatively belated decision to
join it contributed to [his exclusion from the first Democratic
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/steve-bullock-democrats-2020.html)
the next month.

Without that chance at exposure, he was forced to play catch-up. He
focused much of his agenda on overhauling the campaign finance system
and promised to make Democrats competitive in the country’s interior.

Mr. Bullock participated in the party’s second debate in July and
[introduced himself to
voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/who-won-democratic-debate.html),
but he did not qualify for any other debates. He griped about his
exclusion in his campaign’s online videos and to reporters, but said he
was putting his faith in Iowa caucusgoers, not party officials.

“My expectation is it’s not D.N.C. rules that will decide this,” Mr.
Bullock said after a September campaign stop in Manchester, Iowa. “It’s
not nationalized, it’s folks here in Iowa that take this all very, very
seriously.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A Columbia University-educated lawyer who had served as Montana’s
attorney general, Mr. Bullock made his name as a pragmatist who was able
to win Republican support for liberal priorities. He was twice elected
governor of a state that President Trump carried by more than 20
percentage points.

Mr. Bullock brandished those credentials on the trail, often reminding
voters that he was the only candidate in the [historically
large](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/14/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-president.html)
field who had “won a Trump state.” He cautioned voters that the party’s
leading contenders, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie
Sanders, were focused on issues like calling for a single-payer health
care system that he warned would cost Democrats in a general election
against Mr. Trump.

“Many of the issues that folks are talking about through this primary,
they sound good through the primary, but I don’t know that that’s what’s
going to be able to win this overall election,” he said in the September
interview in Iowa. “I have grave concerns that we’re already on our way
to losing this election.”

Mr. Bullock’s campaign was marked by cheeky publicity stunts and his
regular calls for reducing the influence of money in politics. When
Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, [spent
tens of millions of dollars on television
ads](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/bloomberg-ads-2020-race.html)
for his own presidential campaign last month, Mr. Bullock issued one of
his final campaign pleas.

“The Democratic primary isn’t for sale — and a billionaire spending
hundreds of millions of dollars to buy an election isn’t going to fix
our political system,” he said.

But Mr. Bullock would soon become the 12th Democrat to drop out of the
race, following former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, who
[ended his
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/us/politics/joe-sestak-ends-presidential-campaign.html)
on Sunday. Sixteen candidates remain.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who like Mr. Bullock has
struggled to qualify for the Democratic debates, decried what he called
“unfair” rules that have kept both of them off the stage for months,
while praising the governor in a tweet as “a proven leader who got money
out of politics & expanded Medicaid.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

[Term limits prevent](https://sosmt.gov/elections/term_limits/) Mr.
Bullock from seeking a third term as governor, and [some Democrats have
held out hope that he will eventually run for the
Senate](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/steve-bullock-senate-2020-1321058).

The governor, however, has repeatedly said that he has no desire to do
so. His spokeswoman, Galia Slayen, said Monday that Mr. Bullock would
complete his term as governor and would not seek to challenge Mr.
Daines.

“While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across
the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a
senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S.
Senate,” Ms. Slayen said.

Reid J. Epstein reported from Charleston, and Matt Stevens from New
York.
