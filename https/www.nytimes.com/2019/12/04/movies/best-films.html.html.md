A.O. Scott

## Films Worth Arguing About

As the movie year winds down, I would like to express my gratitude to
Martin Scorsese. Not only for making [“The
Irishman,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/the-irishman-review.html)
his best movie in a long time and one of the best of 2019 (see below),
but also for reminding the world of the value of cinema.

The art form is in one of its periodic identity crises. A big chunk of
our collective attention — we don’t yet know how big, or with what
consequences — is migrating to streaming platforms whose offerings
include a lot of the stand-alone single-episode narratives that we used
to see mainly in theaters. (Yes, I know: We saw a lot of sequels, too.)
Movie theaters, meanwhile, are dominated by franchise, I.P.-driven
spectacles like the entities in Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe,
which Scorsese singled out, in an interview in Empire magazine and then
in [a New York Times
Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html),
as “not cinema.”

The dust-up that followed his remarks was predictable. Members of the
aggrieved superhero-loving community — some of whom draw Disney
paychecks — tut-tutted Scorsese for being old, out of touch, overrated
and, most of all, elitist. Accusing Scorsese (and his defenders) of
elitism was exemplary pseudo-populism, a defense of corporate hegemony
disguised as a celebration of mass taste. To question the apparent
preferences of millions of consumers is to risk being labeled a snob.

In the imaginations of their sore-winner, alpha dog-underdog opponents,
the snobs are simultaneously too dangerous to ignore and too enfeebled
to take seriously. The response is basically, *Shut up\! Shut up\! Shut
up\! Nobody’s listening to you anyway\!* And the anti-elitist argument
is at bottom a matter of numbers, of quantity trumping quality. That
“Avengers: Endgame” and “Joker” broke records at the global box office
surely means something, even if the movies themselves don’t.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But to paraphrase [Justin Timberlake’s character in “The Social
Network”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5fJmkv02is): a billion
dollars isn’t cool. You know what’s cool? Movies that offer something
more than the sullen pseudo-politics of “Joker” or the elaborate
pro-status-quo theatrics of “Avengers.” Movies that, rather than
fetishizing self-pity or sentimentalizing domination, illuminate the
cruelty, the comedy and the grace of the human condition. Movies that
treat you as something other than a passive spectator or an obedient,
presold “fan.” Movies that are actually worth arguing about, and
thinking about.

Which is more or less what Scorsese meant by “cinema.” The word might
make even some of his sympathizers a little uncomfortable. Because it
also exists in other languages, including French, using it might make
you sound like you’re putting on airs. (I myself prefer the Italian
pronunciation.) But far from signifying snootiness, the cosmopolitanism
of the term is a sign of the essentially democratic nature of the art
form itself, which is able to leap over barriers of language, custom and
ideology like few others.

(*Looking for the best movies to watch on Netflix, Disney Plus and other
streaming services?* [*Subscribe to our twice-weekly
newsletter*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/watching).)

Cinema also migrates across platforms, which is another reason to
embrace the old/new name. In the digital age, “film” is a technological
misnomer, attached to the glories of a specific, no-longer-dominant
(though not entirely obsolete) way of making and projecting pictures.
“Movies” are, mostly, what we see in theaters (or cinemas, just to
confuse the issue further), while “moving pictures” pop up on nearly
every surface, distracting us from our distraction.

“Cinema” is more capacious and also more specific, because it refers to
an aesthetic rather than a technological category. The medium, right
now, is a mess. But the art form is in a state of rude, contentious
health. Looking back on my favorites released in the United States since
January, I’m struck by how many bristle with an argumentative energy
that seems to match the times, even if a lot of the filmmakers cast
their glances back toward earlier modern moments.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” and Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” unfold in
a restless present tense, but so does Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women,”
even though it takes place more than 100 years ago. “The Irishman” and
“Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” feel like elegies to an older
cinematic ethic, while “Atlantics” and “The Edge of Democracy” press
into an uncertain future, the terms of which are prophesied by the blood
and rhetoric of Mike Leigh’s mighty “Peterloo.” The top two entries on
my list do all of that and more, digging so deep into the particular
lives of their characters — a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Macedonian beekeeper and a film student in London — that they
seem to transcend time altogether.

There’s more. There’s always more\! As long as we trust our eyes and
know where to look.

## 1\. [‘Honeyland’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/movies/honeyland-review.html) (Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov)

Conceived as a government-sponsored informational video, this
documentary is nothing less than a found epic, a real-life environmental
allegory and, not least, a stinging comedy about the age-old problem of
inconsiderate neighbors.

## 2\. [‘The Souvenir’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/movies/the-souvenir-review.html) (Joanna Hogg)

Honor Swinton Byrne plays a diffident version of the director’s younger
self in an elusive autobiographical film that also functions as a kind
of superhero origin story.

## 3\. [‘Parasite’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/parasite-review.html) ([Bong Joon Ho](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/bong-joon-ho-parasite.html))

I can’t think of a film that made me sadder about the state of the world
and more jubilant about the state of movies.

## 4\. [‘The Irishman’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/the-irishman-review.html) (Martin Scorsese)

What is cinema? If you have three and a half hours to spare — and you do

The joys and miseries of a creative family in 21st-century New York and
Los Angeles.

## 6\. [‘Little Women’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/movies/little-women-review.html) (Greta Gerwig)

The joys and miseries of a creative family in 19th-century
Massachusetts.

## 7\. [‘Peterloo’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/peterloo-review.html) (Mike Leigh)

British politics in 1819, full of passion and pageantry, bad faith and
factionalism. It feels like a very short march from then to now.

## 8\. [‘The Edge of Democracy’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/movies/edge-of-democracy-review.html) (Petra Costa)

This harrowing documentary, a thoughtful inside look at the events
leading up to the election of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s populist
president, is the scariest movie of the year.

## 9\. [‘Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/movies/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review.html) (Quentin Tarantino)

Another answer to the “what is cinema?” question, with special attention
to Brad Pitt’s jawline and Margot Robbie’s feet.

## 10\. [‘Atlantics’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/atlantics-review.html) (Mati Diop)

See No. 3. A startlingly original debut feature about the specters that
haunt Dakar, and everywhere else.

## Cinema in the Age of Conglomerates

Seen any good or great movies lately? If you are a film critic making a
Top 10 list of the year’s best, your annual agony is never that there
are not enough choices — just the opposite. About 800 new movies will
have opened in New York by the end of the year, which is 11 percent
fewer than were released [a couple of years
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/movies/flooding-theaters-isnt-good-for-filmmakers-or-filmgoers.html).
The changes in how movies are now distributed are having a pronounced
impact on theatrical exhibition, which may be a disaster or a welcome
course correction in a glutted market.

The better movies generally open in theaters, just as they have long
done. In the past, a lot of junky titles would have gone straight to
video; these days a lot go straight to streaming, while many others
quickly open and close in theaters before they too flow into streaming
purgatory. Despite this online maw, movies still play in theaters
because, well, people still like the big screen. Some play solely to
qualify for awards or because filmmakers also like the big screen.
Amazon and Netflix open movies in theaters because they see those same
filmmakers and awards as a way to keep, and attract, subscribers.

Cinema has always been a moving target, from the cinematograph era to
the streaming. That’s one reason the debate that raged over [Martin
Scorsese’s comments about Marvel
movies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html)
not being cinema feels like a dead end. He is right that nothing is at
risk in them, or rather very little. Even the best ones are absent real
risk because they are not films in the old-fashioned sense: They are
delivery systems for an integrated array of products and experiences
(other movies, theme parks, toys). Their formula is a feature not a bug.
The appeal of the familiar is one way powerful entertainment companies
turn ardent viewers into brand loyalists, reaching fans with a
cradle-to-grave consumer strategy.

History will remember this period for Disney’s monopolistic muscle; it
will also remember Scorsese’s films. It seems unlikely, though, that
history will remember many of the movies Disney now makes. This probably
matters little to the media giant, which has had a busy, record-breaking
year. In March, it finalized its purchase of 21st Century Fox,
effectively destroying a Hollywood pillar. The origins of Fox can be
traced back to around 1904, when William Fox bought a share of a
Brooklyn nickelodeon. [Disney picked up the empire that rose from that
humble beginning for $71.3
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/media/walt-disney-21st-century-fox-deal.html)
and will absorb it for the express purpose of [leveraging Fox
assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/disney-wouldnt-have-bought-fox-assets-without-streaming-plans-iger-says.html)
to become a global streaming behemoth, just like Netflix.

The [end of
Fox](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/fox-history-moments-disney-merger-1203165929/)
feels like another rattle in the slow death of what many still call the
studio system, which hasn’t resembled the factorylike days of the old
MGM for a long time. You can mourn the end of the studios and revere
their legacy — the art, craft and technique — but there’s no mourning
their racism, sexism, cultivated stupidity and contempt for art. The old
Hollywood studios perfected a way of making films and hired artists and
artisans who succeeded within those confines or transcended them (or
failed or fled). Like the young Scorsese and his friends, the Cahiers du
Cinéma critics who became directors, championed those films. André Bazin
honored “the genius of the system.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I tend to think that Hollywood reached its zenith before 1960. Many of
the greatest American films made in the decades since were produced in
spite of terrible studio ideas, more by accident than design, or were
made in the independent realm (at [times with European or Asian
money](https://filmmakermagazine.com/107829-end-of-the-road-jim-jarmusch-on-his-johnny-depp-starring-western-death-trip-dead-man/))
or while the studios were having a fling with adventure. One such moment
was in the 1970s; another occurred recently when Miramax shook up the
indie world and the studios noticed. Their interest was fleeting but
it’s worth recalling that Disney released Wes Anderson’s “Rushmore,”
Paramount backed Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood” and Warner
Bros. put out Richard Linklater’s “Before Sunset.”

It is also worth remembering that both Spike Lee and Kathryn Bigelow,
two of the filmmakers Scorsese holds up as exemplars of cinema, have
nurtured careers beyond Hollywood and sometimes despite it. After Lee
made his breakout film, “She’s Gotta Have It,” he worked with the major
studios but he also battled them to protect his vision and integrity.
Bigelow has never directed movies that were financed by a major studio,
though some have released her features. Scorsese’s recent movies have
been made, as he recently pointed out, without studio help. “In the last
10 years,” [he
said](https://deadline.com/2019/10/martin-scorsese-netflix-irishman-women-characters-marvel-movies-theme-park-rome-festival-1202765130/),
“my films have been independently financed under difficult
circumstances.”

That is a sobering description of American mainstream movies in the age
of global media conglomerates. Yet, as our yearly lists of favorites
attest, great work always happens.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## 1\. ‘[Pain and Glory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/movies/pain-and-glory-review.html)’ (Pedro Almodóvar)

In this wistful, deeply felt masterwork, a filmmaker faces his own
mortality, awakens desire and transforms ragged life into art.

## 2\. ‘[The Irishman](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/the-irishman-review.html)’ (Martin Scorsese)

One of the finest movies of Scorsese’s career, this haunting epic about
a murderer for the mob is about tribal loyalty, male violence and a grim
vision of homegrown fascism.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## 3\. ‘[Parasite](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/parasite-review.html)’ (Bong Joon Ho)

A perfectly directed movie from one of the greatest filmmakers working
today. If you want to know what cinema is, watch this — well, just watch
everything on this list.

## 4\. ‘[Little Women](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/movies/little-women-review.html)’ (Greta Gerwig)

At once faithful and blissfully liberated, this beautiful interpretation
of Louisa May Alcott’s novel is the story of a woman finding her voice,
directed by one who already has.

## 5\. ‘[Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/movies/dicaprio-pitt.html?module=inline)’ (Quentin Tarantino)

Tarantino’s nostalgic panegyric to Los Angeles, the internal combustion
engine and old-school masculine cool is a dream of a movie. I could
spend hours watching Margot Robbie’s character watch herself in a film
and Brad Pitt’s cruise the magically smog-free city in a buttery yellow
1966 Cadillac.

## 6\. ‘[Synonyms](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/movies/synonyms-review.html)’ (Nadav Lapid)

In this corrosive, funny and sometimes shocking existential cry, a young
ex-soldier flees Israel and tries to shed his country and his identity
by turning himself into a Frenchman.

## 7\. ‘[Transit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/transit-review.html)’ (Christian Petzold)

A brilliant allegory that imagines a world in the grip of fascism and
that — as throngs of desperate people seek asylum — becomes a
frightening, all-too-real vision of our own world.

## 8\. ‘[American Factory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/movies/american-factory-review.html)’ (Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar)

This powerful documentary tracks what happens when a Chinese company
takes over a shuttered Ohio General Motors factory. Everyone loses but

## 9\. ‘[One Child Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/one-child-nation-review.html)’ (Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang)

Both site specific yet transcending borders, this devastating
documentary is a damning look at how China’s propaganda controls both
minds and bodies.

## 10\. ‘[The Last Black Man in San Francisco](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/movies/the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-review.html)’ (Joe Talbot)

A heartfelt, often supremely lovely movie about loss, memory, race and
place that Talbot created with his longtime friend, Jimmie Fails, who
also stars.
