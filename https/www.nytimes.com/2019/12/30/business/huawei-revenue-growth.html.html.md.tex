\section{Huawei Posts Solid Growth but Warns of Difficulties
Ahead}\label{huawei-posts-solid-growth-but-warns-of-difficulties-ahead}}

In a year-end note, a deputy chairman said the Chinese tech giant's
confrontation with the United States would hurt its prospects for 2020.

HONG KONG --- For Huawei, it has been a year of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/huawei-lawsuit-us-government.html}{lawsuits},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/technology/huawei-ban-president-trump.html}{blacklists},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/world/europe/huawei-EU-5G-Europe.html}{diplomatic
fights},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/europe/poland-china-huawei-spy.html}{spying
accusations} and, most recently,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/huawei-china-backlash.html}{viral
anger} from the Chinese internet.

Through it all, the company posted solid growth, its deputy chairman
Eric Xu said on Tuesday. In a year-end note, Mr. Xu said the company's
sales in 2019 increased an estimated 18 percent from a year earlier to
\$121.8 billion, just below the company's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/technology/huawei-trump.html}{initial
target for revenue}.

The results hinted at a slowdown in the final quarter of the year, and
Mr. Xu's note was rich in metaphors describing the difficult days ahead.
Alternately likening the company to plums bitten by winter's frost, a
bamboo stalk battered by wind and an embattled aircraft, the executive
said that in 2020, the company would not grow as rapidly as it did in
the first half of 2019.

``It's going to be a difficult year for us,'' wrote Mr. Xu, adding that
``the external environment is becoming more complicated than ever, and
downward pressure on the global economy has intensified.''

Huawei is the world's leading maker of equipment that powers cellphone
networks and a champion of Beijing's ambitions to build new,
cutting-edge technology companies. Officials in the United States have
long been worried that China's government could use Huawei's products to
gather intelligence, an accusation the company has repeatedly denied.

Huawei's year went from bad to worse when the United States added the
company to an export blacklist in May. The move effectively restricted
its ability to purchase American products crucial to its smartphones and
telecom gear, weighing on revenue growth.

The blocks, though, have proven somewhat porous. The Trump
administration has permitted sales to Huawei that are used to maintain
existing mobile networks. Some of its American suppliers determined
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html}{they
could lawfully} continue selling nonsensitive products to the company.
In October, the Trump administration said it
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/us/politics/trump-huawei-trade.html}{would
issue export licenses} to certain United States companies selling to
Huawei, further easing pressures on its supply chain.

Even so, Mr. Xu indicated that the confrontation with the United States
would continue to dampen growth and said he expected Huawei to remain on
the blacklist in 2020.

``Difficulty is the prelude to greater success, and adversity the
whetstone of an iron-willed team. The U.S. government's campaign against
Huawei is strategic and long-term,'' he wrote.

Huawei, he said, will ``need to go all out'' to develop software and
services that work with its smartphones. Analysts have worried about
whether the company's smartphones would remain competitive since it was
blocked from working with Google. Huawei had to release its latest
flagship smartphone, the Mate 30 series, without regular access to
Google's apps.

Mr. Xu said the company shipped a total of 240 million smartphones in
2019, an increase of almost 17 percent over the 206 million units it
sold in 2018.

The company's shares
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/technology/who-owns-huawei.html}{are
not publicly traded} and it has no obligation to announce its results.
In a nod to transparency, Huawei has long announced financials, and this
year it began reporting unaudited results quarterly. The numbers for
2019 are not audited, and the company will likely provide further
details for its performance in the first months of 2020.

With Huawei's business under pressure, Mr. Xu also warned of tough times
for employees, even as he thanked them. Huawei unexpectedly became the
center of online anger in China this month after an employee said
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/huawei-china-backlash.html}{he
had been jailed} for 251 days after demanding severance pay from the
company. The experience struck a chord for many Chinese
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/technology/china-996-jack-ma.html}{white-collar
tech employees}, who are now facing sagging returns for long hours at
the office.

Despite the renewed focus on Huawei's famous
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/huawei-workers-iran-sanctions.html}{hard-charging
corporate spirit}, Mr. Xu did not mince his metaphors in describing the
company's outlook on its employees.

``Managers at all levels need to put company interests above personal
gain and go where they are needed most, including hardship regions,'' he
wrote, calling those willing to put up with such difficulties ``tree
growers.''

He said the company would remove managers who were performing in the
bottom 10 percent as part of a plan to better prune talent.

``We will remove mediocre managers more quickly --- people who have lost
their enterprising spirit, who have built their position on personal
connections or empty and unactionable reporting, and those who
prioritize short-term gains and pass problems on to their successors,''
he wrote, calling such people ``the pit-diggers among us.''
