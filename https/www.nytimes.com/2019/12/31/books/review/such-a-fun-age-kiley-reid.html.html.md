**SUCH A FUN AGE**  
By Kiley Reid

It’s 2015 and, in a gentrified variation on “driving while black,”
20-something Emira is accosted in the freezer aisle of an upscale
Philadelphia supermarket by a security guard accusing her of kidnapping
her white charge. In a midnight crisis, the Chamberlain household has
called Emira in from her night off to watch their toddler, Briar. But
the real crisis unfolds at the store. “With all due respect,” the guard
says to an indignant Emira, “you don’t look like you’ve been babysitting
tonight.” Somehow this initial confrontation, filmed by a fellow shopper
and defused only by the arrival of Briar’s dad, isn’t even the worst
offense committed in Kiley Reid’s provocative but soapy debut novel,
“Such a Fun Age.” It’s merely a preamble for the main narrative about
how two white people end up using their proximity to Emira, a young
black woman, as a signifier of their progressiveness.

It’s also a setup made for a rom-com: Obviously, Emira ends up dating
Kelley, the handsome white guy who caught the episode on his iPhone.
Less obviously, in one of the many lapses in credibility that beleaguer
Reid’s plot, it turns out that Kelley has an unresolved history with
Briar’s mom, Alix, a high-profile social media entrepreneur and active
Hillary supporter. Back in high school, he dumped her, she never forgave
him, and the memory of what happened (a lame saga of virginity lost, a
house party ruined) convinces each one of the other’s exploitative
attitude toward black
people.

Emira doesn’t discover this connection until midway through Reid’s novel
— and from there the story, told from the oscillating, third-person
perspectives of mother and sitter, takes shape as an interracial love
triangle whose convoluted dynamic lets some of the steam out of its
worthy message. The older, whiter characters’ liberal anxieties play out
as a tug-of-war for Emira’s affections — or, as Alix calls it, “a losing
game called ‘Which One of Us Is Actually More Racist?’” Alix grew up
garishly rich and now takes pride in things like inviting five whole
black people to her catered Thanksgiving dinner table. She shows less
interest in her daughter than in the “person she paid to love her,”
voyeuristically reading Emira’s texts and attempting to enfold the
younger, prettier, poorer girl — the first in her family to go to
college — in the web of her influence (as flimsy to us as it is to
Emira).

*\[ Read* [*an excerpt from “Such a Fun
Age.”*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/books/review/such-a-fun-age-by-kiley-reid-an-excerpt.html)
*\]*

Kelley’s affection for Emira appears more genuine, but his wokeness has
a whiff of performance. “Like … I get it,” Emira says to him, “you have
a weirdly large amount of black friends, you saw Kendrick Lamar in
concert and now you have a black girlfriend … great.” He tries to get
Emira to post the supermarket video and to quit working for Alix, who he
thinks is trying to use Emira’s blackness for personal gain. But isn’t
he, too, in a way? In one of the most powerful lines in the book, Emira
articulates to Kelley what a woman of color needs from her white
partner: “Lemme try to say this. You get real fired up when we talk
about that night at Market Depot. But I don’t need you to be mad that it
happened. I need you to be mad that it just like … happens.”

Reid writes scenes and dialogue with a contemporary lilt that feels
deliberately styled for a screen adaptation, inflected throughout with
cringe-inducing “holup holup”s and “ohmygod”s, heavy-handed attempts to
mimic millennial parlance. Over all, the characters’ melodrama is
unwarranted; the final climactic event that Alix thinks “felt like the
plot twist of a horror movie” is actually quite predictable. But the
simple prose and story line belie a more nuanced moral hierarchy: Emira
is clearly the victim of racially motivated manipulation, but the two
white people who profess to care for her shift uncomfortably between the
poles of villain and hero. Both boss and boyfriend engage in distinct
brands of white posturing, defining themselves in part by their
relationships to this young woman — an adoring, vocationally lost black
woman who must decide whether the benefits of those relationships are
outweighed by the cost to her sense of self. Out of Reid’s often cloying
vernacular, then, emerge some surprisingly resonant insights into the
casual racism in everyday life, especially in the America of the liberal
elite.
