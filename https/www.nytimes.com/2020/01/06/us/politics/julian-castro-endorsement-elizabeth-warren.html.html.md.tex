\section{Julián Castro Endorses Elizabeth Warren for
President}\label{juliuxe1n-castro-endorses-elizabeth-warren-for-president}}

The move came soon after Mr. Castro ended his own bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination, and gives a lift to Ms. Warren's campaign as it
tries to reignite excitement.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/us/politics/julian-castro-dropping-out.html}{Julián
Castro}, the former housing secretary whose progressive presidential
candidacy did not make significant inroads with Democratic voters but
earned plaudits from the party's left wing, has endorsed Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-campaign.html}{Elizabeth
Warren} of Massachusetts, offering a possible lift for her candidacy
less than one month before the Iowa caucuses.

Mr. Castro announced his endorsement on Monday morning, just days after
he ended his own bid for the White House. In a statement, Mr. Castro
cast Ms. Warren as the logical extension of his campaign's
social-justice-driven message, which seeks to correct inequities through
targeted policy proposals. He will campaign with Ms. Warren this week,
joining her Tuesday night at a rally at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn.

\begin{quote}
Today I'm proud to endorse
\href{https://twitter.com/ewarren?ref_src=twsrc\%5Etfw}{@ewarren} for
president.

Elizabeth and I share a vision of America where everyone counts. An
America where people⁠---not the wealthy or well-connected⁠---are put
first. I'm proud to join her in the fight for big, structural change.

\end{quote}

``There's one candidate I see who is unafraid to fight like hell to make
sure that America's promise will be there for everyone,'' Mr. Castro
said in a video announcement released on Twitter. Ms. Warren, he said,
``will make sure that no matter where you live in America --- or where
your family came from in the world, you have a path to opportunity,
too.''

The endorsement is not a shock to close observers of the Democratic
primary race --- Mr. Castro and Ms. Warren made no secret of their
shared affection for each other --- but it formalizes a partnership that
could help Ms. Warren reignite excitement at a critical moment.

Ms. Warren has fallen from her polling peak
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/politics/democratic-race-2020.html}{in
early October}, when she was hailed as the race's ascendant front-runner
and the standard-bearer for the party's progressive wing. National polls
now show Ms. Warren firmly in third, behind former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been aided
by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020.html}{grass-roots
progressive groups} and by some
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-queensbridge-park.html}{high-profile
endorsements of his own}, including from popular House members like
Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of
Minnesota.

It is unclear whether Mr. Castro's name carries similar political
weight. His presidential candidacy struggled to break through in a
significant way, but he led the field on a number of progressive issues,
including reparations, border decriminalization and housing inequality.
He impressed liberal activist groups like the Working Families Party and
the Center for Popular Democracy, even though they
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/us/politics/working-families-party-elizabeth-warren.html}{formally
backed Ms. Warren} and Mr. Sanders.

Ms. Warren thanked Mr. Castro for his support on Monday, calling him ``a
powerful voice for bold, progressive change.''

During the waning months of his campaign, Mr. Castro was a vocal critic
of the primary calendar, pointing to how voters in Iowa and New
Hampshire, who hold their nominating contests first, are overwhelmingly
white. Ms. Warren has, at times, sidestepped that issue, saying once in
South Carolina that she was just ``a player in the game on this one.''
