\textbf{Name:} Chance Perdomo

\textbf{Age:} 23

\textbf{Hometown:} Born in Los Angeles and raised in Southampton,
England.

\textbf{Now lives:} When he is not shooting (he is currently filming in
Vancouver, British Columbia), he lives with his family in a ``small and
quaint'' home in Southampton.

\textbf{Claim to fame:} Mr. Perdomo is an actor who describes himself as
``a black child raised by a Latino mother in a white society with two
nationalities.'' In Britain, he is best known for starring in
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIeVilRBAUw}{Killed by My
Debt},'' a TV film based on the true story of a young courier who killed
himself when two traffic tickets grew into a soul-crushing debt.

In the United States, he is known for playing a pansexual warlock on
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/arts/television/the-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-review-netflix.html}{Chilling
Adventures of Sabrina},'' a Gen Z spin on the Sabrina the Teenage Witch
universe.

\textbf{Big break:} After graduating from
\href{https://www.psc.ac.uk}{Peter Symonds College} in Winchester, where
one of his majors was theater, he landed a small part on an episode of
``Hetty Feather,'' a \href{https://www.byutv.org/hettyfeather}{British
children's drama} set in the Victorian era. It was ``one or two lines,''
Mr. Perdomo said, but it was enough ``to take that leap of faith'' and
pursue acting full time.

\textbf{Latest project:} Last year, he was nominated for a BAFTA award
for his role in ``Killed by My Debt'' (he lost out to Benedict
Cumberbatch). Variety
\href{https://variety.com/2019/film/news/variety-10-brits-to-watch-2020-1203440068/}{recently
named} him one of the ``10 Brits to watch for 2020.''

\textbf{Next thing:} The third season of ``Sabrina'' will be released on
Netflix this month. Beyond the show's spooky cloaks and daggers, he
hopes new episodes will allow viewers to continue probing the sexually
fluid sorcerer he plays onscreen.

``I wasn't too familiar with the intricacies of pansexuality,'' he said.
``It's just one aspect of someone's identity, so I decided to play the
character the exact same way I would any other.''

\textbf{Being flashy:} Mr. Perdomo is a disciple of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/magazine/how-to-walk-on-hand-rails.html}{parkour},
which comes in handy for the occasional back flip on set. ``You're
climbing around urban environments and basically trying to find the most
efficient, almost flashiest way to get from Point A to Point B
irrespective of any obstacles in the way,'' he said. ``I've been higher
than a human being probably should.''
