A fast-moving storm packing a litany of hazards —
[tornadoes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/us/nashville-tornado-live.html),
floods, severe storms and more — raged through the southern United
States on Saturday, leaving at least 10 people dead and a trail of
destruction in its wake.

The deaths included an elderly couple in northwest Louisiana who were
killed when a tornado tossed their trailer home hundreds of feet and
damaged more than 50 homes.

The deadly tornado was just one of a series of dangerous weather events
tangled up in the storm system. Powerful winds pummeled Georgia and
Tennessee, officials issued flood warnings in Mississippi and strong
gusts were predicted in the Midwest. Warnings of hail and snow followed
closely behind, extending from Oklahoma up through Michigan.

“This is one of the stronger systems that we’ve seen in recent years,”
said Kurt Van Speybroeck, an emergency response specialist at the
Southern Region Headquarters of the National Weather Service. On
Saturday afternoon, the strongest part of the storm was moving over
Alabama and Tennessee and headed east toward Georgia at about 40 miles
per hour. It will likely roll over the Carolinas on Sunday and be off
the coast by Sunday afternoon at the latest, Mr. Speybroeck said.

The Louisiana tornado, in Bossier Parish, was strong enough to flatten
entire trailer homes, said Charlie Woodrum, the warning coordination
meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Shreveport, La.
The twister’s winds likely spun at up to 135 miles per hour, he said.

The elderly couple’s home, a double-wide trailer, was found about 200
feet away from its normal location, said Lt. Bill Davis, a spokesman for
the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office. It had likely been picked up by the
tornado and tossed into the couple’s backyard. Three dogs who had lived
with the couple were missing.

“This thing happened at two in the morning,” Lieutenant Davis said. “It
was just bad timing.”

Another tornado near Carrollton, Ala., about 30 miles west of
Tuscaloosa, killed three more people, said Jim Stefkovich, a
meteorologist for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.

Just north of Lubbock, Texas, a police officer and firefighter were
killed by a car that hopped onto a highway median and struck them as
they were assisting with two other cars that had crashed. The third car
also struck a firefighter who remained in critical condition on Saturday
night.

Nearly 500 miles away, in Nacogdoches County, Tex., the storm led to
another person’s death, a local police dispatcher said. According to
local news reports, the 44-year-old man was killed [when a tree fell on
his
home](https://www.ktre.com/2020/01/11/one-dead-nacogdoches-county-after-tree-falls-home/)
early on Saturday. A tree also killed a man in Oil City, La., when it
fell on his house early on Saturday, collapsing the roof, the Caddo
Parish Sheriff’s Office said in a
[statement](https://caddosheriff.org/news.php?c=2319&).

About 280,000 customers were without power across the south as of
Saturday afternoon, according to
[PowerOutage.us](https://poweroutage.us/), a website that tracks power
failures.

A tornado may have also touched down in Mississippi, where several
mobile homes were destroyed, said Thomas Winesett, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service’s office in Jackson, Miss. He cautioned
that Weather Service employees would need to survey the area before
confirming that the damage was from a tornado.

Severe thunderstorms and high winds were rolling through the region,
creating a web of warnings that will continue into Sunday.

“It’s a little bit of everything,” Mr. Winesett said.

Following the storm was a cold front that extended north through several
states, including Missouri, Illinois and Michigan. The National Weather
Service issued warnings about winter storms, ice and flooding for much
of those states.

Chicago O’Hare International Airport

more than 1,050 flights in advance of the winter weather.

High winds were expected in Ohio and along the East Coast. Residents
from Western New York to Cleveland were told to expect gusts up to 60
m.p.h. into early Sunday morning.

Some regions were experiencing unseasonably warm temperatures on
Saturday even as their residents braced for more severe weather.
Phildelphia saw a record daily high of 67 degrees, even as forecasters
there warned of high winds on Sunday. Kansas City saw a sudden plunge
from a record daily high of 66 on Thursday to a low of 14 on Saturday
and about 3 inches of snow.
