After a high-speed chase north of Orlando, Fla., sheriff’s deputies
punctured the tires of a stolen Dodge Magnum and brought it to a stop.
They arrested the driver, but couldn’t determine who he was. The man had
no identification card. He passed out after stuffing something into his
mouth. And his fingerprints, the deputies reported, appeared to have
been [chewed
off](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6581927-Seminolecountycarchase-Redacted.html).

So investigators turned to one of the oldest and largest facial
recognition systems in the country: a statewide program based in
Pinellas County, Fla., that began almost 20 years ago, when law
enforcement agencies were just starting to use the technology. Officers
ran a photo of the man through a huge database, found a likely match and
marked the 2017 case as one of the system’s more than 400 successful
“[outcomes](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6586379-FACESlist-Redacted.html)”
since 2014.

A review of these Florida records — the most comprehensive analysis of a
local law enforcement facial recognition system to date — offers a rare
look at the technology’s potential and its limitations.

Officials in Florida say that they query the system 4,600 times a month.
But the technology is no magic bullet: Only a small percentage of the
queries break open investigations of unknown suspects, the documents
indicate. The tool has been effective with clear images — identifying
recalcitrant detainees, people using fake IDs and photos from anonymous
social media accounts — but when investigators have tried to put a name
to a suspect glimpsed in grainy surveillance footage, it has produced
significantly fewer results.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Florida program also underscores concerns about new technologies’
potential to violate due process. The system operates with little
oversight, and its role in legal cases is not always disclosed to
defendants, records show. Although officials said investigators could
not rely on facial recognition results to make an arrest, documents
suggested that on occasion officers gathered no other evidence.

“It’s really being sold as this tool accurate enough to do all sorts of
crazy stuff,” said Clare Garvie, a senior associate at the Center on
Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. “It’s not there yet.”

Facial recognition has set off controversy in recent years, even as it
has become an everyday tool for unlocking cellphones and tagging photos
on social media. The industry has drawn in new players [like
Amazon](https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-overkill-how-deputies-solved-a-12-shoplifting-case/),
which has [courted police
departments](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/technology/amazon-facial-recognition.html),
and the technology is used by law enforcement in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago and elsewhere, as well as by the F.B.I. and other federal
agencies. Data on such systems is scarce, but [a 2016
study](https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) found that half of American
adults were in a law enforcement facial recognition database.

Police officials [have
argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/opinion/facial-recognition-police-new-york-city.html)
that facial recognition [makes the public
safer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/us/facial-recognition-police.html).
But a few cities, including San Francisco, have [barred law enforcement
from using the
tool](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html),
amid concerns about privacy and false matches. Civil liberties advocates
warn of the pernicious uses of the technology, pointing to
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html),
where the government has deployed it as a [tool for authoritarian
control](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html).

In Florida, facial recognition has long been part of daily policing. The
sheriff’s office in Pinellas County, on the west side of Tampa Bay,
wrangled federal money two decades ago to try the technology and now
serves as the de facto facial recognition service for the state. It
enables access to more than 30 million images, including driver’s
licenses, mug shots and juvenile booking photos.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“People think this is something new,” the county sheriff, Bob Gualtieri,
said of facial recognition. “But what everybody is getting into now, we
did it a long time ago.”

## A Question of Due Process

Only one American court is known to have ruled on the use of facial
recognition by law enforcement, and it gave credence to the idea that a
defendant’s right to the information was limited.

[Willie Allen
Lynch](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/50-crack-sale-florida-lead-facial-recognition-change-article-1.3888958)
was accused in 2015 of selling $50 worth of crack cocaine, after the
Pinellas facial recognition system suggested him as a likely match. Mr.
Lynch, who claimed he had been misidentified, sought the images of the
other possible matches; [a Florida appeals court
ruled](https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/first-district-court-of-appeal/2018/16-3290.html)
against it. He is serving an eight-year prison sentence.

Any technological findings presented as evidence are subject to analysis
through special hearings, but facial recognition results have never been
deemed reliable enough to stand up to such questioning. The results
still can play a significant role in investigations, though, without the
judicial scrutiny applied to more proven forensic technologies.

Laws and courts
[differ](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/1992/254-n-j-super-754-1.html)
by [state](http://fprints.nwlean.net/Brady.pdf) on what investigative
materials must be shared with the defense. This has led some law
enforcement officials to argue that they aren’t required to disclose the
use of facial recognition.

In some of the Florida cases The Times reviewed, the technology was not
mentioned in initial warrants or affidavits. Instead, detectives noted
“[investigative
means](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6586485-Kohlsshoplifting-Redacted.html)”
or an “[attempt to
identify](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591394-PasadenaLiquors-Redacted.html)”
in court documents, while logging the matters as facial recognition wins
in the Pinellas County records. Defense lawyers said in interviews that
the use of facial recognition was sometimes mentioned later in the
discovery process, but not always.

Aimee Wyant, a senior assistant public defender in the judicial circuit
that includes Pinellas County, said defense lawyers should be provided
with all the information turned up in an investigation.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Once the cops find a suspect, they’re like a dog with a bone: That’s
their suspect,” she said. “So we’ve got to figure out where they got
that name to start.”

Law enforcement officials in Florida and elsewhere emphasized that
facial recognition should not be relied on to put anyone in jail. “No
one can be arrested on the basis of the computer match alone,” the New
York police commissioner, James O’Neill, [wrote in a June
op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/opinion/facial-recognition-police-new-york-city.html).

In most of the Florida cases The Times reviewed, investigators
[followed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591395-Armedrobbery-Redacted.html)
[similar](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591396-Shoes-Redacted.html)
guidelines. But in a
[few](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6586485-Kohlsshoplifting-Redacted.html)
[instances](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6587265-Shoesshoplifting-Redacted.html),
court records suggest, facial recognition was the primary basis for an
arrest.

Last April, for example, a Tallahassee police officer investigating the
theft of an $80 cellphone obtained a store surveillance image and
received a likely match from the facial recognition system, according to
the Pinellas list. The investigator then “reviewed the surveillance
video and positively identified” the suspect, [she
wrote](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6586364-Targettheft-Redacted.html)
in a court document.

A police department spokeswoman suggested that this step provided a
check on the facial recognition system. “What we can’t do is just say,
‘Oh, it’s this guy,’ and not even look at it,” she said, adding that
in this instance “it was a very clear photo.” The case is proceeding.

## No More ‘Name Game’

Pinellas County’s Face Analysis Comparison & Examination System, or
FACES, was started with a $3.5 million federal grant arranged in 2000 by
Representative Bill Young, a Florida Republican who led the House
Appropriations Committee.

Earlier tests with law enforcement agencies elsewhere had produced
meager results, including systems in California that had [led to one
arrest in four
years](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/03/technology/those-dimples-may-be-digits.html).<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Still, the potential was tantalizing. Pinellas’s first planned
use for facial recognition was in the local jail’s mug shot system.
After Sept. 11, the program was expanded to include the airport.
Eventually, sheriff’s deputies were able to upload photos taken with
digital cameras while on patrol.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The program received more than $15 million in federal grants until 2014,
when the county took over the annual maintenance costs, now about
$100,000 a year, the sheriff’s office said.

The first arrest attributed to the Florida program came in 2004, after a
woman who was wanted on a probation violation gave deputies a false
name, local [news outlets
reported](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2004-09-15-0409150165-story.html).

The number of arrests ticked up as the system spread across the state
and the pool of images grew to include the driver’s license system. By
2009, the sheriff’s office had credited it with nearly 500 arrests.
[By 2013](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/state-photo-id-databases-become-troves-for-police/2013/06/16/6f014bd4-ced5-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html),
the number was approaching 1,000. Details on only a small number of
cases were disclosed publicly.

The latest list, of more than 400 successes since 2014, which The Times
obtained after a records request, is flawed: Not all successful
identifications are logged, and questionable or negative results are not
recorded. Still, together with related court documents — records were
readily available for about half the cases — the list offers insights
into which crimes facial recognition is best suited to help solve:
shoplifting, [check
forgery](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591405-Forgery-Redacted.html),
ID fraud.

In case after case on the list, officers were seeking [ID
checks](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591397-Falsename-Redacted.html).
“We call it the name game,” Sheriff Gualtieri said. “We stop somebody on
the street, and they say, ‘My name is John Doe and I don’t have any
identification.’”

In about three dozen court cases, facial recognition was crucial despite
being used with poorer-quality images. Nearly 20 of these involved minor
theft; **** others were more significant**.**

Instances of violent crime in which the system was helpful — such as the
F.B.I.’s tracking [a
fugitive](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/06/16/after-years-run-dorchester-man-arrested/Gpv7i9fJEP9pMNn00sQn4I/story.html)
accused of child rape — typically involved not surveillance images but
people with fake IDs or aliases.

In nearly 20 of the instances on the Pinellas list, investigators were
trying to identify people who could not identify themselves, including
Alzheimer’s patients and murder victims. The sheriff’s office said the
technology was also sometimes used to help identify witnesses.

The most cutting-edge applications of facial recognition in the area —
at the airport, for instance — never showed significant results and were
scrapped.

“For me it was a bridge too far and too Big Brother-ish,” Sheriff
Gualtieri said.

## Garbage in, Garbage Out

“It comes down to image quality,” said Jake Ruberto, a technical support
specialist in the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office who helps run the
facial recognition program. “If you put garbage into the system, you’re
going to get garbage back.”

The software for FACES is developed by Idemia, a France-based company
whose prototype algorithms did well in several [recent
tests](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/09/11/nistir_8271_20190911.pdf)
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the systems used by law enforcement agencies don’t always have the
latest algorithms; Pinellas’s, for example, was last overhauled in 2014,
although the county has been evaluating other, more recent, products.
Idemia declined to comment on it.

The gains in quality of the best facial recognition technology in recent
years have been astounding. In government tests, facial recognition
algorithms compared photos with a database of 1.6 million mug shots. In
2010, the error rate was just under 8 percent in ideal conditions — good
lighting and high-resolution, front-facing photos. In 2018, it was 0.3
percent. But in surveillance situations, law enforcement hasn’t been
able to count on that level of reliability.

Perhaps the biggest controversy in facial recognition has been its
uneven performance with people of different races. The findings of
[government
tests](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf)
released in December show that the type of facial recognition used in
police investigations tends to produce more false positive results when
evaluating images of black women. Law enforcement officials in Florida
said the technology’s performance was not a sign that it somehow
harbored racial prejudice.

Officials in Pinellas and elsewhere also stressed the role of human
review. But [tests using passport
images](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139827)
have shown that human reviewers also have trouble identifying the
correct person on a list of similar-looking facial recognition results.
In those experiments, passport-system employees chose wrong about half
the time.

Poorer-quality images are known to contribute to mismatches, and dim
lighting, faces turned at an angle, or minimal disguises such as
baseball caps or sunglasses can hamper accuracy.

In China, law enforcement tries to get around this problem by installing
intrusive high-definition cameras with bright lights at face level, and
by tying facial recognition systems to other technology that scans
cellphones in an area. If a face and a phone are detected in the same
place, the system becomes more confident in a match, a Times
[investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html)
found.

In countries with stronger civil liberties laws, the shortcomings of
facial recognition have proved problematic, particularly for systems
intended to [spot criminals in a
crowd](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2019/07/18/orlando-cancels-amazon-rekognition-capping-15-months-of-glitches-and-controversy).<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>[A study of one such
program](https://48ba3m4eh2bf2sksp43rq8kk-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/London-Met-Police-Trial-of-Facial-Recognition-Tech-Report.pdf)
in London, which has an extensive network of CCTV cameras, found that of
the 42 matches the tool suggested during tests, only eight were
verifiably correct.

Current and former Pinellas County officials said they weren’t
surprised. “If you’re going to get into bank robberies and convenience
store robberies, no — no, it doesn’t work that well,” said Jim Main, who
handled technical aspects of the facial recognition program for the
sheriff’s office until he retired in 2014. “You can’t ask, like: ‘Please
stop for a second. Let me get your photo.’”
