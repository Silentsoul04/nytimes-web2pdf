WUHAN, China — The mysterious coronavirus that has killed at least four
people and sickened more than 200 in China is capable of spreading from
person to person, a prominent Chinese scientist said on Monday, adding
to fears of a broader epidemic.

The disclosure increased pressure on the Chinese government to contain a
growing public health crisis, just as China enters its [busiest travel
season of the
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html).
On Tuesday, the authorities confirmed a [fourth
death](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020012109083) from
the illness in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The authorities had previously said [the deadly
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/what-is-coronavirus.html)
seemed capable of spreading only from animals to humans in most cases,
tracing the outbreak to a market in Wuhan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in recent days at least two people have become infected with the
pneumonialike virus even though they live hundreds of miles from Wuhan,
experts said on Monday, suggesting that the illness[is spreading from
person to
person](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html).

“Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission
phenomenon,” Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who is leading a
government-appointed expert panel on the outbreak, said in an interview
on state-run television on Monday.

The World Health Organization announced Monday that it was convening an
emergency meeting on Wednesday “to ascertain whether the outbreak
constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what
recommendations should be made to manage it.”

Millions of Chinese are traveling this week for the Lunar New Year
holiday, adding to fears that the virus could spread swiftly and on a
broader scale. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would now
depend on how many people, on average, a person with virus could infect.

“There are now sufficient cases that it’s not going to die out by
chance,” said Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College
London who has studied the new virus. “The real question now is, how
efficiently can this virus spread from person to person?”

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said on Monday that the outbreak “must be

contain it, according to the state broadcaster

Also on Monday, the authorities reported that new cases had been
detected for the first time in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern
province of Guangdong, all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Cases have also
been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. In many of these
cases, people infected with the virus had traveled to Wuhan.

Here is what we know about the virus, where it has been found, how it is
spreading and what precautions are being taken:

## The virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.

The government of Wuhan [first confirmed on
Dec. 31](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html)
that hospitals in the city were treating dozens of patients for
pneumonia with an unknown cause.

Many of the cases were connected to the Huanan Seafood Market, which
also sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. Considered a likely
source of the virus, the market was closed and disinfected.

The health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that the illness had also
appeared in people who had not been exposed to the market, raising the
possibility that the virus could be present elsewhere in the city.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Local officials have pledged to handle the outbreak with transparency.
But the memory of how China initially covered up the extent of [a deadly
SARS
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html)
that infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003 has not completely
faded. Although flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying
to be more transparent now, many in China remain skeptical.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the weekend, the number of reported cases [more than tripled to
about 200](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-coronavirus.html),
mostly in Wuhan. One more person in the city died, bringing the total
death toll to three, while nine others remained critically ill, the
city’s health commission said. Twenty-five people have recovered.

The authorities have started detecting the country’s first cases outside
of Wuhan. Five new cases were reported in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong
Province, and two in Shanghai. The total number of cases climbed to at
least 219.

The World Health Organization said the spike in reported cases was the
result of [increased searching and
testing](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1219026530636091392) for
respiratory illnesses.

## The virus now appears to spread between humans.

Researchers in China [identified the mysterious pneumonialike
illness](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html)
in early January as a new coronavirus.

Experts initially said that it did not appear to be readily spread by
humans, but on Monday Dr. Zhong, the scientist appointed by the
government to study the outbreak, said that in Guangdong, two
individuals appeared to have been infected by relatives who had traveled
to Wuhan.

Dr. Zhong said the virus could be present in particles of saliva. In one
case, he said, a patient appears to have infected 14 medical workers.

Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their
membranes, like the sun’s corona. Such viruses cause several illnesses
of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe
diseases like SARS. Dr. Zhong was China’s [leading SARS
expert](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/health/after-its-epidemic-arrival-sars-vanishes.html)
during that outbreak.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According [to the World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus), common
signs of infection include fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties
like shortness of breath. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney
failure and even death.

## Cases have been reported outside China.

The [authorities in Thailand detected the new
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-china.html)
last week in two Chinese women who had flown from Wuhan to Bangkok on
separate trips. The government said the women, aged 74 and 61, were in
good
condition.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In Japan, a Chinese man who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 was also
confirmed to have the disease. He was discharged after five days in a
hospital.

South Korea confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on Monday in a
35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived on Sunday at Incheon
International Airport, which serves Seoul.

The woman was found with a fever, muscle pain and other symptoms while
going through customs and was immediately quarantined for tests, said
Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

The woman was traveling with five other people intending to spend the
Lunar New Year holidays in South Korea and Japan, Ms. Jung said. South
Korean officials were running tests on anyone believed to have come in
contact with the woman in the plane, she said.

## Officials have implemented precautionary measures.

In Hong Kong, the government [initiated a disease response
plan](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202001/04/P2020010400179.htm)
after the first cases were reported in Wuhan. [Dozens of people were
hospitalized](https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf)
after returning to Hong Kong from mainland China, but none were found to
have been infected with the new virus.

Five people who traveled from Wuhan to Zhejiang, a coastal Chinese
province south of Shanghai, are being treated for fever but have not
been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, the health authorities there
said.

State media also reported six suspected cases on Monday, including two
in Sichuan Province, one in Shanghai, one in Yunnan Province, one in
Shandong Province and one in the region of Guangxi.

In the southern city of Shenzhen, the authorities have started imposing
temperature screening procedures at the airport and at train and bus
stations. The city said it would also crack down on the illegal trading
of wild animals.

## Animals appear to be the most likely source.

The W.H.O. says animals appear to be the most likely primary source of
the outbreak, though it is still not known which animals are
responsible.

Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, like SARS, were believed to have
emerged from markets where people and live animals were in regular
contact.

To prevent the spread of respiratory infections, the W.H.O. recommends
that people wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses
when coughing and sneezing, and avoid direct contact with farm or wild
animals.

The health authorities in Hong Kong [have also advised
residents](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html) traveling
outside the city not to touch live animals, not to eat wild animals, and
to avoid markets selling fresh meat and live poultry.
