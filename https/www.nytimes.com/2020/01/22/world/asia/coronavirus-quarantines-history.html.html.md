In closing off Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, China
deployed on Thursday morning a centuries-old public health tactic to
prevent the spread of infectious disease — this time, a mysterious
respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus.

Experts said the stunning scale of the shutdown, [isolating a major
urban transit hub larger than New York
City](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html),
was without precedent.

“It’s an unbelievable undertaking,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor
of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, adding that he
had never heard of so many people being cordoned off as a
disease-prevention measure.

Still, “people are going to get out,” he said. “It’s going to be leaky.”

By Thursday evening, China said it planned to extend the shutdown even
further. Officials said they would impose travel restrictions on at
least four other nearby cities — Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang —
affecting millions more residents.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By limiting the movements of millions of people in an attempt to protect
public health, China is engaging in a balancing act with a long and
complicated history fraught with social, political and ethical concerns.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and
Policy at Arizona State University, said the shutdown would almost
certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently
unconstitutional in the United
States.

“It could very easily backfire,” he said, adding that the restrictions
could prevent healthy people from fleeing the city, perhaps exposing
them to greater risk of infection. “In general, this is risky business.”

## China’s expanding measures

To combat the spread of the virus, which first appeared at the end of
December and has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 600,
the Chinese government said it would [cancel planes and trains leaving
Wuhan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html)
beginning Thursday, and suspend buses, subways and ferries within it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan,
residents would not be allowed to leave the city without special
permission, according to a government statement. In Ezhou, which has
about one million residents, all rail stations were to be closed.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease
dates at least to the 14th century, when ships arriving in Venice during
the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days.
The isolation period gave rise to the term quarantine, from the Italian
quaranta giorni, meaning 40 days, according to the [Centers for Disease
Control and
Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/historyquarantine.html).

Professor Hodge said quarantines could be effective if they selectively
isolate only those who have been infected or are suspected of infection.
The response in Wuhan, with the establishment of a “[cordon
sanitaire](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/science/using-a-tactic-unseen-in-a-century-countries-cordon-off-ebola-racked-areas.html)”-type
boundary, goes much further than that.

“Quarantine would be saying ‘You can’t leave your own home, can’t go to
school, work or church,’” he said. But the Chinese authorities “have
drawn a line around this city and said, ‘No one in and no one out.’ That
type of thing is obviously an excessive response.”

## History and ‘the darker side of quarantine’

In recent years, governments have imposed other large-scale measures to
prevent the spread of infectious
diseases.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Sierra Leone, a country of about seven million people, said [“everybody”
was expected to stay
indoors](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/world/africa/sierra-leone-to-impose-widespread-ebola-quarantine.html)
for three days in September 2014, as 7,000 teams of health and community
workers went door to door to find hidden Ebola patients.

Earlier that year, Liberian officials placed West Point, a sprawling
slum in Monrovia where 60,000 to 120,000 people were crammed into
shacks, [under an Ebola
quarantine](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html).
The order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to
spread the disease, experts said, forcing people to crowd together for
basic humanitarian aid.

During the SARS outbreak of 2003, Canadian health officials asked anyone
in Ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to
[stay home for a few
days](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/world/fearing-sars-ontario-urges-wider-quarantines.html)
out of fear that the disease might spread during the Easter holiday
weekend.

In Beijing, at least 4,000 residents who had been exposed to the virus
were [kept in
isolation](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/international/asia/4000-quarantined-in-beijing-as-suspected-sars-cases-climb.html),
and 300 college students who had had contact with infected people were
sequestered in a military camp for two weeks.

Historians have noted that quarantines have often targeted marginalized
populations.

During the plague epidemic of the 14th century, European city-states
posted armed guards on roads and access points to keep out merchants,
people with leprosy and minority groups such as Jews, according to
Eugenia Tognotti, a researcher in Italy who has [written on the history
of
quarantine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559034/pdf/12-0312.pdf).

And during a wave of cholera outbreaks in Europe in the 1830s, Naples
restricted the movement of prostitutes and beggars, who were thought to
be carriers of the contagion, she wrote.

Russian Jews brought typhus fever into the Lower East Side of Manhattan
in 1892, Dr. Markel said. It was not only infected people who were
rounded up and quarantined on an island off the Bronx, however, but also
their neighbors and others whom they had simply greeted on the street.

“That’s the darker side of quarantine — its misuse as a social tool
rather than its scientific use as a medical tool,” Dr. Markel said.

Mihir Zaveri contributed reporting.
