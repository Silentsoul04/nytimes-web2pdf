\textbf{Name:} Evan Mock

\textbf{Age:} 22

\textbf{Hometown:} Haleiwa, on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii.

\textbf{Now Lives:} In Oahu with his family and in New York City, in a
two-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side that he shares with a
friend.

\textbf{Claim to Fame:} First known as a surfer and skater with a
daredevil streak, Mr. Mock became a catwalk regular last year when he
modeled in shows for Louis Vuitton and Alyx. He has since graduated to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/vidcon-social-media-influencers.html}{influencer}
status, as evidenced by his sizable
\href{https://www.instagram.com/evanmock}{Instagram} following and paid
invitations to attend buzzy happenings. **** This season he was front
row at Prada, Off-White, Dior, Loewe and Lanvin, and attended parties
for a new Ugg shoe and GQ magazine. ``I never in my life had the
opportunity to go to events and get paid for it,'' Mr. Mock said. ``How
ridiculous is that? It's such a funny thing, like, you want me there
that bad?''

\textbf{Big Break:} About a year ago, Mr. Mock went skating in Oahu with
the artist Tom Sachs, whom he met through mutual surfing friends. Mr.
Sachs took a shine to Mr. Mock's new neon-pink buzz cut and asked if he
could shoot a quick video for his friend Frank, who had a similar
hairstyle. Turns out, he was referring to Frank Ocean. The next morning,
Mr. Ocean \href{https://www.instagram.com/p/BsNW-ZSFrbK/}{posted the
video on his Instagram} with a ðŸ‘‹ emoji followed by ``@evanmock.'' The
video has been viewed more than 2.3 million times, and Mr. Mock's social
media following took off.

\textbf{Latest Project:} Mr. Mock's nascent modeling career may pay the
bills (he recently appeared in ad campaigns for Aldo and
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/BzeRAzPD8bD/}{Paco Rabanne}
fragrances), but he's not limiting himself to being just another pretty
face. Last year, he started a direct-to-consumer streetwear label called
\href{https://sorryinadvance.co/}{Sorry in Advance}. And he was hired by
Saint Laurent to cast, photograph and direct an advertisement for the
\href{https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/saint-laurent-venice-sneaker-lookbook-uk}{brand's
skate-inspired Venice sneaker}.

\textbf{Next Thing:} He is collaborating with
\href{https://thehouseofdrew.com/}{Drew House}, Justin Bieber's
smiley-face streetwear line, on a collection timed for Coachella. He is
also looking to organize his photography into a book. ``I just want to
put something out there, for people to see, because there's so much
that's been going on in my life,'' Mr. Mock said. ``Like a photo
journal.''

\textbf{Clothes Horse:} Mr. Mock has an eye for fashion, long before he
became a model. ``I used to think skinny jeans were sick, so I was
buying women's jeans from Ross because I couldn't find any men's jeans
that were tight enough,'' he said. ``Now I like them baggy.'' He's also
fine with going shirtless. ``In my most natural form, I'd be wearing,
like, board shorts, house slippers and no shirt, walking around at the
supermarket.''
