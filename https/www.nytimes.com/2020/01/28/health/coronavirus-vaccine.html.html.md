# Researchers Are Racing to Make a Coronavirus Vaccine. Will It Help?

In the early days of January, as cases of a strange, pneumonia-like
illness were reported in China, researchers at the National Institutes
of Health in Maryland readied themselves to hunt for a
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html)
to prevent the new disease.

</div>

</div>

<div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They had clues that a
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html),
similar to ones that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 and MERS in 2012,
was the culprit. Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine
Research Center at the N.I.H, urged government scientists in China to
share the genetic makeup of the virus so his team could begin its race
to develop a vaccine.

On Friday, Jan. 10, the Chinese scientists posted the information on [a
public database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947). The
next morning, Dr. Graham’s team was in the lab. And within hours, they
had pinpointed the letters of the genetic code that could be used to
make a vaccine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists in Australia and at least three companies — Johnson &
Johnson, [Moderna
Therapeutics](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html)
and Inovio Pharmaceuticals — are also working on vaccine candidates to
stop the spread of the disease, which has infected about 6,000 people
and killed more than 130.

“Everybody is trying to move as quickly as possible,” said Jacqueline
Shea, the chief operating officer at Inovio.

Inovio received a grant of up to $9 million to develop a coronavirus
vaccine from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a
group whose aim is to speed vaccines to market. Moderna, which is
working with Dr. Graham’s team at the N.I.H., [received a similar
grant](https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/),
as did researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia.

Historically, vaccines have been one of the greatest public health tools
to prevent disease. But even as new technology, advancements in genomics
and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to move at
unprecedented speed, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky
process. It takes months and even years because the vaccines must
undergo extensive testing in animals and humans. In the best case, it
takes at least a year — and most likely longer — for any vaccine to
become available to the public.

“They may not help in the very early stages of an outbreak, but if we’re
able to develop vaccines in time, they will be an asset later,” said
Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the epidemic preparedness
coalition.

With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch.
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months
from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human
trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in
2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they
hope the joint efforts will cut that time in
half.

The morning after the Chinese scientists published their data earlier
this month, Dr. Graham’s team got to work checking the sequence and
comparing it with what they already had for SARS and MERS. They wanted
to focus on the spike protein, which forms the crown of the coronavirus
and recognizes receptors, or entry points, on a host cell.

“If you can block the spike protein from binding to a cell, then you’ve
effectively prevented an infection,” said Kizzmekia Corbett, the
scientific lead for Dr. Graham’s coronavirus team.

Dr. Corbett and others had studied the spike proteins on SARS and MERS
viruses in detail, using them to develop experimental vaccines. The
vaccines never made it to market because SARS was successfully contained
with public health measures before the vaccine was ready and
preliminary[human trials for the MERS vaccine showed
success](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(19\)30266-X/fulltext)
last year.

But the scientists had a method for developing vaccines that could help
them fast-track production for the new coronavirus. They used the
template for the SARS vaccine and swapped in just enough genetic code
that would make it work for the new virus. “I call it plug and play,”
Dr. Corbett said.

Within a few hours, Dr. Corbett was able to prepare the modified
sequence that the researchers needed. On Tuesday, Jan. 14, the team held
a conference call to discuss the next steps with collaborators in labs
across the country, and sent off the sequence to Moderna.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists at the company plan to use the genetic information to create
synthetic messenger RNA, which carries instructions for cells’
protein-making machinery. The technology will help induce high levels of
antibodies that can identify the spike protein and fight off an
infection.

Once Moderna manufactures the messenger RNA in a few weeks, the N.I.H.
will run more tests, Dr. Corbett said. Collaborators in academic labs
will then test the vaccine in mice infected with the virus and check
blood samples from the animals to see how well the experimental vaccine
worked.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham’s team, said
he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.

“If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a
Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record
speed,” he said, referring to early human trials that test for
safety.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Other researchers are using different methods to develop their vaccines.

Inovio, which is also developing a vaccine for MERS, uses a DNA-based
technology. Johnson & Johnson delivers vaccines through adenoviruses —
which can cause coldlike symptoms but have been made harmless. And
researchers at the University of Queensland are testing particles that
mimic the structure of a virus.

“We don’t know which vaccine approach will be successful at this stage,
so we have to try everything in our arsenal,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, a
vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

In interviews, company executives said that partnerships with
governments and philanthropic foundations were essential to developing
vaccines for outbreaks because there [are so many
uncertainties](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/health/without-lucrative-market-potential-ebola-vaccine-was-shelved-for-years.html).

Dr. Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson’s chief scientific officer,
estimated it could take eight to 12 months before his company’s vaccines
reach human clinical trials. By then, it is possible the coronavirus
outbreak will have been contained. Testing of Johnson & Johnson’s Zika
vaccine is currently halted, he said, because new outbreaks of the
disease have slowed.

“You have to be brave and you have to be a solid company to do this,
because there is no real incentive to do this, no financial incentive,”
he said.

Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said vaccines were
necessary, even if an outbreak wanes, because it could always return. “I
think it’s important to be prepared,” he said.

Experts believe that the frequency of outbreaks will only increase
because of [climate
change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/climate/dengue-mosquito-spread-map.html),
urbanization and global travel, among other factors.

“We probably need to start thinking about putting in a special
infrastructure for coronavirus infections the same way we have for the
flu,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, who is co-director of the Texas Children’s
Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and was involved in the
production of a SARS vaccine that may be repurposed for the new
coronavirus. The detection and monitoring of infections, as well as the
development of vaccines, will put an insurance policy in place for
future outbreaks, he said.

“We’re just starting to realize that the power of vaccines goes way
beyond public health,” he said. “They are also critical to the global
economy and global security.”
