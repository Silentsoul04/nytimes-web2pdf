Australians flown home from Wuhan, China, will be quarantined on an
island for two weeks. Americans, also evacuated from Wuhan, will be
“temporarily housed” on an air base in California. And in South Korea,
the police have been empowered to detain people who refuse to be
quarantined.

For countries outside China, the time to prevent an epidemic is now,
when cases are few and can be isolated. They are trying to seize the
moment to protect themselves against the [coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html),
which has reached every province in China, sickening more than 7,700
people and killing 170.

More than a dozen nations with a handful of cases — including the United
States — are isolating patients and monitoring their contacts, as well
as screening travelers from China and urging people to postpone trips
there.

But whether this virus can be contained depends on factors still
unknown, like just how contagious it is and when in the course of the
infection the virus starts to spread.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China, with nearly 1.4 billion people, is the most populous nation on
Earth, and it has taken extreme measures to try to stop the disease,
first reported in December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The
government has stopped travel in and out of that city and surrounding
ones, effectively locking down tens of millions of people.

“The fact that to date we have only seen 68 cases outside China and no
deaths is due in no small part to the extraordinary steps the government
has taken to prevent the export of cases,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus, the ****** director-general of the World Health
Organization, said at a news briefing on Wednesday.

But the disease has spread far and wide inside China and, with extensive
worldwide travel by its citizens, especially during the celebration of
the Lunar New Year, countries everywhere are bracing for the arrival of
more new cases.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Person-to-person transmission is occurring, and cases have turned up in
several countries with people who have not visited China. Mentioning
those cases, Dr. Tedros said the potential for further global spread was
one of the reasons he had called on the W.H.O.’s emergency committee to
meet again on Thursday to decide whether to declare the epidemic a
public health emergency of international concern. The committee met
twice last week but was [split about whether to declare an
emergency](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/china-virus-who-emergency.html),
saying it did not have enough information to decide.

“I think things are going to get worse before they get better,” Dr.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time
    it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is
    the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My
    colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the
    outbreak.
    
    It’s Thursday, January 30.
    
    Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak?

  - javier hernández  
    Well, we started hearing reports in early January that there was
    this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in
    central China.

  - archived recording  
    Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a
    mystery virus.

javier hernández

People were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which
scientists were calling a coronavirus.

  - archived recording  
    Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically
    causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead
    to pneumonia.

javier hernández

It’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It
was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it
sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain
couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to
humans.

  - archived recording  
    The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from
    animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan.

javier hernández

And at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a
single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals,
things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was
that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this
virus.

michael barbaro

And it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this
virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty
small problem.

javier hernández

At this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been
infected and that, of those, only about four had died.

  - archived recording  
    Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control.

javier hernández

And so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was
treatable and that things would be O.K.

michael barbaro

And Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government
talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.?

javier hernández

We were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a
history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more
reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to
question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was
happening.

michael barbaro

And what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations
like this?

javier hernández

Well before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And
it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000
people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason
that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t
tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it
was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know
about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS
makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it
comes to public health.

michael barbaro

And I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical.

javier hernández

Right. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right.

We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak
as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who
were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for
them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they
needed.

michael barbaro

And so what do you do?

javier hernández

So I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks,
enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and
boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost
everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see
people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this
sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed.

\[music\]

Once I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been
posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him
because he was challenging the official narrative about what was
happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He
thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak.

michael barbaro

And what was happening to his posts once they went online?

javier hernández

They lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just
disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to
scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so
we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground.

michael barbaro

And what did he tell you?

javier hernández

He told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions,
that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a
hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical
workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come
forward publicly.

michael barbaro

So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small.
This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is
bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of
information?

javier hernández

We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this
virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting
symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with
this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a
40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just
a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And
so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe.
\[CHATTER\]

michael barbaro

And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?

javier hernández

He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a
couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu.
So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t
seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was
having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very
suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was
told that she would likely die.

michael barbaro

And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her
illness?

javier hernández

They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr.
Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this
mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and
other medical workers refused.

He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it
said was that she died of severe pneumonia.

michael barbaro

But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they
wouldn’t test her?

javier hernández

It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something
going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have
enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so
many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not
counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And
if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even
included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me
from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital,
according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned
immediately, had to be cremated immediately. \[CHATTER\]

michael barbaro

And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re
burning these bodies?

javier hernández

It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were
beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that
they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps
they thought it posed a threat to other people.

Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like
her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly
find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that
they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were
simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed
like the numbers weren’t right.

michael barbaro

So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s
sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?

javier hernández

So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of
this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports
emerging on social media —

  - archived recording  
    For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke
    out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease
    could be contagious.

javier hernández

— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this
virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the
case before.

  - archived recording (zhong nanshan)  
    \[SPEAKING CHINESE\]

  - archived recording (translator)  
    We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed
    that it is contagious among humans.

javier hernández

And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially.
He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all
over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than
had been previously known.

michael barbaro

So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.

javier hernández

Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able
to infect 14 medical workers.

michael barbaro

Wow.

javier hernández

And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.

  - archived recording 1  
    Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now?

  - archived recording 2  
    It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever,
    it can be transmitted.

  - archived recording 3  
    But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.

javier hernández

This is the moment when the world begins to wake up.

  - archived recording 1  
    Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well.

  - archived recording 2  
    Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found
    outside of China.

  - archived recording 3  
    — because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly
    Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have
    airports here in the United States very concerned about it —

  - archived recording 4  
    That are doing surveillance.

  - archived recording 5  
    — here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing
    exponentially.

  - archived recording 6  
    It is. It’s growing.

javier hernández

The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.

  - archived recording 1  
    The number of people who have died —

  - archived recording 2  
    The death toll climbing once again overnight.

  - archived recording 3  
    The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus —

  - archived recording 4  
    26 deaths so far from the —

  - archived recording 5  
    — has now passed 40.

  - archived recording 6  
    \[SPEAKING CHINESE\]

  - archived recording 7  
    It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried.
    They’re all afraid of dying.

javier hernández

You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be
contained.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because
you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care
of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.

javier hernández

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Are you anxious?

javier hernández

Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I
think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these
situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I
couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I
touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me.
The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.

michael barbaro

I mean, understandably.

javier hernández

So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.

  - archived recording  
    Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as
    hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with
    families, an unprecedented act.

javier hernández

And then the very next day, I hear —

  - archived recording  
    Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on
    lockdown.

javier hernández

The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.

michael barbaro

Wow.

  - archived recording  
    Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public
    transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.

michael barbaro

So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who
remains that they’re not going anywhere.

javier hernández

Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done
before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in
recent times.

  - archived recording  
    Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.

javier hernández

And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t
just a local problem.

  - archived recording  
    Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.

javier hernández

They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that
there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to
stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the
biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the
biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.

  - archived recording 1  
    Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been
    stopped.

  - archived recording 2  
    Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese
    government will prove effective.

michael barbaro

It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that
kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city
somehow being locked down.

javier hernández

So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in
full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck
there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t
get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of
medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get
the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s
the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice
but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t
swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply
with this mass lockdown.

michael barbaro

You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its
authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its
citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And
you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially
suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t
China’s government have been able to identify and control this
outbreak before it got out of hand?

javier hernández

You would think that, because the government is so well known for being
able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s
been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the
same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s
authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

javier hernández

Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in
which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to
be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to
take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has
created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything
about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something
wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the
incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to
get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody
will ever hear about it.

michael barbaro

So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it
may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain
it themselves and keep it from Beijing.

javier hernández

Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the
SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew
exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this
illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the
chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they
could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find
out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But
eventually it broke.

michael barbaro

So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led
to that breakdown, that cover-up?

javier hernández

China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS
crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so
that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the
central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more
transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they
didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear
bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President
Xi.

michael barbaro

Why?

javier hernández

He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is
somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for
China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that
goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to
be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will
pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the
fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people
like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official
statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that
didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They
didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing
this unsavory story into public view.

michael barbaro

So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care
workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.

javier hernández

Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis.
They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus
might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to
wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will
stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear
for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.

michael barbaro

So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the
failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because
it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.

javier hernández

At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist
Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize
entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay
indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their
narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the
public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also
a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling
to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and
that affect people’s lives.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t,
right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to
speak out about something like a public health crisis.

javier hernández

Exactly.

And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can
actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a
world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives
around the world in danger.

michael barbaro

Javier, thank you.

javier hernández

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in
mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that
epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than
6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health
Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether
the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international
concern, its most severe classification.

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the
White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a
letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking
to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of
the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the
book contains significant amounts of classified information that could
harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times
published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has
further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators
are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later
today.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

If China can somehow contain its outbreak, and if other countries with
cases can prevent sustained transmission, Dr. Fauci said that it might
be possible to end the outbreak, just as the coronavirus that caused the
SARS epidemic in 2003 was stamped out.

“But it’s going to be a real kind of tightrope walk, because if it gets
so expansive then it’s not going to just disappear the way SARS did,” he
said. “I think the next four to five weeks are going to be critical.
It’s either going to start peaking and go into a downturn, or it’s
going to explode into a global outbreak.”

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said in an interview that he thought it would
become clear in a few days whether the outbreak could be contained.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If we’re seeing widespread transmission, thousands or tens of thousands
of infections in the community, I don’t see how this gets controlled,”
Dr. Frieden said. “On the other hand, if we see a SARS-like situation,
where with incredible effort they were able to isolate people, tamp down
the spread, then we’re in a containment situation.”

A particular concern is the possibility that the virus could wreak havoc
in Africa, where possible cases are being investigated.

“We are very concerned about Africa because some of the least prepared
countries for outbreaks are in Africa,” Dr. Frieden said, adding, “We
know the systems there to find it and stop it are weaker there than
elsewhere.”

If efforts to contain an outbreak fail, public health authorities will
focus on “mitigation”— dealing with the disease and trying to minimize
the harm it does to people and communities.

“It’s a worrisome situation in China,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of
the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in
an interview on Wednesday. “It seems like more of a mitigation strategy
than a control strategy that China has moved to.”

The United States still has a chance to avoid China’s fate, she said.

“We still only have five cases, and we can really do aggressive measures
around those cases,” Dr. Messonnier said. “We’re trying to contain the
disease, and by being aggressive we’re hoping to learn more about what
it takes to contain it.”

The five patients have hundreds of contacts. Some are being tested for
the virus, and the results may help researchers understand how the
disease is transmitted. The C.D.C. is also monitoring more than 100
“patients under investigation” — some with cough or fever who have
been to Wuhan, or have had contact with a patient.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But if the case count were to increase exponentially, Dr. Messonnier
said, it would be hard to continue the concerted containment efforts.
The C.D.C. is already gearing up should the approach need to evolve to
mitigation strategies like closing schools, preventing public gatherings
and helping hospitals prepare for a surge of
cases.

One troubling question is whether infected people can start spreading
the virus before they themselves get sick. Chinese health officials have
said they believe such transmission has taken place. If it happened
often, it could make stopping an outbreak much
harder.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The reason is that the first step in halting outbreaks has traditionally
been to identify people who are ill and then stop them from infecting
others, usually by isolating them. But that approach will not work as
well if people without any symptoms are already transmitting the
disease.

Health officials in the United States said they had not seen data from
China to support that claim, nor any evidence that people without
symptoms had spread the disease in the United States. The five patients
in the United States had all visited Wuhan, and so far none of their
contacts have become ill or tested positive for the virus.

Dr. Fauci said that epidemics are fueled by people with symptoms — like
sneezing and coughing, which help spray the virus around — and not by
those without symptoms, even if some of them can spread the virus. Dr.
Frieden said if asymptomatic people do transmit some virus, sick
patients are likely to spread a lot more.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

People with colds or flu can spread viruses for a day or two before they
become ill, but how big a role that plays in outbreaks is not known,
researchers say.

In any case, flu spreads worldwide every year, infecting tens of
millions of people.

And the spread of the new coronavirus is starting to resemble that of
seasonal flu, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for
Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

“I think we have to revisit which model we’re really using, and I think
we really over the past week and a half have come closer to the
influenza model,” Dr. Osterholm said. “Trying to stop influenza in a
community without vaccine is like trying to stop the wind. I don’t know
how we’re going to stop this.”

He added, “The only thing operating in our favor is at least it doesn’t
appear to be as severe as SARS or as MERS.”

Among patients with the Wuhan coronavirus, about 20 percent have become
seriously ill, and the rest have a mild illness, the W.H.O. said at a
news briefing on Wednesday. So far, the death rate appears to be about 2
percent, but that is not certain yet. Those who die tend to be older
people with underlying ailments. The median age of the first 425
patients in China was 59, and a little more than half were male,
[according to a report
published](https://cdf.nejm.org/services/GetOnlineFirstPDF.aspx?DOI=NEJMoa2001316)
in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.

Diseases caused by related coronaviruses are deadlier: SARS killed 10
percent, and MERS about 35 percent.

But if the new virus were to spread even more widely and a 2 percent
mortality rate continued, the death toll could be considerable. Seasonal
flu, with a much lower overall death rate of 0.1 percent, kills more
than half a million people worldwide every year. At least 8,200 people
in the United States have died during this flu season, according
to[estimates from the C.D.C.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm)
