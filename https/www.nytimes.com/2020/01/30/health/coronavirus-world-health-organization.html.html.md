The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on
Thursday as the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/WHO-Trump-coronavirus.html)
outbreak spread well beyond China, where it emerged last month.

The move reversed the organization’s decision just a week ago to [hold
off such a
declaration](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/china-virus-who-emergency.html).
Since then, there have been thousands of new cases in China and clear
evidence of human-to-human transmission [in several other
countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html),
including the United States.

All of which warranted a reconsideration by the W.H.O.’s emergency
committee, officials said.

The declaration “is not a vote of no confidence in China,” said Tedros
Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director-general. “On the contrary,
the
[W.H.O.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/WHO-Trump-coronavirus.html)
continues to have confidence in China’s capacity to control the
outbreak.”

The declaration comes now, he said, because of fears that the
coronavirus may reach countries with weak health care systems, where it
could run amok, potentially infecting millions of people and killing
thousands.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Following the declaration, the State Department on Thursday night
[warned travelers to avoid China
altogether](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html).

China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said that the
country “is fully confident and capable of winning the battle against
this epidemic.”

In a statement on the ministry’s website, she added that China was
willing to continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to
safeguard public health.

States of emergency are “merely guidance,” said Dr. David L. Heymann, a
former W.H.O. assistant director-general who now analyzes the work of
the agency’s emergency committee. Governments and even private companies
“may or may not follow it.”

Nonetheless, emergency declarations signal that the world’s top health
advisory body thinks the situation is grave. Many scientific experts
welcomed the decision.

The public health emergency “allows them to further lean into the role
of global leadership for governments and the private sector,” said Dr.
Thomas R. Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and a veteran of several global health
emergencies.

The first goal, he said, should be to understand more about how the
virus is spreading — whether mostly in hospitals and clinics, what ages
and sexes or professions are most affected, how sick they become and
what risk factors are dangerous.

But Amir Attaran, a professor of law and epidemiology at the University
of Ottawa and a frequent W.H.O. critic, called the declaration
“inexcusably late.” The committee’s reasoning that it lacked enough
scientific evidence to declare an emergency last week was “balderdash,”
he added.

“W.H.O. is paralyzed for the same political reasons that ruined its
scientific judgment in SARS, Ebola and Zika,” he said. “Borders are
closed, aircraft grounded and ships anchored as W.H.O. mutely dithers
over whether or not to declare an emergency.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Events have comprehensively overtaken them, proving their uselessness
yet again,” he
added.

Declaring emergencies is always a hard decision, Dr. Tedros said on
Wednesday.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Border closings and
flight cancellations may cause hardships for millions of healthy people
near the epicenter, and enormous economic disruption.

In the worst cases, supplies of [food and medicine can run
short](https://www.businessinsider.com/no-food-crowded-hospitals-wuhan-first-week-in-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-1)
and panic can spread, threatening to do more damage than the disease.

Experts at the W.H.O. have lavishly and repeatedly praised China’s
response as remarkably aggressive.

The country is building two hospitals, in just two weeks, to house
coronavirus patients. Chinese scientists deposited the genetic signature
of the coronavirus in public databases, greatly speeding the development
of diagnostic tests and, potentially, vaccines.

Chinese authorities cordoned off the major cities at the outbreak’s
epicenter, Hubei Province, [stranding more than 50 million
people](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/479733-more-than-30-million-on-lockdown-amid-coronavirus)
at the height of the Lunar New Year holidays — a measure that few other
countries could have undertaken.

Whether that massive cordon will prove effective remains to be seen.
Five million people were able to leave Wuhan, the city where the
outbreak began, before its train and bus stations and airports were
closed, the mayor said. There were soon outbreaks across the country.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Tedros praised the Chinese government, saying it “is setting a new
standard for outbreak response.” Other countries should be grateful that
only 98 of the nearly 10,000 cases confirmed so far have occurred
outside China’s borders, he said.

Despite the emergency declaration, and despite the State Department’s
urging Americans to stay away from China, the W.H.O. opposes
restrictions on travel to China or on trade with it.

Measures the agency considers unwarranted include border closures, visa
restrictions and the quarantining of apparently healthy visitors from
the affected regions, said the chairman of the agency’s emergency
committee, Dr. Didier Houssin, an adviser to France’s national health
security agency.

Many such measures have already been taken against China by other
countries, and Dr. Houssin said the W.H.O. would question the scientific
rationales behind
them.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Neither he nor Dr. Tedros questioned the decision by the United States
and other countries to evacuate their citizens from China, and they said
the cancellation of flights by airlines was justified if the real reason
was that they had no passengers.

Dr. Tedros, who met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday,
said he was struck by how much Mr. Xi knew about the outbreak and by the
fact that Ma Xiaowei, director of China’s National Health Commission,
was on the ground in Wuhan leading the response.

That is not say there haven’t been missteps. The W.H.O. last week
described its risk assessment for the outbreak as “moderate,” when it
should have said “high.” The error was corrected in a footnote to the
agency’s report; Dr. Tedros described it on Twitter as a “human error.”

Experts in the United States have complained of spotty epidemiological
information from China.

Also, the W.H.O. cannot share information with Taiwan, which now has
eight coronavirus patients, because Taiwan is not a member of the United
Nations.

The agency “doesn’t want to upset its major stakeholders,” said Charles
Clift, a senior consulting fellow at the Chatham House, an international
affairs research group in London. “China carries the political clout
that other countries don’t.”

And the outbreak seems to accelerating, along with its consequences.
China said on Friday<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>that
another 43 people had died from the disease, bringing the total to 213.
No deaths have yet occurred outside China.

On Thursday, Russia closed much of its 2,600-mile border with China and
stopped all train service between the countries, except for a regular
train between Moscow and Beijing. Some airlines, including British
Airways, have stopped flying there; others are greatly reducing their
service.

Within China, some medical experts have questioned their country’s
response, arguing that local officials should have imposed stricter
travel restrictions before the virus spilled out of Wuhan. The country
has now confirmed cases in every province and region.

Residents have complained that local authorities kept mum about the
outbreak’s severity — initially insisting that there was no evidence of
person-to-person transmission outside Wuhan — but admitted the truth
after press reports in Hong Kong.

As the dimensions of the outbreak became clear, the mayor of Wuhan on
Monday offered to resign.

A W.H.O. delegation was allowed to visit Wuhan for just one day. Dr.
Gauden Galea, the organization’s representative in Beijing, said the
visit was not intended “to pass judgment.”

“Everything is being done with a sense of intensity, and to our
assessment, good practice,” he added. “I don’t want to be an apologist.
You have to understand the large scale and the comprehensiveness of the
operation.”

Following the trip, China agreed to permit international experts
coordinated by the W.H.O. into the country to work with Chinese
scientists on containing the epidemic. The C.D.C. is assembling a team
to join them.

The W.H.O. has made just five emergency declarations since its power to
do so was established in 2005: for the pandemic influenza in 2009; a
polio resurgence in 2014; the Ebola epidemic in West Africa that year;
the Zika virus outbreak in 2016; and an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic
Republic of Congo last year.

Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine and one of the discoverers of the Ebola virus and the presence
of AIDS in Africa, agreed with the W.H.O.’s emergency declaration but
felt the process was flawed.

“It is time for the W.H.O. to change its all-or-nothing, binary
approach” to declaring an emergency, Dr. Piot
said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“In every emergency,
there is a spectrum of alert levels.”

Dr. Tedros expressed the same frustration at a news conference on
Wednesday, suggesting that the agency might need to switch to a
graduated “green-yellow-red" system.

Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Chris Horton from
Taipei. Elsie Chen contributed research.
