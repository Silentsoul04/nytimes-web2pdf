On a July 25 telephone call with the president of Ukraine, President
Trump described Ambassador Yovanovitch as ``bad news'' and said,
ominously, ``She's going to go through some things.''

WASHINGTON --- The American ambassador whose abrupt recall from Ukraine
helped lead to President Trump's impeachment has retired from the State
Department, a person familiar with her plans confirmed on Friday.

Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, had been expected to leave the
Foreign Service after she was ordered back to Washington from Kyiv,
Ukraine, ahead of schedule last spring,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-trump-impeachment.html}{accused
of being disloyal to Mr. Trump}.

But documents and testimony
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-facts-bio.html}{later
showed} that she was the target of a smear campaign for, in part,
refusing to grant visas to former Ukrainian officials who were
investigating Mr. Trump's political rivals.

On a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html?module=inline}{July
25 telephone call} with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr.
Trump described Ms. Yovanovitch as ``bad news'' and said, ominously,
``She's going to go through some things.''

She possibly already had: Text messages between Mr. Trump's personal
lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and his associates that were released
publicly earlier this month indicated that Ms. Yovanovitch
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/world/europe/ukraine-yovanovitch-investigation.html}{was
under surveillance} while still in Kyiv --- a claim that the State
Department and Ukraine security officials are investigating.

State Department officials have suggested that Ms. Yovanovitch was
pulled from Kyiv because of concerns about her security. But Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo has refused to publicly support her, or clarify why
she was recalled to the United States,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/politics/mike-pompeo-ukraine-state-department.html}{setting
off an internal revolt of diplomats} who have rallied to her defense.

Ms. Yovanovitch was a star witness for House Democrats in their
impeachment inquiry. She
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-testimony.html}{described
being ``shocked, appalled, devastated''} upon learning of what the
president said about her to Mr. Zelensky.

The Senate is all but assured to acquit Mr. Trump in a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-31?action=click\&module=Spotlight\&pgtype=Homepage}{vote
scheduled for Wednesday} that will end his impeachment trial.

At its heart was whether Mr. Trump could be held liable for appearing to
withhold \$391 million in security aid from Ukraine --- money that
Congress had already approved --- until Mr. Zelensky announced an
investigation into a company that had employed Hunter Biden, the son of
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is seeking the Democratic
nomination to run against Mr. Trump.

Ms. Yovanovitch's retirement from the State Department, after 33 years
of service,
was\href{https://www.npr.org/2020/01/31/801697400/ukraine-ambassador-marie-yovanovitch-key-figure-in-impeachment-trial-retires}{first
reported on Friday by NPR}. She could not be immediately reached for
comment, and the State Department did not return calls and messages
seeking comment Friday night.

Since returning to Washington last spring, Ms. Yovanovitch has been
assigned to a
\href{https://isd.georgetown.edu/profile/amb-marie-l-yovanovitch/}{fellowship}
at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, and she
is scheduled to receive
\href{https://sfs.georgetown.edu/event/trainor-award-to-amb-marie-yovanovitch/}{an
award} in February from the university's School of Foreign Service for
``Excellence in the Conduct of Diplomacy.''
