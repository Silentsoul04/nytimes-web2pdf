DES MOINES — John Delaney ran one of the longest presidential campaigns
in American history, but it’s over now.

Mr. Delaney dropped out of the Democratic race on Friday, just three
days before the Iowa caucuses, ending a two-and-a-half-year marathon
that has spanned almost the entirety of the Trump presidency.

Anthony Scaramucci was working in the White House when Mr. Delaney began
his campaign. The white supremacist rally in Charlottesville had not
happened yet. Robert Mueller’s investigation was less than three months
old.

Mr. Delaney announced his candidacy on July 28, 2017, during his third
term as a representative from Maryland, and did not pursue re-election
in 2018, the better to focus on his quest for the White House. By the
time other Democrats began flooding Iowa, he had already visited every
county — the theory being that a little-known congressman could become a
presidential nominee if he barnstormed the early primary states before
anyone else was around to draw voters’ attention.

“I think I’m the right person for the job, but not enough people knew
who I was or still know who I am,” [Mr. Delaney said in
August 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/john-delaney-2020-iowa.html).
“The way to solve that problem, it seems to me, is to get in early and
just work harder than everyone else.”

On Friday, he acknowledged that it hadn’t been enough. He said he had
concluded that he would not meet the threshold of 15 percent support
needed for viability in the caucuses — at least not in enough precincts
to matter — but that he could pull enough support to keep other moderate
candidates below the threshold, which he did not want to
do.

“Particularly these rural counties I went to, I would talk to people in
precincts that last time, 2016, 20 people caucused, and I’d be sitting
there with two people who I know are going to caucus for me,” he said in
an interview on Friday. “I’ve wanted this campaign to be constructive
and productive the whole time, and it felt like when I knew that I
didn’t have enough support to reach viability in a meaningful way, but
I had enough support to pull off from other candidates, I said, well,
that’s not very productive.”

He said he might endorse someone later in the primary, but would not
immediately. He also said he would “absolutely fully support, with
everything I’ve got, whoever the Democratic nominee is,” even if it is
one of the liberal candidates whose policies he has criticized.

Mr. Delaney’s big pitch was bipartisanship, and the time-honored idea
that Americans could overcome their bitterest divisions if they had a
leader who encouraged them to do so. As more candidates entered and the
race shifted sharply to the left, he leaned harder into his
self-appointed role as a voice of moderation, nowhere more so than on
health care.

He proposed [automatically enrolling every American in a government-run
health care
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/john-delaney-health-care.html),
but offering a credit to people who wanted to forfeit that benefit and
buy their own insurance instead. He cast it as a compromise measure: a
way to guarantee universal coverage without eliminating private
insurance. And as the race heated up, he pushed aggressively against
“Medicare for all,” calling it unrealistic and bad politics.

“I believe the American people do want choices,” he said in 2018. “We’re
different than other countries in that regard. We believe in choices, we
believe in everyone making their own decisions, so I don’t see why we
want to be insisting upon one source of health care for everyone.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By June 2019, Mr. Delaney was stuck around 1 percent in the polls, but
it was enough to qualify him for the first two Democratic debates. After
a muted performance in the first debate, he made the most of the second,
logging [about the same amount of speaking
time](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/30/us/elections/debate-speaking-time.html)
as more prominent candidates like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
But his numbers did not improve, and he didn’t qualify for later
debates.

The debate moderators seemed, at times, to regard Mr. Delaney less as
his own candidate than as a foil for liberals like Senators Bernie
Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. It was at Mr.
Delaney, in response to his criticism of “impossible promises” and
“fairy-tale economics,” that Ms. Warren directed [a memorable
line](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-debate.html):
“I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for
president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t
do and shouldn’t fight for.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Delaney said on Friday that he thought his campaign had brought
early attention to criticisms of “Medicare for all” that candidates like
former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., now hammer on the
trail.

On “this notion of running toward the center, unifying the country,” he
said, “I think our campaign made a meaningful difference.”

Before he was elected to the House in 2012, Mr. Delaney founded two
financial companies and was, at one point, the youngest chief executive
on the New York Stock Exchange. Those companies made him one of the
wealthiest members of Congress, with [an estimated net worth of more
than $90
million](https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/every-member-congress-wealth-one-chart).
He spent millions of those dollars on his own
campaign.
