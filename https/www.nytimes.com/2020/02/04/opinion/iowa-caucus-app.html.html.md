Democrats desperately need to win the internet to beat Trump. Their
first big test was a massive failure.

A transformative piece of technology is supposed to “disrupt” the
unwieldy ways that came before it. On Monday evening, an app built to
deliver quicker caucus results took the Silicon Valley term of art
literally, contributing to massive delays in reporting the results in
Iowa. Hours after the caucuses ended, the state Democratic Party,
[citing inconsistencies in the reporting
data](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/us/politics/iowa-caucus-problems.html),
still has not publicly reported any results. It stressed there was no
“hack or intrusion.”

Over the past hours a disheartening game of electoral tech support,
conducted by journalists across the internet, has unfolded. And in place
of definitive results, an information war has broken out, unleashing
reckless speculation, conspiracy theories and deep anxiety.

First came the reports — trickling in from caucus leaders, precinct
captains and observers — that the app wasn’t working properly. On Monday
evening a precinct captain told me by text that their caucus manager was
“unable to get the app from the Democratic Party to work” and “had to do
the math to figure out delegates ‘long hand.’” FiveThirtyEight’s [Amelia
Thomson-Deveaux
spoke](https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/iowa-caucus-2020-election-live/#255769)
to a frustrated caucus leader who suggested the app itself wouldn’t
download. “We could not problem-solve getting the app onto one of our
devices,” he told her. NBC News
[reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/iowa-caucuses-live-updates-2020-democrats-make-their-final-pitches-n1128596/ncrd1129196#liveBlogHeader)
some caucus leaders had missed the window to download the app
altogether. The Biden campaign [issued a
letter](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/iowa-caucuses-live-updates-2020-democrats-make-their-final-pitches-n1128596/ncrd1129516)
to Iowa party leaders suggesting the app had failed.

Reckless speculation followed about possible security problems with the
technology. Stories from late last month raising concerns about [the
caucus app’s
vulnerabilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dems-iowa-caucus-voting-app-stirs-security-concerns-11580063221)
recirculated on Twitter. Among the chief fears: The app was to be
downloaded directly to the phones of caucus volunteers, making it
difficult to ensure the safety of the devices.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After midnight, [The Huffington
Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/iowa-caucus-app-shadow_n_5e390191c5b687dacc722824?ri18n=true)
reported that Shadow, a tech company funded by the progressive digital
media firm
[Acronym](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/politics/democratic-political-campaign-advertising.html),
was responsible for building the app. Shadow, according to [its
website](https://shadowinc.io/about), bills itself “as building a
long-term, side-by-side ‘Shadow’ of tech infrastructure to the
Democratic Party and the progressive community at large.” Acronym
quickly [put out a
statement](https://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/1224585689586532352)
distancing itself from Shadow and noting, “We, like everyone else, are
eagerly awaiting more information from the Iowa Democratic Party.”

There’s a great deal we don’t know yet about Shadow and the caucus app,
though details have trickled in. Vice attempted to install the app
itself and had similar issues to caucus leaders logging in. On Tuesday
afternoon, Shadow issued its first official statement taking
responsibility for the delayed results. [Via
Twitter,](https://twitter.com/ShadowIncHQ/status/1224773797380837377?s=20)
the company stressed that “the underlying data and collection process
via Shadow’s mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process
to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP
was not.”

Its apparent failure is a nightmare scenario for Democrats and the
political left. Quite simply, the party desperately needs to [win the
internet](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/01/opinion/democrats-2020-election-online.html)
in their race to beat President Trump. That means building
infrastructure to connect and assuage voters, controlling the narrative
and overcoming the substantial [time
advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/01/opinion/democrats-2020-election-online.html)
held by the president. In its first critical test, the party
systematically undermined each of those
goals.

Shadow’s failure suggests a potentially deadly combination of
techno-utopianism and laziness. The two fuel each other: The overarching
belief that software will fix everything leads to slapdash engineering,
procurement and deployment. The result is an obsession with another
Silicon Valley term of art, “minimum viable product.” The author Eric
Ries
[defined](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html)
it as “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the
maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least
effort.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shadow’s app seems to fit that definition. Reports
[suggest](https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1224565448303357952?s=20)
that the app was engineered in just the past two months. According to
cybersecurity consultants and academics [interviewed by the
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/us/politics/iowa-caucuses.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#link-774e54b7),
the app was not tested at statewide scale or vetted by the Department of
Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency. And even if the app was
working just fine, [reports
suggest](https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1224574088917569536?s=20)
the roll out of the tool was bungled, to the point where those tasked
with reporting via the app weren’t trained to know how to use it.

The process feels reckless given today’s internet, where individual
devices are easy to compromise and where routine disruptions like denial
of service attacks can happen at a moment’s notice. There’s also
precedent for rigorous testing. A [2012 profile of President Obama’s
digital
team](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/when-the-nerds-go-marching-in/265325/)
in The Atlantic detailed an excruciating process by which the
organization simulated “every possible disaster situation” weeks before
Election Day to ensure reliability.

Since the caucus is conducted in public view and with a full paper
trail, it seems hard to imagine that the results would be lost. Still, a
critical failure like this creates credibility problems for the party
and confidence issues for voters, who woke up Tuesday morning to
uncertainty.

The cryptic nature of the digital firms and tech contractors is also
bound to raise questions. Who exactly is responsible for building the
apps intended to protect the integrity of the democratic process? Who is
funding the companies behind the tech companies? Why didn’t the Iowa
Democratic Party disclose the app maker? How are procurement decisions
made? Where’s the transparency? That the name of the company at the
center of the fiasco is the literal definition of opacity doesn’t help
either.

Perhaps most concerning is that, on an internet engaged in a constant
information war, the Democrats’ technology failure created an
information vacuum that was quickly seized upon by trolls and political
operatives alike to cast doubt on the electoral process and sow
division. “Quality control = rigged?” Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s
campaign manager,
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1224533010890002434?s=20)
on Monday night. The message was retweeted and liked a combined 14,000
times. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. questioned whether the
results had been “rigged” or fixed, as did the Trump campaign’s national
press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2020, even in periods of relative calm and certainty, conspiracy
theories abound. By failing to deliver as an anxious nation watched, the
Iowa Democratic Party helped transform the caucus into a petri dish for
conspiracies. Democrats floated suspicions of their own party;
Republicans amplified them and tried out theories of their own;
unsubstantiated claims of meddling or hacking rattled around picking up
shares, likes and retweets. Facts were scarce. Fear, uncertainty and
doubt took their place. “Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight,” Mr. Trump
tweeted shortly before midnight.

Disruption, indeed.
