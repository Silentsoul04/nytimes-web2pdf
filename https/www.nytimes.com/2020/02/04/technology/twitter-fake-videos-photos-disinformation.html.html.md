# Twitter Moves to Target Fake Videos and Photos

</div>

While stopping short of an outright ban, the social media company plans
to label or take down material that appears to have been digitally
manipulated.

Twitter, bowing to pressure from its users, said on Tuesday that it
would more aggressively scrutinize fake or altered photos and videos.

Starting in March, the company said, it will add labels or take down
tweets carrying manipulated images and videos. The move, while short of
an outright ban, was announced one day after [YouTube also said it
planned to remove misleading election-related content on its
site](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/technology/youtube-misinformation-election.html).

Twitter’s new policy highlights a balancing act — between allowing
parody and removing disinformation — that social media companies face as
they try to more aggressively police the content posted to their
platforms.

To determine whether a tweet should be removed or labeled, Twitter [said
in a blog
post](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-media.html),
it will apply several tests: Is the media included with a tweet
significantly altered or fabricated to mislead? Is it shared in a
deceptive manner? In those cases, the tweet will probably get a label.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But if a tweet is “likely to impact public safety or cause serious
harm,” it will be taken down. Twitter said it might also show a
warning to people before they engaged with a tweet carrying manipulated
content, or limit that tweet’s reach.

“Our approach does not focus on the specific technologies used to
manipulate or fabricate media,” said Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site
integrity. “Whether you’re using advanced machine learning tools or just
slowing down a video using a 99-cent app on your phone, our focus under
this policy is to look at the outcome, not how it was achieved.”

The company developed its rules after surveying more than 6,500 users,
civil groups and academics, said Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president
for trust and safety.

They found that about 70 percent of surveyed Twitter users believed it
was unacceptable for the company to take no action against manipulated
content. More than 90 percent said such content should be removed or
placed behind a warning label saying the video or image had been
altered.

“Things that distort or distract from what’s happening threaten the
integrity of information on Twitter,” Ms. Harvey said.

Like other social networks that have tried to crack down on bogus
content, Twitter will be under pressure to consistently apply its new
rules.

Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, said
that defining harm was not always clear, especially in the context of
social media. “And it would be difficult to automate these responses on
a global scale,” she said.

Last year, an [altered video of Speaker Nancy
Pelosi](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/pelosi-doctored-video.html)
that made it appear that she was slurring her words spread across the
internet. Another heavily [edited clip of former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden
Jr](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/us/politics/biden-video-disinformation-spread.html).
falsely made it seem as though he had made racist remarks.

Mr. Roth said the manipulated videos of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Biden would
get a label under Twitter’s new policy. Depending on what a tweet
sharing the video said and if it caused harm, Mr. Roth said, Twitter
could take the tweet down.

Last year, Twitter said it would add warning labels to [hide messages
from major political
figures](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/twitter-politicans-labels-abuse.html)
who broke the company’s rules for harassment or abuse. Normally, those
tweets would be taken down, but the company argued that they would be
newsworthy enough to remain on the platform. As of Tuesday, Twitter had
not yet used the labels.

In January, [Facebook banned “deepfake”
videos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-says-it-will-ban-deepfakes.html)
from its platform. But the company said the videos of Ms. Pelosi and Mr.
Biden would not be removed under the policy because they had been edited
with video editing software, not artificial intelligence.

YouTube banned misleading political content on Monday as part of a new
policy ahead of the presidential election in November.
