# Inundated With Flu Patients, U.S. Hospitals Brace for Coronavirus

</div>

Resources are already stretched during flu season. With so much medical
equipment and drugs made in China, public health experts are anxiously
watching the global supply chain.

[With an intense flu season in full
swing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/flu-season-severity.html),
hundreds of thousands of coughing and feverish patients have already
overwhelmed emergency rooms around the United States. Now, hospitals are
bracing for the potential spread of coronavirus that could bring another
surge of patients.

So far, only [a dozen people in the United
States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html) have
become infected with the novel coronavirus, but an outbreak could
severely strain the nation’s hospitals.

“We’re talking about the possibility of a double flu pandemic,” where a
second wave starts before the first is over, said Dr. Eric Toner, a
senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Public health experts are also closely watching reserves of vital
medical supplies and medications, many of which are made in China. Some
hospitals in the United States are already “critically low” on
respirator masks, according to Premier Inc., which secures medical
supplies and equipment on behalf of hospitals and health systems. And
China is the dominant supplier of the raw ingredients needed for
penicillin, ibuprofen and even aspirin — drugs taken daily by millions
of Americans and dispensed routinely to hospital patients.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“All the hospitals are taxed with a large flu season and other bugs,”
said Dr. Mark Jarrett, the chief quality officer for Northwell Health,
which operates 23 hospitals across Long Island and elsewhere in New
York. About 400 patients are coming to its emergency rooms each day with
flulike symptoms.

“Everybody is at maximum capacity,” Dr. Jarrett said.

Northwell activated its emergency operations center earlier this month
in response to concerns that the virus, now in epidemic proportions
across China, could become a pandemic, similar to the hospital system’s
reaction to the threat of swine flu in 2009 and Ebola in 2014.

Although the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for
coronavirus late last week, Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed on Friday at a [news
briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKcUSGk6bdI) that the risk for
Americans was still low. Hundreds of people who returned to the United
States from Wuhan have been quarantined at military bases, and others
possibly exposed have been asked to self-quarantine or stay at home.

But Dr. Redfield also said that officials were beginning to actively
discuss what other steps would have to be taken in the event that the
new coronavirus spread in this country. Asked about emergency funding,
Alex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said he
did not believe agencies required additional funds right now.

Still, across the country, hospitals are taking steps to prepare for the
potential threat.

Some are already scrambling to find sufficient supplies of medical face
masks, [especially so-called N95
respirators](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/masks-and-n95-respirators),
which are more effective for preventing infection. [Manufacturers are
struggling to keep up with global
demand](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/business/coronavirus-face-masks.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
and the desperate need for supplies in China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mask shortage highlights just how dependent the United States health
care system is on goods from China. Premier was told last week that a
Taiwanese factory it had a contract with was halting shipments to the
United States. In addition, Chaun Powell, the group vice president of
strategic supplier engagement for Premier, said masks that are made in
China are being diverted for use there. As a result, “there’s not as
much supply to ship,” he
said.

Hospitals in the United States have also increased their requests, he
said, adding that orders for respirator masks in the first five days of
February had completely outstripped the demand for a typical month.

“We’re trying to get as many masks as we can, as is everybody else,” Dr.
Jarrett of Northwell said.

On Friday, Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, said the agency was closely monitoring the supply chain
from Chinese pharmaceutical and medical supply factories, but said the
F.D.A. had received no reports of disruption so far.

Many of those factories closed during the Lunar New Year holidays and
remained closed for additional days..

“Many of us are holding our breath to see the downstream effect on
pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies because of this outbreak in
China,” said Dr. Paul Biddinger, who helps oversee emergency
preparedness for Partners Healthcare, the Boston hospital group that
includes Massachusetts General.

Experts like Dr. Toner say supplies could easily become depleted,
especially at smaller hospitals that tend to have less inventory of
basic items like masks, gowns and gloves. Hospitals [have long struggled
with shortages of injectable
medications](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/health/drug-shortages-generics.html)
and staples like saline. In 2017, Hurricane Maria knocked out power to
several pharmaceutical factories in Puerto Rico, [leading to a shortage
of saline
bags](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-drug-shortage.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Hospitals will “burn through their supplies very quickly if there are a

said.

Some hospital executives downplayed concerns. “This is something we have
a tremendous amount of experience with,” said Dr. Paul Stefanacci, the
chief medical officer for acute care of Universal Health Services, a
for-profit hospital chain. His company has increased its orders of
supplies by 10 percent to handle any uptick in patients.

David Gillan, senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient,
another purchasing group, described the supply chain as strained, and
said he worries about too much “anticipatory behavior,” such as
hospitals ordering more than they need.

Public health officials are also watching whether the shutdown of
manufacturing plants could lead to shortages in a wide variety of drugs
containing active ingredients made in China. Some drug makers reported
that their facilities had reopened this week. But even temporary delays
in manufacturing — or problems transporting materials — could lead to
problems, some experts said.

“[A number of
companies](https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-chemicals/Coronavirus-puts-drug-chemical-industry/98/web/2020/02)
are panicking, for sure,” said James Bruno, a consultant who advises
small and midsize drug makers on manufacturing issues. “Especially the
smaller ones who don’t have the wherewithal to have backup suppliers.”

Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for the Association for Accessible
Medicines, a generic industry trade group, said companies typically have
several years’ worth of supplies of ingredients and that there were
“redundancies built into the system.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rosemary Gibson, an expert on China’s drug supply who is a senior
adviser at the Hastings Center, a nonpartisan bioethics research
institute, said she had learned of companies having trouble getting
shipments of their products. “If there were exports from China that were
no longer coming to the U.S., our hospitals and our health systems would
cease to function within a couple of months,” said Ms. Gibson, who [also
wrote a
book](https://www.amazon.com/China-Rx-Exposing-Americas-Dependence/dp/1633883817),
“China Rx,” about the American dependence on medicines from China.

The United States has already seen examples of how quickly a disruption
in supply from China can lead to shortages. In 2018, [widespread recalls
of the blood pressure drug
valsartan](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/health/fda-blood-pressure-valsartan.html)
were traced to problems at a single Chinese factory that made the drug’s
active ingredient, which was contaminated with a possible
carcinogen.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

About 20 F.D.A. employees assigned to the agency’s [offices in
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/world/asia/19iht-beijing.1.17954828.html),
and who were responsible for product inspections there, have been
evacuated.

“It will be some matter of time before we understand what the
disruptions are,” said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission [who has
studied](https://www.uscc.gov/hearings/exploring-growing-us-reliance-chinas-biotech-and-pharmaceutical-products)
the growing reliance by the United States on Chinese pharmaceutical
products.

Meanwhile, hospitals are training their staffs and circulating the
latest guidance for screening patients and limiting the spread of the
virus. At CommonSpirit Health — a large Catholic hospital system with
142 hospitals created through the merger of Dignity Health, based in San
Francisco, and Catholic Health Initiatives, based in Chicago — patients
and staff members are being instructed on how to distinguish coronavirus
from the flu. It has already embedded screening questions in its
electronic health records.

“It has not impacted our facilities at this time,” said Roy Boukidjian,
vice president for infection prevention for CommonSpirit.

Learning from a 2014 experience with Ebola [when two nurses in Dallas
were infected while caring for a
patient](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/ebola-outbreak-dallas-nurse-amber-joy-vinson.html),
hospitals understand they need to actively prepare their medical staffs
for an influx of cases from a contagious disease, instructing them on
how to safely put on and take off clothing and other protective
equipment, said Julie Fischer, an assistant professor of microbiology at
Georgetown University. “Personnel were not trained, systems were not
tested,” she said. “That’s where the breakdown happened.”

Health care workers are always at high risk, and [the death of a
doctor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html)
treating patients in China reinforced the dangers.

Some nurses say they are better prepared now to protect workers. “We all
went through the Ebola virus a couple of years ago,” said Barbara Rosen,
an official with Health Professionals and Allied Employees, a New Jersey
union. “For this round, everything seems very prepared.”

But Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of National Nurses United,
which represents roughly 155,000 nurses, said some hospitals may not be
fully prepared.

“Our concern is that there is inadequate planning and training and also
just basic staffing,” as well as the availability of supplies that
protect nurses and patients from infection, she said.

Because the nature of the virus is still unknown, public health
officials said it’s unclear what future challenges hospitals will face
if the coronavirus spreads into an epidemic in the United States. While
the current government guidelines call for patients to be treated in
specialized isolation rooms, experts say it is unlikely that there will
be enough isolation rooms at individual facilities.

And to manage the health of patients with severe respiratory illnesses,
which coronavirus can cause, hospitals may find themselves without
enough beds in their intensive care units or sufficient ventilators and
other breathing equipment.

“If it’s a pandemic, it’s going to stretch our resources very thin,”
said Nicole Errett, a researcher at the University of Washington School
of Public Health.
