CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Three days after his [State of the Union
address](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/trump-state-of-the-union.html),
President Trump traveled on Friday to North Carolina to drive home one
of the speech’s major themes.

“This is a blue-collar boom,” Mr. Trump said, repeating what he told
Congress was responsible for “the great American comeback.” He added,
“Boom\!”

The president’s visit to a Charlotte community college gave him a chance
to celebrate a 3.6 percent unemployment rate, the latest jobs numbers,
which showed that [employers added 255,000
jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/january-jobs-report.html)
in January, and the 2017 tax bill. All of those issues are key
components of what is expected to be the centerpiece of his re-election
campaign: the economy.

He boasted about his poll numbers, the 2016 election, his relationship
with China, soldiers coming home and criminal justice overhaul. He
derided Democrats over their trade policies and the chaos during the
Iowa caucuses on Monday, and he dismissed the “failed impeachment hoax.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And Mr. Trump made no mention that he intended to dismiss two key
witnesses in the House hearings that led to his impeachment: [Lt. Col.
Alexander S.
Vindman](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/politics/alexander-vindman-impeachment-testimony.html),
an adviser on Ukraine on the National Security Council, and Gordon D.
Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union.

His focus was economic development, and he highlighted the more than
8,700 economically distressed areas designated by the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act as “opportunity zones” and the tax incentives offered to
business leaders and investors who put money into them.

“Opportunity zones are amazing,” Mr. Trump said. “Tremendous amounts of
money are being put into areas that have not received money for decades
and decades.”

North Carolina has more than [250 such
zones](https://public.nccommerce.com/oz/), representing a population of
1.1 million, including 45,000 families with children living in poverty.
Seventeen of the zones [are in
Charlotte](https://charlottenc.gov/ED/Development/Pages/OpportunityZones.aspx).

Mr. Trump also singled out low unemployment rates for African-Americans,
Asian-Americans, Latinos and women. He lauded his own criminal justice
overhaul efforts and his support for historically black colleges and
universities. And he expressed frustration over African-Americans’
support for Democrats.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You’ve been with the Democrats for a hundred years, 112 to be exact,
and they treat you badly,” Mr. Trump said. “They only come around two
months before the election, and then right after the election, they say,
‘Bye-bye, we’ll see you in two years.’”

Ben Carson, the housing secretary and the only African-American cabinet
member, said Mr. Trump was driven by his kindness and compassion to help
low-income communities. He said that the president was not given credit
for his achievements and that Mr. Trump had been wrongly called a racist
and deemed guilty of “everything under the sun.”

“But let me tell you what he’s really guilty of,” Mr. Carson said. “He
is guilty of creating a dynamic economy that is working for everybody.
He is guilty of creating a military that is so strong that it can’t be
challenged by anyone. He is guilty of recognizing how important it is to
have a Space Force. He is guilty of trade agreements that have leveled
the playing
field.”
