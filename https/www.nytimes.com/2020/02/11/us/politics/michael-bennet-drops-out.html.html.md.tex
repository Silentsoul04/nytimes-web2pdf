\section{Michael Bennet Drops Out of the 2020 Presidential
Race}\label{michael-bennet-drops-out-of-the-2020-presidential-race}}

Mr. Bennet, a senator from Colorado, took a middle path in the race for
the Democratic nomination. He failed to make gains in the polls and with
donors.

Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who campaigned for president on a
promise to fix a broken Washington, ended his bid for the Democratic
nomination on Tuesday after a dismal showing in the New Hampshire
primary.

Mr. Bennet had staked all his hopes on New Hampshire, holding 50 town
hall events there in the 10 weeks leading up to the primary and
campaigning exclusively there in the final stretch, even on the night of
the Iowa caucuses.

But early results showed him with only 0.3 percent of the vote. Write-in
candidates had more.

``I feel nothing but joy tonight as we conclude this campaign and this
chapter,'' Mr. Bennet tweeted after announcing his departure. ``Tonight
wasn't our night. But New Hampshire, you may see me once again.''

\begin{quote}
I love our country. I love the idea of democracy. And I want to pass it
on to the next generation.

I feel nothing but joy tonight as we conclude this campaign and this
chapter.

Tonight wasn't our night. But New Hampshire, you may see me once again.

--- Michael Bennet (@MichaelBennet)

Mr. Bennet, 55, a former school superintendent, managed to raise his
national profile during his bid, but he paddled along while others sped
ahead. His bet was that a grass-roots campaign could lift him: dozens of
town hall events, unscreened audience questions, direct contact with
voters.

But he failed to register in polls, which kept him out of every debate
after July, and he crisscrossed primary states with a staff far smaller
than some of his opponents.

He was also hampered by his late entry: He
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/michael-bennet-president-2020.html}{joined
a Democratic field} that had already swelled to 20 candidates. Just as
he was set to declare his candidacy, he was diagnosed with prostate
cancer and paused to undergo surgery before announcing a run for the
White House.

Mr. Bennet took a middle path in the race, and
\href{https://coloradosun.com/2019/07/31/michael-bennet-president-2020-democratic-primary/}{often
warned} that the Democratic Party was at risk of moving too far to the
left. On health care, he touted his Medicare-X health plan, which would
build on the Affordable Care Act but not upend the current system, a
contrast to more progressive proposals. On immigration, he opposed
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/border-crossing-decriminalization.html}{decriminalizing
illegal border crossings}, while candidates like Senator Elizabeth
Warren and Juli√°n Castro, the former housing secretary who has since
left the race, said they supported such a move.

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

He argued that his ``\href{https://michaelbennet.com/RealDeal/}{Real
Deal}'' agenda was more broadly appealing than other candidates'
platforms, and leaned hard on an endorsement from James Carville, the
lead strategist behind Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, who said he was
scared that the other Democratic candidates could not defeat President
Trump.

Mr. Bennet's pitch was, more than anything, a return to normalcy. ``If
you elect me president, I promise you won't have to think about me for
two weeks at a time,''
\href{https://twitter.com/MichaelBennet/status/1158806845953323008?s=20}{he
tweeted in August}.

He had a small breakout moment in early January, before his campaign
announcement, when he gave a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78dsjOIE5L8\&feature=youtu.be}{fiery
speech} on the Senate floor, excoriating his Republican colleague Ted
Cruz and shouting repeatedly as he accused Mr. Cruz of shedding
``crocodile tears'' over unpaid government workers. The speech was
viewed millions of times online, but it failed to gain him the support
he needed.

Mr. Bennet's maternal grandparents were immigrants who fled the Warsaw
Ghetto, eventually moving to New York. As a senator, he was best known
for helping to craft a sweeping immigration reform bill in 2013. The
legislation, which would have provided more than \$46 billion to bolster
border security while also carving a path to citizenship, passed in the
Senate but never made it to the House.

Mr. Bennet's younger brother, James, is the editorial page editor of The
New York Times. Last year,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/business/media/james-michael-bennet-new-york-times.html}{The
Times said} in a statement that James Bennet would recuse himself ``from
any work generated by the opinion desk related to the 2020 presidential
election.'' The arrangement was expected to last for as long as Michael
Bennet was a candidate in the race.
