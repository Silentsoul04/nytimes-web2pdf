# Deval Patrick, Latecomer to the 2020 Race, Drops Out

The former Massachusetts governor had a compelling life story and an

Former Gov. [Deval
Patrick](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/deval-patrick.html)
of Massachusetts dropped out of the Democratic presidential race on
Wednesday, just three months after entering it, ending a last-minute
campaign that seemed to fizzle out almost as soon as it had begun.

Mr. Patrick had hoped to capture delegates in his neighboring state of
New Hampshire and to carve away former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)’s
support among black voters in South Carolina. But while Mr. Biden has
lost support, Mr. Patrick did not gain any. In the New Hampshire primary
on Tuesday, [he received less than 0.5 percent of the
vote](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/11/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-primary-election.html).

“I believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being
able to deliver better outcomes,” he said in a message to supporters.
“But the vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to
create the practical wind at the campaign’s back to go on to the next
round of voting.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Patrick was the third candidate to end his campaign after the New
Hampshire primary, following the entrepreneur [Andrew
Yang](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/andrew-yang-drops-out.html)
and Senator [Michael
Bennet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/michael-bennet-drops-out.html)
of Colorado, both of whom dropped out late Tuesday night.

In South Carolina, local Democratic officials said that while Mr.
Patrick had generated enthusiasm among some older black Democrats, who
remembered him as the second black elected governor in history, he had
little name recognition among younger voters.

And in a significant setback, he failed to secure a spot on the ballot
in Michigan, which will hold its primary on March 10 and will be a key
battleground if the race is undecided after Super Tuesday, one week
earlier. The Michigan Bureau of Elections concluded that Mr. Patrick had
entered the race too late to be automatically included on the ballot,
and that efforts by his supporters to collect enough signatures had
[fallen
short](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/122719_Patrick_Staff_Report_Final_Draft_674771_7.pdf).

## Who’s Running for President in 2020?

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Patrick [began his
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020-president.html)
on Nov. 14, reversing his decision a year earlier not to run. By the
time he entered, other candidates had a huge head start. Four debates
had already passed.

He cast himself as the candidate best suited to unite moderates and
progressives amid worries that none of the contenders already in the
field would be able to build a coalition capable of defeating President
Trump. His stump speeches drew from his compelling life story — he grew
up in poverty on Chicago’s South Side before ascending to the upper
echelons of business and politics.

But Mr. Patrick also came to the campaign with some potential baggage,
given a growing progressive movement in the Democratic Party that is
deeply suspicious of big business. His career included positions as
corporate counsel at Texaco and, more recently, as a managing director
at Bain Capital, a private equity firm.

And, unlike [Michael R.
Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html),
the billionaire former mayor of New York City who was also a latecomer
to the race, Mr. Patrick did not have enough of a personal fortune to
finance his own campaign. There was also little evidence that he had a
donor base large enough to make up for months of lost fund-raising.

In his message to supporters on Wednesday, Mr. Patrick expressed
irritation at the focus on the timing of his campaign.

“Many in the media have noted that I entered the race ‘late,’” he said.
“As a direct and limiting consequence, I’ve met many people on the
campaign trail who lament how they wished I had entered the race sooner.
As I hope you know, I entered this race when I could, and not a moment
before I should have. More importantly, I entered the race months before
anyone had cast a
vote.”
