# Harvard and Yale Ensnared in Education Dept. Crackdown on Foreign Funding

</div>

The department told the Ivy League universities to hand over records on
millions of dollars in gifts, grants and contracts from foreign
countries, including China, Iran and Russia.

WASHINGTON — A federal crackdown on universities that fail to disclose
donations and contracts from foreign governments has ensnared Harvard
and Yale, [the Education Department
said](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USED/bulletins/27b7801)
on Wednesday.

In letters to the schools on Tuesday, the department wrote that it was
investigating whether the two Ivy League universities had failed to
report at least $375 million **** from countries including China, Iran,
Russia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The department is seeking extensive
records related to grants, gifts, contracts and overseas programming.

In a [letter to
Harvard](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/harvard-20200211.pdf),
the department said it was “aware of information suggesting Harvard
University lacks appropriate institutional controls,” and as a result,
the university’s reports to Washington may not include or fully reflect
“all reportable gifts” and contracts “from or with foreign sources.”

In the case of Yale, [officials
wrote](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/yale-20200211.pdf) that
although the university had “a considerable presence abroad, represented
by sites in dozens of cities and countries,” it appeared to have “failed
to report a single foreign source gift or contract in 2014, 2015, 2016
and 2017.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Education Department zeroed in on records related to two Chinese
telecommunications companies,
[Huawei](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/white-house-huawei-back-door.html)
and [ZTE](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/business/what-is-zte.html),
that the Trump administration has labeled security risks or sanctions
violators. The [Russian computer security firm Kaspersky
Lab](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/us/politics/kaspersky-lab-antivirus-federal-government.html)
has also fallen under suspicion. The letters also named the Skolkovo
Foundation of Russia, the Iran-linked Alavi Foundation and the Qatar
National Research Fund, among other organizations.

The inquiry was first [reported by The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/education-department-investigating-harvard-yale-over-foreign-funding-11581539042).

“This is about transparency,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a
statement. “If colleges and universities are accepting foreign money and
gifts, their students, donors and taxpayers deserve to know how much and
from whom. Moreover, it’s what the law requires.”

Jonathan Swain, a Harvard spokesman, confirmed that the university was
informed on Tuesday of the records request.

“We’re reviewing it and beginning to start to compile our response to
the Department of Education, which is going to take some time,” he said.

Karen Peart, the director of Yale’s media relations, also confirmed that
the university had received the request on Tuesday.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are reviewing the request and preparing to respond to it,” she said
in a written statement.

The letter to Harvard appears to have been prompted in part by an
investigation into Charles M. Lieber, the chairman of the university’s
chemistry department, who was [charged with lying to federal
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/charles-lieber-harvard.html)
about grants he had received from China. **** The Education Department
request asks for all records regarding Dr. Lieber’s Chinese benefactors,
the Thousand Talents recruitment program and the Wuhan University of
Technology.

Dr. Lieber was arrested on Jan. 28 and released early this month on $1
million bond.

But the inquiry is also part of a broad crackdown that began last summer
and was designed to force more scrutiny on funding for U.S. higher
education institutions from countries that are often at odds with
American policies but eager to tap the country’s brightest minds.

The Education Department said Wednesday that since July, its enforcement
efforts have prompted the reporting of about $6.5 billion in undisclosed
foreign gifts, grants and contracts. Ten schools — Boston University,
Carnegie Mellon, the University of Chicago, the University of Colorado
at Boulder, Cornell, M.I.T., the University of Pennsylvania, Texas A\&M,
the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Yale — declared
approximately $3.6 billion in previously unreported foreign gifts.

The department [announced in June that it was
investigating](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-13904.pdf?utm_source=federalregister.gov&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list)
whether Cornell, Georgetown, Rutgers and Texas A\&M were fully complying
with a federal law that required colleges to report all gifts and
contracts from foreign sources that exceeded $250,000. In letters sent
to the universities in July, department officials wrote that they were
seeking records dating as far back as nine years, outlining agreements,
communication and financial transactions with entities and governments
in countries such as China, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The federal government demanded thousands of records that could reveal
millions of dollars in foreign aid for campus operations overseas,
academic research and other cultural and academic partnerships.

The investigations have caused friction between the Education
Department[and several higher education
groups](https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Letter-ED-Associations-Response-on-Section-117.pdf),
which have urged the department to clarify the rules around an obscure
provision, called Section 117, in the Higher Education Act. The
provision requires colleges to report all gifts and contracts from
foreign sources that exceed $250,000.

Education Department officials revealed last February in [congressional
testimony](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-02-28%20Zais%20Testimony%20-%20PSI.pdf)
that fewer than 3 percent of 3,700 higher education institutions that
receive foreign funding reported receiving foreign gifts or contracts
exceeding $250,000.

“Unfortunately, the more we dig, the more we find that too many are
underreporting or not reporting at all,” Ms. DeVos said. “We will
continue to hold colleges and universities accountable and work with
them to ensure their reporting is full, accurate and transparent, as
required by the law.”
