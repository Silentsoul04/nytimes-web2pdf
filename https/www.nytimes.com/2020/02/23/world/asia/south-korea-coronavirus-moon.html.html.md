SEOUL, South Korea — As South Korea struggles to contain a [snowballing
coronavirus
outbreak](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/asia/daegu-south-korea-coronavirus.html),
its president on Sunday raised the country’s alert
level<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>to the highest for the
first time in a decade, which empowered the government to lock down
cities, bar visitors from China and unilaterally restrict the movement
of people.

In raising the alert level, President Moon Jae-in is effectively
acknowledging that the virus is threatening to spin out of control,
after [the number of
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps.html)
has jumped to 763 in a few days and the death toll has risen to six.

The world is closely watching South Korea, concerned that it has become
another hot spot of infection outside China. Emerging outbreaks in South
Korea, Iran and Italy have provoked fear that the epidemic could turn
into a global pandemic, as countries impose [more travel
restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/21/business/coronavirus-airline-travel.html)
and containment measures.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The United States has raised its travel advisories for South Korea and
Japan, warning about “sustained community spread.” Israel denied entry
to 130 South Koreans on board a Korean Air flight that landed in Tel
Aviv on Saturday, forcing them to return home on the same plane.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent days, the South Korean government has shut day care centers,
banned outdoor rallies and postponed the reopening of schools in early
March. Churches are asking congregants to stay home and pray online
instead.

But Mr. Moon said South Korea faced a “wholly different situation” after
the quickly expanding outbreak of the virus among members of a
[Shincheonji Church of
Jesus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html)
in Daegu, South Korea’s fourth-largest city, 180 miles southeast of
Seoul. More than half of all the patients in the country are either
members of Shincheonji or their relatives and other contacts.

In Daegu, shopping districts, supermarkets and parks were empty as the
government asked citizens to stay home.

On Sunday, South Korean officials said they had no immediate plan to bar
Chinese visitors — as some conservative news outlets and other critics
have demanded — or lock down any cities. But by putting the country on
the highest alert, they showed their resolve to take more aggressive
steps if needed.

This is the first time since 2009 that the country has been put on the

“We should not be bound by regulations, nor should we shy away from
unprecedented strong measures,” Mr. Moon said at an emergency government
meeting on Sunday.

The alert, known as Level 4, will allow the government to allocate more
money for fighting the virus and make it easier for health officials to
acquire the personal data of people suspected of being infected, as well
as outlaw religious and other
gatherings.

It will also empower health officials to control air, train and other

Health officials hope that the number of new patients connected to
Shincheonji will drop significantly within a week or so. They have
already screened most members of the church showing potential symptoms,
and many have been tested for the virus.

“We are faced with a watershed moment in the case of the coronavirus,”
Mr. Moon said. “The coming few days will be a critical time for us. This

Until now, South Korean officials had been reluctant to raise the alert
level, worried that such a drastic measure would hurt the country’s
already slowing economy, as well as undermine its image as a country
safe for travel. In China where the virus originated, the economy has
come to a standstill, while the country has been essentially cut off
from the rest of the world.

South Korea’s economic troubles have deepened in recent weeks, with
exports to China, its biggest trading partner, sharply dropping because
of the outbreak. South Korean auto and other companies that rely on
parts from China have also suffered.

Despite its extensive ties with China, South Korea had initially
appeared to cope well in containing the spread of the coronavirus. After
reporting its first case on Jan. 20, the number of patients remained
low. By Feb. 15, the country had 28 cases and no
deaths.

A few days later, the situation began to unravel, when an infected

Daegu, a city of 2.4 million. Since then, the number of patients has
exploded, mostly among members of Christian church and people connected
to
them.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

For now, the outbreak has been largely limited to Daegu and the
surrounding North Kyongsang Province, which account for the majority of
the infections. But several new cases have emerged in towns across South
Korea, most of them Shincheonji worshipers who have attended church
services in Daegu or people who have traveled to the city or have met
people from there.

“A large number of people gathered in a very closed space, holding their
prayer services together for one to two hours,” said Jung Eun-kyeong,
director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
referring to the Shincheonji church. “In such an environment, it was
likely that even a few patients spread the disease to many people.”

Although health officials have frantically tried to track down church
members and direct contacts, they acknowledged that it had become
increasingly hard to establish the chain of transmissions once the
community spread began. Shincheonji worshipers have been noted for their
secrecy, often hiding their membership even to their parents, said
former members and experts on religious sects.

In their efforts to contain the outbreak, officials have designated
coronavirus-only hospitals and have required all people visiting regular
hospitals with respiratory symptoms to be tested for the virus. With
some towns fearing a lack of hospital beds, the government recently
expedited the approval of newly built hospital wards so they could be
quickly used to accommodate more patients.

Subway stations, coffee shops and movie theaters were all required to
install hand sanitizers for customers to use. The government also
empowered doctors to order a coronavirus test even if a patient doesn’t
want it.

During a telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday,
President Moon sympathized with Beijing’s efforts to battle the virus,
saying that “China’s difficulties are our own
difficulties.”

More than 10,000 Chinese students are expected to return to South Korea
in the coming week after winter vacations, as their South Korean
universities are scheduled to reopen in early March. That has raised
fears among some South Koreans.

On Sunday, officials said the Chinese students will be asked not to come
to school for two weeks, officials said. The government also changed the
opening day of kindergartens and high schools, to March 9, from March 2.

“We don’t agree with the argument that we are trying to catch mosquitoes
while keeping the windows open,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said
last week, dismissing the demand for a ban on Chinese visitors, as the
United States and dozens of other countries have done. He said more
people have been infected by South Koreans’ returning from China than by
Chinese visitors.

The raising of the alert level came a day after thousands of older
Christian activists dismissed his government’s appeals not to gather in
large groups and pressed ahead with their weekly anti-government
protest. They accused Mr. Moon of mismanaging the economy and being too
friendly toward North Korea and China. At the protest, most of the
participants wore masks but loudly chanted antigovernment slogans and
“Amens.”

“We will defend South Korea even if we get infected with the virus and
die,” said [the Rev. Jun
Kwang-hoon](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/world/asia/jun-kwang-hoon-pastor-.html),
who had organized the rally, shouted at the cheering crowd. “Those of
you who are here are true Christians. Even if we contract the virus, the
Lord will cure us.”
