Frank Wucinski and his 3-year-old daughter, Annabel, are among the
dozens of Americans the government has flown back to the country from
Wuhan, China, and put under quarantine to check for signs of
coronavirus.

Now they are among what could become a growing number of families hit
with surprise medical bills related to government-mandated actions.

Mr. Wucinski, a Pennsylvania native who has lived in China for years,
accepted the U.S. government’s offer to evacuate from Wuhan with Annabel
in early February as the new coronavirus spread. His wife, who is not an
American citizen and remains in China, developed pneumonia that doctors
think resulted from Covid-19, the disease caused by the respiratory
virus. Her father, whom she helped care for, was infected and recently
died.

The first stop for Mr. Wucinski and Annabel was a two-week quarantine at
Marine Corps Station Miramar near San Diego. During that time, they had
[two mandatory
stays](https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/girl-back-in-hospital-mcas-miramar-radys/509-c2a9e22e-0323-4152-be3b-3cf7720ebc3a)
in an isolation unit at a nearby children’s hospital. The first started
upon arrival in the United States, and the second was a few days later,
after an official heard Annabel coughing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The hospital staff were very nice, they brought us a lot of toys,” Mr.
Wucinski said. “Each time it was three or four days. I love my daughter
to death, but being in the same room that long, she is not a great
conversationalist.”

Both have repeatedly tested negative for the virus.

After their release from quarantine, Mr. Wucinski and his daughter went
to stay with his mother in Harrisburg, Pa. That’s where they found a
pile of medical bills waiting: $3,918 in charges from hospital doctors,
radiologists and an ambulance company.

“I assumed it was all being paid for,” Mr. Wucinski said. “We didn’t
have a choice. When the bills showed up, it was just a pit in my
stomach, like, ‘How do I pay for
this?’”

Mr. Wucinski’s employer, a standardized testing company, provided health
benefits when he lived in China but does not offer coverage in the
United States.

Patients in the United States [regularly
confront](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/opinion/surprise-medical-bill.html)surprise
medical bills that are hard to decode. Mr. Wucinski’s case suggests that
those held in mandatory isolation for suspected coronavirus may be no
exception.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The federal government has the authority to [quarantine and isolate
patients](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/historyquarantine.html) if
officials believe them to be a public health threat. These powers, which
date back to cholera outbreaks among ship passengers in the late 19th
century, are rarely used. They don’t say anything about who pays when
the isolation happens in a nongovernmental medical facility — or when
they’re brought there by a private ambulance company.

“There is no uniform practice,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of
global health law at Georgetown University. “They do have the powers,
but they’ve almost never used them in modern times.”

Few patients have been held in mandatory isolation, but the number is
likely to grow if the coronavirus continues to spread across the United
States. Eleven cases were
[confirmed](https://www.click2houston.com/news/texas/2020/02/29/11-cases-of-coronavirus-confirmed-in-san-antonio/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=snd&utm_content=kprc2)
in San Antonio on Friday evening. Earlier in the day, public health
authorities identified [a second case in
California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/us/coronavirus-solano-county.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
and [a first in Oregon in
which](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/02/28/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-oregon-4th-ld-writethru.html?searchResultPosition=9)
patients who had not traveled to an affected country became infected.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman declined to
comment on whether it would pay the bills of patients kept in mandatory
isolation.

Mr. Gostin worries that high charges for mandatory isolation could make
patients wary of seeking needed medical treatment.

“The most important rule of public health is to gain the cooperation of
the population,” he said. “There are legal, moral and public health
reasons not to charge the patients.”

These hospital stays could prove expensive. The International Federation
of Health Plans
[estimates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/005-LifeSciences/ifhpreport.pdf)
that the average day in a U.S. hospital costs $4,293, compared with
$1,308 in Australia and $481 in Spain. The hospital stays may be
especially costly for patients without health insurance or for those who
have large deductibles, which they must pay before their health benefits
kick in.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

He did receive a document upon leaving quarantine directing him to
contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an
email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.

“My question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were
mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?” Mr. Wucinski wrote in his
message.

He has not received a response, he said. When contacted by The New York
Times, a Rady Children’s Hospital spokesman said the physicians’ bill
had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible
for the charges.

“We’re in the process of assessing how the error occurred,” the
spokesman, Benjamin Metcalf, said. “We are working with government
agencies regarding billing for these cases.”

But the hospital bill represented only a fraction of those the family
received.

The ambulance company that transported the Wucinskis, American Medical
Response, charged the family $2,598 for taking them to the hospital. A
company representative declined to comment on the bill “due to patient
privacy concerns,” but said the company would look into the case.

An additional $90 in charges came from radiologists who read the
patients’ X-ray scans and do not work for the hospital. Having such

Mr. Wucinski is looking into whether he or his daughter might qualify
for Medicaid, the public insurance program that covers low-income
Americans. Some news outlets have [seized
on](https://nypost.com/2020/02/28/man-cleared-after-coronavirus-quarantine-cant-stop-coughing-in-tv-interview/)
the fact that he coughed enough on a recent television interview to
require water.

Mr. Wucinski recently noticed that his daughter is blinking a lot and
hopes to get the issue examined by a doctor, but is worried about the
charges they may face. He has wondered whether the stress of the past
month and the separation from her mother has played a role.

“I should take her to the doctor this week for a checkup, but we don’t
have insurance, so it’s just going to have to be cash,” he said.
