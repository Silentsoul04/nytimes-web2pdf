# Tom Steyer Drops Out of 2020 Presidential Race

</div>

Mr. Steyer, the former hedge-fund executive, exited the race after a
disappointing finish in South Carolina — a state where he had spent
considerable resources and pinned the hopes of his campaign.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

COLUMBIA, S.C. — [Tom
Steyer](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tom-steyer.html),
the billionaire former hedge-fund executive whose prolific campaign
spending [altered the Democratic
primary](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/tom-steyer-debate.html)
and allowed him to persist in the race, withdrew after an apparent
third-place finish Saturday night in South Carolina.

Speaking to supporters here, Mr. Steyer announced he was ending his long
shot presidential bid, but promised to continue working on issues that
are of great importance to him — environmental and economic injustice.

“We live in a country that is deeply unjust economically where rich
people have been profiting at the expense of everybody else,” Mr. Steyer
said, his voice cracking at times. “And I didn’t get in this race and
start talking about things to get votes. I was in this race to talk
about things that I cared the most about.”

Mr. Steyer, 62, had failed to capitalize on [his investment of millions
of dollars in South
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/tom-steyer-millions-south-carolina.html),
where he had pinned the hopes of his campaign. Despite spending more
than $191 million on advertising nationally, Mr. Steyer did not earn any
national pledged delegates in Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada, making
South Carolina something of a make-or-break state for his continued
viability. With nearly 90 percent of the votes counted here, Mr. Steyer
had garnered less than 12 percent of the vote, although he told
supporters he might pick up one or two delegates.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Steyer, who said he had always planned to end his candidacy if he
did not see a path to victory, declared that, based on the South
Carolina results, he did not see a path. In leaving the campaign, he did
not endorse another candidate, but pledged to work with the Democratic
nominee who he said would be “a million times better than Trump. Trump
is a disaster.”

Mr. Steyer’s departure from the race comes nearly eight months after [he
made a late entry into the
contest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-president.html);
his July decision to join the primary was a surprising reversal for the
longtime climate change and impeachment activist [who had previously
said he would not seek the White House
in 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-trump-2020.html).

But run he did. And although he continued to rail against President
Trump and call for action to combat global warming, Mr. Steyer fashioned
himself as a populist most concerned with attacking the corporate
interests that he said had developed a stranglehold over the American
political
system.

Nowhere was Mr. Steyer’s money more evident than in South Carolina. As
his rivals fought amid the crowded Democratic field to gain a foothold
in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Steyer’s campaign saw an opportunity to
saturate South Carolina voters with television ads and direct mail while
also building out a large campaign operation and making dozens of visits
to the state.

But Mr. Steyer’s campaign [went beyond even those
efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/tom-steyer-millions-south-carolina.html).
In a state where black voters comprised about 60 percent of the
Democratic electorate, Mr. Steyer’s campaign hired local
African-American staff members, used black-owned businesses to cater
events and provide other services and committed to spending about
$150,000 on advertising in the black-owned media.

The [heavy spending
strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/tom-steyer-2020-campaign.html)
— which presaged a similar approach taken by fellow billionaire [Michael
R.
Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html)
— appeared to be at least partially responsible for the boost in the
polls that Mr. Steyer enjoyed in South Carolina. In January and
February, Mr. Steyer [polled in the double digits several
times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/upshot/tom-steyer-poll.html)
in surveys of South Carolina voters despite having never performed that
well in dozens of other national and early voting state polls, save for
once or twice in Nevada.

But exactly [how Mr. Steyer wielded his financial resources also came
under
scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/politics/tom-steyer-james-clyburn-south-carolina.html)
and raised questions about whether he was seeking to gain influence
though his spending. For instance, Mr. Steyer’s campaign made commercial
rent payments to a company owned by Jennifer Clyburn Reed, a daughter of
James E. Clyburn, the longtime Democratic congressman from South
Carolina whose endorsement was highly coveted and eventually went to
former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html).

Mr. Steyer’s campaign also put influential black lawmakers on his
campaign payroll as advisers — [some of whom endorsed
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders-tom-steyer-south-carolina.html)
— and faced allegations of vote-buying, all of which raised concerns
among some South Carolina Democrats. Earlier in the cycle, [Mr. Steyer’s
campaign was forced to
apologize](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/tom-steyer-endorsements.html)
for what it said was “miscommunication” following a report that a top
aide had privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians
in exchange for endorsements.

Nonetheless, Mr. Steyer’s relative strength in South Carolina earned him
one final chance to make his case in front of a national television
audience at the debate in late February.

In the days before the primary, Mr. Steyer’s South Carolina staff had
swelled to more than 100 workers, many of them young and black South
Carolinians.

In appearances around the state, Mr. Steyer focused his appeal on the
economic and environmental injustices affecting African-Americans, as
well as an unequivocal pledge that the federal government would pay
reparations to the descendants of slaves if he were elected.

“We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the
last 400-plus years in America of systematic legal injustice,
discrimination and cruelty,” he said in Tuesday’s debate.

Mr. Steyer repeated the pledge at a fish fry sponsored by his campaign
in North Charleston on Thursday, where he also had recruited the black
radio personality Sheryl Underwood to speak on his behalf.

“I support his ability to speak to issues that our community needs
somebody to speak to,” Ms. Underwood said of Mr. Steyer. “I support the
coalescing of his resources with our resources to get more people into
the process.”

In the end, though, it was not enough, and, despite the onslaught of
spending, many South Carolinians viewed Mr. Steyer’s campaign as more of
a novelty than anything. Democratic political activists had coined a new
term to describe his foray into the state: South Carolina had been
“Steyered,” they said.

Stephanie Saul reported from Columbia, S.C., and Matt Stevens reported
from New York. Alexander Burns contributed
