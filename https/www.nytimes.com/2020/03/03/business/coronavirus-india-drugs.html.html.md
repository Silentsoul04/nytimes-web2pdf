# As Coronavirus Disrupts Factories, India Curbs Exports of Key Drugs

</div>

The outbreak has hobbled Chinese factories that supply India’s vast drug
industry with ingredients for antibiotics and vitamins, raising the
prospect of global shortages.

MUMBAI, India — The spreading
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) may soon
affect people’s health in a different way: The outbreak is now starting
to hurt the supply of essential drugs.

Drug makers are struggling to get vital raw ingredients for common
antibiotics and vitamins from Chinese factories, which were closed for
weeks as China battled to contain the coronavirus. Now, even as some of
the country’s factories have restarted, shortages of some drugs may
develop.

The disruption is being felt most acutely in India, where the
[authorities on Tuesday ordered the country’s vast pharmaceutical
industry to stop
exporting](https://dgft.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noti%2050_0.pdf) 26
drugs and drug ingredients, most of them antibiotics, without explicit
government permission.

That’s a problem for the rest of the world, which relies on India’s drug
makers for much of its supply of generic drugs. India exported about $19
billion of drugs last year and accounted for about one-fifth of the
world’s exports of generics by volume, according to the India Brand
Equity Foundation.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The shortage of Chinese drug ingredients is the latest example of the
global economy’s dependence on products made in China, [from iPhones to
auto
parts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/business/economy/china-coronavirus-economy.html).
Last month, Apple [cut its sales
expectations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html),
partly because production of its gadgets was ramping up more slowly than
expected as [China reopened its
factories](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html).
Much of the fallout may still be hidden and is likely to play out over
months.

India’s decision to limit drug exports was particularly delicate since
other countries rely on its manufacturers. On Tuesday, one Indian
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the issue, said the government wanted to ensure an
adequate supply of medicines for Indians before allowing exports.

Last week, the Food and Drug Administration warned that one undisclosed
drug was [already in short
supply](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/health/drug-coronavirus-shortage.html)
in the United States because of problems related to the virus outbreak.
The agency said it was watching about 20 other drugs whose manufacturers
relied solely on China for finished products or active pharmaceutical
ingredients.

Dr. Stephen Hahn, the head of the F.D.A., told the Senate Health
Committee on Tuesday that the agency had learned of India’s export curb
that morning.

“We’re working very closely to look at that list to assess how that will
affect the medical supply chain,” he said.

Lawmakers and Trump administration officials have been eyeing the global
supply chains that deliver drugs and other medical supplies to the
United States, wary that the coronavirus might lead to shortages of key
supplies.

In [a hearing in
July](https://www.uscc.gov/hearings/exploring-growing-us-reliance-chinas-biotech-and-pharmaceutical-products),
experts told the United States-China Economic and Security Review
Commission that America had a troubling reliance on China for its drug
supply — but that purchasing from India instead would also have its
downsides.

Rosemary Gibson, a co-author of “China Rx: Exposing the Risks of
America’s Dependence on China for Medicine,” who testified at that
hearing, said India also imported the bulk of the active pharmaceutical
ingredients, or A.P.I.s, that it used to manufacture drugs from China.
She added that sourcing those raw ingredients for drugs within India
would have implications for drug prices.

“The main reason that India wants to import A.P.I.s from China is
because it’s cheap,” said Ms. Gibson, a senior adviser with the Hastings
Center, a bioethics research institute. “If we choose to move from China
to India, even if it has the capacity to manufacture its A.P.I.s, it
would make it more expensive.”

India’s exports of the specified drugs are unlikely to be completely
stopped, said Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian
Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents most of the country’s large
pharmaceutical companies.

“It’s not a ban on export,” he said. “It’s a restriction. What we want
to do is monitor the movement of the drugs.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The antibiotics facing export limits are tinidazole, metronidazole,
chloramphenicol, erythromycin salts, neomycin, clindamycin salts and
ornidazole.

Other drugs on the restricted list include the painkiller acetaminophen,
the hormone progesterone, the antiviral drug acyclovir, and the vitamins
B1, B6 and B12.

India decided to restrict exports after a high-level government
committee analyzed the country’s dependence on Chinese drug ingredients
and concluded last week that 34 drugs had no alternative suppliers,
according to [a
report](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/covid-19-impact-government-panel-lists-essential-drugs-that-can-run-out/articleshow/74449944.cms?from=mdr)
on Tuesday in The Economic Times, a major Indian newspaper.

Indian drug makers depend on Chinese factories for important
ingredients, particularly for antibiotics and vitamins. Although Indian
companies had stockpiled extra ingredients ahead of the Lunar New Year
holiday, those reserves are now running low.

Krishnanath Munde, who follows the pharmaceutical industry for India
Ratings and Research, a unit of Fitch Group, said that for now Indian
manufacturers are getting by, in part by sourcing some ingredients from
European and Indian suppliers.

“But if this trend continues beyond March and the coronavirus spreads to
other regions in China and around the globe, we expect a disruption of
the supply chains,” he said. “Then everyone will be hit — every sector.”

Mr. Jain said that larger manufacturers had ingredient stocks to last
until May for most drugs, but some products could be affected earlier.
India’s scores of small manufacturers are already struggling to cope
with rising prices for some ingredients, such as those that go into
acetaminophen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Cipla, one of India’s largest drug makers, whose main generic products
include asthma inhalers and H.I.V. drugs, declined to comment on Tuesday
on the export limits but said in a statement that it had enough
inventory to last one to two months.

“We see shipments coming in,” the company said. “We have also secured
some additional inventory from vendors who have ready stocks available.
This will ensure that we do not face any disruptions in case the
situation does not resolve in the coming weeks.”

Over the longer term, the Indian government is considering pushing
forward with a long-stalled plan to make more drug ingredients
domestically and reduce the country’s reliance on Chinese suppliers.

“For any product, you cannot be dependent on one location,” Mr. Jain
said. “Health care security for every country is important.”

Karan Deep Singh contributed reporting from New Delhi, Katie Thomas from
New York and Ana Swanson from Washington.
