# ‘When Can We Go to School?’ Nearly 300 Million Children Are Missing Class

The global scale and speed of the educational disruption from the

HONG KONG — The coronavirus epidemic has reached deeper into daily life
across the world, with a sweeping shutdown of all schools in Italy, a
suspension of classes in India’s capital and warnings of school closures
in the United States, intensifying the educational upheaval of nearly
300 million students globally.

Only a few weeks ago, China, where the outbreak began, was the only
country to suspend classes. But the virus has spread so quickly that by
Wednesday, 22 countries on three continents had announced school
closures of varying degrees, leading [the United Nations to
warn](https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes)
that “the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption
is unparalleled.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Students are now out of school in South Korea, Iran, Japan, France,
Pakistan and elsewhere — some for only a few days, others for weeks on
end. In India on Thursday, all public and private schools through the
fifth grade [were ordered
closed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/world/coronavirus-news.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-4c11ca8b)
through March in the capital, New Delhi, affecting more than two million
children.

*\[Read: ‘*[*Proselytizing robots’: Inside South Korean church at
outbreak’s
center*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html)*.\]*

In Italy, suffering one of the deadliest outbreaks outside China,
officials said Wednesday that they would extend school closures beyond
the north, where the government has imposed a lockdown on several towns,
to the entire nation. All schools and universities will remain closed
until March 15, officials said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On the West Coast of the United States, the region with the most
American infections so far, Los Angeles declared a state of emergency on
Wednesday, advising parents to steel themselves for school closures in
the nation’s second-largest public school district. Washington State,
which has reported at least 10 deaths from the outbreak, has closed some
schools, while on the other side of the country in New York, newly
diagnosed cases have led to the closure of several schools as
well.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

The speed and scale of the educational tumult — which now affects 290.5
million students worldwide, the United Nations says — has little
parallel in modern history, educators and economists contend. Schools
provide structure and support for families, communities and entire
economies. The effect of closing them for days, weeks and sometimes even
months could have untold repercussions for children and societies at
large.

“They’re always saying, ‘When can we go out to play? When can we go to
school?’” said Gao Mengxian, a security guard in Hong Kong whose two
daughters have been stuck at home because school has been suspended
since January.

In some countries, older students have missed crucial study sessions for
college admissions exams, while younger ones have risked falling behind
in reading and math. Parents have lost wages, tried to work at home or
scrambled to find child care. Some have
moved<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>children to new schools
in areas unaffected by the coronavirus, and lost milestones like
graduation ceremonies or last days of school.

“I don’t have data to offer, but can’t think of any instances in modern
times where advanced economies shut down schools nationally for
prolonged periods of time,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at
the [Peterson Institute for International
Economics](https://www.piie.com/)in Washington.

In Hong Kong, families like Ms. Gao’s have struggled to maintain some
semblance of normalcy.

Ms. Gao, 48, stopped working to watch her daughters and started
scrimping on household expenses. She ventures outside just once a week
and spends the most time helping her girls, 10 and 8, with online
classes, fumbling through technology that leaves her confused and her
daughters frustrated.

Governments are trying to help. Japan is offering subsidies to help
companies offset the cost of parents’ taking time off. France has
promised 14 days of paid sick leave to parents of children who must
self-isolate, if they have no choice but to watch their children.

But the burdens are widespread, touching corners of society seemingly
unconnected to education. In Japan, schools have canceled bulk food
deliveries for lunches they will no longer serve, hurting farmers and
suppliers. In Hong Kong, an army of domestic helpers has been left
unemployed after wealthy families enrolled their children in schools
overseas.

Julia Bossard, a 39-year-old mother of two in France, said she had been
forced to rethink her entire routine since her older son’s school was
closed for two weeks for disinfection. Her days now consist of helping
her children with homework and scouring supermarkets for
fast-disappearing pasta, rice and canned food. “We had to reorganize
ourselves,” she said.

## Online and Alone

School and government officials have sought to keep children learning —
and occupied — at home. The Italian government created a [web
page](https://www.istruzione.it/coronavirus/didattica-a-distanza.html)
to give teachers access to videoconference tools and ready-made lesson
plans. Mongolian television stations are airing classes. Iran’s
government has made all children’s internet content free.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Students even take online physical education: At least one school in
Hong Kong requires students — in gym uniform — to follow along as an
instructor demonstrates push-ups onscreen. Each student’s webcam
provides proof.

The offline reality, though, is
challenging.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Technological
hurdles and unavoidable distractions<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>pop up when children and teenagers are left to their own devices
— literally.

Thira Pang, a 17-year-old high school student in Hong Kong, has been
repeatedly late for class because her internet connection is slow. She
now logs on 15 minutes early.

“It’s just a bit of luck to see whether you can get in,” she said.

The new classroom at home poses greater problems for younger students,
and their older caregivers. Ruby Tan, a teacher in Chongqing, a city in
southwestern China that suspended school last month, said many
grandparents were helping with child care so that the parents can go to
work. But the grandparents do not always know the technology.

“They don’t have any way of supervising the children’s learning, and
instead let them develop bad habits of not being able to focus during
study time,” Ms. Tan said.

Some interruptions are unavoidable. Posts on Chinese social media show
teachers and students climbing onto rooftops or hovering outside
neighbors’ homes in search of a stronger internet signal. One family in
Inner Mongolia [packed up its
yurt](https://m.weibo.cn/status/4478077407118555?) and migrated
elsewhere in the grasslands for a better web connection, a Chinese
magazine reported.

The closings have also altered the normal milestones of education. In
Japan, the school year typically ends in March. [Many
schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html)
are now restricting the ceremonies to teachers and students.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When Satoko Morita’s son graduated from high school in Akita Prefecture,
in northern Japan, on March 1, she was not there. It will be the same
for her daughter’s ceremony at elementary school.

“My daughter asked me, ‘What’s the point of attending and delivering
speeches in the ceremony without parents?’” she said.

For Chloe Lau, a Hong Kong student, the end of her high school education
came abruptly. Her last day was supposed to be April 2, but schools in
Hong Kong will not resume until at least April
20.

## A Burden on Women

With the closings, families must rethink how they support themselves and
split household responsibilities. The burden has fallen particularly
hard on women, who across the world are still largely responsible for
child care.

Babysitters are in short supply or leery of taking children from
hard-hit regions.

The 11-year-old son of Lee Seong-yeon, a health information manager at a
hospital in Seoul, South Korea, has been out of class since the
government suspended schools nationwide on Monday. [South Korea has the
highest number of coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-moon.html)
outside China.

Working from home was never an option for Ms. Lee: She and her husband,
also a hospital employee, have more work duties than ever. So Ms. Lee’s
son spends each weekday alone, eating lunchboxes of sausage and kimchi
fried rice premade by Ms. Lee.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I think I would have quit my job if my son were younger, because I

said.

### Schools Reopening ›

#### Back to School

Updated Aug. 17, 2020

The latest on how schools are navigating an uncertain season.

  -   - Universities across the country are facing [a rising demand for
        tuition
        rebates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/15/us/covid-college-tuition.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup)
        as students ask if college is becoming “glorified Skype.”
      - In Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest school district has
        [perhaps the most ambitious plan in the
        country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/los-angeles-schools-virus-testing.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup)
        to test for the coronavirus.
      - Families [priced out of “learning pods” are seeking
        alternatives](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/covid-schools-learning-pods.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - How are campus newspapers covering back to school? [We want to
        hear from student
        journalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/us/student-newspaper-schools-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).

Still, she feels her career will suffer. “I try to get off work at 6
p.m. sharp, even when others at the office are still at their desks, and
I run home to my son and make him dinner,” she said. “So I know there is
no way I am ever going to be acknowledged for my career at work.”

For mothers with few safety nets, options are even more limited.

In Athens,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Anastasia Moschos
said she had been lucky. When her 6-year-old son’s school was closed for
a week, Ms. Moschos, 47, an insurance broker, left her son with her
father, who was visiting. But if the schools stay closed, she may have
to scramble for help.

“The assumption is that everyone has someone to assist,” she said.
“That’s not the case with me. I’m a single mother, and I don’t have
help at home.”

Even mothers able to leave affected areas have trouble finding child
care. Cristina Tagliabue, a communications entrepreneur from Milan, [the
center of Italy’s
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/world/europe/24coronavirus-milan-italy.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article),
recently moved with her 2-year-old son to her second home in Rome. But
no day care facility would<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>accept her son because other parents did not want anyone from
Milan near their children, Ms. Tagliabue said.

The closings in Italy — which include day care in addition to schools
and universities — are likely to create problems for parents nationwide.

Ms. Tagliabue has turned down several job proposals, she said, since she
is unable to work at home without a babysitter for her young child.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“It’s right to close schools, but that has a cost,” she said. “The
government could have done something for mothers — we are also in
quarantine.”

## Beyond the Classroom

The epidemic has shaken entire industries that rely on the rituals of
students in school and parents at work.

School administrators in Japan, surprised by the abrupt decision to
close schools, have rushed to cancel orders for cafeteria lunches,
stranding suppliers with unwanted groceries and temporarily unneeded
employees.

Kazuo Tanaka, deputy director of the Yachimata School Lunch Center in
central Japan, said it scrapped orders for ingredients to make about
5,000 lunches for 13 schools. It would cost the center about 20 million
yen, nearly $200,000, each month that school was out, he said.

“Bakeries are blown,” said Yuzo Kojima, secretary general at the
National School Lunch Association. “Dairy farmers and vegetable farmers
will be hit. The workers at the school lunch centers cannot work.”

To blunt the effects, Japan’s government is [offering financial
help](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/29/national/science-health/shinzo-abe-coronavirus/#.Xl-dEBMzb-Y)
to parents, small businesses and health care providers. But school lunch
officials said they had not heard about compensation for their workers.

In Hong Kong, many among its [sizable population of domestic
helpers](https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-publications/english/1617rb04-foreign-domestic-helpers-and-evolving-care-duties-in-hong-kong-20170720-e.pdf)
have been jobless as affluent parents have enrolled children overseas.

Demand for nannies had already dropped by a third when the outbreak
began, because many companies allowed parents to work from home, said
Felix Choi, the director of Babysitter.hk, a nanny service. Now some
expatriate families have left the city rather than wait out the
closings.

“Over 30 percent of our client base is Western expat families, and I’m
not seeing many of them coming back to Hong Kong at this moment,” Mr.
Choi said. “Most of them informed us they will only come back after
school
restarts.”
