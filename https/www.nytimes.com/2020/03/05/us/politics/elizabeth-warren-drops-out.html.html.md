Ms. Warren, a senator and former law professor, staked her campaign on
fighting corruption and changing the rules of the economy.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — [Senator Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/podcasts/the-daily/warren.html?action=click&module=Briefings&pgtype=Homepage)
entered the 2020 race with expansive plans to use the federal government
to remake American society, pressing to strip power and wealth from a
moneyed class that she saw as fundamentally corrupting the country’s
economic and political order.

She exited on Thursday after her avalanche of progressive policy
proposals, which briefly elevated her to front-runner status last
fall, failed to attract a broader political coalition in a Democratic
Party increasingly, if not singularly, focused on defeating President
Trump.

Her departure means that a Democratic field that began as the most
diverse in American history — and included six women — is now
essentially down to two white men: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden
Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders.

Ms. Warren said that from the start, she had been told there were only
two true lanes in the 2020 contest: a liberal one dominated by Mr.
Sanders, 78, and a moderate one led by Mr. Biden, 77.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I thought that wasn’t right,” Ms. Warren said in front of her house in
Cambridge as she suspended her campaign, “But evidently I was wrong.”

Though her vision energized many liberals — the unlikely chant of “big,
structural change” rang out at her rallies — it did not find a wide
enough audience among the party’s working-class and diverse base. Now
her potential endorsement is highly sought, and both Mr. Sanders and Mr.
Biden have spoken with her in the days since Super Tuesday losses sealed
her political fate, though she revealed precious little of her
intentions on Thursday.

“I need some space around this,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Warren’s impact on the race was far greater than just the outcome
for her own candidacy. Her policy plans drove the agenda. She
effectively pushed [former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a
centrist billionaire, out of the
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-drops-out.html)
with a dominant debate performance last month.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And her ability to raise well over $100 million and fully fund a
presidential campaign without holding high-dollar fund-raisers
demonstrated that other candidates, beyond Mr. Sanders and his intensely
loyal small-dollar donors, could do so in the future.

## Listen to ‘The Field’: What Happened to Elizabeth Warren?

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Austin Mitchell and Jessica Cheung, and edited by Lisa Tobin and Mike Benoist

#### We went to Massachusetts to explore how the most diverse slate of candidates in U.S. history become a contest, again, between two men.

</div>

  - jessica cheung  
    Hello.

  - austin mitchell  
    Hello\!

  - astead herndon  
    Hey, how are you?

  - austin mitchell  
    Buddy.

  - astead herndon  
    Yikes. What a day already. Um —

  - austin mitchell  
    Yeah, what do you mean when you say, “What a day already“?

  - astead herndon  
    Well, we just reported that Elizabeth Warren is dropping out of the
    presidential race. We’re here in Boston outside of her house. Not in
    Boston, actually. Cambridge. Waiting for her to speak to a horde of
    media, both local and national.

  - speaker 1  
    We have —

  - speaker 2  
    I understand that, but I was here before you guys all jumped in
    front of me.

  - speaker 1  
    Because we just found out we have to move.

astead herndon

From The New York Times, this is “The Field.” I’m Astead Herndon in
Massachusetts.

  - \[cheering\]  
    Around 12:30 on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren came out of a
    side door of her house with her husband and her golden retriever and
    addressed the media.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    All right. So I announced this morning that I am suspending my
    campaign for president. I say this with a deep sense of gratitude.

astead herndon

It’s been two days since Super Tuesday, where Elizabeth Warren’s best
finish was in third place, including in her home state of Massachusetts.
That put her behind her campaign’s already lowered expectations and made
a gathering like today feel almost inevitable.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    For every single person —

astead herndon

She thanks her supporters and her staff and takes questions.

  - archived recording (reporter)  
    Senator, will you be making an endorsement today? We know that you
    spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Not today. Not today. I need some space around this.

astead herndon

And when it comes to why she has to drop out?

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    You know, I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that
    there are two lanes, a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the
    incumbent for, and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent
    for. And there’s no room for anyone else in this. I thought that
    wasn’t right, but evidently I was wrong.

  - archived recording (reporters)  
    Senator, why do you think —

astead herndon

And on the question of gender?

  - archived recording (reporter)  
    And I wonder what the message would be to the women and girls who
    feel like we’re left with two white men to decide between?

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    I know. One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls
    who are going to have to wait four more years. That’s going to be
    hard.

  - archived recording (reporters)  
    Senator, why do you think —

astead herndon

She gets emotional, but there are clearly things that she’s left unsaid.

But when you ask her supporters who have come to the house to watch this
speech, they go there.

  - warren supporter 1  
    Oh, I’m so sad. Yesterday, I so sad I couldn’t — I couldn’t move.

  - warren supporter 2  
    I’m frustrated, I’m disappointed, and sad.

  - warren supporter 3  
    I’m heartbroken that very clearly most qualified candidate is out of
    the race.

  - warren supporter 4  
    Sadly, too many people in this country aren’t ready for a woman
    president, which is an unfortunate thing.

  - warren supporter 5  
    Very disappointed, but I guess there’s never going to be a time for
    a woman. She’s my generation, and we’re not going to see it now.
    This was our — it’s not going to happen.

  - toddler  
    (CRYING) Grandma, Grandma, I wanna go home\!

  - warren supporter 5  
    Maybe her generation. All right, we gotta go. Look at this little
    girl looking at the doggie. She likes the doggie.

astead herndon

Today, millions of voters across six states will cast their ballot for
the two viable Democratic candidates left: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
What began as a contest with historic diversity, along racial and gender
lines, has now come down to two men, 70 plus, both white. And as someone
who covered senator Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, and with Warren
especially, who once led in national polling, I’m left to wonder how did
we get here? How did it end up this way?

  - \[doorbell ringing\]

  - astead herndon  
    Wow. Oh, those are one of the fancy doorbells, where you can look at
    it with your phone. Hello, how are you?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Hello, a party.

  - astead herndon  
    Hi, my name’s Astead. I’m a politics reporter at The Times.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Hi, nice to meet you.

  - astead herndon  
    It’s nice to meet you.

  - lyn licciardello  
    I’m Lyn. What did you say your name is?

  - astead herndon  
    Astead.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Astead?

  - astead herndon  
    Yes.

  - jessica cheung  
    I’m Jessica —

astead herndon

So the next day, me and producers Austin Mitchell and Jessica Cheung go
to North Andover, Massachusetts.

  - austin mitchell  
    Should we take our shoes off?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Oh, you don’t have to.

  - jessica cheung  
    You sure?

astead herndon

To meet with a pretty typical Warren supporter, Lyn Licciardello.

  - astead herndon  
    I only have one sock on.

  - lyn licciardello  
    It’s fine. \[LAUGHTER\]

  - jessica cheung  
    You have what?

  - astead herndon  
    I only have one sock on.

  - \[laughter\]

  - austin mitchell  
    How does that happen?

astead herndon

Her husband Tom is there, too.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Tommy, will you pour water, please?

  - tom licciardello  
    Yes, I knew there was a role for me somewhere.

astead herndon

And her cousin Kathleen.

  - kathleen lambert  
    Let me take your coats.

astead herndon

And we all sit down in their living room.

  - astead herndon  
    What do you do?

  - lyn licciardello  
    I am a nurse, but I teach exercise now.

  - astead herndon  
    Oh, very nice. Give me — what exercise?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Oh, well, I teach a class that’s about the first half is aerobic,
    and then there’s some stretching and strength training. It’s about
    an hour class at the senior center in Lawrence.

  - astead herndon  
    Awesome. How long have you been in North Andover?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Since 1949.

  - astead herndon  
    Hm. And when did you first notice Senator Warren?

  - lyn licciardello  
    I noticed Senator Warren years ago. I think it was around 2012. I
    happened to be reading the paper one morning. And I noticed that a
    congressman named Todd Akin had said a horrible thing about women
    and pregnancy, saying that if a woman were to get pregnant as a
    result of rape, then her body has a way of getting rid of that.

  - archived recording (todd akin)  
    It seems to me, first of all, from what I understand from doctors,
    that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has
    ways to try to shut that whole thing down.

  - lyn licciardello  
    And my eyes just flew open, and I said, oh my god, this man is in
    our Congress. I was flabbergasted, and I said to my husband, who is
    that woman? There was a — at the same time, I was not happy with
    Scott Brown, who was our senator at the time.

  - archived recording  
    He doesn’t stand up for women’s reproductive rights and economic
    security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women
    coverage for birth control or even mammograms. He had two
    opportunities —

  - lyn licciardello  
    And I said, who’s that woman that’s going to run against Scott
    Brown? I heard that a woman is going to run against Scott Brown.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    I’m Elizabeth Warren. I’m running for the United States Senate. And
    before you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads, I want to tell you
    who I am. Like a lot of you, I came up the hard way.

  - lyn licciardello  
    And I said, I have to do something to help her get elected.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    But Washington is still rigged for the big guys, and that’s gotta
    change. I’m Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message, because I
    want Massachusetts families to have a level playing field.

astead herndon

And so Lyn becomes a volunteer for the Warren Senate campaign.

  - lyn licciardello  
    I was always on board with Elizabeth right after that.

  - astead herndon  
    Why do you think you felt so drawn to Elizabeth Warren?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Because in many ways, she’s me. She’s me. She has the same feelings
    that I have. She’s actually very close to my age. She has a
    wonderful way of kind of looking into your heart and mind. She’s
    interested in you. She’s interested in the people.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Hi, I’m Elizabeth Warren. It’s very nice to see you.

  - speaker  
    I’m going to vote for you.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Wonderful, say that again. Fabulous. We’re here for the chicken.
    \[LAUGHTER\] Good to see you. I like your shirt. Very handsome.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Elizabeth has that heart. And, she’s brilliant.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    And despite the odds, you elected the first woman senator to the
    state of Massachusetts. \[CHEERING\]

  - astead herndon  
    How did it feel? I mean, she wins the race, obviously. How did that
    feel?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Oh, my god.
    
    It was so exciting. I still can’t say that without crying. It was so
    exciting.

astead herndon

So then, in 2016.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Well, I was for Hillary. Hillary, I was very invested in having
    Hillary be president. She had all the qualifications. She was more
    qualified than anybody who’s ever been president, in my opinion. But
    because she was a woman, I knew it would be difficult. But I still
    thought she could win.

  - astead herndon  
    Did you know people or did you hear people say, I won’t vote for
    Clinton because she’s a woman?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Not like that. But here’s what I did hear. I was talking to a woman
    who was kind of a stranger, but we were chatting. And we were
    talking about politics and about how we feel about certain things.
    So I guess it was like immigration, climate change and things like
    that. And this woman was on board with all of the Democratic ideals.
    And then I mentioned Hillary Clinton, and she said, “Oh, I hate
    her.” And I said, “Really? Because she’s the one who stands for
    all of these things that we’re talking about.” “No, no. I can’t
    stand her.” I said, “Well, why don’t you like her?” “Oh, I have no
    idea.” I said, “Is it because she’s an aggressive woman? Is she too
    aggressive? Is she too loud? Does she express herself too much?” And
    her reply was, “No. I don’t know why.” So like a minute later, I
    mentioned Elizabeth Warren. She said, “Oh, I can’t stand her
    either.” So I was like, “She agrees with you about everything\!
    All the things that you’re saying you believe in, she is promoting.”
    “No, well, I can’t stand her.” So, I know. I mean, I’ve been a woman
    my whole life. So I know very well that that is the reason. Even
    women will vote against women, because they’re women.

  - archived recording (joy behar)  
    There are people out there who have this idea that you’re not
    trustworthy, that they don’t like you for some reason. What is that
    about, in your opinion?

  - archived recording (hillary clinton)  
    You know, Joy, obviously I’ve thought a lot about it, because I
    don’t like to hear it.

  - archived recording (joy behar)  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (hillary clinton)  
    So I need to figure out what’s behind it. You know, I am perhaps a
    more serious person, a more reserved person than is in the public
    arena these days. So I think people then say, “Well, she’s serious.
    She’s reserved. Can I really like her?”

  - archived recording (joy behar)  
    But what is inauthentic? What’s inauthentic mean?

  - archived recording (hillary clinton)  
    I don’t understand that. I don’t understand that. Because I’ve been
    pretty much the same person my entire life, for better or worse,
    right?

  - archived recording (joy behar)  
    Mm-hm.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Clinton losing made a difference. Clinton losing did make it harder
    for me to think that a woman could win.

astead herndon

So this year, when Elizabeth Warren announces that she’s running, Lyn
has mixed feelings.

  - lyn licciardello  
    I love that people were getting to know her all across the country.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Hi.

  - archived recording (raelyn)  
    Hi, my name’s Raelyn.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Hi, Raelyn.

  - archived recording (raelyn)  
    I was wondering if there was ever a time in your life where somebody
    you really looked up to maybe didn’t accept you as much and how you
    dealt with that?

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Yeah.
    
    My mother and I had very different views of how to build a future.
    She wanted me to marry well.
    
    And I really tried, and it just didn’t work out. But I also know it
    was the right thing to do. And sometimes, you just gotta do what’s
    right inside. You gotta take care of yourself first and do this.
    Give me a hug. \[APPLAUSE\]

  - lyn licciardello  
    And it was a pleasure for me to see that, although I was a little
    bit worried.

  - archived recording 1  
    In the wake of her third place finish in Iowa and fourth place
    finish in New Hampshire, Warren said, “My job is to persist.” But
    persisting and winning are two very different things.

  - archived recording 2  
    Senator Elizabeth Warren, she came in fifth place in South Carolina.

  - archived recording 3  
    Elizabeth Warren trailing in fourth place in Nevada.

  - archived recording 4  
    I think the biggest question that Elizabeth Warren has to answer is,
    where does she win?

astead herndon

Lyn voted early in Massachusetts for Senator Warren. But in the days
leading up to Super Tuesday, she’s questioning her vote and wondering if
she did the right thing.

  - lyn licciardello  
    But I didn’t feel — I didn’t feel bad that I had already voted for
    her at all, because like she said, vote with your heart. And she was
    my heart.

  - jessica cheung  
    Did you know anyone personally in your life who were for Warren and
    then jumped ship?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Yes, my cousin Kathleen.

  - astead herndon  
    Raising her hand.

  - kathleen lambert  
    Yes, actually as soon as Buttigieg and Klobuchar backed Biden — and
    I was kind of waiting to see how it all shook out a little bit — I
    voted for Biden because we have to stop Sanders, in my opinion. But
    I would have voted for Warren, because I voted for Hillary.

astead herndon

As Kathleen is talking, Tom nods and raises his hand.

  - austin mitchell  
    Yeah, did you raise your hand, too?

  - tom licciardello  
    Me too. Yeah, yeah.
    
    Yeah, actually as the sole old white guy in the room, I, too, did
    vote for Biden, though I love Elizabeth Warren, and she would have
    made an extraordinarily wonderful president.

  - astead herndon  
    By the time Massachusetts was voting, if she looked more electable,
    if she was a front-runner, you all would have stuck with her?

  - tom licciardello  
    Yeah, you bet.

  - kathleen lambert  
    Absolutely, yeah.

  - astead herndon  
    Did you see when she — obviously when she comes out and talks at her
    house, did you see that?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Oh, yes. I was here in the living room. I was in my own living room
    listening to it, watching. And yeah, I cried through the whole
    thing. It’s heartbreaking.

  - astead herndon  
    Do you remember something she said that day that stuck with you or
    maybe caused you to feel that emotion?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Well, one of the things was that, you know how she talked about the
    pinkie swear that she does with the little kids? The first time I
    met her, which was way back when, before she was elected senator for
    the first time, she was doing that with little girls that were
    there.

  - jessica cheung  
    What is the pinkie swear? What is she promising girls?

  - lyn licciardello  
    She says that girls can be president. She gets right down to their
    level. She gets right down to their eye level and talks to the girls
    like that.

  - astead herndon  
    The race is now down to two guys, after starting with such a diverse
    field, gender ratio, all of that. How does it feel for it to be down
    to two men, when you had four women senators at the start, all of
    whom you liked?

  - lyn licciardello  
    I know. It’s sick, isn’t it? \[CHUCKLES\]
    
    You know, it was almost inevitable. I think people pan — not
    panicked, but I think that people are very, very concerned that we
    have to beat Trump.

  - astead herndon  
    But why does the feeling of “need to beat Trump” then translate to
    men? So you’re saying, I think a lot of people are scared, I think a
    lot of people just want to beat Trump, and that’s why it came down
    to two men. What is necessarily male about those qualities?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Because there are so many people in the country that just would not
    vote for a woman, like that woman that I was talking about before.
    And we really feel the need to prevail this time, especially.

  - astead herndon  
    So the idea that a woman candidate is a risk because of other
    people’s or the country’s sexism?

  - lyn licciardello  
    Yes, that’s how I feel. It’s a terrible thing to have to feel, but I
    do feel that way. Right now. I don’t think it’s always going to be
    like that, but I think it’s the way it is right now.

\[music\]

  - jessica cheung  
    All right.

  - austin mitchell  
    Thank you. You can go skiing now.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Oh, good. I’m sorry you can’t come with us. That was too bad.

  - jessica cheung  
    Tell us where you’re going.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Warren, Vermont. \[LAUGHS\]
    
    It’s very funny, because we have our ski place right next to our
    daughter and son-in-law in Warren, Vermont. And our son-in-law’s
    parents live in Warren, Rhode Island.

  - laughter

  - astead herndon  
    A Warren household to the end.

  - lyn licciardello  
    Yes.

astead herndon

It’s one voter’s view that sexism is what consumed the Elizabeth Warren
campaign. And certainly that’s one that’s popular among her most
die-hard supporters. But I’m wondering, is this the view inside her own
campaign? Do they think that the barriers that gender placed on them
were too big to overcome?

The same day we met with Lyn, we headed to the Charlestown neighborhood
of Boston, to Elizabeth Warren’s campaign headquarters.

  - astead herndon  
    It’s kind of like a warehousey building, nondescript, very on brand.
    There is a Dunkin’ Donuts right across the street.

astead herndon

To meet with someone who’s worked for the Warren campaign from the
start.

  - kristen orthman  
    I’m Kristen Orthman, the communications director for Elizabeth
    Warren.

astead herndon

As communications director, Kristen’s in charge of trying to best
translate the candidate to the rest of the country, particularly through
the media. And over the course of this campaign, we got to know each
other pretty well. Now that the campaign has ended, I’m wondering
whether Kristen will speak more candidly about what went wrong and about
what role gender specifically played in the campaign’s demise.

  - astead herndon  
    Is there something different about planning communications and media
    for women politicians?

  - kristen orthman  
    Yes.

  - astead herndon  
    \[LAUGHS\] Yeah, in what way?

  - kristen orthman  
    I think that there can be more caution when you’re working for a
    woman, because you’re viewing things through the lens of much more
    of “how will this be perceived?” And I think I’ve an appreciation
    for the challenges of the Clinton presidential campaign probably now
    than I did when I first started.

  - astead herndon  
    In what way?

  - kristen orthman  
    I think that the fact that there were stories when Elizabeth first
    ran — there was an infamous one like the day she announced.

astead herndon

This is December 31, 2018, when Warren first announced her intentions to
seek the presidency.

  - kristen orthman  
    Talking about like, I think it was the likability factor, her versus
    Hillary. Because they were two women who ran for president, two
    white women who ran for president that had blond hair. I mean, I
    guess I’m not quite sure what else warranted necessarily that.

  - astead herndon  
    So when it becomes clear she’s running for president, how forefront
    of mind was gender and the need to define her on her own, outside of
    Clinton or whatever terms?

  - kristen orthman  
    I think when you’re running for president, male, female, you have to
    be yourself. So what I was always, and what our team and her always
    wanted to make sure is, you are showing what you would hope is the
    truest version of yourself.

astead herndon

One of the critiques of the Clinton campaign, fair or not, was that many
voters felt like they never really knew her authentic self, that there
was a barrier between candidate and voter built up over all those years
in the public eye. So Kristen and her team tried to go in the opposite
direction. To distinguish Warren, both from Clinton but also from
everyone else.

  - kristen orthman  
    You know, she runs out on stage.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Hello, Indianola\!

  - kristen orthman  
    She dances.

  - archived recording  
    \[CHEERING\]

  - kristen orthman  
    She stays for hours for photos.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    So we just finished our event here in New York City, and I got a lot
    of notes and a \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - kristen orthman  
    She is just like the compassionate and joyful person that I know
    behind the scenes, was the person that was on a town hall stage. Or
    the fighter that I’ve also seen behind the scenes, and that many
    people saw, whether in the hearing room or otherwise, was the person
    on the debate stage. There is a vulnerability that comes with that,
    being a female candidate versus being a male candidate. I always was
    thinking through the risks in that, because I just knew that the
    “mistakes” that — I’m using quotes, because I don’t always they
    were, but they were perceived as mistakes — that female candidates
    make. It’s like a higher bar.

astead herndon

But to her, these risks were necessary components of running an
authentic campaign.

  - kristen orthman  
    Let’s do the things that have now become like signatures, were
    signatures of the campaign. It’s like, well, OK, she’s running for
    president to say something and do something. So let’s start doing
    that.

  - archived recording  
    2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is leading
    the pack when it comes to policy proposals.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    So I’ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America.
    I’ve got a plan to put $800 billion new federal into our public
    schools. Student loan debt, I’ve got a plan for that. And
    corruption.

astead herndon

She became known as the “I have a plan for that” candidate.

  - kristen orthman  
    The “I have a plan for that” just happened organically. Time
    Magazine put it on the cover, and that’s when it became more of a
    thing. I think it happened grassroots level before that. People
    start talking about it, because we were doing it.

  - astead herndon  
    There was like a whole meme section of like, Warren plan.

  - kristen orthman  
    Exactly, that’s what I mean. Yeah, exactly, exactly.

astead herndon

And by the end of last fall, Warren has crossed into front-runner
status. She’s leading in some national polls. But this is also about the
time that I noticed a shift in the race.

  - astead herndon  
    The primary change from a contest to ideas, to one of just as
    obsession about who can win. Do you think that’s true?

  - kristen orthman  
    I think the primary campaign has always been about who can win.

  - astead herndon  
    How does that impact the women, specifically, who are running?

  - kristen orthman  
    I do think I need distance in order to fully formulate, but I don’t
    think there’s any question that electability was viewed through a
    lens that probably hurt the women candidates. Because there was a
    perception that, after 2016, even though the female candidate got 3
    million more votes, is a woman not electable? And she has said
    before publicly that she would hear that from people in the early
    states. Like, “I’m worried about who can beat Trump.” But I don’t
    think all of a sudden in October it was like, “Oh, let’s make this
    primary about who’s going to beat Donald Trump.” That’s what it’s
    been.

astead herndon

I would largely agree. Certainly, electability has never been far from
mind for most Democratic voters. But as more and more people tuned into
the race, particularly around this time in the late fall, it shifted its
tone. Policy ideas took a back seat to that electability question. And
the candidates who had most clearly articulated their path to victory
started to rise, while Elizabeth Warren started to fall. This coincided
with rival candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar increasingly
casting Warren’s campaign as out of touch with the mainstream Democratic
Party and a real general election risk. And so to respond to that
scrutiny, the Warren campaign tries to reposition itself as a unity
candidate, someone who can actually bring all sides together.

  - astead herndon  
    There’s sometime during the unity candidate phase, where I did feel
    like it was different from the fight that we had heard before.

  - kristen orthman  
    Mm-hm.

  - astead herndon  
    How do you square those two versions that we did see just this year?

  - kristen orthman  
    I mean, I think you can both — unity doesn’t mean not fighting. I
    never didn’t think she was herself.

  - astead herndon  
    Take us into debate prep, for instance. Like, are you sitting there
    thinking, “We have to package a candidate, and there are concerns
    about how she’ll be perceived if she attacks too much or attacks too
    little.” Like, how much is gender a concern as you are thinking
    about the big national combative moments?

  - kristen orthman  
    Mm-hm. You know, I don’t want to make a big statement saying it’s
    easier for men to attack than women. I do think that there are
    probably greater consequences to a failed attack by a female than a
    failed attack by a male. Because obviously she had a debate
    performance a couple — two debates ago — where she doing some level
    of contrasts with Mayor Bloomgberg.

  - laughter

  - astead herndon  
    Understatement of human history.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    I’d like to talk about who we’re running against — a billionaire who
    calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And, no, I’m not
    talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.
    Democrats are not going to —

  - kristen orthman  
    She was really strong. She was tough, and she was dynamic.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant
    billionaire for another. This country has worked —

  - kristen orthman  
    They were contrasting with each other, and I think overall, it was
    agreed upon that she did well in that exchange.

astead herndon

But this came in Nevada, after two straight disappointing finishes in
Iowa and New Hampshire.

  - astead herndon  
    I mean, if we’re just going to take Nevada, I feel like that is a
    reason to ask why then and not previously? Were you all in rooms
    saying, “Well, we can’t attack yet“? One of things I remember from
    the second this campaign started was the way that supporters were so
    eager to see her cut down the Bidens and the Bernies and everyone
    else. It really didn’t get that payoff until Nevada.

  - kristen orthman  
    Mm-hm.

  - astead herndon  
    Why?

  - kristen orthman  
    So I like reject the premise of your question, because I think that
    you can be both advocating for yourself and creating contrast in
    ways that are not — that don’t always need to be how it happened in
    Nevada.

  - archived recording (moderator)  
    Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a
    woman could not win the election?

  - archived recording  
    \[LAUGHTER\]

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight
    with Bernie. But look —

  - kristen orthman  
    Now, some would say about — and this is what I heard frequently from
    reporters — “Oh, you guys are doing subtle contrasts. People don’t
    get that. People don’t know that.” I don’t necessarily agree with
    that. I think that you’re always looking at the bar of how do we
    balance advocating for yourself and your ideas versus contrasting
    with other people.

  - jessica cheung  
    You characterize Warren as contrasting with Bloomberg.

  - kristen orthman  
    Yes.

  - jessica cheung  
    Others might characterize that as she was attacking Bloomberg or
    going after Bloomberg.

  - kristen orthman  
    Yeah.

  - jessica cheung  
    And I wonder — yeah, I wonder if in your role, you’re choosing your
    words carefully, because you know that male politicians are treated
    differently or characterized differently than female politicians.

  - kristen orthman  
    I very specifically used the word “contrast.” So you are correct
    that I was specifically choosing those words. That was your
    question, right? Yeah.

  - astead herndon  
    There is a prevailing view from Warren supporters that gender was
    the foremost reason that she wasn’t successful in this race. Do you
    share that feeling?

  - kristen orthman  
    You think that’s a prevailing view?

  - astead herndon  
    Yeah, definitely.

  - kristen orthman  
    I just think I probably need more time to think about it. And I’m
    not trying to not answer your question. I think that there were —
    what she said yesterday around, like, there were basically two
    ideological, I think she called them poles. We could call them
    lanes. That’s not necessarily genderized. That is an ideological
    reason. And then I think electability, the idea of electability, was
    the other reason. Now, the idea of electability through the eyes of,
    “can a woman win“? Certainly, that’s gender. And I would add that it
    wasn’t just “can a woman win?” It was, can a non-white or non-male
    candidate win?

  - astead herndon  
    For that last point, it seems as if, then, this kind of place that
    we’ve ended, with two people on the ideological poles, both of them
    being white males, was that inevitable?

  - kristen orthman  
    I mean, maybe.
    
    I don’t know.

\[music\]

  - astead herndon  
    Yeah, we’ll see you later.

  - jessica cheung  
    Bye, we’ll see you later.

  - astead herndon  
    It’s so hard to get people — I think this is true. I mean,
    particularly being a male reporter asking women about sexism, you
    need people to — like, oh, were you thinking about this, then? But
    that’s not really how biases work, right? Like, does she say
    “contrast” and not “attack” because of sexism? Maybe. But it’s so
    deeply pervasive that it’s not something you actively think about as
    you’re doing it. And I feel like that makes sometimes the reporting
    challenge difficult, because you’re asking these candidates, like,
    wasn’t that sexist? Wasn’t that racist? Wasn’t that blah, blah,
    blah. And it’s like, maybe? I think there were a lot of challenges
    in the race, and ideology was one, name recognition is one,
    fund-raising is one, and sexism and gender pervades all of those
    things. And does it define all of those things? Maybe it informs all
    of those things is a better way to put it, but you know, how do you
    now?

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Gender in this race, you know that is the trap question for every
    woman. If you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone
    says “whiner.” And if you say, no, there was no sexism, about a
    bazillion women think, what planet do you live on? I promise you
    this. I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on.

  - archived recording  
    Senator, advice to your supporters right now looking for a
    candidate. What is your advice to them?

Ms. Warren’s political demise was a death by a thousand cuts, not a
dramatic implosion but a steady decline. In the fall, most national
polls showed that Ms. Warren was the national pacesetter in the
Democratic field. By December, she had fallen to the edge of the top
tier, wounded by an October debate during which her opponents
relentlessly attacked her, particularly on her embrace of “Medicare for
all.”

She invested heavily in the early states, with a ground game that was
the envy of her rivals. But it did not pay off: In Iowa, where she had
bet much of her candidacy — she had to take out a $3 million line of
credit before the caucuses to ensure she could pay her bills in late
January — she wound up in a disappointing third place.

Ms. Warren slid to fourth in [New
Hampshire](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/11/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-primary-election.html)
and
[Nevada](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/22/us/elections/results-nevada-caucus.html),
and to fifth in [South
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/29/us/elections/results-south-carolina-primary-election.html).
By Super Tuesday, her campaign was effectively over — with the final
blow losing her home state, Massachusetts.

The California results strikingly laid bare [the demographic cul-de-sac
her candidacy had
become](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-super-tuesday.html)
as Ms. Warren struggled to win over voters beyond college-educated white
people, in particular white women. She was poised to win delegates in
only a handful of highly educated enclaves: places like San Francisco,
Santa Monica and West Hollywood.

Though the campaign failed to generate the widespread backing necessary
to win the nomination, Ms. Warren retained a core of fierce loyalists
dedicated to her promise of wholesale change.

Her selfie lines were filled with well-wishers — young girls seeking her
trademark pinkie promise (“I’m running for president because that’s what
girls do”), cutouts of Ms. Warren’s likeness, and tattoos of her adopted
slogan: “Nevertheless, she persisted.” When her staff gathered Thursday,
many were clad in liberty green, the color her campaign adopted to
symbolize its togetherness.

“One of the hardest parts of this is all those pinkie promises,” a
visibly emotional Ms. Warren said, describing the “trap” of gender for
female candidates.

“If you say, ‘Yeah, there was sexism in this race,’ everyone says,
‘Whiner\!’” Ms. Warren said. “If you say, ‘No, there was no sexism,’
about a bazillion women think, ‘What planet do you live
on?’”

Before her exit, Ms. Warren accumulated the second-largest number of
Democratic delegates of any woman to run for president in history,
behind only Hillary Clinton, the 2016 nominee.

The party’s left lane is now clearer for Mr. Sanders. His supporters and
other progressives have spent the last two days gingerly reaching out to
Ms. Warren’s orbit and plotting in private conversations about how to
keep the two liberal standard-bearers aligned.

In January, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren clashed in a deeply personal way
after she confirmed a report that in a private meeting before the
campaign began, [he told her he believed that a woman could not win the
White House
in 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-woman-president.html).
During a debate, Mr. Sanders strongly denied having made the remark, and
Ms. Warren confronted him onstage afterward, accusing him of calling her
a “liar.” Relations have been chilly since.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In her call with Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren revealed so little of her
endorsement plans that a person familiar with the call remarked on her
“great poker face.”

Ms. Warren arrived on the political scene in the aftermath of the 2008
financial collapse and shot to stardom with her indictments of Wall
Street and unfettered capitalism.

In 2016, some progressive organizations mounted “Run Warren Run”
campaigns and Mr. Sanders floated her as a possible challenger to Mrs.
Clinton, but Ms. Warren declined to run.

Joining the 2020 race, she found a changed political terrain. Mr.
Sanders’s political stock had soared after his 2016 run, giving him an
immediate advantage in fund-raising and name recognition that
complicated Ms. Warren’s electoral path.

Mr. Trump’s election seemed to shock the Democratic base into an acute
focus on electability. Voters frequently second-guessed their electoral
choices as they tried to game out which candidate would be best equipped
to beat him.

Mr. Biden, in particular, has capitalized on this anxiety.

Ms. Warren’s allies and supporters said the electability question — who
would be the surest bet to defeat the president — disproportionately
hurt female candidates after Mrs. Clinton’s unexpected loss in 2016.

“All they heard all along was what a risk the women were,” said
Christina Reynolds, a vice president of Emily’s List, a leading
Democratic women’s group that endorsed Ms. Warren this week, only after
Senator Amy Klobuchar withdrew.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Reynolds said that evaluation was as wrong as it was widespread.
“The idea that that doesn’t hang around the women’s necks is crazy,”
she said.

Ms. Warren’s campaign was slow to directly address questions of
electability, seeming to believe her rise in the polls last year spoke
for itself. But as the calendar turned to 2020, it was apparent that the
issue was hobbling her candidacy as precinct captains and volunteers
warned Ms. Warren that it was what they were hearing about from voters.

Ms. Warren’s decline had begun in earnest at the October debate, when
she was pressed on how she would pay for Medicare for all and had no
answer. It took weeks to detail her plan, but by then her perceived
trustworthiness seemed to have taken a hit: The candidate with a plan
for everything did not have one to finance the biggest issue of the
campaign. (Mr. Sanders, despite releasing fewer details on paying for
Medicare for all, has faced fewer questions.)

When she did roll out details, she was criticized by those on the left
for compromising too much and by centrists for the sheer size of the
plan. The episode captured a fundamental pain point for her candidacy:
She was too much of an insider for those demanding revolution, and too
much of an outsider for those who wanted to tinker with the system and
focus on beating Mr. Trump.

As the race intensified in the fall, Ms. Warren was reluctant to strike
back at her opponents, even as they undermined her image. Pete Buttigieg
made deep incursions into her support among educated white voters but
she did not call him out [in earnest until
December](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg.html),
even as he flooded the Iowa airwaves with a moderate message
undercutting her progressive
platform.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While most campaigns used the megaphone of mass television ads to cut
through the media filter, Ms. Warren’s braintrust was cool to the power
of commercials from the start, preferring on-the-ground and digital
organizing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At times, Ms. Warren’s campaign did not reflect the urgency of a
candidacy trying to make history and promote a program of systemic
upheaval that included government-run health care, free public college,
student debt cancellation, breaking up Big Tech, universal child care,
and tax increases on the wealthy.

But after weak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Ms. Warren charged
into the February debate planning to confront Mr. Bloomberg in his first
appearance onstage. In Mr. Bloomberg, she found a rare rival she seemed
truly comfortable attacking, an embodiment of the influence of money.

She slashed. He stumbled. Mr. Bloomberg would never recover. Ms.
Warren’s donations surged, but her vote count did not.

She would bend a principled stand that week as well, [declining to
disavow](https://twitter.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1230633667195621376)
a new super PAC that would air nearly $15 million in pro-Warren
advertising, saying she did not want to unilaterally disarm. The irony
was not lost on her opponents: The anti-big money candidate wound up
with the biggest super PAC in the race to date.

In recent days, Ms. Warren had taken to speaking to voters directly
about their electability fears, imploring them to tune out pundits.

“Cast a vote from your heart,” she said Tuesday.

In speeches over the course of her campaign, Ms. Warren sought to
elevate the stories of women, often women of color. Her final major
address, in East Los Angeles on Monday, was devoted to Latina janitors
who organized for better working conditions.

Aimee Allison, the founder and president of She The People, a political
advocacy organization for women of color, praised Ms. Warren for her
campaign’s intentional inclusivity. “She really comes up as the first
white candidate for president who had an intersectional politics,” she
said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Ms. Allison acknowledged that pitch [did not find favor in the
broader minority electorate, even as it won plaudits from academics and
activists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-vote.html).

“Black voters really were looking for a return to normalcy,” she said.
“It was a rejection from what was perceived as riskier politics and a
broader and more courageous political vision.”

Ms. Warren’s supporters were devoted to making the party more
progressive to the end. In Illinois, where Ms. Warren’s campaign was
scheduled to hold a post-Super Tuesday phone banking session, staff and
supporters refused to cancel. They used their time to support Marie
Newman, the local challenger running against an incumbent Democrat
opposed to abortion rights.

“Our work continues,” Ms. Warren told her staff in the call informing
them she was quitting the race. “The fight goes on, and big dreams never
die.”

Astead W. Herndon reported from Cambridge, and Shane Goldmacher from New
York. Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from New
York.
