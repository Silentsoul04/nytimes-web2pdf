The two major candidates continuing to vie for the 2020 Democratic
presidential nomination met Sunday night amid the coronavirus crisis at
the CNN studio in Washington, without an audience, for what may be the
final debate of the primary season.

Here is how the candidates’ remarks stacked up against the truth.

What the Facts
Are:

## Senator Bernie Sanders said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had supported cuts to Social Security.

What Mr. Sanders said:

*“You were in the Senate for a few years. Time and time again, talking
about the necessity with pride about cutting Social Security, cutting
Medicare and veterans programs.”*

**True but lacks context.** Mr. Biden [at multiple points in his Senate
career](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/biden-factcheck.html)
praised measures to reduce the federal budget deficit, including some
that would have reduced the spending growth in Social Security. He has
also vowed to protect the program at other times, including in the
Senate, in a 2012 vice-presidential debate and in his current campaign,
where he has proposed expanding the program.

In 1984, Mr. Biden supported a one-year freeze to cost-of-living
adjustments in federal spending that would have applied to Social
Security. In 1995 he voted for a federal balanced budget amendment that
did not explicitly shield the program from cuts. He said in 2007 that he
was open to raising the eligibility age for receiving benefits from the
program, and he and President Barack Obama tried to negotiate a
so-called grand bargain on federal spending that would have reduced the
growth of Social Security spending over time.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What the facts
are:

## Mr. Biden criticized President Trump for his decision to develop a new coronavirus test when one was already available.

What Mr. biden Said:

*“No, the World Health Organization offered testing kits that they have
available to give to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy
them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we
had our own.”*

**True.** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did decide to
develop its own coronavirus test, despite the existence of one already
created by the World Health Organization. As The New York Times
[reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html),
the federal government “designed its own test as it typically does
during an outbreak.” That test, however, produced faulty results and
ultimately delayed local public health departments’ ability to test a
large number of patients for the novel disease. Meanwhile, the World
Health Organization made its test widely available, and [more than 60
countries](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166)
decided to use that product.

WHAT THE facts
are:

## Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders argued over the provisions of a coronavirus bill that just passed the House.

WHAT WAS SAID:

Mr. Biden: *“We just passed a law saying you do not have to pay for any
of this, period.”*

Mr. Sanders: *“That’s not true. As a matter of fact, that’s not true.
That law has enormous
loopholes.”*

**Mr. Biden’s statement was exaggerated.** The emergency relief package
passed by the House in a bipartisan vote on Saturday includes [several
measures intended to help families and
workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-bill.html)
including paid sick leave, unemployment benefits and food assistance.
President Trump has voiced his support, but it is slightly premature to
call this legislation “law.”

The
[bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Families%20First%20summary.pdf#page=7)
requires private insurers and government-run programs like Medicare and
Medicaid to cover diagnostic testing for the coronavirus “at no cost to
the consumer.” It also gives states the option to extend Medicaid
coverage and free testing to their uninsured populations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What the Facts
Are:

## Mr. Biden claimed he could immediately pass legislation to create a so-called public option that would allow all Americans to enroll in Medicare.

What Mr. Biden said:

*“A Medicare option. We can do that now. I can get that passed. I can
get that done, if I’m president of the United States of America.”*

**This is exaggerated.** Mr. Biden tried to argue that [his health care
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-health-care.html),
which would let Americans sign up for Medicare while leaving private
coverage intact, had a more realistic path toward becoming legislation
than [Mr. Sanders’s Medicare-for-all
proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all.html).
In truth, both policies would face long odds in Congress, where
Republicans currently hold a majority in the Senate and oppose both
ideas. Even if Democrats were to control both houses, the public option
would still be far from easy to enact into law: Many wanted to include
it in the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama, but
it ultimately fell out of the legislation after [intense
lobbying](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/us/politics/11health.html)
from the health insurance industry.

What the Facts
Are:

## Mr. Biden was wrong on the number of super PACs supporting Mr. Sanders.

What Mr. Biden said:

*“You get rid of the nine super PACs?”*

**This is exaggerated.** Mr. Biden was most likely referring to “[People
Power for
Bernie](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeoplesaction.org%2F2020%2F01%2Fnine-groups-that-endorsed-sanders-join-forces-to-drive-black-brown-working-class-and-young-voter-turnout-in-primaries%2F),”
a coalition of nine outside advocacy groups backing Mr. Sanders’s
candidacy and organizing voter mobilization efforts on his behalf. These
groups were labeled “dark money” by Pete Buttigieg, the former
Democratic candidate. Most of them others are [501(c)(4) organizations
or social welfare
nonprofits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-fact-check.html).

Beyond these groups, Mr. Sanders does have the support of a super PAC of
National Nurses United, the country’s largest nurses’ union. It has
spent over $750,000 in support of his candidacy, [according to the
campaign finance watchdog the Center for Responsive
Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?chrt=V&type=S).
(The center also lists three other super PACs that support Mr. Sanders,
but they have spent no money on his behalf.) In contrast, the super PAC
supporting Mr. Biden (Unite the Country) was created by his former aides
and has spent about $10 million on his behalf.

What the Facts
Are:

## Mr. Biden said both he and Mr. Sanders embrace the idea of a “green new deal” to address climate change.

What Mr. Biden said:

*“We both agree that we have a new green deal to deal with the threat
that faces humanity.”*

**This is mostly true.** The Green New Deal is a congressional
resolution that lays out an ambitious plan to fight both climate change
and economic inequality. It includes a goal of switching to 100 percent
wind, solar and other renewable energy by 2030 while providing a federal
jobs guarantee and Medicare for all. Mr. Sanders is an original
co-sponsor of the Senate version of that resolution, and incorporated
many of the elements of the bill into his climate plan, which he also
has named for the Green New Deal.

Mr. Biden has said in his climate plan that he believes the Green New
Deal “is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we
face.” But his plan puts $1.7 trillion into addressing climate change
compared with $16 trillion proposed by Mr. Sanders, and sets a slightly
later deadline — 2050 — for decarbonizing the economy.

What the facts
are:

## Mr. Sanders inflated the degree to which he and former President Barack Obama were united in opposition to an immigration bill in 2007.

What Mr. Sanders said:

*“That bill was opposed by LULAC, the largest Latino organization in
America. They called the guest worker program akin to slavery. The bill
was killed because it was a vote on the amendment. I think it was 49 to
48. You know who voted with me? Barack Obama.”*

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**This is misleading.** Mr. Sanders was referring to immigration reform
legislation in 2007. The bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate,
would have given legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants,
established a temporary worker program, strengthened border security and
limited family-based immigration in favor of a skills- and
education-based system.

Mr. Sanders was right that the League of United Latin American Citizens
said the bill would exploit immigrant workers. And he and Mr. Obama,
then the junior senator from Illinois, both
[voted](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00201)
for an amendment that would have scaled back the guest worker program in
early June 2007.

But later, Mr. Obama voted to invoke cloture — ending debate and
allowing the Senate to take a final vote on the whole bill — three
times, while Mr. Sanders [voted against it all three
times](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/1348/all-actions?overview=closed&q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22:%22all%22%7D&KWICView=false).
Weeks later, the Senate revived the legislation. Mr. Obama [again voted
to move the bill
forward](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/1639/all-actions?overview=closed&q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22:%22all%22%7D&KWICView=false)
while Mr. Sanders did not.

What the facts
are:

## Mr. Biden accused Mr. Sanders of voting against a Russia sanctions bill. Mr. Sanders said he voted against the bill because it included new sanctions on Iran that could undercut the 2015 nuclear deal.

What Mr. Sanders said:

*“It was undermining the Iranian agreement.”*

**True on both counts.** The argument centers on a vote that the Senate
took in June 2017 to impose sanctions on Russia for its interference in
the 2016 election. The bill also included sanctions on Iran, at a time
when the 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran was still fully in effect. (Mr.
Trump exited the agreement nearly a year later.)

The bill passed 98 to 2; only Mr. Sanders and Senator Rand Paul,
Republican of Kentucky, voted against it. In a statement after the vote,
Mr. Sanders said that “I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on
Russia included in this bill,” and that it was “unacceptable” that
Russia interfered with the U.S. elections “or anywhere around the
world.” But he said he was concerned that new sanctions on Iran “could
endanger the very important nuclear agreement that was signed between
the United States, its partners and Iran in 2015.”

Mr. Biden was a modest player in the Obama administration negotiation of
that deal — most of the heavy lifting was done by Secretary of State
John Kerry and a team of State and Energy Department negotiators. But he
supported it. In criticizing Mr. Sanders, he is essentially saying that
the need to punish Russia should have overridden the concerns about
undermining the Iran deal. Mr. Sanders came to the opposite conclusion.

What the Facts Are:

## Mr. Biden wrongly said Mr. Sanders voted against the auto bailout.

What Mr. Biden said:

*“Also part of that was bailing out the automobile industry. Saving
thousands of jobs. Tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against
that as well.”*

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**This is misleading.** Mr. Sanders actually supported the $14 billion
auto rescue plan in December 2008. “The problem is if you don’t act in
the midst of a growing recession, what does it mean to create a
situation where millions of more people become unemployed and that could
spread? And I have serious concerns about that. I think it would be a
terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls,” Mr.
Sanders told [Vermont Public
Radio](https://archive.vpr.org/vpr-news/leahy-sanders-reluctantly-support-auto-industry-rescue/)
at the time.

But the bill failed in the Senate, prompting the Bush administration to
propose using funding from the [Troubled Asset Relief
Program](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/TARP-Tracker.aspx)
— which passed in October 2008 to bail out Wall Street and which Mr.
Sanders opposed — to also aid automakers. Once the bailouts were lumped
together, Mr. Sanders [opposed the overall
package](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00005).
