## Joe Biden

Mr. Biden’s [commitment to choose a woman as his running
mate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html)
earned him praise, as did his [responses to questions about the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007035872/biden-pandemic.html).
But he also had some shakier moments, and some strategists thought that
given his solid lead in the primary, he should have focused more on
contrasting himself with President Trump than with Mr. Sanders.

> “.@joebiden is looking very good here. Strong. Command. Rising to the
> moment of crisis. Best he’s been in 11 debates.” — **[David
> Axelrod](https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1239347201995874309)**,
> director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and former
> senior adviser to President Barack Obama
> 
> “Smart of Biden to keep bringing the focus back to RIGHT NOW. This is
> a moment of urgency & folks are desperate for immediate solutions, not
> academic debates.” — **[Jesse
> Lehrich](https://twitter.com/JesseLehrich/status/1239348905965498369)**,
> former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton
> 
> “Joe Biden’s answer to the question on how he will get the support of
> Latinx voters, who have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders, was
> inadequate. Was it me or did it sound like he didn’t care that Latinx
> voters aren’t voting for him?” — **[Cristina
> Jiménez](https://twitter.com/CrisAlexJimenez/status/1239372196092489730)**,
> co-founder and executive director of United We Dream
> 
> “Biden has been surprisingly negative, given current polls & delegates
> & fact that coronavirus news is likely to overwhelm the debate & the
> primary. I expected more of a pivot to the general & more Trump
> attacks.” — **[Matt
> Grossmann](https://twitter.com/MattGrossmann/status/1239362292283826176)**,
> director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at
> Michigan State University

## Bernie Sanders

Commentators thought Mr. Sanders, too, had a strong performance over
all, but they did not think he changed the course of the race, which has
veered sharply toward Mr. Biden. He also drew some criticism for his
continued defense of his [controversial remarks about Fidel
Castro](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html).

> “Bernie Sanders had the better \#DemDebate performance tonight, but
> @JoeBiden won the debate by committing to a woman VP. The Democratic
> primary is over.” — **[Frank
> Luntz](https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1239371053383573505)**,
> Republican consultant and pollster
> 
> “On climate, there are a lot of people — especially young people — who
> simply want to hear @JoeBiden say that it is an existential threat and
> would be a sacred mission for his administration. @BernieSanders
> speaks in moral imperatives, and Biden responds in a programmatic
> way.” — **[David
> Axelrod](https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1239362267302498305)**
> 
> “I’m not sure what Bernie gains by the ‘sometimes dictators do good
> things’ defense.” — **[Carol
> McDonald](https://twitter.com/DCtwiterati/status/1239366512290521089)**,
> Democratic strategist and former deputy political director for Hillary
> Clinton
> 
> “That was Bernie’s best closing statement in any \#DemDebate this
> cycle.” — **[Laura
> Belin](https://twitter.com/LauraRBelin/status/1239370437425090561)**,
> Iowa political commentator

## Coronavirus

The first and most important subject Sunday night was the coronavirus
pandemic, which has [killed thousands of people
worldwide](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
and, in the past week, [shut down much of American
society](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa). The
candidates took different approaches: Mr. Biden emphasized his
experience responding to the swine flu and Ebola outbreaks during the
Obama administration, while Mr. Sanders argued that the pandemic proved
the need for programs like “Medicare for all.”

> “Sanders with a more coherent initial response on COVID-19 than Biden
> — and meets Dem voters where they are by criticizing the president’s
> response as insufficient.” — **[Dave
> Wasserman](https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1239342811578802176)**,
> editor at Cook Political Report
> 
> “People might get tired of hearing about the Ebola example, but the
> learned lessons from experience is critical to save lives — especially
> if we are dealing with something worse.” — **[Amanda
> Renteria](https://twitter.com/AmandaRenteria/status/1239345713831542784)**,
> interim president of Emerge and former national political director for
> Hillary Clinton
> 
> “Sanders doing a really good job connecting his core \#M4A \[Medicare
> for all\] message to \#coronavirus. A really good contextualization of
> how he will govern.” — **[Jess Morales
> Rocketto](https://twitter.com/JessLivMo/status/1239348017288839175)**,
> political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance
> 
> “This entire debate so far has really been a series of questions about
> crisis management, through the prism of coronavirus. In short, Biden’s
> answer is leadership. Sanders’ answer is ideology.” — **[Mo
> Elleithee](https://twitter.com/MoElleithee/status/1239349995675017217)**,
> executive director of Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public
> Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman

## Running mates

The most unexpected news of the debate came when Mr. Biden pledged
unequivocally to choose a woman as his running mate if he wins the
nomination.

Asked if he would make the same pledge, Mr. Sanders said he would
probably choose a woman but did not commit definitively the way Mr.
Biden had, saying instead that he would “in all likelihood” do so and
that “my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.”

> “My 7yr-old daughter just charged into the room: @JoeBiden just
> declared that his running mate will be a woman\! Did you hear that?\!”
> — **[María Teresa
> Kumar](https://twitter.com/MariaTeresa1/status/1239358896071942144)**,
> president of Voto Latino
> 
> “Biden commits to a woman VP on the stage. That was crucial and
> welcome. Bernie is offered the chance to commit and refuses to do the
> same. Why.” — **[Shaunna
> Thomas](https://twitter.com/SLThomas/status/1239358370299117569)**,
> co-founder and executive director of UltraViolet
> 
> “Only news out of tonight’s debate is that @JoeBiden committed to
> picking a woman as VP and @BernieSanders did not.” — **[Ben
> LaBolt](https://twitter.com/BenLaBolt/status/1239359314701086721)**,
> former spokesman for Mr. Obama
> 
> “The question itself implies there is a qualified woman who meets your
> standards out there. Hedging says you think there might not be. That’s
> the problem with Bernie’s answer.” — **[Jess
> McIntosh](https://twitter.com/jess_mc/status/1239362402887630848)**,
> SiriusXM host and former spokeswoman for Hillary
Clinton
