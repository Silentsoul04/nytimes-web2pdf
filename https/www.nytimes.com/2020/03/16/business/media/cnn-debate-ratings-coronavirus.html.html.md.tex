The Biden-Sanders matchup attracted 10.8 million viewers, down from
prior forums in Nevada and South Carolina.

Despite tens of millions of Americans hunkering down in their homes
because of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/live-coronavirus-news-updates.html}{the
coronavirus pandemic,} the CNN debate on Sunday between Joe Biden and
Senator Bernie Sanders attracted a smaller live audience than the last
two Democratic matchups.

About 10.8 million people watched the candidates spar inside a closed
Washington television studio, an unusual format without any in-person
spectators that was widely praised
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/takeaways-march-democratic-debate.html}{for
its substance and solemnity.} It was the highest-rated television
program of the night, just slightly ahead of ``60 Minutes'' on CBS.

But viewership fell short of the huge audience that tuned in for the
last two Democratic debates in Nevada (19.7 million) and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/business/media/democratic-debate-cbs-ratings.html}{South
Carolina} (15.3 million), according to Nielsen. The NBC News debate in
Las Vegas on Feb. 19, featuring Michael R. Bloomberg's debut as a
candidate,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/media/democratic-debate-las-vegas.html}{set
a record} for Democratic primary debates, and outscored the Grammy
Awards and the Golden Globes.

The ongoing public health crisis over the coronavirus has seemingly
outstripped even the presidential race in terms of Americans'
current-events interests. The Democratic field has also narrowed since
the debate in South Carolina three weeks ago, with Mr. Biden
establishing a consistent lead ahead of Mr. Sanders in polls.

The two-hour debate on Sunday drew 9.9 million viewers on CNN, the
highest rating for a debate hosted by the network this election cycle.
An additional 848,000 watched on the Spanish-language network Univision,
and 80,000 watched on CNN en Español. CNN said that its online
livestream attracted an average of 608,000 people watching each minute.

The debate was moderated by the CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper,
along with the Univision anchor Ilia Calderón. The Univision anchor
Jorge Ramos had been scheduled to moderate, but
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/cnn-democratic-debate-coronavirus.html}{he
recused himself} after saying he had been possibly exposed to the
coronavirus; Mr. Ramos has no symptoms and has said he feels healthy.
