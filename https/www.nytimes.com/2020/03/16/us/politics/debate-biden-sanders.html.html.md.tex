On Politics With Lisa Lerer

\section{The Coronavirus Debate}\label{the-coronavirus-debate}}

A crisis can provide a sharper view of how candidates approach the
problems facing the country.

It's a good thing that last night's debate wasn't taking place in
California, because both candidates would have been forced to violate
new state guidelines to attend.

On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Gavin Newsom
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/coronavirus-newsom-california-seniors-restaurants-bars.html}{called
for all residents 65 years and older} to isolate themselves at home.
Both Joe Biden, 77, and Bernie Sanders, 78, would have fallen into that
category.

I mention that new rule as a way of underscoring how quickly and
profoundly American life changed over the weekend, as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa}{the country
grapples with the spread} of the coronavirus.

Crises have a way of clarifying distinctions. In last night's debate, we
got a much sharper glimpse into how Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders view the
problems facing the country.

Both of the Democratic primary candidates dismissed President Trump's
approach as insufficient, embracing a much further-reaching government
strategy to try to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the
virus.

But the scope of their responses differed significantly. Mr. Biden
focused on immediate solutions, saying he would call upon the military
to help handle the situation and work to enact a
``multi-multi-billion-dollar program.''

The virus, as he sees it, is a short-term problem that requires an
American reckoning, but then life would return largely to normal.

``Regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis,''
Mr. Biden said. ``This is like we are being attacked from abroad. This
is something that is of great consequence. This is like a war. And in a
war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people.''

Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, sees the virus as a symptom of systemic problems
in American society like income inequality, the power of big
corporations and the demise of the working class. He offered a more
structural critique, rooted in the virus.

``As a result of the virus here, the coronavirus,'' he said, ``what we
have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how
unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so
little.''

Mr. Biden shot back: ``People are looking for results, not a revolution.
They want to deal with the results they need right now.''

The two-man, audience-free debate certainly led to a more substantive
discussion. There was no playing to the crowd or moderators dwelling on
candidates without a clear shot at the nomination (ahem, Michael
Bloomberg). Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders debated bankruptcy law, campaign
finance, climate change, immigration, Social Security, the Iran deal,
the Iraq war, abortion rights and foreign policy.

Mr. Sanders delivered a forceful performance, turning policy critiques
into questions about Mr. Biden's leadership and trustworthiness. Mr.
Biden's team appeared to expect a less aggressive approach from Mr.
Sanders. Anita Dunn, a top Biden aide, later described her candidate's
debate performance as ``graciously dealing with the kind of protester
who often shows up at campaign events, on live television.''

But none of the disagreements were particularly new. Voters paying
enough attention to understand the details of those policy-heavy spats
had most likely already settled on a candidate and which side of the
party's ideological divide they favor.

In that way, this debate seemed unlikely to inspire the kind of
fundamental shift that would be required for Mr. Sanders to win the
nomination. (Of course, at a time when our daily lives feel so
scrambled, it's not out of the question that something surprising could
happen with our politics.)

Whether or not Mr. Sanders defies the odds and captures the nomination,
his worldview --- and the energized wing of the Democratic Party that it
represents --- isn't going away. And if Mr. Biden wants to win the
general election, he needs to find a way to see Mr. Sanders less as a
pesky protester and more as a key partner in his political coalition.

A few other moments worth noting:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Paging Senators Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and
  other would-be vice-presidential picks. The news out of this debate is
  that Mr. Biden
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html}{committed
  outright} to picking a female running mate.
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/politics/democrats-women-vice-president.html}{The
  push for a woman on the ticket} escalated after Ms. Warren dropped out
  of the race. For all you veepstakes lovers, this declaration isn't
  that surprising but it does narrow Mr. Biden's list of possibilities.
\item
  Beyond the shrunken field of candidates,
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/cnn-democratic-debate-coronavirus.html}{debating
  in the time of coronavirus looks awfully different}. The podiums were
  placed six feet apart, in line with recommendations from the Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention for keeping a safe distance from
  others. Only a dozen people were physically present in the Washington
  television studio where the debate took place. Hand sanitizer was
  widely available, and the candidates greeted each other with a careful
  elbow bump.
\item
  Even if the logistics were different, it's nice to see a campaign
  event happening, as so many primary elections are getting postponed.
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html}{Georgia
  and Louisiana have delayed their presidential primaries}, and Wyoming
  has suspended its in-person Democratic caucus voting. Yesterday, we
  reported that
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/ny-voting-coronavirus.html}{New
  York officials are considering plans} to postpone the state's
  presidential primary election from April 28 to June 23.
\item
  In an interview after the debate, Mr. Sanders suggested that holding
  primaries may not ``make a lot of sense'' right now. ``I would hope
  governors listen to the public health experts,'' he said. ``I'm
  thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks,
  registering people, all that stuff. It does not make a lot of sense.''

Podiums were cleaned before the start of the Democratic debate on
Sunday. The debate was moved from a theater in Phoenix to a CNN
television studio in Washington because of concerns about the
coronavirus.

\item
  The coronavirus crisis brought Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders together for
  an unusual debate, and the debate highlighted their distance,
