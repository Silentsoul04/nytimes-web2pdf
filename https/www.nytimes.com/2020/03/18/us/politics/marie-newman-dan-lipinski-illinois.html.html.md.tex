Illinois House
Primary}\label{marie-newman-beats-dan-lipinski-democratic-incumbent-in-illinois-house-primary}}

Ms. Newman, a progressive challenger, upset Mr. Lipinski, a conservative

health care.

WASHINGTON --- Representative Dan Lipinski, a conservative Democrat from
Illinois whose opposition to abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act
made him a pariah in his party, lost a hard-fought primary race on
Tuesday night to his progressive challenger, Marie Newman.

Ms. Newman, a business consultant and founder of an anti-bullying
program, edged out Mr. Lipinski by two percentage points, with 494 of
500 precincts
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/us/elections/results-illinois-house-district-3-primary-election.html}{reporting}
early Wednesday. She had the backing of the progressive group Justice
Democrats and its standard-bearer, Representative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez of New York, as well as EMILY's List, the powerful group
that backs Democrats who support abortion rights.

Mr. Lipinski narrowly beat Ms. Newman in 2018. Tuesday's results were a
major upset for the congressman, whose family has represented Illinois'
third district, in the Chicago suburbs, for nearly four decades. Mr.
Lipinski's father, Bill Lipinski, first won the seat in 1982 and held it
until 2005, when Mr. Lipinski succeeded him.

``This is a critical victory for the progressive movement in showing
that voters are ready for a new generation of progressive leadership in
the Democratic Party,'' said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of
Justice Democrats. ``This isn't just a loss for one incumbent. It's a
defeat for machine politics and big corporate donors who want to stop
our movement for `Medicare for all,' a Green New Deal and reproductive
rights.''

Ms. Newman's victory was a rare bright spot for the progressive movement
in Tuesday's contests, in which Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} of Vermont suffered major defeats in three crucial states,
including Illinois. The results
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/biden-florida-illinois-primary.html?action=click\&module=ELEX_results\&pgtype=Interactive\&region=ReporterUpdates}{all
but extinguished} his hopes of a comeback against former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, who appeared to be headed toward becoming the Democrats'
presumptive nominee.

The race put a fine point on the tensions within the Democratic Party in
the era of President Trump. Mr. Lipinski's views are far more
conservative than those of Mr. Biden, and in many ways he was an outlier
among Democrats. In addition to voting against the 2010 health care law
and opposing abortion rights, he declined to endorse former President
Barack Obama in 2012 and opposed same-sex marriage until the Supreme
Court made it legal across the nation in 2015.

Despite their official stance that the party backs incumbents, top
Democrats did not go out of their way to advance Mr. Lipinski's cause.
During a trip to Texas last month, with 10 days to go until the state's
primary, **** Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped in on the campaign offices of
another conservative Democrat, Representative Henry Cuellar, boosting
his successful battle to defeat a Justice Democrats-backed challenger,
Jessica Cisneros. Ms. Pelosi did not do the same for Mr. Lipinksi.

And Mr. Lipinski's fellow Illinoisan, Representative Cheri Bustos, who
leads the party's campaign arm, canceled a planned fund-raiser for Mr.
Lipinski last year, bowing to progressives who were outraged by the
congressman's anti-abortion rights stance. Her decision
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/dan-lipinski-abortion-cheri-bustos.html}{raised
questions} about whether there was room left in the party for lawmakers
who oppose abortion.

The day after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Ms. Newman, Representative
Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, a centrist Democrat and the majority leader,
\href{https://thehill.com/homenews/house/461972-dem-leader-says-party-can-include-abortion-opponents}{told
reporters} that there was ``absolutely'' room in the party for
candidates who oppose abortion rights. But some veteran Democrats,
including two others from Illinois, Representative Jan Schakowsky and
former Representative Luis Gutiérrez, openly backed Ms. Newman.

Ms. Newman, who worked in advertising before starting her own consulting
business, founded a nonprofit organization, ``Team Up to Stop
Bullying,'' after one of her children was subjected to severe bullying
in school. Her campaign website bills her as ``a state and national
advocate for health care rights, income equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and
common-sense gun safety.''

Ms. Newman had the backing of groups that support abortion rights,
including Planned Parenthood and Naral, as well as several unions and
Indivisible, the grass-roots advocacy group. Even before all the votes
were counted on Tuesday night, Emily's List issued a statement
congratulating her on the victory, calling her ``a proven fighter for
working families.''
