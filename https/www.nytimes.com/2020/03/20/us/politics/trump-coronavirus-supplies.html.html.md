<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers have resisted calls from
congressional Democrats and a growing number of governors to use a
federal law that would mobilize industry and provide badly needed
resources against the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/coronavirus-news.html)
spread, days after the president said he would consider using that
authority.

Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about the Defense Production Act
since he first said on Wednesday that he was prepared to invoke the law,
which was passed by Congress at the outset of the Korean War and grants
presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure
the availability of critical equipment.

The next day, he suggested that obtaining medical equipment should be up
to individual governors because “we’re not a shipping clerk.” But on
Friday, he reversed himself, asserting that he had used the law to spur
the production of “millions of masks,” without offering evidence or
specifics about who was manufacturing them or when they would reach
health workers.

And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that
he was left with the impression after talking with Mr. Trump that he had
decided to move to put the act into effect. He said “a commitment on the
phone was a good start,” but that the president now needed to push the
government “to move full steam ahead.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Trump’s confusing statements played out in the middle of a
growing health crisis that within days has abruptly and indefinitely
altered the course of American life.

With the [number of coronavirus cases in the United States surging
above 17,000](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us)
— over 40 percent of those concentrated in New York — front-line health
care workers have reported a dire shortage of masks, surgical gowns and
eye gear to protect them from the virus. State lawmakers have also
implored the president to help them get the supplies they need.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Business leaders have said invoking the defense law is not necessary.
During his appearance with the members of his coronavirus task force on
Friday, Mr. Trump supported that idea and said that private companies,
including General Motors, had volunteered to produce supplies without
any prompting from the government.

“We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that
want to do the work and help our country,” Mr. Trump said. “We have not
had a problem with that at all.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of the president’s advisers have privately said that they share the
longstanding opposition of conservatives to government intervention and
oppose using the law, and the president again signaled his own
ambivalence about
it.

“When we need something, we’ll order something,” Mr. Trump said of the
act. “As you know two days ago, I invoked the act. It is a big step. I
am not sure if it is done before. When we need something, we’ll use it.”

Asked Friday night about specific ways the Defense Production Act has
been used, the White House said in a statement that the president was
“currently using it to drive the private sector’s response to this
crisis,” and that he had invoked the act “to ensure that the necessary
authorities will be available to prioritize production of items under
government contracts and to allocate scarce items where they are needed
most.”

In signing the executive order on Wednesday to put the act into effect,
Mr. Trump said the purpose was to expedite distribution of “health and
medical resources needed to respond to the spread of Covid-19, including
personal protective equipment and ventilators,” and that Alex M. Azar
II, the secretary of health and human services, could order production
and distribution of supplies, if necessary.

But the president did not say if masks and ventilators in anything near
the necessary quantity have actually been delivered to the workers who
need them.

During Friday’s briefing, Mr. Trump grew increasingly confrontational
with reporters as they pressed him on the details of the Defense
Production Act, and he snapped at Peter Alexander, a reporter for NBC
News, who asked him what he would say to Americans who were scared.

“I say that you’re a terrible reporter, that’s what I say,” Mr. Trump
replied.

“It is a bad signal that you are putting out to the American people,”
the president continued. “You want to get back to reporting instead of
sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. I happen to feel good about it.
Who knows. I have been right a lot. Let’s see what happens.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the coronavirus has spread, Mr. Trump has come under withering attack
from Democrats for the speed at which he has mobilized the government to
respond.

“We’re talking about a president who is basically doing what Herbert
Hoover did at the beginning of the Depression and minimizing the danger
and refusing to use available federal action,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of
New York said Friday in an interview with the radio station WNYC. “And
people are going to die, and they shouldn’t, they don’t have to, if we
could get the support that we’re asking for.”

Republicans have not been openly critical, but some governors have been
explicit in describing their difficulties in depending on the private
sector for medical supplies.

In a call held on Thursday with Mr. Trump, a group of governors stressed
to him that they were struggling to address the staggering demand for
equipment.

At one point, Gov. Kristi Noem, Republican of South Dakota, grew
frustrated as she expressed to the president and members of the
coronavirus task force that state officials had been working
unsuccessfully with private
suppliers.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“I need to understand how you’re triaging supplies,” Ms. Noem said. “We,
for two weeks, were requesting reagents for our public health lab from
C.D.C., who pushed us to private suppliers who kept canceling orders on
us. And we kept making requests, placing orders.”

She added, “I don’t want to be less of a priority because we’re a
smaller state or less populated.”

Mr. Trump promised her that would “never” happen before Ms. Noem’s
telephone line was disconnected.

When it was originally passed, the Defense Production Act granted
President Harry S. Truman the power to spur the production of aluminum,
titanium and other needed materials during wartime. Since then, it has
been used for both the prevention of terrorism and to prepare for
natural disasters.

The act would give the Trump administration the authority to override
companies’ existing contracts and to direct supplies to hot spots like
New York City or Seattle. It could also help mobilize funds for
retooling factories, refitting pharmacy drive-throughs into testing
sites and ramping up production of an eventual vaccine.

But John Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that corporate executives were
already working “hand in glove” with the government on production
challenges.

“American companies will do whatever it takes to support our country’s
response to the pandemic and shore up the economy,” he said. “The
Defense Production Act was designed for defense industry products with a
single supplier, often with purely domestic production chains, and
invoking it may do more harm than good in sectors such as
pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.”

Companies that manufacture face masks, medical wipes and other supplies
say they are already operating around the clock to meet elevated demand.
Some factories that make similar products — like surgical gowns, diapers
and incontinence products — have already switched over to manufacture
the face masks or other protective gear that health care workers need.

But people familiar with the administration’s actions say it is still
trying to figure out how industry supply chains operate, which companies
could produce additional products and what kinds of subsidies it may
need to offer.

And without the Defense Production Act, the government will lack the
ability to channel these supplies to areas that need it most — or to
persuade companies to act quickly and without regard for their profits.

As reported cases of the virus in the United States have soared, Mr.
Trump, who is known to recruit input from a variety of outside advisers,
has been getting conflicting advice. The proliferating number of private
sector voices with direct access to the president and his top advisers —
notably his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner — has resulted in a
chaotic process.

The president’s advisers say they see the role of the federal government
as a facilitator, as opposed to the chief producer or a national
governor. They have tried to encourage states to get by with what they
can, suggesting there will be support from the federal government but
that this should not be the first option.

In practice, the administration has been trying to use the provision to
jawbone companies into taking voluntary action while holding over them
the possibility that the federal government would intervene, according
to administration officials familiar with the state of play.

“We’re actually encouraged that the partnership with the private sector
can meeting many of these needs,” said Marc Short, Vice President Mike
Pence’s chief of staff, on Friday morning in a discussion with
reporters.

Katie Rogers and Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Maggie
Haberman from New York. Michael Gold contributed reporting from New
York, and Noah Weiland from Washington.
