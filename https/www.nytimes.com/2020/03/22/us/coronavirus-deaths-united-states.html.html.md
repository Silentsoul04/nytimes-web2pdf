*This obituary is part of a series about* [*people who have died in the
coronavirus
pandemic*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Her name was Loretta, but they called her Lettie. She stood 4 feet 10
inches tall. She was outrageously friendly, the kind of person liable to
invite the sales clerk at T-Mobile to join the family for dinner. This
made her children cringe but was also something they loved. Pure Lettie.

She was tough. At work, she could stare down colleagues who were hairy,
blustery and taller than her by a foot or two. And it was true of her
husband, Roddy. He could not say no to her.

Roddy had not wanted to go on their February trip to the Philippines. He
was watching the early news about the coronavirus, and worried it would
put his wife, a cancer survivor, in danger. But she was adamant. There
was something she needed to finish.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On March 11, Loretta Dionisio became a data point.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the [news conference where her death was
announced](https://www.dailybreeze.com/2020/03/11/la-county-reports-first-death-related-to-coronavirus-6-new-cases/),
the public health director in Los Angeles County did not name her, in
accordance with federal privacy regulations.

The public health director referred only to a woman in her 60s with
“underlying health conditions” who was stopping briefly in California
after travels in Asia, adding that “shortly after being hospitalized,
she unfortunately passed.” In the ongoing tally of fatalities associated
with the coronavirus, hers was the 37th death in the United States, the
first in Los Angeles County.

newsletter about California, for updates.\]*

Nearly two weeks later, Ms. Dionisio’s family was still grappling with
the bureaucracy that surrounds infectious disease. She died far from her
home in Orlando, Fla., during a layover 2,500 miles away. Her son and
daughter, on the East Coast, have been unable to see their father, who
is in quarantine in California after giving their mother cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. For days after her death, he barely spoke.

And in the painful logistics of hygiene and quarantine, no funeral Mass
has been said for her.

“Through this whole ordeal, we didn’t want her to get lost in the
story,” said her son, Rembert Dionisio.

Janice Jenkins, a close friend of Ms. Dionisio’s, said that the days
after her death had felt strange and disjointed, without the ceremonies
that mark the passing of someone dear.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“This whole thing is just like a hole in the ground that they’re just
throwing bodies into,” she said.

## A rush of numbers

News of the pandemic is released in the form of data, illnesses and
deaths compiled by countries and counties. But sparks of humanity glow
here and
there.

The list goes on. As of Sunday, 390 deaths had been tied to the
coronavirus in the United States. The average age of those who had died
was a few months over 77, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. In the most vulnerable age brackets, [men are nearly

in wealthier countries with higher life expectancies, according to a
study published last week by demographers at Oxford University. The
virus spreads faster in countries like Italy, where there is a high
level of contact between the young and the
old.

As the crisis has deepened, mourning rituals have fallen by the wayside.

In China, where more than 3,100 people have died, the national health
commission has banned funerals. Patients die in intensive care units
that do not allow visitors, and in the moments after a person’s death,
health workers in hazmat suits enter a hospital room and take the body
away.

In Italy, where funerals serve as a central pillar of community life,
many of the dead are being buried by a lone priest, without mourners
present. [A local cemetery in the province of Bergamo, at the center of
the outbreak, shut down this past
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-funerals.html)
for the first time since World War II. The local newspaper, [L’Eco di
Bergamo](https://www.ecodibergamo.it/), ran 10 pages of obituaries.

“These are people who die alone and who are buried alone,” the
newspaper’s editor, Alberto Ceresoli, said.

## A specific person

Ms. Dionisio, 68, was fond of emeralds (the real kind), serial killer
documentaries and the Home Shopping Network.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She had a passionate interest in food. Her brainstorming about lunch
plans, her co-workers would joke, sometimes began at 9:30 in the
morning. People not related to her called her “mom.” And she had such a
close, tender relationship with her husband that when he had to work on
Saturdays, she would drive an hour to work with him just so she could
sit by his side.

“I don’t mind, I just want to be with him,” she said, once, when a
co-worker asked her why.

It would be a mistake, however, to consider her a softy. When the family
needed someone to negotiate a deal, they sent Ms. Dionisio.

“She wasn’t necessarily persuasive, she was just persistent,” said her
son-in-law, Chris Connelly. “She would say, ‘I want that car and I want
it for this price.’ You would be there until 10 o’clock at night and the
manager would say, ‘What do I have to do to go home?’”

Loretta Mendoza was born in Pasay City, in the Philippines, to parents
who had fled by foot into the countryside to escape the Japanese
occupation during World War II, at times eating roots to survive. It was
an ordeal they rarely spoke of. In first grade, she was sent away to a
convent school, to be educated by nuns.

“She and I took care of each other,” said her sister, Norma Quijano, 73,
who is five years her senior. “You know how the nuns
are.”

Ms. Dionisio’s decision to travel to the Philippines in February was
bound up in that history.

She and her husband, Rodrigo, a classmate from art school in the
Philippines, left for the United States in the 1970s, and found work as
commercial artists. They eventually settled in Orlando and raised two
children, Rembert and Rowena.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But unfinished business from the Philippines nagged at Ms. Dionisio.

Her father, who had grown up in poverty, had spent years scrimping to
buy land for a coconut plantation in the coastal region of Camarines
Norte, promising his children it would support them in their old
age.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

This was dubious — the land’s value had dwindled over the years to a few
thousand dollars, and the government had forced the family to surrender
the property when they immigrated to the United States. But Ms.
Dionisio, as a tribute to her deceased father, was intent on collecting
compensation for the plot from the Department of Agrarian Reform. She
and her sister had chipped away at this task for years, a wrestling
match with provincial land bureaucrats who demanded a long list of
notarized documents. This spring’s trip was the one in which Ms.
Dionisio would collect the check.

“She said, ‘I have to finish this,’” Ms. Quijano said. “She wanted to
settle it once and for all.”

News about the virus was already beginning to circulate, and an active
volcano had spewed ash particles into the air. People tried to talk Ms.
Dionisio, who had survived two bouts of cancer and suffered from
diabetes, out of traveling. Her husband was against making the trip, and
so was their daughter and her sister. Ms. Jenkins tried to dissuade her,
as well, but understood it was useless.

“It goes back to her never wanting to give up,” Ms. Jenkins said. Ms.
Dionisio’s daughter, Rowena Dionisio-Connelly, agreed: As a small girl,
Ms. Dionisio would run after a neighbor who teased her brother, who was
gay. “She would pull out a wooden spoon and chase the neighbor with it
all the way to his doorstep,” she said.

So the couple set off for a month of travel, sending back dispatches
from their journey. Increasingly, they were in the shadow of the virus.

## A gut punch

“We’ve been wearing our masks to avoid the coronavirus,” Mr. Dionisio
wrote in a text message to Ms. Jenkins, along with a photo of a carved
bench nestled in tropical greenery. As the trip went on, he wrote, more
and more of the tourist sights were being closed.

In early March, Ms. Dionisio called home to announce that she had
achieved her goal: Zipped inside her suitcase was a check from the
Filipino government, compensating the family for the loss of the coconut
plantation, said her sister, Ms. Quijano. She turned toward home, a trip
that would take the couple through Thailand and, briefly, South Korea.

There were, their children now realize, small signs that something was
wrong.

At one point, Mr. Dionisio mentioned to Rowena that her mother had a
fever. In a phone call to her sister, passing on the triumphant news
about the check, Ms. Dionisio mentioned she wasn’t feeling well.

Then they were on their way to safety. Mr. Dionisio told his daughter
that they had to wait, exhausted, for nine hours in the airport in
Seoul, where there was no free seat for them.

That is something Rowena’s mind gets stuck on now.

“It’s a gut punch, because I can see how they were,” she said. “My dad
was probably trying to make her comfortable on the windowsill, her head
was probably resting on his shoulder.”

When they landed in Los Angeles, her mother called from outside her
sister-in-law’s house, saying she needed to rest after the 11-hour
flight.

“She was joking and laughing about not being able to get into the
house,” she said. “She said, ‘I’ll call you later. I need to sleep.’
And then I never heard from her again.”

When Mr. Dionisio awoke from a deep, jet-lagged sleep hours later, he
could not wake his wife. Panicked, he performed CPR and called an
ambulance, which took her to a hospital with a weak pulse. Over the next
hours, she experienced four cardiac arrests, her family said. She was
declared dead at 2:57 a.m. on March 10.

After she tested positive for the virus on March 11, the family was
occupied with crisis management, five or six hours a day of phone calls
to public health officials, the crematory, hospital staff. Not only
their father, but also their aunt and uncle, and another aunt and
cousin, have been ordered to self-quarantine.

A memorial gathering, for now, is out of the question.

“We don’t want to put any other family members in harm’s way,” Ms.
Dionisio’s son, Rembert, said. “That’s what makes everything really
rough right now. It’s almost taken away from what is happening with my
mother.”

His cousin, Paula, is thinking of setting up a conference call so that a
priest can say Mass.

The check for the coconut planation will be deposited, its balance given
to Ms. Dionisio’s eldest sister.

Rowena has trouble speaking about her mother without breaking down.

“It’s hard for me to to come to terms with the fact that Mom is gone,”
she said. “I’m searching for her. Her smell. I want to touch her hand.”
