Senator [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
plans to participate in the Democratic presidential debate in April if
one is held, his campaign said on Tuesday, the strongest indication yet
that he plans to continue competing against [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
in the 2020 primary for the foreseeable future.

The Democratic National Committee has said previously that there would
be a debate in April, but one has not been scheduled. The committee has
not announced a media partner or a site host — critical elements that
are typically agreed upon at least a month in advance. The coronavirus
crisis has already upended most facets of the Democratic primary, and
there is no guarantee that the debate will take place.

Still, the fact that the Sanders campaign is signaling, for now, that he
would be on a debate stage in April is a strikingly public sign of the
Vermont senator’s determination to wield political influence and
challenge Mr. Biden for primacy despite the former vice president’s
nearly insurmountable delegate lead.

“Senator Sanders is still running for president,” said Mike Casca, a top
campaign official. “If there is a debate in April, he plans to be
there.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Sanders has been holding regular live-streamed events to discuss the
coronavirus response, including one on Tuesday night with Representative
Pramila Jayapal of Washington and several health
experts.

Before the coronavirus outbreak effectively put the primary race on hold
— most upcoming primaries have been moved to later dates and neither Mr.
Sanders nor Mr. Biden is holding any in-person campaign events — Mr.
Sanders had soundly lost a string of primary races beginning with South
Carolina and continuing through last Tuesday, when he lost contests in
Arizona, Florida and Illinois.

Mr. Biden’s decisive victories, and his ability to attract so many
demographic groups, have left Mr. Sanders with no realistic path to the
nomination. After Mr. Sanders’s losses last week, his campaign manager
said the Vermont senator would “assess his campaign,” and Mr. Sanders
has shifted his focus since then to the virus. He has not made any
announcements about his campaign’s future, and snapped last week at a
reporter who asked about his plans. During an [interview on
MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKxArKJMU4c) on Monday night, he
said his campaign was “kind of moving day by day.”

The Democratic National Committee has not set a media partner, a venue
or a date for the party’s final planned debate, nor has it released
qualification criteria to participate.

Xochitl Hinojosa, a D.N.C. spokeswoman, declined to say whether a debate
would still take place in April as planned or move later in the calendar
to follow primary contests from several states that have switched from
April to June. The Biden campaign declined to comment.

Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden [met in their first one-on-one
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/biden-sanders-debate-recap.html)
just over a week ago, a forum that was moved from Arizona to Washington,
D.C., because of travel concerns related to the coronavirus, and held in
a CNN studio with no live audience.

Nine states and the District of Columbia now plan to hold primaries on
June 2, making it the day with the second-largest delegate haul on
Democrats’ presidential primary calendar, after Super Tuesday, when
California and Texas voted.

Mr. Biden cannot officially clinch the presidential nomination before
June 2, even if he were to win all of the delegates from all of the
states and territories voting before then.

And some of the states with contests scheduled in April and May are
contemplating moving back on the calendar. Elections officials in New
York and Pennsylvania, with April 28 contests, have said they will seek
to delay their primaries.
