# 13 Deaths in a Day: An ‘Apocalyptic’ Coronavirus Surge at an N.Y.C. Hospital

Hospitals in the city are facing the kind of harrowing increases in
cases that overwhelmed health care systems in China and Italy.

In several hours on Tuesday, Dr. Ashley Bray performed chest
compressions at Elmhurst Hospital Center on a woman in her 80s, a man in
his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fiancé. All had
tested positive for the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/armen-henderson-arrested-homeless-coronavirus-testing.html)
and had gone into cardiac arrest. All eventually died.

Elmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital in Queens, has begun transferring
patients not suffering from coronavirus to other hospitals as it moves
toward becoming dedicated entirely to the outbreak.
[Doctors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/armen-henderson-arrested-homeless-coronavirus-testing.html)
and nurses have struggled to make do with a few dozen ventilators. Calls
over a loudspeaker of “Team 700,” the code for when a patient is on the
verge of death, come several times a shift. Some have died inside the
emergency room while waiting for a bed.

A refrigerated truck has been stationed outside to hold the bodies of
the dead. Over the past 24 hours, New York City’s public hospital system
said in a statement, 13 people at Elmhurst had died.

“It’s apocalyptic,” said Dr. Bray, 27, a general medicine resident at
the hospital.

Across the city, which has become the epicenter of the coronavirus
outbreak in the United States, hospitals are beginning to confront the
kind of harrowing surge in cases that has overwhelmed health care
systems in China, Italy and other countries. On Wednesday evening, New
York City reported 20,011 confirmed cases and 280 deaths.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than 3,922 coronavirus patients have been hospitalized in the city.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday [offered a glimmer of hope that
social-distancing
measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html)
were starting to slow the growth in hospitalizations statewide. This
week, the state’s hospitalization estimations were down markedly, from a
doubling of cases every two days to every four days.

It is “almost too good to be true,” Mr. Cuomo said.

Still, hospitals are under siege. New York City’s hospitals run the
gamut from prestigious teaching institutions catering to the elite to
public hospitals providing care for some of the poorest communities in
the nation. Regardless of whom they serve, few have been spared the
impact of the pandemic: A flood of sick and fearful New Yorkers has
besieged emergency rooms across the city.

Working with state and federal officials, hospitals have repeatedly
expanded the portions of their buildings equipped to handle patients who
had stayed home until worsening fevers and difficulty breathing forced
them into emergency rooms. Elmhurst, among the hardest-hit hospitals in
the city, is a prime example of the hardships medical centers and their
staffs are facing across the country.

“Elmhurst is at the center of this crisis, and it’s the number one
priority of our public hospital system right now,” the city’s public
hospital system’s statement said. “The front line staff are going above
and beyond in this crisis, and we continue surging supplies and
personnel to this critical facility to keep pace with the crisis.”

Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation,
which operates New York City’s public hospitals, said plans were
underway to transform many areas of the Elmhurst hospital into intensive
care units for extremely sick patients.

But New York’s hospitals may be about to lose their leeway for
creativity in finding spaces.

All of the more than 1,800 intensive care beds in the city are expected
to be full by Friday, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency
briefing obtained by The New York Times. Patients could stay for weeks,
limiting space for newly sickened
people.

The federal government is sending a 1,000-bed hospital ship to New York,
although it is not scheduled to arrive until mid-April. Officials have
begun erecting four 250-bed hospitals at the Jacob K. Javits Convention
Center in Midtown Manhattan, which could be ready in a week. President
Trump [said on Wednesday on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242826052310794240)
that construction was ahead of schedule, but that could not be
independently confirmed.

Officials have also discussed converting hotels and arenas into
temporary medical centers.

At least two city hospitals have filled up their morgues, and city
officials anticipated the rest would reach capacity by the end of this
week, according to the briefing. The state requested 85 refrigerated
trailers from FEMA for mortuary services, along with staff, the briefing
said.

A spokeswoman for the city’s office of the chief medical examiner said
the briefing was inaccurate. “We have significant morgue capacity in our
five citywide sites, and the ability to expand,” she said.

In interviews, doctors and nurses at hospitals across the city gave
accounts of how they were being stretched.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Workers at several hospitals, including the Jacobi Medical Center in the
Bronx, said employees such as obstetrician-gynecologists and
radiologists have been called to work in emergency wards.

At a branch of the Montefiore Medical Center, also in the Bronx, there
have been one or two coronavirus-related deaths a day, or more, said
Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a nurse. There are not always enough gurneys, so
some patients sit in chairs. One patient on Sunday had been without a
bed for 36 hours, she said.

At the Mount Sinai Health System, some hospital workers in Manhattan
have posted photos on social media showing [nurses using trash bags as
protective
gear](https://twitter.com/brianmrosenthal/status/1241744193648762882). A
system spokesman said she was not aware of that happening and noted the
nurses had other gear below the bags. “The safety of our staff and
patients has never been of greater importance and we are taking every
precaution possible to protect everyone,” she said.

With[ventilators in short
supply](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007051271/cuomo-coronavirus-update.html),
NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city’s largest systems, has
begun using one machine to help multiple patients at a time, a virtually
unheard-of move, a spokeswoman
said.

[Elmhurst Hospital
Center](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/chna-elmhurst-2013.pdf)
opened in 1832 and moved to its current Queens location in 1957, making
it one of the oldest hospitals in New York City.

In the neighborhood it serves, Elmhurst, more than two-thirds of
residents were born outside of the United States, the highest such rate
in the city. It is a safety-net hospital, serving mainly low-income
patients, including many who lack primary care doctors.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Queens accounts for 32 percent of New York City’s confirmed coronavirus
cases, more than any other borough and far more than its share of the
city’s population. It also has fewer hospitals. Elmhurst is one of three
major hospitals serving a large population and is centrally located,
which in part explains why it is busy in normal times and even busier
now.

Medical workers said they saw the first signs of the virus in early
March — an increase in patients coming in with flulike symptoms before
the alarm had been fully raised in the city and the country. Tests
results were taking longer then, but they eventually confirmed that many
of these patients had
coronavirus.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good

        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In the weeks after, the emergency room began filling up, with more than
200 people at times. Every chair in the waiting room was usually taken.
Patients came in faster than the hospital could add beds; earlier this
week, 60 coronavirus patients had been admitted but were still in the
emergency room. One man waited almost 60 hours for a bed last week, a
doctor said.

The patients coming in now are sicker than before because they were
advised to try to recover at home, doctors said.

Like other hospitals, Elmhurst has come perilously close to running out
of ventilators several times; other hospitals have replenished its
supply.

Despite the more optimistic projections by the state about
hospitalization rates, the crowds outside of Elmhurst have not thinned
out.

The line of people waiting outside of Elmhurst to be tested for the
coronavirus forms as early as 6 a.m., and some stay there until 5 p.m.
Many are told to go home without being tested.

Julio Jimenez, 35, spent six hours in the emergency room on Sunday night
after running a fever while at work in a New Jersey warehouse. He
returned on Monday morning to stand in the testing line in the pouring
rain. On Tuesday, still coughing, eyes puffy, he stood in line for
nearly seven hours and again went home untested.

“I don’t know if I have the virus,” Mr. Jimenez said. “It’s so hard.
It’s not just me. It’s for many people. It’s crazy.”

Rikki Lane, a doctor who has worked at Elmhurst for more than 20 years,
said the hospital had handled “the first wave of this tsunami.” She
compared the scene in the emergency department with an overcrowded
parking garage where physicians must move patients in and out of spots
to access other patients blocked by stretchers.

Family members are not permitted inside, she said.

Dr. Lane recalled recently treating a man in his 30s whose breathing
deteriorated quickly and had to be put on a ventilator. “He was in
distress and panicked, I could see the terror in his eyes,” she said.
“He was alone.”

Other doctors said they had tried to resuscitate people while drenched
in sweat under their protective gear, face masks fogging up. Some
patients have been found dead in their rooms while doctors were busy
helping others, they said.

Sometimes doctors try to call patients’ families when it is clear they
will not recover.

That is what Dr. Bray said she tried to do before the man who reminded
her of her fiancé died on Tuesday. As it turned out, his mother, also
stricken with the coronavirus, was a patient at another hospital.

“We weren’t able to get in touch with anybody,” Dr. Bray said.

Sullivan and Michael Schwirtz. Susan C. Beachy contributed research.
