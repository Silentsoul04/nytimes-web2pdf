In one of the last interviews before his death, Larry Kramer, the AIDS
activist who became that epidemic’s wrathful prophet, said he was
writing a play for the age of Covid-19. It was, he said, a work he might
not live to finish.

“It’s about gay people having to live through three plagues,” he said
from his apartment in Greenwich Village. It was March 24, two days into
the governor’s order to stay in place. Already Mr. Kramer was becoming
increasingly isolated.

Two months later, Mr. Kramer, who had cheated death several times in the
past, [died on
May 27](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F05%2F27%2Fus%2Flarry-kramer-dead.html).
His play, like his legacy, remained a work in progress. The cause was
pneumonia.

The three plagues are H.I.V./AIDS, Covid-19 and the decline of the human
body — specifically, a broken leg that Mr. Kramer, 84, suffered last
April, when he fell in his apartment and lay on the floor until his home
attendant arrived hours later.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Mr. Kramer, who had several brushes with death since receiving an
H.I.V. diagnosis in 1988, the days had haunting echoes of the AIDS
epidemic, which he felt never ended.

“The government has been awful in both cases,” he said, his voice softer
than the old days but his anger undiminished. “They were terrible with
AIDS and they’re terrible with this thing. One wonders what will become
of us.”

As in the AIDS epidemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a fixture on the
nightly news. The two men had a complicated history. In the 1980s, Mr.
Kramer blamed Dr. Fauci for the federal government’s slow response to
AIDS, calling him a murderer and an “incompetent idiot.”

But the adversaries developed a grudging friendship, and Dr. Fauci
helped get Mr. Kramer into a lifesaving experimental drug trial after
Mr. Kramer had a liver transplant.

“We are friends again,” Mr. Kramer said in an email. “I’m feeling sorry
for how he’s being treated. I emailed him this, but his one line answer
was, ‘Hunker down.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also as with AIDS, people’s casual encounters from the past have taken
on potentially lethal significance, and the news brought a steady drip
of death or diagnosis: the playwright Terrence McNally, whom Mr. Kramer
called a close friend and neighbor, dead at 81; the AIDS researcher Dr.
Michael Saag, diagnosed at 64 on his way home from organizing a medical
conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections, ill but not
critical.

“It’s been so long that I have been losing friends that it becomes
surreal,” Mr. Kramer said.

He did not find that his experience during the AIDS crisis gave him
perspective on the coronavirus pandemic, he said. Rather, the two eras
merged into each other.

“We certainly had our experience,” he said of his generation of AIDS
activists. “But I find it very hard to stay in touch with the outside
world, because of the hardships we are all having to go through. You can
read about everybody else’s experiences on Facebook, but it gets
depressing after a while.”

He said he hoped the antiretroviral drugs that he and many friends were
taking for H.I.V. would bolster their immune systems against the
coronavirus. It was a slender hope.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

For Mr. Kramer, who was by then largely homebound, a challenge of the
pandemic was isolation. His husband, David Webster, whom he married in
2013 in the intensive care unit of NYU Langone Medical Center, was away
on a work project, wary of bringing potential exposure into the home.
Some of Mr. Kramer’s home attendants, also, had to stop coming because
of exposure to the disease.

So he tried to lose himself in the new play, “An Army of Lovers Must Not
Die,” which he had to change almost daily as the news changed. “I wonder
if it will ever be done now,” he said of the play.

But Mr. Kramer, for all his doom-saying, repeatedly beat the odds,
surviving to finish his two-part epic novel, “The American People,” the
second volume of which, at 880 pages, landed earlier this year.
