Hello, from the socially distanced land of our comfy (read: tiny) New
York apartments\!

Electoral politics as we know them are on pause at the moment, and the
coronavirus has upended the Democratic primary race in many ways. Here’s
a look at exactly how, and notes on other things you might have missed
in the 2020 race this week.

## How to campaign during the coronavirus outbreak

As President Trump has appeared before the nation for daily briefings
and [labeled himself a “wartime
president,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-wartime-president.html)
former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
— the candidate who seems all but certain to face Mr. Trump in the
general election — has faced questions online and even at virtual
fund-raisers about why he has kept a relatively low profile.

The outbreak has, of course, forced Mr. Biden and Senator [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
of Vermont off the physical campaign trail. And the unusual situation
has left [Mr. Biden trying to figure out how to position himself as a
prominent voice on the
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-virus.html).

“I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with
the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think
we should be doing and how we should be doing it,” [Mr. Biden said on
Sunday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/biden-trump-coronavirus.html).

### Reshaping the health care debate

If you’ve watched any of the Democratic debates or attended any campaign
events, you know that health care has long been a central issue in the
2020 presidential race. Adding the coronavirus pandemic to the equation
[has made the stakes even
higher](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-health-care.html)
and made the difference between Democratic and Republican visions of
what the system should look like even more
stark.

Advancing “Medicare for all” has, for two cycles now, been Mr. Sanders’s
central policy priority, and our colleague [Sydney Ember reports
that](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/bernie-sanders-coronavirus.html)
he “believes he can meld this moment of national crisis with the
progressive policy agenda that has been his life’s work.”

### In related news:

  - [Our colleague Reid J. Epstein
    reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee-coronavirus.html)
    that planners for the Democratic National Convention are looking at
    “contingency options” in case the mid-July gathering in Milwaukee
    can’t take place.

  - Our colleague Dionne Searcey looked back at [how Americans managed
    to vote
    in 1918](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html)
    when the nation was ravaged by the Spanish flu.

  - And our colleagues Katie Glueck and Sabrina Tavernise **** stopped
    to consider the fact that [the most powerful people in American
    politics are
    seniors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/biden-trump-seniors.html).

## Will there be another debate?

Mr. Sanders would like to debate Mr. Biden again if, in fact, a debate
is held in April as originally planned.

“Senator Sanders is still running for president,” Mike Casca, one of his
top campaign officials, [said on
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/politics/biden-sanders-next-democratic-debate.html).
“If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there.”

Mr. Biden, not so much.

“I haven’t thought about any more debates,” [he said a day
later](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-next-debate.html).
“I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Democratic National Committee said previously that there would be a
debate in April, but one has not been scheduled and the committee has
not announced a media partner or a site host.

## How about another Super Tuesday?

Thanks to multiple postponements connected to public health concerns, as
many as 10 states and the District of Columbia may now hold primaries on
June 2, making it suddenly quite important to the Democratic race.

As of this writing, [June 2 would confer a trove of delegates so
large](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/biden-sanders-coronavirus-june-2.html)
it would be second only to Super Tuesday in early March. And as such,
the June Tuesday that was once an afterthought could now represent Mr.
Biden’s first chance to clinch the presidential nomination.

  - We are keeping a [running update of major
    changes](https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
    for the election, including rescheduled primaries and caucuses.

  - For a full list of which states are voting when, take a look at our
    [primary election
    calendar](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html).

  - [Wisconsin is plowing ahead with plans to vote on
    April 7.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/wisconsin-primary-coronavirus.html)
    Now the governor wants to send everyone an absentee ballot in under
    two weeks.

  - In a [political
    memo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/politics/coronavirus-2020-election-primary.html),
    our colleague Matt Flegenheimer observed that the election-year
    calendar seemed set in stone — until suddenly it wasn’t.

## And finally …

For us, just as for so many of you, the coronavirus outbreak has been
and will continue to be front of mind when it comes to news. Our
politics team will continue to vigorously cover the 2020 race and all of
the ways it is being affected by the pandemic, and we urge you to keep
reading. But for now, this weekly roundup will go on hiatus. We hope we
can rejoin you when things get a little bit more back to
normal.
