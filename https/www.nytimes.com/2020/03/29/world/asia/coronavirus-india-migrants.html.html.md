# India’s Coronavirus Lockdown Leaves Vast Numbers Stranded and Hungry

The sudden shutdown of businesses has upended the lives of millions of
migrant laborers in Indian cities. More than a dozen migrants have died,
and anger is rising.

NEW DELHI — In one of the biggest migrations in India’s modern history,
hundreds of thousands of migrant laborers have begun long journeys on
foot to get home, having been rendered homeless and jobless by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi’s [nationwide
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

With businesses shut down in cities across the country, vast numbers of
migrants — many of whom lived and ate where they worked — were suddenly
without food and shelter. Soup kitchens in Delhi, the capital, have been
overwhelmed. So far, more than a dozen migrant laborers have lost their
lives in different parts of the country as they tried to return to their
home, hospital officials said.

Thousands of migrants in Delhi, including whole families, packed their
pots, pans and blankets into rucksacks, some balancing children on their
shoulders as they walked along interstate highways. Some planned to walk
hundreds of miles. But as they reached the Delhi border, many were
beaten back by the police.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You fear the disease, living on the streets. But I fear hunger more,
not corona,” said Papu, 32, who came to Delhi three weeks ago for work
and was now trying to return to his home in Saharanpur in the state of
Uttar Pradesh, 125 miles away.

While dozens of countries across the world are under lockdown to contain
the virus’s spread, in crowded and impoverished places like India, many
fear that the measures could spark social unrest. Millions of people
live in Indian slums, and staying at home for three weeks — as Mr. Modi
has ordered — is a daunting prospect in such places, where dozens of
family members often share a few rooms.

Migrant laborers have been protesting the lockdown across India. On
Saturday, thousands came out to the streets in the southern state of
Kerala, saying they had not eaten in days. The authorities urged them to
disperse for their own safety, but they ignored the commands.

As of Sunday morning, just one of India’s 36 state and territorial
governments, Uttar Pradesh, had made arrangements to bring migrants
home, commissioning about 1,000 buses. On Saturday, migrants waited in
lines miles long on the outskirts of Delhi to board a few buses, and the
overwhelming majority were turned away.

But by Sunday afternoon, the central government had ordered states to
reverse course and seal their borders, ordering migrants to stay where
they are. The reversal added to the already confused rollout of the
lockdown, which has prompted state government actions often at odds with
the central government’s orders. The police, often confused, have
resorted to violence.

India already had one of the world’s largest homeless populations, and
the lockdown has swelled its numbers exponentially, workers for
nongovernmental organizations say. A 2011 government census put the
number of homeless at 1.7 million, almost certainly a vast underestimate
in this country of 1.3 billion, experts
say.

Mr. Modi announced the lockdown, which includes a ban on interstate
travel, with just four hours’ notice on Tuesday, leaving the enormous
migrant population stranded in big cities. Jobs lure at least 45 million
people to cities from the countryside every year, according to
government estimates.

Many of those migrants are fed and housed at the shops and construction
sites where they work, and as businesses closed, hundreds of thousands —
if not millions — were suddenly without their homes and a regular source
of
food.

A group of 13 men walking along a Delhi highway last week, bound for
their homes in Uttar Pradesh, said they had not eaten in nearly two
days. They had about $3 between them, they said.

“This may have been a good decision for the wealthy, but not those of us
with no money,” said Deepak Kumar, a 28-year-old truck driver, referring
to the lockdown.

Sirens approached in the distance, and the men ran away, worried it was
the police. It turned out to be an ambulance, and the men regrouped and
set off again.

Aid workers warn that the situation could deteriorate into violence if
the desperation increases and people continue to go without food.

Soup kitchens across Delhi are unable to cope with the demand, which aid
workers estimate has tripled. Fights have been breaking out. The
government has given the police no explicit policy for dealing with
stranded migrants, and many officers have lashed out.

“In the absence of a clear policy, the migrants have been left to the
whims of police. And there are instances where the police treat them
inhumanely,” said Ashwin Parulkar, a senior researcher for the Center
for Policy Research in Delhi who studies India’s homeless population.

Usually, the homeless are fed by India’s array of religious
institutions: Hindu temples, Sikh gurdwaras and mosques. But now,
everything is closed, and shelters are feeling the
strain.

“The pressure has increased drastically. People can't walk the streets,
and if it remains like this, the situation will explode,” said Nishu
Tripathi, 29, a supervisor at a soup kitchen opened by Safe Approach, a
Delhi-based nongovernmental organization.

“Every time we start distributing food, we are charged by the crowd,” he

Safe Approach started an open-air soup kitchen in northeast Delhi last
week. It now serves 8,000 people. As people lined up for food there on
Thursday, police cars circled, sirens blaring.

“Leave this place\! Go inside. Separate\! Separate\! Maintain
distance\!” the police yelled through a
loudspeaker.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

As a group of men and boys, some disabled and hobbling on makeshift
crutches, walked along the highway toward the soup kitchen, police
officers suddenly began beating them with bamboo sticks. “Maintain
social distance\!” they yelled.

A boy of about 15 was hit in the mouth, his wails exposing his
blood-soaked teeth. An angry crowd formed to console him. “Why would
they do that\!” screamed a man waiting for food. “He was walking here.
Why would they treat us like this\!”

Mr. Tripathi, the supervisor, turned to reporters. “Go, we cannot ensure
your safety,” he said.

Despite government orders to allow the transportation of essential items
like food and medicine during the lockdown, vendors complain their
delivery trucks are being harassed by the police and their stores forced
to
shut.

“I’ve never seen such desperation,” said Ricky Chandael, a supervisor at
another shelter. “Before, charitable people would come and donate to our
shelter, but they can’t reach us because of the lockdown. And every day,
there are at least 100 new people showing up here for food.”

As lunchtime neared and the crowd grew, Mr. Chandael, like Mr. Tripathi,
advised reporters to leave for their safety.

On Thursday, the government announced a $22.5 billion relief package to
support the millions made unemployed by the lockdown. But it is unclear
how much that will help migrants and others in India’s enormous
off-the-books work force — believed to make up 80 percent of India’s 470
million workers — who are likely to have trouble getting access to the
benefits.

The aid, including cash and food handouts, is tied to registration in
national labor databases, which omit many migrant workers, or a home
address, which many migrants do not have.

Mr. Modi has said that shutting down for three weeks is India’s only
hope to prevent a devastating epidemic. As of Sunday, 980 people in the
country had tested positive for the coronavirus, with 24 dead.

Supervisors at a shelter for women and children in Nizamuddin, a
neighborhood in Central Delhi, said the government had given them soap
for the first time, and that they were under orders to teach those
seeking shelter about the coronavirus, and to force them to wash their
hands and take showers.

“It’s hard; they aren’t used to washing all the time,” said Rajesh
Kumar, the shelter’s
supervisor.

The previous night, he said, about 70 women with dozens of children had
started banging on the gate to the shelter, begging to be let in, saying
they had been beaten by the police for sleeping on the road. But the
shelter was full and Mr. Kumar had to turn them away.

Mr. Kumar said most homeless people he encountered had known nothing
about the coronavirus, and had awakened one day to find the police
shooing them off the streets, ordering them to practice social
distancing — a new catchword in India, as in most of the world.

“But where do the homeless go?” he asked.
