*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Alan Merrill, a guitarist and singer whose song “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll”
became Joan Jett’s breakthrough hit, and who had early success as one of
the few Western rock stars in Japan in the late 1960s and early ’70s,
died on Sunday in Manhattan.

The cause was complications of the coronavirus, his daughter Laura
Merrill said. She said he was 69, although some documents indicate that
he may have been 71.

“I was just at his show a couple of weeks ago,” Ms. Merrill [wrote in a
post on Facebook announcing his
death](https://www.facebook.com/iLookok/posts/10163563888920227). “He
played down the ‘cold’ he thought he had.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Merrill grew up in a family that was deeply connected to the music
industry. His parents were both noted jazz musicians: His mother, Helen
Merrill, is a singer; his father, [Aaron
Sachs](https://web.archive.org/web/20140626145656/http://news.allaboutjazz.com/aaron-sachs-and-jimmy-scott-gone.php),
was a saxophonist and clarinetist who died in 2014.

As a teenager, Mr. Merrill played in rock bands, and in the 1960s
auditioned to join the band the Left Banke as a guitarist. In the summer
of 1968, Mr. Merrill moved to Tokyo, where his mother had been living.

There he saw on television mop-topped, Beatles-esque bands like the
Tigers playing to crowds of screaming teenage girls.

“It was like an alternate universe where everybody’s Asian, but I think
I can get in here somehow,” he recalled thinking in an interview with
The New York Times in 2017.

Through his mother’s connections in the music business, Mr. Merrill
began playing guitar in Japanese rock bands. He joined the Lead, whose
members were all Westerners. It had a hit in 1968 with “[Akuma Ga Kureta
Aoi
Bara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gifDVY5mYbs),”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>which Mr. Merrill sang in Japanese, though he did not speak the
language.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He recorded two solo albums in Japan: “Alone in Tokyo” (1971), in
Japanese, which yielded another hit,
“[Namida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4U9D5IB3Ms)” (“Teardrops”),
and “Merrill 1” (1972), in English. At the same time, he played with the
popular glam-rock group Vodka Collins, and acted in a television soap
opera, “Jikan Desuyo.”

But by 1974 — after a disagreement with his talent manager, he said —
Mr. Merrill left for London, where he helped start a new glam-pop band,
the Arrows; he was its singer and bassist. The group had a Top 10 hit in
Britain in 1974 with “Touch Too Much.” A single the next year, “Broken
Down Heart,” was unsuccessful, but its B-side, “[I Love Rock ’n’
Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AT_Pbtyid0),” written by Mr.
Merrill and Jake Hooker, the guitarist for the Arrows, would become a
classic.

The song caught the ear of Ms. Jett, who recorded it for the first album
with her band the Blackhearts, releasing it in 1981. It held the No. 1
spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for seven weeks the following year,
and — with a few tweaks to place the song from a woman’s point of view —
launched Ms. Jett’s career as a tough-talking rock star.

“I can still remember watching the Arrows on TV in London and being
blown away by the song that screamed hit to me,” Ms. Jett recalled in a
[Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/joanjettandtheblackhearts/photos/a.129315806006/10157987982441007/?type=3&theater)
on Sunday.

In a [2009
interview](https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/alan-merrill-of-the-arrows)
with the website Songfacts, Mr. Merrill described “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll”
as a “knee-jerk response” to the 1974 Rolling Stones song “It’s Only
Rock ’n Roll (But I Like It),” and to Mick Jagger’s elite social circle.

“I almost felt like ‘It’s Only Rock ’n’ Roll’ was an apology to those
jet-set princes and princesses that he was hanging around with — the
aristocracy, you know,” Mr. Merrill said. “That was my interpretation as
a young man: OK, I love rock ’n’ roll.”

Allan Preston Sachs was born in New York on Feb. 19, either in 1949 or
1951, and grew up in the Bronx. His extended family also included the
songwriter Laura Nyro, to whom he was related through a relative’s
marriage. He and Ms. Nyro, [who died
in 1997](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/10/arts/laura-nyro-intense-balladeer-of-60-s-and-70-s-dies-at-49.html),
referred to each other as cousins, and in his teenage years he often
went to her apartment after school to watch her compose songs.

After the Arrows disbanded in 1977, Mr. Merrill played with Rick
Derringer and Meat Loaf, and in 1985 released a solo album on the
Polydor label, titled simply “Alan Merrill.” Vodka Collins reunited in
the 1990s and released three new albums, and Mr. Merrill became a
fixture in the New York rock world, playing widely and building a
reputation as a raconteur telling stories of his own singular career.

In addition to his mother and daughter, Mr. Merrill is survived by his
wife, Joanna Lisanti; another daughter, Allegra Soler; and a son, Allan
Sachs-Ambia.
