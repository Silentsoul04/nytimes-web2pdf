\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Dr. James T. Goodrich, a pediatric neurosurgeon known for successfully
separating conjoined twins in a complicated and rare procedure, died on
Monday at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical
Center in the Bronx. He was 73.

The cause was complications of the coronavirus, according to Montefiore,
where he was the director of pediatric neurosurgery and had spent more
than 30 years of his career.

Dr. Goodrich was thrust into public view when he conducted
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/nyregion/surgeons-successfully-separate-conjoined-twins.html}{a
series of four operations} over nearly a year on Clarence and Carl
Aguirre, twins from the Philippines who were joined at the tops of their
heads and shared major veins in their brains. Dr. Goodrich led a team of
surgeons at Montefiore's Children's Hospital, and the twins' story
generated headlines,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/nyregion/surgeons-prepare-to-separate-conjoined-twins.html}{including
in The New York Times}, and was the subject of television specials.

During the final surgery, in August 2004, the team discovered that the
twins' brains were connected by more brain tissue than they had
initially thought, a potentially serious complication.

``We got to this point and we were stuck,'' Dr. Goodrich told
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/nyregion/doctors-separate-twin-boys-despite-finding-brains-were-fused.html}{The
Times} after the operation, but ``we did a lot of soul-searching'' and
decided to continue.

Hours later, Clarence and Carl lay next to each other, alive and well.
They had no major complications after the surgery, and their mother,
Arlene Aguirre,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/nyregion/no-major-complications-for-separated-twins-doctors-say.html}{said},
``My dream has come true.''

Carl and Clarence, who turn 18 later this month, live with their mother
in Scarsdale, N.Y.

James Tait Goodrich was born in Portland, Ore., on April 16, 1946, to
Richard and Gail (Josselyn) Goodrich. His mother was an artist and a
designer, and his father worked in advertising. Dr. Goodrich served in
the Marines during the Vietnam War, then studied neurosurgery and
psychobiology at the University of California, Irvine; Columbia
University; and the Neurological Institute of New York before starting
at Montefiore.

He married Judy Laudin in 1970. In addition to his wife, he is survived
by three sisters, Kristine Goodrich, Jan Rentenaar and Carol Montecucco.

In another celebrated case, Dr. Goodrich led a team of 40 surgeons in a
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/health/new-york-neurosurgeon-death-coronavirus-mcdonald-twins/index.html}{27-hour
procedure in 2016} to separate another set of twin boys, the seventh
separation procedure of his long career.
