She helped transgender women in Queens contend with human trafficking,
health issues and possible deportation. Her death was attributed to the
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

When transgender women in Queens needed a safe place to be tested for
H.I.V., \href{https://www.facebook.com/lbcfny/}{Lorena Borjas} turned
her home into a clinic. When others were arrested and charged with
prostitution, she bailed them out. When some faced deportation after an
arrest, she created a nonprofit group to arrange for their legal
representation.

Ms. Borjas, an indefatigable activist who drew on her own experiences as
an immigrant transgender woman to help others, died on Monday at a
hospital in Brooklyn. She was 59.

\href{https://www.aclu.org/news/by/chase-strangio/}{Chase Strangio}, a
friend and colleague, said the cause was complications of the
coronavirus.

Ms. Borjas became a guardian angel of sorts for the transgender
community in Queens, helping women deal with sex trafficking, police
harassment, substance abuse and health problems.

Cecilia Gentili, a friend, said in a phone interview that Ms. Borjas's
efforts on behalf of other transgender women went beyond those of most
nonprofit workers.

``If one of the girls got arrested for doing sex work, she would answer
the phone at 3 in the morning and at 8 in the morning she would be in
court with a lawyer and with the money to bail you out,'' Ms. Gentili
said.

Ms. Borjas's efforts ranged from the broad-focused, like starting
nonprofits and organizing protests, to the very personal; Ms. Gentili
said she handed out condoms to sex workers on Roosevelt Avenue in
Queens. She added that Ms. Borjas was interested in breaking the
arrest-jail-deportation cycle.

In 2011 Ms. Borjas and Mr. Strangio founded the
\href{https://www.facebook.com/lbcfny/}{Lorena Borjas Community Fund} to
help transgender people embroiled in that cycle. Mr. Strangio said the
organization had put up bail for more than 50 people over the years and
raised more than \$45,000 to cover different costs.

``But this is just a fraction of what Lorena herself did,'' Mr. Strangio
wrote in an email. ``She probably helped over 100 trans people obtain
immigration status or other legal support.''

Born in Mexico City on May 29, 1960, Ms. Borjas came to the U.S. when
she was 20 and eventually earned a green card through an amnesty program
under the Reagan administration. She was convicted of several charges
related to prostitution, which were later vacated by Queens Criminal
Court because, the judge said, she was forced into prostitution by human
traffickers.

But other convictions remained on her record until Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo
pardoned her in 2017.

``With this pardon granted, I will no longer have to go to sleep at
night worrying that I will be deported back to a country that is no
longer home,'' Ms. Borjas told
\href{https://transgenderlawcenter.org/archives/case/lorena-borjas}{the
Transgender Law Center} that year. ``I will be able to live my life
without stress and fear of immigration, and I will be able to continue
doing the work I do and help more vulnerable transgender women.''

Ms. Borjas became a U.S. citizen last year.

Ms. Gentili said that Ms. Borjas's survivors include a partner and
family in Mexico and California.
