TOKYO --- Ken Shimura could make people laugh just by
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkdsvAbezj4}{tweaking a
traditional dance},
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic53hhFllPM}{mangling an English
lesson} or acting like a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpO5BG96420}{shogun fool}.

A beloved comedian in Japan, he died on Sunday in the coronavirus
pandemic at a hospital in Tokyo, the Izawa Office, which represented
him, said. He was 70.

Mr. Shimura's slapstick humor, physical comedy and naïve persona made
him a household name in Japan for nearly five decades. Generations of
children grew up watching his comedy skits and dance routines.

And before there was ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' Mr. Shimura
introduced the concept of broadcasting footage contributed by viewers on
the variety show ``Kato-Chan Ken-Chan Gokigen TV,'' which aired for six
years on Saturday nights on TBS, one of Japan's main television
networks.

Mr. Shimura started feeling sick on March 17 and developed a fever and
extreme fatigue two days later. He was hospitalized on March 20 and
tested positive for the coronavirus three days later.

The Times is telling the stories of those who have died in the pandemic.

He had recently been cast as the lead in a forthcoming film to be
directed by the well-known director Yoji Yamada. Mr. Shimura had also
been invited to be a torch runner in the Olympic relay, which was
canceled after the Tokyo Summer Olympics was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/sports/olympics/coronavirus-summer-olympics-postponed.html}{delayed}
for a year because of the pandemic.

Ken Shimura was born Yasunori Shimura on Feb. 20, 1950, in
Higashimurayama, a city in the western Tokyo metropolitan region, to
Kenji and Kazuko Shimura. His father was a schoolteacher and celebrated
judo athlete.

Mr. Shimura joined a popular music band, the Drifters, as a roadie in
1974. As the group branched into comedy, he was recruited to join it and
performed regularly with it in its television variety show. He created
characters including Baka Tonosama (stupid lord) and Henna Ojisan (weird
uncle).

One of Mr. Shimura's most famous and enduring acts was his rendition of
``Higashimurayama ondo,'' a song written about his hometown. He added
impish moves to traditional dance forms as he performed it on the
variety show, and the routine was popular enough that people all over
Japan learned the words whether they had any connection to the town or
not.

Mr. Shimura's survivors include two older brothers.
