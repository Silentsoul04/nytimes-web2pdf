*With the New York gala circuit on hiatus because of the coronavirus
outbreak, here is how some patrons and society figures are spending
their time — and money — while self-isolated. (Interviews have been
edited.)*

## Larry Milstein

**Age**: 25

**Occupation**: founder of PRZM, a Gen Z consulting firm; philanthropist

**Favorite charities:** World Health Organization’s [Covid-19 Solidarity
Response
Fund](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate),
[International Medical Corps](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/)

**Where are you hunkering down?** At my family home in Long Island.

**What do you miss most from your pre-Covid life?** I live in Manhattan.
Being at the epicenter of this global crisis is particularly
disheartening. New York is a place always pulsing with energy. To feel
that energy drained is so antithetical to what the city is.

**Have you looked for novel ways to compensate?** It occurred to me that
we needed to be doing more than sending out love and thoughts. We needed
to be creating a sense of community, raising funds and offering critical
resources. So we tried to come up with a creative solution to replicate
the sense of a charity event.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Can you describe it?** We introduced the first ever Zoom gala. The
idea was to use a digital platform for fund-raising, to foster a sense
of social connection while doing good. Unlike Instagram Live, you could
actually see the other attendees.

They included some of our committee members, people like Paul Arnhold,
Danielle Lauder and Satchel Lee, Spike Lee’s daughter. We wanted to give
guests the chance to feel their best, whether it was wearing their
finest pair of sweats or rocking an awesome party outfit.

**What were some highlights of that event?**

We had Ty Sunderland as a D.J. Cheat Codes and Anna of the North
performed.

**Have your efforts paid off?**

We raised $5,000 in less than 24 hours since announcing this party on
Tuesday night, and more than $20,000 overall. We asked for small
grass-roots donations: $25 as a base fee, but people could donate more,
or less. We wanted this to feel accessible and diverse in a way a formal
seated black-tie dinner could never be.

**How are you spending your downtime?**

I’ve been binge-watching TV. I’m midway through “The Tiger King.” And,
like a lot of Americans right now, I’m baking banana bread.

## Jill Kargman

**Age**: 45

**Occupation**: writer and actress

**Favorite charity:** [River Fund](https://www.river.fund/)

**Where is she hunkering down?** In her apartment building on the Upper
East Side.

**What’s keeping you in the city?** I don’t have a country house. And I
feel safest in New York. I think I would go crazy hearing crickets.

**Please take us through your day.** I think of reading the paper as a
full-time job. I have a love/hate relationship with my television right
now. A positive distraction has been my new Andrew Cuomo crush. He’s my
virus daddy. I love how strong his language is. I never thought of him
as sexy before. But now, he’s hot.

**What else are you doing?** I’ve made a quarantine vlog, if you will,
based on a character resurrected from a show I did in Williamstown;
later it moved to the Carlyle. I’ve called my character
[Dzanielle](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17856598183860833/?hl=en).
She lives on Instagram as a caricature of Upper East Side moms grappling
with the traumas of canceled SoulCycle classes and visible roots.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**How do you manage family time?** We’re not one of those families
working on 10,000-piece puzzles or making a fig loaf — the kind of thing
you see on Instagram. More often we’re all piled up on my bed watching
reruns of “Game of Thrones.”

**What about charity work?** I’ve just donated to the River Fund, an
organization in Queens set up to fight hunger and poverty. In the same
way there is triage in the hospital intake room, there is going to be
some philanthropic triage. People will have to prioritize. Your food
insecurity will be first. You’re not going to be thinking about the
American Friends of some international
philharmonic.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

**And your writing?** Everyone asks, “What are you working on?” That
makes me feel pressured, like I have to turn out a masterpiece. People
are always reminding you, “Shakespeare wrote ‘King Lear’ when he was
under plague quarantine.” But Shakespeare didn’t have three kids
whining, “What are we having for
dinner?”

**Is there an upside to self-isolation?** Just being together as a
family is nice. My husband and two daughters have breakfast, lunch and
dinner together every single day. I keep reading all these statistics
about how divorce rates are soaring. I think this seclusion has been
great for our marriage.

**What’s your secret to keeping calm? And connected?** We have Post
Morrow, a beautiful nature preserve, near our house. We go there on lots
of long walks. I’m also rewatching all my favorite Disney classics on
Disney+. I’ve gotten to see “Snow White,” “Sleeping Beauty,”
“Cinderella” and “Alice in Wonderland.” I’m using the Houseparty
app, which is quite fun. You can share your screen. It’s like bringing a
bunch of your friends into your room.

**What do you miss?** I never thought I would say this, but I miss
jumping on the subway to get to meetings. I miss going into a cafe and
actually being able to sit down and check a few emails

**Who’s been cleaning your house?** Um, me. (chuckles)

**Is that a challenge?** Yes.

**How are you keeping up your charitable contributions?** The Hilton
foundation has donated over $10 million to coronavirus relief efforts.
During April I am donating 20 percent of my Nicky Hilton x French Sole
shoe sales to the LifeWay Network’s Covid-19 Freedom Fund, which assists
human trafficking survivors.

**How do you envision life post-Covid?** I’m not upset that we can’t
shake hands anymore. I think we’re going to just throw that out
completely. We have become very touchy as a society; it’s not necessary.
We’ll be seeing the world through a new set of eyes and not taking basic
things for granted anymore.
