How Larry Milstein, Jill Kargman and Nicky Hilton Rothschild are
hunkering down.

\emph{With the New York gala circuit on hiatus because of the
coronavirus outbreak, here is how some patrons and society figures are
spending their time --- and money --- while self-isolated. (Interviews
have been edited.)}

\hypertarget{larry-milstein}{%
\subsection{Larry Milstein}\label{larry-milstein}}

\textbf{Age}: 25

\textbf{Occupation}: founder of PRZM, a Gen Z consulting firm;
philanthropist

\textbf{Favorite charities:} World Health Organization's
\href{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate}{Covid-19
Solidarity Response Fund},
\href{https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/}{International Medical
Corps}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?} At my family home in Long Island.

\textbf{What do you miss most from your pre-Covid life?} I live in
Manhattan. Being at the epicenter of this global crisis is particularly
disheartening. New York is a place always pulsing with energy. To feel
that energy drained is so antithetical to what the city is.

\textbf{Have you looked for novel ways to compensate?} It occurred to me
that we needed to be doing more than sending out love and thoughts. We
needed to be creating a sense of community, raising funds and offering
critical resources. So we tried to come up with a creative solution to
replicate the sense of a charity event.

\textbf{Can you describe it?} We introduced the first ever Zoom gala.
The idea was to use a digital platform for fund-raising, to foster a
sense of social connection while doing good. Unlike Instagram Live, you
could actually see the other attendees.

They included some of our committee members, people like Paul Arnhold,
Danielle Lauder and Satchel Lee, Spike Lee's daughter. We wanted to give
guests the chance to feel their best, whether it was wearing their
finest pair of sweats or rocking an awesome party outfit.

\textbf{What were some highlights of that event?}

We had Ty Sunderland as a D.J. Cheat Codes and Anna of the North
performed.

\textbf{Have your efforts paid off?}

We raised \$5,000 in less than 24 hours since announcing this party on
Tuesday night, and more than \$20,000 overall. We asked for small
grass-roots donations: \$25 as a base fee, but people could donate more,
or less. We wanted this to feel accessible and diverse in a way a formal
seated black-tie dinner could never be.

\textbf{How are you spending your downtime?}

I've been binge-watching TV. I'm midway through ``The Tiger King.'' And,
like a lot of Americans right now, I'm baking banana bread.

\hypertarget{jill-kargman}{%
\subsection{Jill Kargman}\label{jill-kargman}}

\textbf{Age}: 45

\textbf{Occupation}: writer and actress

\textbf{Favorite charity:} \href{https://www.river.fund/}{River Fund}

\textbf{Where is she hunkering down?} In her apartment building on the
Upper East Side.

\textbf{What's keeping you in the city?} I don't have a country house.
And I feel safest in New York. I think I would go crazy hearing
crickets.

\textbf{Please take us through your day.} I think of reading the paper
as a full-time job. I have a love/hate relationship with my television
right now. A positive distraction has been my new Andrew Cuomo crush.
He's my virus daddy. I love how strong his language is. I never thought
of him as sexy before. But now, he's hot.

\textbf{What else are you doing?} I've made a quarantine vlog, if you
will, based on a character resurrected from a show I did in
Williamstown; later it moved to the Carlyle. I've called my character
\href{https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17856598183860833/?hl=en}{Dzanielle}.
She lives on Instagram as a caricature of Upper East Side moms grappling
with the traumas of canceled SoulCycle classes and visible roots.

\textbf{How do you manage family time?} We're not one of those families
working on 10,000-piece puzzles or making a fig loaf --- the kind of
thing you see on Instagram. More often we're all piled up on my bed
watching reruns of ``Game of Thrones.''

\textbf{What about charity work?} I've just donated to the River Fund,
an organization in Queens set up to fight hunger and poverty. In the
same way there is triage in the hospital intake room, there is going to
be some philanthropic triage. People will have to prioritize. Your food
insecurity will be first. You're not going to be thinking about the
American Friends of some international philharmonic.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

\textbf{And your writing?} Everyone asks, ``What are you working on?''
That makes me feel pressured, like I have to turn out a masterpiece.
People are always reminding you, ``Shakespeare wrote `King Lear' when he
was under plague quarantine.'' But Shakespeare didn't have three kids
whining, ``What are we having for dinner?''

\hypertarget{nicky-hilton-rothschild}{%
\subsection{Nicky Hilton Rothschild}\label{nicky-hilton-rothschild}}

\textbf{Age}: 36

\textbf{Favorite charities}: \href{https://hiltonfoundation.org/}{Hilton
Foundation},\href{https://lifewaynetwork.org/}{LifeWay Network}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down}: At home in Brookhaven, N.Y.

\textbf{Is there an upside to self-isolation?} Just being together as a
family is nice. My husband and two daughters have breakfast, lunch and
dinner together every single day. I keep reading all these statistics
about how divorce rates are soaring. I think this seclusion has been
great for our marriage.

\textbf{What's your secret to keeping calm? And connected?} We have Post
Morrow, a beautiful nature preserve, near our house. We go there on lots
of long walks. I'm also rewatching all my favorite Disney classics on
Disney+. I've gotten to see ``Snow White,'' ``Sleeping Beauty,''
``Cinderella'' and ``Alice in Wonderland.'' I'm using the Houseparty
app, which is quite fun. You can share your screen. It's like bringing a
bunch of your friends into your room.

\textbf{What do you miss?} I never thought I would say this, but I miss
jumping on the subway to get to meetings. I miss going into a cafe and
actually being able to sit down and check a few emails

\textbf{Who's been cleaning your house?} Um, me. (chuckles)

\textbf{Is that a challenge?} Yes.

\textbf{How are you keeping up your charitable contributions?} The
Hilton foundation has donated over \$10 million to coronavirus relief
efforts. During April I am donating 20 percent of my Nicky Hilton x
French Sole shoe sales to the LifeWay Network's Covid-19 Freedom Fund,
which assists human trafficking survivors.

\textbf{How do you envision life post-Covid?} I'm not upset that we
can't shake hands anymore. I think we're going to just throw that out
completely. We have become very touchy as a society; it's not necessary.
We'll be seeing the world through a new set of eyes and not taking basic
things for granted anymore.
