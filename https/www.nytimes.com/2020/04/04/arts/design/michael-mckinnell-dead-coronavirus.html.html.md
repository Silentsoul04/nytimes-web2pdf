*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*

Michael McKinnell, whose heroically sculptural and democratically open
design for Boston City Hall catalyzed the city’s urban revival in the
late 1960s and embodied the era’s idealism and civic activism, died on
March 27 in Beverly, Mass. He was 84.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His wife and architectural partner, Stephanie Mallis, said the cause was
the coronavirus.

In 1962, the British-born Mr. McKinnell was a 26-year-old graduate
student in architecture at Columbia University working as a teaching
assistant to the German-born architect [Gerhard
Kallmann](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/arts/design/gerhard-kallmann-architect-dies-at-97.html)
when, almost on a lark, the two entered a competition to design a new
Boston City Hall. Vying with 255 other submissions, they won.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They were as amazed as anyone that they prevailed,” Ms. Mallis said.
Neither had ever built anything.

Except for fellow architects, few Americans had seen anything quite like
the winning proposal — certainly not the city’s mayor, John F. Collins,
who reportedly exclaimed on first seeing the design, “What the
\[expletive\] is that?”

It wasn’t the proper government structure of Boston’s staid red-brick
tradition; rather, it was a proudly monumental building that would
command the vast plaza of the new Government Center complex with
thunderous
authority.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What Mayor Collins saw was the exposed musculature of mighty concrete
piers supporting a massive cornice line of offices. The building was to
stand at the edge of a fanning plaza whose bricks entered the ground
floor of the structure like a carpet, running up three flights to the
City Council chambers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Spaces and forms interpenetrated. Sculptural concrete projections that
housed the chambers and the mayor’s office protruded from a modular
facade of offices. A brick amphitheater of stairs on the ground floor
accommodated gatherings of citizens, even spontaneous sit-ins; the vast
plaza in front, inspired by the Campo of Siena, Italy, anticipated the
thousands of protesters of those riotous times.

It was a benevolent structure that took the side of the people,
guaranteeing citizens free access through porous perimeters in that
cradle of American democracy.

Twenty years Mr. McKinnell’s senior, Mr. Kallmann was best known for
publishing an essay about two divergent trends in architecture: one in
which buildings were composed rigorously within a controlling grid; the
other, propelled by French and British Brutalists, in which designs in
concrete embraced sometimes violent breakout forms. The
Kallmann-McKinnell design synthesized the two approaches, the rational
and the complex.

Both men had been educated in British architecture schools that taught
that architecture’s mission was to build well in the service of a moral
and social purpose. And both had been imbued with the belief that
concrete was, as one theorist said, “the stone of our time.”

Built in concrete and brick, their robust City Hall design implicitly
critiqued the thin commercial glass-and-steel buildings then chilling
cities across America. It was a statement of protest against what Mr.
McKinnell called the “degenerate frippery and surface concerns” of
“cosmetic” architecture.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Its deliberate monumentality expressed a generosity toward the public
rather than a corporate idea of minimal expense, and its exposed
concrete surfaces gave the building a sense of authenticity — an “all
thoroughness,” Mr. McKinnell said in an interview, admitting that had
they had their way, “we would have used concrete to make the light
switches.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like the Sydney Opera House, the structure landed on postcards, the two
men’s design becoming a symbol of the new Boston. And though it proved
controversial with some members of the public, who found the rugged
materials and bold forms confrontational, it was, for most architects
and critics, the masterpiece that would hover over the rest of Mr.
McKinnell’s nearly 60-year career.

The two architects quickly won a half-dozen commissions to design a
series of buildings in and around Boston, all built in concrete. Both
received appointments to the faculty of Harvard’s Graduate School of
Design.

Their careers were inextricably linked. They even sat opposite each
other at a partners desk, passing drawings back and forth as they
conceptualized and developed projects.

Mr. Kallmann was more the theorist: He talked about architecture. Mr.
McKinnell was interested in materials, in how parts fit: He talked about
the building. He always carried a six-inch ruler in his pocket,
explaining that architecture was about measure and scaling the building
to the human body.

Their emphasis on constructional rigor would earn Mr. Kallmann and Mr.
McKinnell the sobriquet “Column and Mechanical” in one of their Harvard
classes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But by 1974, as concrete grew unpopular and a national recession took
hold, Mr. McKinnell and Mr. Kallmann found themselves out of work,
waiting for the phone to ring in a garret office on Tremont Street
overlooking Boston Common. They thought of returning to England.

At the same time, the softer architectural blandishments of
postmodernism, promising the comforts of architectural history and
tradition, were challenging
modernists.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 1978, the second act for Kallmann McKinnell & Wood, as their firm was
then called, arrived in the form of a commission for the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, to be built on a hill in residential
Cambridge, Mass. Its directors told the architects, “Not one square inch
of concrete, inside or out.”

The commission was for a house for academics, a grove of academia, and
having learned the lesson of survival — that they should design not for
an audience of architects but for clients and the public — Mr. Kallmann
and Mr. McKinnell embarked in a new direction that would last the rest
of their careers. Mr. Kallmann died in 2012.

They built the Academy with a sloping roof, like the houses around it,
and they consulted history books to evoke the turn-of-the-20th-century
architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, the brothers Charles Sumner Greene
and Henry Mather Greene, and others who used natural materials like wood
and stone. For the Academy, City Hall’s arresting vertical lines were
tranquilized into calming horizontals. And Mr. McKinnell relaxed the
interiors, realizing that a space for artists, philosophers and
historians needed to have “talking places” — nooks and crannies for
informal conversation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The critic Ada Louise Huxtable of The New York Times [wrote
approvingly](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/arts/architecture-view-classical-clarity-in-an-academic-design-cambridge-mass.html)
of the project. “The architects have felt free to find their answers in
terms of existing building types and historical precedents,” she wrote,
“rather than through the invention of new forms. The design goes
beyond modernism.”

But it was a period of style wars in architecture, and modernists
believed Mr. McKinnell and Mr. Kallmann had stepped onto a slippery
architectural slope. Indeed, years of postmodernist buildings followed
in their portfolio, designs that indulged historicism and traditions
less probingly than in the Academy building.

“Yes, it was possible to have the rigor and systematic nature of
modernism together with some symbolic and representational elements,”
Andrea Leers, a friend and teaching colleague of Mr. McKinnell’s, said
in an interview. “But to most of us, it was a kind of capitulation.”

If the firm lost the attention of modernists, it gained the support of a
larger audience, and Kallmann McKinnell & Wood went on to add scores of
employees and to attract commissions to design embassies, academic
buildings and museums around the world.

Noel Michael McKinnell was born on Dec. 25, 1935, in Salford,
Manchester, England, to Ronald and Marguerite McKinnell. His father was
an accountant who had fought in both world wars; his mother was a
homemaker.

Mr. McKinnell’s marriage to Jane D’Espo in 1961 ended in divorce.
Besides Ms. Mallis, whom he married in 2003, he is survived by two
daughters from his first marriage, Caitlin McKinnell and Phoebe
McKinnell; a sister, Sheila Sharman; and four grandchildren.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After Mr. McKinnell left his firm several years ago and moved to
Rockport, Mass., he and Ms. Mallis continued to design buildings,
completing institutional projects in Israel. They also both painted.

He remained the dedicated architect and builder even on his deathbed.
After he refused life support in the hospital in Beverly, he spoke by
telephone with his wife, herself isolated at home because of the
coronavirus. He described to her the design for a grave site, to be
created in their backyard garden in Rockport overlooking the sea. It
would be a simple square of white roses, his favorite flower, planted in
a lower terrace on an axis with another flower bed on the upper one.

As he described it, she drew the design. The gravestone itself, carved
with both their names, would be granite, not
concrete.
