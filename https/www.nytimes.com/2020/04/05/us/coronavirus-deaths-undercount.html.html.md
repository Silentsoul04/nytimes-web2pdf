WASHINGTON — A coroner in Indiana wanted to know if the coronavirus had
killed a man in early March, but said that her health department denied
a test. Paramedics in New York City say that many patients who died at
home were never tested for the coronavirus, even if they showed telltale
signs of infection.

In Virginia, a funeral director prepared the remains of three people
after health workers cautioned her that they each had tested positive
for the coronavirus. But only one of the three had the virus noted on
the death certificate.

Across the United States, even as [coronavirus
deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html)
are being recorded in terrifying numbers — many hundreds each day — the
true death toll is likely much higher.

More than 9,400 people with the coronavirus have been reported to have
died in this country as of this weekend, but hospital officials,
doctors, public health experts and medical examiners say that official
counts have failed to capture the true number of Americans dying in this
pandemic. The undercount is a result of inconsistent protocols, limited
resources and a patchwork of decision making from one state or county to
the next.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In many rural areas, coroners say they don’t have the tests they need to
detect the disease. Doctors now believe that some deaths in February and
early March, before the coronavirus reached epidemic levels in the
United States, were likely misidentified as influenza or only described
as pneumonia.

With no uniform system for reporting coronavirus-related deaths in the
United States, and a continued shortage of tests, some states and
counties have improvised, obfuscated and, at times, backtracked in
counting the dead.

“We definitely think there are deaths that we have not accounted for,”
said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Health Security, which studies global health threats and is
[closely tracking](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/) the
coronavirus pandemic.

Late last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued
new guidance for how to certify coronavirus deaths, underscoring the
need for uniformity and reinforcing the sense by health care workers and
others that deaths have not been consistently tracked. In its
[guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf), the
C.D.C. instructed officials to report deaths where the patient has
tested positive or, in an absence of testing, “if the circumstances are
compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In infectious outbreaks, public health experts say that under typical
circumstances it takes months or years to compile data that is as
accurate as possible on deaths. The reporting system during an epidemic
of this scale is particularly strained. And while experts say they
believe that virus-related deaths have been missed, the extent of the
problem is not clear.

But as mayors and governors hold daily news conferences reporting the
latest figures of infections and deaths related to Covid-19, Americans
have paid close attention to the locations and numbers of the sick and
dead — one of the few metrics available for understanding the new and
mysterious disease threatening their
communities.

Public health experts say that an accurate count of deaths is an
essential tool to understand a disease outbreak as it unfolds: The more
deadly a disease, the more aggressively the authorities are willing to
disrupt normal life. Precise death counts can also inform the federal
government on how to target resources, like ventilators from the
national stockpile, to the areas of the country with the most desperate
need.

For families who have lost a loved one in the midst of this epidemic,
there is an urge simply to know: Was it the coronavirus?

## Lingering questions

As the coronavirus outbreak began sweeping across the country last
month, Julio Ramirez, a 43-year-old salesman in San Gabriel, Calif.,
came home from a business trip and began feeling unwell, suffering from
a fever, cough and body aches. By the next day, he had lost his sense of
taste and smell.

His wife, Julie Murillo, took him to an urgent care clinic several days
later, where he was so weak he had to be pushed in a wheelchair. Doctors
prescribed antibiotics, a cough syrup and gave him a chest X-ray, but
they did not test for the coronavirus, she said. Just over a week after
he returned from his trip, Ms. Murillo found him dead in his bed.

“I kept trying to get him tested from the beginning,” Ms. Murillo said.
“They told me no.”

Frustrated, Ms. Murillo enlisted friends to call the C.D.C. on her
behalf, urging a post-mortem test. Then she hired a private company to
conduct an autopsy; the owner pleaded for a coronavirus test from local
and federal authorities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Saturday afternoon, 19 days after the death, Ms. Murillo received a
call from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, she said.
The health department had gone to the funeral home where her husband’s
body was resting and taken a sample for a coronavirus test. He tested
positive.

In a statement, the health department said that post-mortem testing has
been conducted on “a number of cases,” but did not provide specifics or
comment on Mr. Ramirez’s case.

The work of counting deaths related to the virus falls to an assortment
of health care providers, medical examiners, coroners, funeral homes and
local health departments that fill out America’s death certificates. The
documents typically include information on the immediate cause of death,
such as a heart attack or pneumonia, as well as on any underlying
disease. In coronavirus cases, that would be
Covid-19.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The federal government does not expect to produce a final tally of
coronavirus deaths until 2021, when it publishes an annual compilation
of the country’s leading causes of death.

A [New York Times
tally](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
of known Covid-related deaths, based on reports from state and local
officials, showed 9,470 deaths as of Sunday. On Friday, the National
Center for Health Statistics, part of the C.D.C., began publishing
preliminary estimates of coronavirus deaths, although a spokesman said
that information would have a “lag of 1-2 weeks.” Its[first
estimate](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/) noted 1,150 ****
deaths, based on the number of death certificates that included Covid-19
as an underlying disease.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is not a ‘real time’ count of Covid deaths, like what the states are
currently reporting,” Jeff Lancashire, a spokesman for the National
Center for Health Statistics, said.

But those who work with death certificates say they worry that relying
only on those documents may leave out a significant number of cases in
which coronavirus was confirmed by testing, but not written down in the
section where doctors and coroners are asked to note relevant underlying
diseases. Generally, [certificates
require](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/blue_form.pdf) an immediate
cause, and encourage — but do not require — officials to take note of an
underlying disease.

Then there are the many suspected cases.

Susan Perry, the funeral director from Virginia, said that she was
informed by health workers and families that three recently deceased
people had tested positive for the virus so that she and her staff could
take necessary precautions with the bodies. Only one death certificate
mentioned the virus.

“This probably happens all the time with different diseases, but this is
the first time I’m paying attention to it,” Ms. Perry said. “If we don’t
know the numbers, how are we going to be able to prepare ourselves and
protect ourselves?”

## ‘Now we’re having the “aha\!” moment’

Early in the U.S. outbreak, virus-linked deaths may have been
overlooked, hospital officials said. A late start to coronavirus testing
hampered hospitals’ ability to detect the infection among patients with
flulike symptoms in February and early March. Doctors at several
hospitals reported treating pneumonia patients who eventually died
before testing was available.

“When I was working before we had testing, we had a ton of patients with
pneumonia,” said Geraldine M**é**nard, chief of general internal
medicine at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans. “I remember thinking
it was weird. I’m sure some of those patients did have it. But no one
knew back
then.”

An emergency department physician in San Francisco recalled two deaths
that were probably coronavirus but not identified as such. One patient
died at home; a relative in the same home later tested positive for the
disease. Another patient was an older man who came to the hospital with
typical coronavirus symptoms, and who had been in contact with someone
recently traveling to China, but arrived at the hospital before testing

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?

        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In New York City, emergency medical workers say that infection and death
rates are probably far higher than reported. Given a record number of
calls, many ambulance crews have encouraged anyone not critically ill to
stay home. The result, medics say, is that many presumed coronavirus
patients may never know for sure if they had the virus, so any who later
die at home may never be categorized as having had it.

Across the country, coroners are going through a process of
re-evaluation, reconsidering deaths that occurred before testing was
widely available. Coroners and medical examiners generally investigate
deaths that are considered unusual, or result from accidents or
suicides, or occur at home.

Joani Shields, the coroner in Monroe County, Ind., said she wondered
about a man diagnosed with pneumonia who died in early March.

A coronavirus test was requested at the time, but the local health
department denied it, Ms. Shields said, on the ground that the supply of
tests was too limited.

“I wish we could have tested him,” she said.

In Shelby County, Ala., Lina Evans, the coroner, said she was now
suspicious of a surge in deaths in her county earlier this year, many of
which involved severe pneumonia: “We had a lot of hospice deaths this
year, and now it makes me go back and think, wow, did they have Covid?
Did that accelerate their death?”

Ms. Evans, who is also a nurse, is frustrated that she will never know.

“When we go back to those deaths that occurred earlier this year, people
who were negative for flu, now we’re having the ‘aha\!’ moment,” she
said. “They should have been tested for the coronavirus. As far as
underreporting, I would say, definitely.”

## Disparate reporting, more waiting

Even now, as testing is more widely available, there is a patchwork of
standards about information being reported by state and local health
officials on deaths in the United States.

Around the world, keeping an accurate death toll has been a challenge
for governments. Availability of testing and other resources have
affected the official counts in some places, and [significant
questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html)
have emerged about official government tallies in places such as China
and Iran.

In the U.S., uncertainties and inconsistencies have emerged, and health
departments have had to backtrack on cases of previously reported
deaths. Florida officials rescinded an announcement of a Covid death in
Pasco County. In Hawaii, the state’s first announced coronavirus death
was later re-categorized as unrelated after officials admitted
misreading test results. Los Angeles county officials announced that a
child had died from the virus, then said they were unsure whether the
virus caused the death, then declined to explain the confusion.

Adding to the complications, different jurisdictions are using distinct
standards for attributing a death to the coronavirus and, in some cases,
are relying on techniques that would lower the overall count of
fatalities.

In Blaine County, Idaho, the local health authority requires a positive
test to certify a death the result of coronavirus. But in Alabama, the
state health department requires a physician to review a person’s
medical records to determine whether the virus was actually the root
cause of death.

“This is in the interest of having the most accurate, and most
transparent data that we can provide,” said Karen Landers, a district
medical officer with the Alabama Department of Public Health. “We
recognize that different sites might do it differently.”

So far, the state has received reports of 45 people with the coronavirus
dying, but has only certified 31 of those deaths as a result of the
virus.

Experts who study mortality statistics caution that it may take months
for scientists to calculate a fatality rate for coronavirus in the
United States that is as accurate as possible.

Some researchers say there may never be a truly accurate, complete count
of deaths. It has happened before. Experts
[believe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3827586/) that
widespread news coverage in 1976 of a potential swine flu epidemic — one
that never materialized — led to a rash of deaths recorded as influenza
that, in years prior, would have been categorized as pneumonia.

“We’re still debating the death toll of the Spanish flu” of 1918-19,
said St**é**phane Helleringer, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins
University Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It might take a long
time. It’s not just that the data is messy, but because the effects of a
pandemic disease are very complex.”

Sarah Kliff reported from Washington, and Julie Bosman from Chicago.
Reporting was contributed by Mitch Smith in Overland Park, Kan., and Ali
Watkins in New York. Susan C. Beachy contributed research from New York.
