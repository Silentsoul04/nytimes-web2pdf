A 39-year-old woman took Flight 701 from Doha, Qatar, to John F. Kennedy
International Airport in late February, the final leg of her trip home
to New York City from Iran.

A week later, on March 1, she tested positive for the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/upshot/coronavirus-response-fax-machines.html),
the first confirmed case in New York City of an outbreak that had
already devastated China and parts of Europe. The next day, [Gov. Andrew
M.
Cuomo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/style/cuomo-ny-tough-video-coronavirus.html),
appearing with Mayor Bill de Blasio at a news conference, promised that
health investigators would track down every person on the woman’s
flight. But no one did.

A day later, [a lawyer from New
Rochelle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-state.html),
a New York City suburb, tested positive for the virus — an alarming sign
because he had not traveled to any affected country, suggesting
community spread was already taking place.

Although city investigators had traced the lawyer’s whereabouts and
connections to the most crowded corridors of Manhattan, the state’s
efforts focused on the suburb, not the city, and Mr. de Blasio urged the
public not to worry. “We’ll tell you the second we think you should
change your behavior,” [the mayor said on
March 5](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-cases.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For many days after the first positive test, as the coronavirus silently
spread throughout the New York region, [Mr.
Cuomo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/style/cuomo-ny-tough-video-coronavirus.html),
Mr. de Blasio and their top aides projected an unswerving confidence
that the outbreak would be readily contained.

There would be cases, they repeatedly said, but New York’s hospitals
were some of the best in the world. Plans were in place.
[Responses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/upshot/coronavirus-response-fax-machines.html)
had been rehearsed during “tabletop” exercises. After all, the city had
been here before — Ebola, Zika, the H1N1 virus, even Sept. 11.

“Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers — I speak for the mayor also on
this one — we think we have the best health care system on the planet
right here in New York,” [Mr. Cuomo said on
March 2](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-novel-coronavirus-briefing-governor-cuomo-announces-state).
“So, when you’re saying, what happened in other countries versus what
happened here, we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in
other countries.”

But now, New York City and the surrounding suburbs have become the
epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, with far more cases than
many countries have. [More than 138,000 people in the state have tested
positive for the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html),
with nearly all of them in the city and nearby suburbs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo announced that 731 more people had died of the
virus, the state’s highest one-day total yet. The overall death toll in
New York is 5,489 people.

Epidemiologists have pointed to [New York City’s
density](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-crowds-density.html)
and its role as an international hub of commerce and tourism to explain
why the coronavirus has spread so rapidly. And it seems highly unlikely
that any response by the state or city could have fully stopped the
pandemic.

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From the earliest days of the crisis, state and city officials were also
hampered by a [chaotic and often dysfunctional federal
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html),
including [significant problems with the expansion of coronavirus
testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html),
which made it far harder to gauge the scope of the outbreak.

Normally, New York would get help from Washington in such a time, as it
did after Sept. 11. But [President Trump in February and early
March](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html)
minimized the coronavirus threat, clashing with his own medical experts
and failing to marshal the might of the federal government soon after
cases emerged in the United States.

As a result, state and city officials often had to make decisions early
on without full assistance from the federal government.

Even so, the initial efforts by New York officials to stem the outbreak
were hampered by their own confused guidance, unheeded warnings, delayed
decisions and political infighting, The New York Times found.

“Flu was coming down, and then you saw this new ominous spike. And it
was Covid. And it was spreading widely in New York City before anyone
knew it,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former head of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the city’s
Health Department. “You have to move really fast. Hours and days. Not
weeks. Once it gets a head of steam, there is no way to stop it.”

Dr. Frieden said that if the [state and city had adopted widespread
social-distancing measures a week or two
earlier](https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1247184873615433729),
including closing schools, stores and restaurants, then the estimated
death toll from the outbreak might have been reduced by 50 to 80
percent.

But New York mandated those measures after localities in states
including California and Washington had done so.

San Francisco, for example, ordered schools closed on [March 12 when
that city had 18 confirmed
cases](https://www.kron4.com/health/coronavirus/san-francisco-reports-4-new-coronavirus-cases-bringing-total-to-18/);
Ohio also ordered its schools
[closed](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2020-03-12/ohio-gov-mike-dewine-orders-all-k-12-schools-closed)
on the same day, with five confirmed cases. Mr. de Blasio ordered
schools in New York to close three days later [when the city had 329
cases](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-calls-president-trump-take-comprehensive-federal-action-combat-novel-coronavirus).

Then seven Bay Area counties [imposed stay-at-home rules on
March 17](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/california-covid-19.html).
Two days later, the entire [state of California ordered the
same](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/California-stay-at-home-order-virus.html).
New York State’s stay-at-home order came on the 20th, [and went into
effect on
March 22](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/ny-ca-stay-home-order.html).

“New York City as a whole was late in social measures,” said Isaac B.
Weisfuse, a [former New York City deputy health
commissioner](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/nyregion/18flu.html).
“Any after-action review of the pandemic in New York City will focus
on that issue. It has become the major issue in the transmission of the
virus.”

Interviews with more than 60 people on the front-lines of the unfolding
crisis — city and state officials, hospital executives, health care
workers, union leaders and emergency medical workers — revealed how the
virus overwhelmed the city’s longstanding preparations, leaving
officials to improvise. Many spoke on the record; others spoke
anonymously to describe private meetings and conversations without fear
of losing their jobs.

“Everything was slow,” said Councilman Stephen T. Levin, a Brooklyn
Democrat who had called for City Hall to take swifter action as the
outbreak spread. “You have to adapt really quickly, and nothing we were
doing was adapting quickly.”

Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have focused intensely in recent days
on vastly expanding the ability of the health care system to treat
coronavirus patients [as the outbreak nears its
peak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-peak.html).
The state and city have set up new hospital wards, scoured the world for
ventilators and protective gear and aggressively recruited doctors and
nurses around the country.

Mr. Cuomo has been praised for his informative daily news conferences,
where he not only focuses on the facts of the pandemic but also seeks to
rally the public’s support for efforts to curb the spread. Mr. de Blasio
has also made outreach a priority.

Still, Mr. Cuomo has at times acknowledged the difficulties in fighting
the outbreak.

“I am tired of being behind this virus,” [he said on
March 31](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-new).
“We’ve been playing catch-up. You don’t win playing catch-up.”

The governor’s aides said he was referring to the country as a whole,
not New York.

The governor and the mayor emphasized that they had no misgivings about
their initial handling of their response. They said that their efforts
spurred the Trump administration to act more decisively to curb the
outbreak. New York was the first state to obtain federal approval for
its own coronavirus testing.

“Every action I took was criticized at the time as premature,” Mr. Cuomo
said in an interview. “The facts have proven my decisions correct.”

Mr. de Blasio said in a statement, “We’re dealing with a virus that’s
only months old and science that changes by the day,” adding that
“hindsight is a luxury none of us have in the heat of
battle.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From the start, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo projected as much concern
about panic as they did about the virus.

“We can really keep this thing contained,” [Mr. de Blasio said at a news
conference](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus.html)
about virus preparations in late February.

That tone continued even after the first positive case was announced on
March 1.

“Everybody is doing exactly what we need to do,” said Mr. Cuomo, seated
with Mr. de Blasio, at a news conference on March 2. “We have been ahead
of this from Day 1.”

Hospitals also expressed confidence in their plans for responding to a
pandemic, with the Healthcare Association of New York State declaring on
March 2 that its members were “[prepared for an influx of patients
caused
by](https://www.hanys.org/communications/pr/2020/2020-03-02_coronavirus.cfm)Covid-19.”

But few, if any, appeared to have made significant efforts before the
virus hit to greatly increase supplies of ventilators or protective
gear, [looking instead to draw on emergency government
stockpiles](https://www.gnyha.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3_GNYHA-Statement-Hospital-Preparedness-for-Coronavirus.pdf).

Officials seemed to speak and act based on the assumption that the virus
had not arrived in the state until that first case — the woman traveling
from Iran. State and local officials now acknowledge that the virus was
almost certainly in New York much earlier.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Infectious disease specialists had known for weeks before any positive
test had occurred that many of the early cases would be missed because
of significant flaws in federal testing.

Bruce Farber, the chief of infectious diseases for two hospitals within
Northwell Health, the largest hospital system in New York, said that by
late January, it was apparent that cases would soon begin appearing in
the United States. He said he and his colleagues realized, as they
reviewed the strictly limited federal testing criteria during a Feb. 7
meeting, that many infected people would not be identified.

Only those with a fever severe enough to require hospitalization and who
had traveled to China in the previous 14 days could get tested, Dr.
Farber told them, reading from the C.D.C. guidelines.

“It was that moment that I think everybody in the room realized, we’re
dead,” Dr. Farber said.

For both city and state, the initial plan was to trace, isolate and
contain each case. Mr. Cuomo promised that they would go further than
necessary to find every connection to the woman who arrived from Iran.

“Out of an abundance of caution we will be contacting the people who
were on the flight with her from Iran to New York,” he said.

But no one ever did that work. Local officials could only request an
investigation from the C.D.C., and the agency did not perform one
because they believed at the time she had not been contagious during the
flight, officials said. Neither Mr. Cuomo nor Mr. de Blasio publicly
mentioned finding the plane passengers again.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That’s because new cases in the area kept emerging: the lawyer in New
Rochelle who worked in Manhattan but had no connection to the first case
and had not traveled to countries affected by the virus. Then two more
people in New York City tested positive, also unconnected to the
affected countries and, more ominously, to each
other.

people, city officials said.

By comparison, in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, more than
9,000 such workers were deployed. New York City added to its original 50
only after the outbreak began to accelerate.

Because of the limits on testing, said the mayor’s press secretary,
Freddi Goldstein, “all the detectives in the world would have been
useless.”

By March 5, Mr. de Blasio seemed to acknowledge the virus had spread
beyond control. “You have to assume it could be anywhere in the city,”
he said.

Still, not wanting to cause undue alarm, he told New Yorkers to go on
with their normal lives, which left many confused about the danger they
faced.

The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, had sought to
reassure commuters, in early February, that “this is not something that
you’re going to contract in the subway or on the bus.” The mayor
reiterated the point several times in early March.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But there seemed to be little basis for that confidence.

The C.D.C. in early February said it was “unclear” if the virus could be
transferred on surfaces and, by March, said that it might “[be
possible](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html)”
for someone to get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then
touching their face. The virus mainly spreads between people in close
contact, the agency has said, such as occurs on a crowded subway.

State and city officials blamed the confusing messages on shifting
guidance from the federal government.

But by the second week in March, as the virus continued to spread
widely, Mr. de Blasio also clashed over messaging with his own Health
Department.

The mayor wanted widespread testing, but senior Health Department
officials believed it was a waste of limited resources. They urged
instead a public awareness campaign to tell people with mild symptoms to
stay home and not infect others, or themselves, by going to testing
centers.

City Hall blocked the department from releasing that message to the
public, until the mayor eventually backed down in the third week in
March.

New York City’s system for detecting infectious diseases was flashing
danger.

While only about 100 cases of the coronavirus had been confirmed in the
whole state, [the city’s surveillance
system](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/disease-reporting) was,
by the end of the first week in March, signaling a spike in
influenza-like illnesses at emergency rooms. A few days later, the
number of police officers calling out sick jumped noticeably, as did
calls to 911 for fever and cough.

The governor and the mayor began taking limited steps to restrict
people’s activities, but even those were met with resistance.

Locals complained when the governor ordered a porous “containment area”
for New Rochelle, where a cluster had emerged. It meant closing schools
and gathering places in a one-mile radius of a synagogue at the center
of the outbreak, while allowing movement in and out.

Each day brought some new action.

The governor declared a state of emergency, worked to expand testing
capacity and, later, secured the construction of field hospitals. The
mayor and the governor encouraged work-from-home. They restricted large
gatherings to 500 people, and reduced by half the occupancy for
restaurants and bars. Broadway closed. So did most other big
entertainment
venues.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Still some people flouted the rules, continuing to gather in public.

But the biggest and most prolonged battle centered on closing the city’s
school system, with its 1.1 million students. Doing so would amount to a
virtual shutdown of the
city.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mayor and his aides worried about the effect on the poorest and most
vulnerable New Yorkers. For Mr. de Blasio, whose progressive political
identity has been defined by his attention to the city’s have-nots, the
crisis presented a stark and unwelcome choice to harm some New Yorkers
in order to save others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If you suddenly in one day close down the schools, how do you make sure
that you are providing for these kids and their parents?” said Emma
Wolfe, a top aide to Mr. de Blasio. “We’re not in the suburbs. We can’t
tell people to stay at home and play around in your yard.”

Behind the scenes, top health officials were growing increasingly
alarmed. Demetre Daskalakis, the city’s head of disease control,
threatened to quit if the schools were not closed, a city official said.
City Hall said no such threat reached the mayor’s attention.

And Dr. Barbot — who at the start of the outbreak had insisted that “New
Yorkers remain at low risk” — gave a far scarier assessment to a
closed-door meeting of business executives in City Hall on March 12: Up
to 70 percent of city residents could become infected.

The time for containment was over, she added. Mr. de Blasio, seated
beside her at the meeting, stared daggers as she spoke.

“Why don’t you shut down restaurants now?” a chief executive who
attended the meeting recalled someone asking the mayor.

“I’m really concerned about restaurateurs; I’m really concerned about
jobs,” the mayor responded, the executive recalled. Mr. de Blasio had
urged New Yorkers to start social distancing and work from home where
possible.

The following weekend, even though Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo had
ordered occupancy limits for restaurants and bars, much of the city’s
nightlife appeared to continue
apace.

State and city officials believed they were doing everything possible to
confront the outbreak, moving from big decision to big decision so
quickly that each day, they said, felt like a year. They blamed the
spread in New York on the federal government, which they say dragged its
feet on testing. For weeks, Mr. Trump [brushed aside
concerns](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007067717/trumps-coronavirus-statements.html)
that the outbreak would damage the country.

“We have it totally under control,” Mr. Trump said in late January. A
month later, he advised Americans to “view this the same as the flu.”

But local officials did have control over closing schools and
businesses. While they waited on making a decision, other major cities
were moving toward shutdowns.

In California, Los Angeles followed San Francisco’s lead and ordered its
schools closed on March 13, after 40 cases of the virus had been
confirmed. On that same day, there were nearly four times as many
confirmed cases in New York, but City Hall did not yet support closing
schools.

And even as aides to the mayor and governor, both Democrats, worked
closely together on the response, old rivalries crept in. Though the two
leaders put up a unified front at the outset of the outbreak, it was
clear by the middle of March that a high-stakes version of their
longstanding political battles was playing out. The March 2 news
conference has been their only appearance together.

First, Mr. Cuomo sought to force the mayor’s hand on the schools, state
officials said.

In a series of calls during the second weekend in March, the governor
worked with the Greater New York Hospital Association, a powerful
hospital lobby, to address the question of child care for health care
workers in the event that schools closed. That had been a sticking point
for those workers’ union, 1199 SEIU, which has deep ties to City Hall.
The hospital association volunteered to raise funds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The union, which had questioned the need to close schools on that
Friday, was by Sunday calling for closure.

That Sunday morning, March 15, Health Department officials gave Mr. de
Blasio some chilling forecasts of the number of possible dead if more
restrictions were not imposed. Closing schools was necessary, and most
businesses too. By then, the city had a plan to create [centers for the
children of health care
workers](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enrollment-help/regional-enrichment-centers),
as well as emergency medical workers.

Finally, Mr. de Blasio was persuaded.

As the city prepared an announcement to close the schools, Mr. Cuomo
announced the shutdown during a television appearance. Mr. de Blasio
made it official that evening, and then announced restaurants and bars
would be closed for everything but takeout and delivery.

After the decision on schools, the mayor became more assertive in
suggesting major changes in daily
life.

New Yorkers would probably soon have to be kept at home for all but the
most necessary needs, he said on March 17 — a “shelter-in-place” order
similar to what had already been implemented in the Bay Area of
California.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This time, Mr. Cuomo was the one who resisted. He favored a more gradual
shutdown.

“I’m as afraid of the fear and the panic as I am of the virus, and I
think that the fear is more contagious than the virus right now,” the
governor said when asked two days later about the mayor’s comments.

He chastised the mayor for a poor communication strategy.

But then California moved first: Gov. Gavin Newsom [issued a statewide
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/California-stay-at-home-order-virus.html)
for residents to stay at home. The state had 675 confirmed cases of the
virus.

That same day, March 19, New York had more than 4,152.

That night, roughly 20 prominent New York leaders — including local
members of Congress, two borough presidents, City Council members and
civic and religious figures — joined a conference call convened by the
state attorney general, Letitia James.

“I was growing very frustrated over the schism between the mayor and the
governor,” said one person on the call, who captured the sentiment.
After the call, a participant conveyed those feelings to the governor’s
office.

Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s top aide, said Mr. Cuomo decided on his
plan to “pause” New York during an afternoon meeting with his health
commissioner, before the call or Mr. Newsom’s order.

The governor had been reviewing disturbing projections about the spread
of the virus since 4:30 a.m., she said.

“OK, let’s shut it down,” she recalled the governor saying. He announced
it the next day.

By that point, March 20, the state had more than 7,000 confirmed
cases.

Leaders of the New York Police Department now start each day with a
review of how many of its 36,000 uniformed officers are sick. By early
April, it was around 19 percent.

“It’s been a struggle,” said the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea.
Only the fact of a shutdown city has helped.

No parades or protests. No calls to schools. Fewer calls for police in
general. The calls to 911, instead, are mostly for ambulances. First it
was 5,000 a day. Then 6,000. A record almost daily.

That New York City, mammoth and interconnected, would be hit hard by the
pandemic may have been inevitable. But Washington, and then New York,
had options. The state’s leaders had power over key decisions.

Their aides argue they moved as fast as possible given the flawed
information they had from the federal government and in the midst of a
fast-moving crisis on a scale none had seen before.

“This is an enemy that we have underestimated from Day 1,” Mr. Cuomo
said on Monday. “And we have paid the price dearly.”

Jesse Drucker, Luis Ferré Sadurní, Joseph Goldstein, Jeffery C. Mays,
Jesse McKinley, Brian M. Rosenthal and Michael Rothfeld contributed
reporting.
