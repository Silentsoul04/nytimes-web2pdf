## ‘Roll Up Your Sleeves, Girls’

### Hosted by Cheryl Strayed, produced by Kelly Prime and edited by Sara Sarasohn

#### Cheryl Strayed calls the writer Margaret Atwood to talk about hard times, pansies and eight decades of getting it done.

Wednesday, April 8th, 2020

</div>

  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Margaret Atwood, the legendary,
    extraordinary Margaret Atwood. Author of so many novels and books of
    poetry and children’s books. I was still in my teens when The
    Handmaid’s Tale came out, and I read it and was astonished by it.
    And I’ve loved her ever since. She’s written so powerfully about
    people in incredibly difficult circumstances, people who can’t even
    use their own names, people whose movement is constricted and whose
    thought is constricted. And I think that there’s something, in
    essence, the way she writes about how we persist in the face of
    extreme difficulty that I felt like she might be the person to talk
    to at this very moment when so many of us are wondering, well, how
    do we live this new way? And what is the way forward?

  - \[music\]  
    Margaret Atwood has written about that in so many ways and so many
    forms for decades now. I’m going to give her a call.

  - \[beeping\]

  - \[chime\]

  - margaret atwood  
    Hi, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, Margaret. I’m so glad to talk to you.

  - margaret atwood  
    Lovely to talk to you.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So where are you, Margaret? And who are you with?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’m right in my study. My sister is here. She has brought her sewing
    machine. I’ve dredged out my ancient sewing machine. And we’re going
    to make facemasks.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s so wonderful.

  - margaret atwood  
    And we’re going to go get some blue shop towels, because apparently
    they make good linings.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Really?

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Now, is this sewing machine — tell me, is this something you’ve had
    for a long time? And how did you learn to sew?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’ve had it for a long time. I sewed all my clothes in high school,
    as people who were that way inclined did. And I also sewed clothes
    for my baby sister, who is here with me right now. She’s 12 years
    younger. And I also, of course, sewed for my daughter. And I sewed
    for myself for years. And then I just kind of didn’t for a while. So
    I’m going to have to learn how to re-thread this thing and oil it
    and all of those things. But I think I can probably get back into
    the groove.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. You know, it’s so funny that you should say that. Because,
    honestly, just two days ago, my daughter Bobbi, who is named after
    my mother Bobbi, said, do we have a sewing machine? And I said, I
    do. It’s in the basement. And it was your grandmother’s. The
    grandmother she never met, my mother, was an amazing seamstress and
    sewed all of my clothes when I was growing up. And so we pulled it
    upstairs. And it was the same thing. I was like, OK, I used to know
    how to thread this thing.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. Where does the thread go?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. But it’s the same thing. And I think it’s fascinating. We’re
    kind of going back in time in an interesting way. You grew up in
    rural northern Quebec, right?

  - margaret atwood  
    OK, well, it depends what part of growing up you’re talking about.
    So one to five, out in the backwoods of Quebec — except in the
    winters, it was city. It was Ottawa. And then by the time I was 12,
    I was spending a full year in school. And that would be in Toronto.
    And that was where I was doing all of the sewing. So we started in
    grade 8. And guess what we made for our mothers?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Aprons.

  - margaret atwood  
    You got it.

  - \[laughter\]  
    They were so appreciative.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I know. You know why I know that? The same thing. I grew up in
    northern Minnesota. Now, I’m a little younger than you. I’m 51. And
    you are —

  - margaret atwood  
    That isn’t just a little younger, Cheryl.

  - \[laughter\]  
    That is a lot younger.

  - cheryl strayed  
    OK, how old are you?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’m 80.

  - cheryl strayed  
    But no, the same thing. So this is something you and I share in
    common, this growing up in the sort of wilds of the north country. I
    was northern Minnesota. But because of that, I think of myself as an
    honorary Canadian.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, it’s very close.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Very close, yeah. And so I’m curious. Is it true you didn’t go to
    sort of formal school until you were about 12?

  - margaret atwood  
    No, in the winters I went. Because my dad was a forest entomologist.
    That means bugs that eat trees. And they are dormant in the winter.
    They don’t do anything. So we were always in the city at that time.
    But it was the war. And there was no school, Cheryl. There wasn’t
    any pre-school. There wasn’t any daycare. There wasn’t any schooly
    school school until grade one. So I didn’t go to school until I was
    six. What a shock. It was horrible.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Was it? Was it?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, sit in a desk in a row. It was also the military phase of
    school. So you did a lot of marching here and there. And the girls
    door, the boys door — you lined up, and then you marched in. And it
    was some kind of eternal curse if you went in the wrong door.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I’m going to guess that this approach was always contrary to
    your spirit.

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, who knows?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I mean, you seem kind of —

  - margaret atwood  
    Who knows what your spirit is when you’re seven?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, I don’t know —

  - margaret atwood  
    You don’t actually know.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think I disagree. I mean, you have a daughter, right? I mean,
    wasn’t she who she is the minute she was born? Didn’t you feel her
    personality?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, sure, but you have to wait and find out what form that is
    going to take.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So when you think about when you became you — I mean, what were you
    like as a girl?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I was — like all kids, you’re in different ways at different
    ages. Are you not?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah.

  - margaret atwood  
    So I would say I was a happy four-year-old. I was a glum
    nine-year-old. I was a shy 12-year-old. And I was the life of the
    party at 16.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And then ever since.

  - margaret atwood  
    But what else do you need to know?

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, Margaret, so when I emailed you and asked if I could call you,
    I told you. I said, this “Sugar Calling” thing, I’m really
    interested in talking to writers who are over the age of 60, because
    I’m seeking wisdom. And your reply was, well, I’d love to do it. I
    don’t know if I have any wisdom to offer. And of course, I know
    you’re wrong about that. But what I’m curious is, are you wiser
    now than you were at 40, or 60 or 20?

  - margaret atwood  
    No, I’m wiser than I was at 17. And if that isn’t true for other
    people, they’re in trouble.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think we all are.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, so I’d say I’m wiser than I was at 17. And I’m wiser than I
    was at 30. But then you start thinking of wise people you have
    known. So I think my parents were both pretty wise. My mother
    especially was exceptionally wise. My grandmother was very wise. And
    one of the wise things about them was that they instinctively
    followed the rule of the Inuit people of northern Canada, which is,
    when you’re an elder — and it’s other people who decide whether
    you’re an elder or not. It’s not just being old. But when you’re
    an elder, you’re considered to be wise. But you don’t offer any
    advice unless people ask you for it. And I think that’s a pretty
    wise thing to do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I agree entirely.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, so when my daughter had a child, my friends said to me, just
    remember, you know nothing.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think that’s part of wisdom, knowing when to stay silent and to
    simply let somebody make their choices, to sit back and witness.

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, they’ll ask you for advice if they want it. And if they don’t
    want it, they’re not going to listen to it anyway. So why waste your
    time?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Well, I certainly consider you an elder, Margaret. I mean,
    you have —

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I’ll tell you if I don’t know the answer.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Thank you. So I want to —

  - margaret atwood  
    Or I will say, Cheryl, what do you think? What do you think you
    should do about that?

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I think that that’s often the key. In my work as Dear Sugar,
    where I did give people advice when they sought it from me, I would
    very often say, the answer is actually within you. The question that
    you asked me tells me the truth. It tells me the thing that you want
    to do or the thing that you know is the right thing. I think a lot
    of it is very often we’re afraid to trust our own instincts. And so
    when we seek advice, we’re really just seeking reassurance.

  - margaret atwood  
    Confirmation.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, confirmation. Exactly. So I want to just back up. Here you are
    sewing masks with your baby sister. Are you guys being socially
    isolated in your place? Are you in Toronto? Or where exactly are
    you?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’m in Toronto. I socially isolated when I got back from where I had
    been, which was on March the 10th. Of course, I made it out of New
    Zealand, Australia and Ireland in the nick of time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Wow.

  - margaret atwood  
    And then, of course, I didn’t see anybody or breathe on them for the
    required number of days. And of course, now we’re social distancing.
    But because she lives in the woods and doesn’t see other people, and
    because I’ve socially isolated for all that time, we’re safe
    together.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Yeah. And is she staying with you until whenever —

  - margaret atwood  
    She comes in on the weekends and cheers me up.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. But otherwise, you’re alone during the week.

  - margaret atwood  
    It doesn’t feel like that, Cheryl, because everybody and their dog
    wants me to do something for them.

  - \[laughter\]  
    And we had a squirrel problem just recently. So the squirrel guy
    came. The roofing guy came. They can come, because they’re on the
    outside of your house. So you’re not near them. They’re doing their
    thing outside. So although, yes, I’m, quote, “alone,” I’m not alone.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s true. So tell me about your days.

  - margaret atwood  
    My day.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, your days in general, during this time of social isolation.

  - margaret atwood  
    There isn’t any in generally, because it’s something new every day.
    So today, we went out looking for shop towels colored blue, blue
    shop towels, because they are apparently very good filters for
    masks. But the place we went to we saw from afar that it had a huge,
    long line-up of people waiting to get in. And they were not social
    distancing. So we turned around, and we said, we think we can get
    some of these things online. And we can get other things by ordering
    them and opting for curb pickup. So we’re going to try doing that.
    But we scored something that’s in quite short supply, Cheryl. And
    that would be the pots of pansies.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Pots of pansies?

  - margaret atwood  
    We actually scored a couple of pots of pansies. The ordinary garden
    shops seem to be closed. However, at our local food depot, we saw
    two pots of pansies. And we grabbed them right away.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And where are you putting these pansies? Are they —

  - margaret atwood  
    We put them in pots in the back yard. And they look very decorative
    and cheerful.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Beautiful. Wow. So it sounds like you’re kind of, so far, doing
    quite well for yourself during this time.

  - margaret atwood  
    You know, Cheryl, you know this yourself, that if you grow up in the
    backwoods, not seeing a lot of people all the time doesn’t bother
    you a lot. I think it’s hard for people who have been used to going
    to the office, running their business, seeing a lot of people,
    talking to a lot of people in person — I think it’s very hard for
    them. Because they’re not used to this.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So OK, so far things are going well. You’re thriving in the face of
    this pandemic?

  - margaret atwood  
    What is it that you think might go wrong, Cheryl? I think anybody
    who isn’t ill, and who has a place to be and who knows how to get
    food is in a very good place. But there are other people who don’t
    have that. They’re having a hard time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And that’s my next question. Are you afraid for the world? Are you
    afraid for yourself? What are some of the more — I mean, what are
    you thinking as you’re watching the news?

  - margaret atwood  
    OK, so the older you get, the less afraid you are of those kinds of
    things. You’re afraid for other people. But you already know your
    plot, the plot of your life. And the plot of your life is that
    there’s a lot more in the past than there’s going to be in the
    future. So time is limited anyway. So why waste your time worrying
    and being afraid? But if you’re younger, of course, you don’t know
    that plot. And you think that this may be my whole future just gone
    up in smoke. Everything that I thought was going to be in my life is
    in question. And particularly if, for instance, you’ve lost your
    job, you’re unemployed, you don’t know how to pay for things, you
    don’t know how you’re going to eat — these are very worrisome
    things.
    
    And what if you have young children? So that can be very, very
    stressful and worrisome. And a lot of people are extremely anxious.
    But if you’re asking me, personally — so day before yesterday, I
    climbed out on the roof, because we had a squirrel problem. I wanted
    to deal with it. And poor Lucia was saying, don’t do that\! Don’t do
    that\! I said, what can go wrong? It’s a flat roof.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And who is Lucia?

  - margaret atwood  
    She works with me. So she was wringing your hands. Let me do that. I
    said, you’re too tall. You wouldn’t be able to get out the window.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Margaret. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I’m with Lucia on this. I’m all
    for pushing the boundaries, but maybe you shouldn’t go up on the
    roof. I don’t know.

  - margaret atwood  
    Oh, come on. It wasn’t dangerous, OK. I don’t do deliberately
    dangerous things. Trust me. That’s part of my wisdom. I know when
    it’s dangerous.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s, I guess, right. Well, unless the squirrels came after you.
    That could have happened too.

  - margaret atwood  
    They would not come after me. I have an aura of squirrel protection
    around me like an invisible force field.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh my gosh.

  - margaret atwood  
    I was putting hot pepper down their hole so they wouldn’t aggravate
    me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How does the hot pepper down their hole keep them from aggravating
    you?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, they’re like people, Cheryl. They’re mammals. And they have
    very sensitive noses. So the pepper would say to them, this is not
    where you want to be.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, I see.

  - margaret atwood  
    You do not want to be in Margaret’s ceiling. Yeah, so the hot pepper
    is to the squirrel like the yellow tape is to the place where you’re
    not supposed to go.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Got it. Got it. Because really, I want to come socially isolate with
    you and your sister. Because it sounds like — and Lucia. You’re
    having that sort of barrel of fun there over in Toronto.

  - margaret atwood  
    As much as possible.

  - \[laughter\]  
    It’s limited parameters. But within those parameters, we’re doing
    the best we can to not worry and do things that are positive.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, I want to ask you, though, about — so you mentioned the people
    who are really struggling, who either have family members or loved
    ones who have the virus and are sick or dying, or people whose jobs
    have been lost and whose lives have been deeply stressed. And I
    couldn’t help but think that you’ve written in your books about
    people who are really living in scary and restricted circumstances —

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s true.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — and dire — and I thought you might, as an elder, have something to
    say or to sort of tell me about how you crafted those characters,
    what you imagined when you imagined those kind of difficult
    circumstances? And any kind of wisdom you might have to offer to
    people who are having a really difficult time right now.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, well, it would depend what kind of difficult time they’re
    having. So a material, physical difficult time, or an emotional
    difficult time, or both. So I was born in 1939, which meant that my
    early childhood was spent during World War II. So when I think of
    hard times I think of people in Europe during those times. Those
    were very hard times. And I’ve also always been interested in
    plagues. And I think that’s partly from hearing about my mom and dad
    who went through the 1919 influenza epidemic, which was very lethal
    and killed a huge number of people around the world, like really a
    lot. So the whole family — five kids, two grown ups — went through
    that. And they all survived. So that’s rather a hopeful story to
    have heard. So I think for young people who have never been through
    any of those things or lived at a time when they were happening,
    this seems just frightful. Seems like the absolute worst thing.
    They’ve never known anything like it. It’s horrible. But if you’ve
    witnessed, heard about, and known people who have been through these
    other things, you think, OK, we’re going to make it through this.
    It’s going to be bad. And things are not going to be the same on
    the other side. But you know they aren’t. They change anyway.
    
    So I’ve got a little bit of perspective, which is a man called Barry
    Lord, who wrote a book called “Art & Energy,” in which he connects
    the kinds of culture you have with the kind of energy that is
    supporting it. He goes back to the days of fire. He goes through
    coal, which produced a culture of production. So Marx and trade
    unions and everything came out of that. And then oil comes along.
    And it’s very cheap, and it doesn’t take that many people to produce
    it. And you get a culture of consumption. Lots of cheap stuff. But
    we’re now transitioning into renewable energy. And that will produce
    and is producing right now a culture of stewardship. And this time
    is going to give us a bit of a reset button. How are we going to do
    things differently on the other side?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, I think you’re right that we will. And it is interesting. This
    pandemic, I think, is really making people live differently right
    now, today. And I do feel like on the level of really contemplating
    climate change, so much of that conversation has been around all the
    things we can’t do. Oh, we’re all so tied to our automobiles, and
    our travel, and our jobs and our this and that and the other thing.
    We can’t possibly reduce. And yet, here we are. Everything, thanks
    to COVID-19, came to a screeching halt.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. I think we’re going to be saying to ourselves, do I really
    need that? Do I really need to be doing that? So I think it is going
    to be — I’ve heard a number of people saying, I just wasn’t really
    using by my home as a home. I was just using it as a place to sleep.
    And now that I’ve had to be in it, I’m creating a whole new
    relationship with it. I think you look at stuff you have. And you
    think, do I really need that stuff? Could somebody else be making
    use of that stuff, which for me is sitting in a drawer? So I think a
    lot of people are thinking that way. And they’re sorting through
    their stuff and minimizing it. Are you?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I am. Yeah. I’ve really thought about this in a big way. I was this
    morning and getting dressed and thinking, I’m wearing the same thing
    I’ve worn for five days.

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s a little unhealthy, Cheryl.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    I know. Well, no. It’s been washed in between a time or two.

  - margaret atwood  
    Oh, yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I mean, I don’t need all the clothes that I think I needed. Now, of
    course, you and I both do public events. And so you need a certain
    kind of wardrobe. But it’s been pretty liberating to just adapt a
    uniform, essentially, my stay at home pandemic uniform that, really,
    I’m very happy wearing.

  - margaret atwood  
    And what is that like, Cheryl? Can you describe that for us?

  - cheryl strayed  
    They’re comfortable they’re basic.

  - margaret atwood  
    What color are they, Cheryl?

  - cheryl strayed  
    They’re black. They’re black and gray. Why are you asking me these
    questions?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, because it’s a podcast. And people are listening. And they
    want to know what this outfit is like.

  - cheryl strayed  
    OK, so I’m wearing this kind of gray sweater right now over the
    black top I’ve been wearing all week and the black pants I’ve been
    wearing all week. What are you wearing right now, now that we’re on
    the subject?

  - margaret atwood  
    Red. I’m wearing red, Cheryl. Because I’m old. It picks up the skin
    tones.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You know, I remember you — I think you said that to me the first
    time we met. You looked beautiful. And you said, yes, it picks up my
    skin tones, this color.

  - margaret atwood  
    Think pink, pack black. You must have heard that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    See, I haven’t. And this is why I called you, my dear elder, to give
    me all the best advice. So I’m curious, who do you turn to? It
    sounds like you’re not feeling terribly alone and sad and struggling
    right now. But when you do, who do you to turn to or what do you
    turn to for wisdom?
    
    Or consolation, or enlightenment or comfort.

  - margaret atwood  
    Or just to have a chat. Well, it depends what the subject is.
    
    I’m not — let’s see, how can I put this.
    
    I like to talk things over with people whose opinions I value. So I
    have a number of people in my life that I can do that with. Somewhat
    fewer in number than they used to be, Cheryl. Because in my age
    group, people are dropping off the tree.
    
    So nonetheless, there are younger people who aren’t stupid, believe
    it or not.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How does it feel to lose some of your best friends and the people
    who you used to turn to in hard times? How does that feel, to watch
    people around you dying who you love?

  - margaret atwood  
    When people die. OK, people die. I hate to break this to you. But
    that’s one of the things that they do. And that has been going on
    pretty much my whole life. Not my first rodeo of people dying. And
    it’s always very hard if you value that person. They’re not going to
    be in your life anymore in the way that they used to be. They’ll
    still be in your life. It’s just that there probably won’t be any
    new conversations. If there are some new conversations and you’re
    awake while you’re having them, you’re not alone on the planet
    either. It’s fairly normal for people to turn up who aren’t alive in
    the usual sense anymore.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You feel like the dead talk to you?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I think if you’re a writer, they’ve been talking to you all
    your life through their work.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Certainly. So you have a poem — speaking of writers talking to you
    through their work. You have a poem that I think you wanted to share
    with me. Would you read it to me?

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. The question is, what did I do with it? Here it is. Here it
    is. I found it. OK, so this is by a poet called Jay Macpherson.
    J-A-Y M-A-C-P-H-E-R-S-O-N. She was actually a teacher of mine. And
    then she became a friend of mine. She’d had a very peculiar life.
    She was one of those English children that was evacuated during
    World War II and ended up in Newfoundland. And was also a very
    instinctive poet. So this poem is called “The Beauty of Job’s
    Daughters.” And it’s in a book of hers called Poems Twice Told. And
    what it is about is the force of the imagination — something that we
    can all think about in these times. So the story of Job is that God
    and the devil decided to have a wager about Job. And God allowed
    Satan to torture Job in various different ways, including killing
    all of his children. So at the end of the story, God admits that
    this hadn’t been fair and gives Job his wealth back and also gives
    him other children. So I always thought that it was a pretty fishy
    story. So I kill all your children. And these new children are
    supposed to make up for that. I don’t think so.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Doesn’t work that way.

  - margaret atwood  
    I don’t think it works that way. But that’s how it works in the
    story. And so this poem is called “The Beauty of Job’s Daughters.”
    The old, the mad, the blind have fairest daughters. Take Job. The
    beasts the accuser sends at evening shoulder his house and shake it.
    He’s not there, attained in age to inwardness of daughters in all
    the land no women found so fair. Angels and sons of God are nearest
    neighbors. And even the accuser may repair to walk with Job in
    pleasures of his daughters. Wide, shining rooms, more warmly lit at
    evening, gardens beyond whose secrets scent the air. Not wiles of
    men, nor envy of the neighbors, riches of earth, nor what heaven
    holds more rare can take from Job the beauty of his daughters, the
    gardens and the rock, music at evening and cup so full that all who
    come must share. Perhaps we passed them? It was late, or evening.
    And surely, those were desert stumps, not daughters. In fact, we
    doubt that they were ever there. The old, the mad, the blind have
    fairest daughters. In all the land, no women found so fair.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You read so beautifully, Margaret.

  - margaret atwood  
    Guess who I learned to read that from?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Who?

  - margaret atwood  
    The person who wrote it.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Really? So Jay was your professor?

  - margaret atwood  
    She was my professor at Victoria College in the University of
    Toronto in 1960, approx.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And did she actually teach you how to read poetry out loud?

  - margaret atwood  
    I heard her read. And one of the things that she said was, some
    people like to read poetry the way actors do. And they call that
    helping the old boy out. But if you read poetry too dramatically, it
    gets in the way of people hearing the words.

  - cheryl strayed  
    She was right. So why did you choose this particular piece to read?

  - margaret atwood  
    It was short.

  - \[laughter\]  
    It’s effective. If I had said I’m going to read you all Beowulf,
    that takes eight hours. You can get all of Beowulf, by the way, read
    by an Icelandic poet. So he gives it the old what for. And he reads
    it in the original. And what you’re hearing is something that’s
    1,000 years old. You’re hearing that voice from the deep past. And
    you won’t be able to understand it, of course. But you can read
    along with Seamus Heaney’s translation for the meaning. And that
    takes eight hours, the whole of the poem.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s always astounded me, that we can read work that is so, so
    ancient and so old, and it still has relevance and meaning to us
    today.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. The difference is that a lot of the languages that we read, we
    don’t know how they were pronounced. But because Icelandic didn’t
    change for 1,000 years, you’re hearing it. That’s how they spoke it.
    So it’s not Grendel. It’s Gr-r-r-endel\!

  - cheryl strayed  
    Can you do that again?

  - margaret atwood  
    Gr-r-r-endel\!

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s impressive.

  - margaret atwood  
    Isn’t it? Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How did you get that voice? How can you do that?

  - margaret atwood  
    I got that voice from Svanur Thorkelsson because I heard him read
    it.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Wow.
    
    You get it done. From making the facemasks, to scaring the squirrels
    away, to getting —

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I get that from my mother. She used to say, roll up your
    sleeves, girls.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And now, look, you and your sister are doing just that.
    That’s kind of a beautiful circle, isn’t it?

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s what we’re doing. Her sewing is going to be better than mine.
    I’m just telling you that right now. I’m going to have to get back
    in stride with it.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And that’s what you’re going to do when we get off the phone. You’re
    going to get to your sewed work, is that right?

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s what we’re going to do. So she brought a lot of fabrics in.
    They’re very pretty, actually. And we’ve washed them. We will iron
    them. And she brought her cutting board. You’ve got this cutting
    board that measures these things.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, I know that.

  - margaret atwood  
    You have a little wheel that you can just cut along the line. And so
    that’s what we’re going to do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Beautiful. Well, Margaret, it’s been an absolute pleasure to speak
    to you today. And thank you so much for taking the time to talk to
    me. I think you’re exquisitely wonderful, and brilliant and amazing.
    So happy sewing, and my best to your sister and all the squirrels,
    as well.

  - margaret atwood  
    As long as they stay in their place, right?

  - cheryl strayed  
    All right, bye, Margaret.

  - margaret atwood  
    Bye, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye bye.

  - \[music\]  
    I’m Cheryl Strayed. And this is “Sugar Calling.” Next week, the
    great writer, traveler and speaker, Pico Iyer.
    
    Thanks for
listening.

## ‘Roll Up Your Sleeves, Girls’

### Hosted by Cheryl Strayed, produced by Kelly Prime and edited by Sara Sarasohn

#### Cheryl Strayed calls the writer Margaret Atwood to talk about hard times, pansies and eight decades of getting it done.

Wednesday, April 8th, 2020

</div>

  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Margaret Atwood, the legendary,
    extraordinary Margaret Atwood. Author of so many novels and books of
    poetry and children’s books. I was still in my teens when The
    Handmaid’s Tale came out, and I read it and was astonished by it.
    And I’ve loved her ever since. She’s written so powerfully about
    people in incredibly difficult circumstances, people who can’t even
    use their own names, people whose movement is constricted and whose
    thought is constricted. And I think that there’s something, in
    essence, the way she writes about how we persist in the face of
    extreme difficulty that I felt like she might be the person to talk
    to at this very moment when so many of us are wondering, well, how
    do we live this new way? And what is the way forward?

  - \[music\]  
    Margaret Atwood has written about that in so many ways and so many
    forms for decades now. I’m going to give her a call.

  - \[beeping\]

  - \[chime\]

  - margaret atwood  
    Hi, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, Margaret. I’m so glad to talk to you.

  - margaret atwood  
    Lovely to talk to you.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So where are you, Margaret? And who are you with?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’m right in my study. My sister is here. She has brought her sewing
    machine. I’ve dredged out my ancient sewing machine. And we’re going
    to make facemasks.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s so wonderful.

  - margaret atwood  
    And we’re going to go get some blue shop towels, because apparently
    they make good linings.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Really?

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Now, is this sewing machine — tell me, is this something you’ve had
    for a long time? And how did you learn to sew?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’ve had it for a long time. I sewed all my clothes in high school,
    as people who were that way inclined did. And I also sewed clothes
    for my baby sister, who is here with me right now. She’s 12 years
    younger. And I also, of course, sewed for my daughter. And I sewed
    for myself for years. And then I just kind of didn’t for a while. So
    I’m going to have to learn how to re-thread this thing and oil it
    and all of those things. But I think I can probably get back into
    the groove.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. You know, it’s so funny that you should say that. Because,
    honestly, just two days ago, my daughter Bobbi, who is named after
    my mother Bobbi, said, do we have a sewing machine? And I said, I
    do. It’s in the basement. And it was your grandmother’s. The
    grandmother she never met, my mother, was an amazing seamstress and
    sewed all of my clothes when I was growing up. And so we pulled it
    upstairs. And it was the same thing. I was like, OK, I used to know
    how to thread this thing.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. Where does the thread go?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. But it’s the same thing. And I think it’s fascinating. We’re
    kind of going back in time in an interesting way. You grew up in
    rural northern Quebec, right?

  - margaret atwood  
    OK, well, it depends what part of growing up you’re talking about.
    So one to five, out in the backwoods of Quebec — except in the
    winters, it was city. It was Ottawa. And then by the time I was 12,
    I was spending a full year in school. And that would be in Toronto.
    And that was where I was doing all of the sewing. So we started in
    grade 8. And guess what we made for our mothers?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Aprons.

  - margaret atwood  
    You got it.

  - \[laughter\]  
    They were so appreciative.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I know. You know why I know that? The same thing. I grew up in
    northern Minnesota. Now, I’m a little younger than you. I’m 51. And
    you are —

  - margaret atwood  
    That isn’t just a little younger, Cheryl.

  - \[laughter\]  
    That is a lot younger.

  - cheryl strayed  
    OK, how old are you?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’m 80.

  - cheryl strayed  
    But no, the same thing. So this is something you and I share in
    common, this growing up in the sort of wilds of the north country. I
    was northern Minnesota. But because of that, I think of myself as an
    honorary Canadian.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, it’s very close.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Very close, yeah. And so I’m curious. Is it true you didn’t go to
    sort of formal school until you were about 12?

  - margaret atwood  
    No, in the winters I went. Because my dad was a forest entomologist.
    That means bugs that eat trees. And they are dormant in the winter.
    They don’t do anything. So we were always in the city at that time.
    But it was the war. And there was no school, Cheryl. There wasn’t
    any pre-school. There wasn’t any daycare. There wasn’t any schooly
    school school until grade one. So I didn’t go to school until I was
    six. What a shock. It was horrible.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Was it? Was it?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, sit in a desk in a row. It was also the military phase of
    school. So you did a lot of marching here and there. And the girls
    door, the boys door — you lined up, and then you marched in. And it
    was some kind of eternal curse if you went in the wrong door.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I’m going to guess that this approach was always contrary to
    your spirit.

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, who knows?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I mean, you seem kind of —

  - margaret atwood  
    Who knows what your spirit is when you’re seven?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, I don’t know —

  - margaret atwood  
    You don’t actually know.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think I disagree. I mean, you have a daughter, right? I mean,
    wasn’t she who she is the minute she was born? Didn’t you feel her
    personality?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, sure, but you have to wait and find out what form that is
    going to take.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So when you think about when you became you — I mean, what were you
    like as a girl?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I was — like all kids, you’re in different ways at different
    ages. Are you not?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah.

  - margaret atwood  
    So I would say I was a happy four-year-old. I was a glum
    nine-year-old. I was a shy 12-year-old. And I was the life of the
    party at 16.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And then ever since.

  - margaret atwood  
    But what else do you need to know?

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, Margaret, so when I emailed you and asked if I could call you,
    I told you. I said, this “Sugar Calling” thing, I’m really
    interested in talking to writers who are over the age of 60, because
    I’m seeking wisdom. And your reply was, well, I’d love to do it. I
    don’t know if I have any wisdom to offer. And of course, I know
    you’re wrong about that. But what I’m curious is, are you wiser
    now than you were at 40, or 60 or 20?

  - margaret atwood  
    No, I’m wiser than I was at 17. And if that isn’t true for other
    people, they’re in trouble.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think we all are.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, so I’d say I’m wiser than I was at 17. And I’m wiser than I
    was at 30. But then you start thinking of wise people you have
    known. So I think my parents were both pretty wise. My mother
    especially was exceptionally wise. My grandmother was very wise. And
    one of the wise things about them was that they instinctively
    followed the rule of the Inuit people of northern Canada, which is,
    when you’re an elder — and it’s other people who decide whether
    you’re an elder or not. It’s not just being old. But when you’re
    an elder, you’re considered to be wise. But you don’t offer any
    advice unless people ask you for it. And I think that’s a pretty
    wise thing to do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I agree entirely.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, so when my daughter had a child, my friends said to me, just
    remember, you know nothing.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think that’s part of wisdom, knowing when to stay silent and to
    simply let somebody make their choices, to sit back and witness.

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, they’ll ask you for advice if they want it. And if they don’t
    want it, they’re not going to listen to it anyway. So why waste your
    time?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Well, I certainly consider you an elder, Margaret. I mean,
    you have —

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I’ll tell you if I don’t know the answer.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Thank you. So I want to —

  - margaret atwood  
    Or I will say, Cheryl, what do you think? What do you think you
    should do about that?

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I think that that’s often the key. In my work as Dear Sugar,
    where I did give people advice when they sought it from me, I would
    very often say, the answer is actually within you. The question that
    you asked me tells me the truth. It tells me the thing that you want
    to do or the thing that you know is the right thing. I think a lot
    of it is very often we’re afraid to trust our own instincts. And so
    when we seek advice, we’re really just seeking reassurance.

  - margaret atwood  
    Confirmation.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, confirmation. Exactly. So I want to just back up. Here you are
    sewing masks with your baby sister. Are you guys being socially
    isolated in your place? Are you in Toronto? Or where exactly are
    you?

  - margaret atwood  
    I’m in Toronto. I socially isolated when I got back from where I had
    been, which was on March the 10th. Of course, I made it out of New
    Zealand, Australia and Ireland in the nick of time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Wow.

  - margaret atwood  
    And then, of course, I didn’t see anybody or breathe on them for the
    required number of days. And of course, now we’re social distancing.
    But because she lives in the woods and doesn’t see other people, and
    because I’ve socially isolated for all that time, we’re safe
    together.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Yeah. And is she staying with you until whenever —

  - margaret atwood  
    She comes in on the weekends and cheers me up.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. But otherwise, you’re alone during the week.

  - margaret atwood  
    It doesn’t feel like that, Cheryl, because everybody and their dog
    wants me to do something for them.

  - \[laughter\]  
    And we had a squirrel problem just recently. So the squirrel guy
    came. The roofing guy came. They can come, because they’re on the
    outside of your house. So you’re not near them. They’re doing their
    thing outside. So although, yes, I’m, quote, “alone,” I’m not alone.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s true. So tell me about your days.

  - margaret atwood  
    My day.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, your days in general, during this time of social isolation.

  - margaret atwood  
    There isn’t any in generally, because it’s something new every day.
    So today, we went out looking for shop towels colored blue, blue
    shop towels, because they are apparently very good filters for
    masks. But the place we went to we saw from afar that it had a huge,
    long line-up of people waiting to get in. And they were not social
    distancing. So we turned around, and we said, we think we can get
    some of these things online. And we can get other things by ordering
    them and opting for curb pickup. So we’re going to try doing that.
    But we scored something that’s in quite short supply, Cheryl. And
    that would be the pots of pansies.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Pots of pansies?

  - margaret atwood  
    We actually scored a couple of pots of pansies. The ordinary garden
    shops seem to be closed. However, at our local food depot, we saw
    two pots of pansies. And we grabbed them right away.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And where are you putting these pansies? Are they —

  - margaret atwood  
    We put them in pots in the back yard. And they look very decorative
    and cheerful.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Beautiful. Wow. So it sounds like you’re kind of, so far, doing
    quite well for yourself during this time.

  - margaret atwood  
    You know, Cheryl, you know this yourself, that if you grow up in the
    backwoods, not seeing a lot of people all the time doesn’t bother
    you a lot. I think it’s hard for people who have been used to going
    to the office, running their business, seeing a lot of people,
    talking to a lot of people in person — I think it’s very hard for
    them. Because they’re not used to this.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So OK, so far things are going well. You’re thriving in the face of
    this pandemic?

  - margaret atwood  
    What is it that you think might go wrong, Cheryl? I think anybody
    who isn’t ill, and who has a place to be and who knows how to get
    food is in a very good place. But there are other people who don’t
    have that. They’re having a hard time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And that’s my next question. Are you afraid for the world? Are you
    afraid for yourself? What are some of the more — I mean, what are
    you thinking as you’re watching the news?

  - margaret atwood  
    OK, so the older you get, the less afraid you are of those kinds of
    things. You’re afraid for other people. But you already know your
    plot, the plot of your life. And the plot of your life is that
    there’s a lot more in the past than there’s going to be in the
    future. So time is limited anyway. So why waste your time worrying
    and being afraid? But if you’re younger, of course, you don’t know
    that plot. And you think that this may be my whole future just gone
    up in smoke. Everything that I thought was going to be in my life is
    in question. And particularly if, for instance, you’ve lost your
    job, you’re unemployed, you don’t know how to pay for things, you
    don’t know how you’re going to eat — these are very worrisome
    things.
    
    And what if you have young children? So that can be very, very
    stressful and worrisome. And a lot of people are extremely anxious.
    But if you’re asking me, personally — so day before yesterday, I
    climbed out on the roof, because we had a squirrel problem. I wanted
    to deal with it. And poor Lucia was saying, don’t do that\! Don’t do
    that\! I said, what can go wrong? It’s a flat roof.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And who is Lucia?

  - margaret atwood  
    She works with me. So she was wringing your hands. Let me do that. I
    said, you’re too tall. You wouldn’t be able to get out the window.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Margaret. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I’m with Lucia on this. I’m all
    for pushing the boundaries, but maybe you shouldn’t go up on the
    roof. I don’t know.

  - margaret atwood  
    Oh, come on. It wasn’t dangerous, OK. I don’t do deliberately
    dangerous things. Trust me. That’s part of my wisdom. I know when
    it’s dangerous.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s, I guess, right. Well, unless the squirrels came after you.
    That could have happened too.

  - margaret atwood  
    They would not come after me. I have an aura of squirrel protection
    around me like an invisible force field.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh my gosh.

  - margaret atwood  
    I was putting hot pepper down their hole so they wouldn’t aggravate
    me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How does the hot pepper down their hole keep them from aggravating
    you?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, they’re like people, Cheryl. They’re mammals. And they have
    very sensitive noses. So the pepper would say to them, this is not
    where you want to be.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, I see.

  - margaret atwood  
    You do not want to be in Margaret’s ceiling. Yeah, so the hot pepper
    is to the squirrel like the yellow tape is to the place where you’re
    not supposed to go.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Got it. Got it. Because really, I want to come socially isolate with
    you and your sister. Because it sounds like — and Lucia. You’re
    having that sort of barrel of fun there over in Toronto.

  - margaret atwood  
    As much as possible.

  - \[laughter\]  
    It’s limited parameters. But within those parameters, we’re doing
    the best we can to not worry and do things that are positive.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, I want to ask you, though, about — so you mentioned the people
    who are really struggling, who either have family members or loved
    ones who have the virus and are sick or dying, or people whose jobs
    have been lost and whose lives have been deeply stressed. And I
    couldn’t help but think that you’ve written in your books about
    people who are really living in scary and restricted circumstances —

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s true.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — and dire — and I thought you might, as an elder, have something to
    say or to sort of tell me about how you crafted those characters,
    what you imagined when you imagined those kind of difficult
    circumstances? And any kind of wisdom you might have to offer to
    people who are having a really difficult time right now.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah, well, it would depend what kind of difficult time they’re
    having. So a material, physical difficult time, or an emotional
    difficult time, or both. So I was born in 1939, which meant that my
    early childhood was spent during World War II. So when I think of
    hard times I think of people in Europe during those times. Those
    were very hard times. And I’ve also always been interested in
    plagues. And I think that’s partly from hearing about my mom and dad
    who went through the 1919 influenza epidemic, which was very lethal
    and killed a huge number of people around the world, like really a
    lot. So the whole family — five kids, two grown ups — went through
    that. And they all survived. So that’s rather a hopeful story to
    have heard. So I think for young people who have never been through
    any of those things or lived at a time when they were happening,
    this seems just frightful. Seems like the absolute worst thing.
    They’ve never known anything like it. It’s horrible. But if you’ve
    witnessed, heard about, and known people who have been through these
    other things, you think, OK, we’re going to make it through this.
    It’s going to be bad. And things are not going to be the same on
    the other side. But you know they aren’t. They change anyway.
    
    So I’ve got a little bit of perspective, which is a man called Barry
    Lord, who wrote a book called “Art & Energy,” in which he connects
    the kinds of culture you have with the kind of energy that is
    supporting it. He goes back to the days of fire. He goes through
    coal, which produced a culture of production. So Marx and trade
    unions and everything came out of that. And then oil comes along.
    And it’s very cheap, and it doesn’t take that many people to produce
    it. And you get a culture of consumption. Lots of cheap stuff. But
    we’re now transitioning into renewable energy. And that will produce
    and is producing right now a culture of stewardship. And this time
    is going to give us a bit of a reset button. How are we going to do
    things differently on the other side?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, I think you’re right that we will. And it is interesting. This
    pandemic, I think, is really making people live differently right
    now, today. And I do feel like on the level of really contemplating
    climate change, so much of that conversation has been around all the
    things we can’t do. Oh, we’re all so tied to our automobiles, and
    our travel, and our jobs and our this and that and the other thing.
    We can’t possibly reduce. And yet, here we are. Everything, thanks
    to COVID-19, came to a screeching halt.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. I think we’re going to be saying to ourselves, do I really
    need that? Do I really need to be doing that? So I think it is going
    to be — I’ve heard a number of people saying, I just wasn’t really
    using by my home as a home. I was just using it as a place to sleep.
    And now that I’ve had to be in it, I’m creating a whole new
    relationship with it. I think you look at stuff you have. And you
    think, do I really need that stuff? Could somebody else be making
    use of that stuff, which for me is sitting in a drawer? So I think a
    lot of people are thinking that way. And they’re sorting through
    their stuff and minimizing it. Are you?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I am. Yeah. I’ve really thought about this in a big way. I was this
    morning and getting dressed and thinking, I’m wearing the same thing
    I’ve worn for five days.

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s a little unhealthy, Cheryl.

  - \[laughter\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    I know. Well, no. It’s been washed in between a time or two.

  - margaret atwood  
    Oh, yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I mean, I don’t need all the clothes that I think I needed. Now, of
    course, you and I both do public events. And so you need a certain
    kind of wardrobe. But it’s been pretty liberating to just adapt a
    uniform, essentially, my stay at home pandemic uniform that, really,
    I’m very happy wearing.

  - margaret atwood  
    And what is that like, Cheryl? Can you describe that for us?

  - cheryl strayed  
    They’re comfortable they’re basic.

  - margaret atwood  
    What color are they, Cheryl?

  - cheryl strayed  
    They’re black. They’re black and gray. Why are you asking me these
    questions?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, because it’s a podcast. And people are listening. And they
    want to know what this outfit is like.

  - cheryl strayed  
    OK, so I’m wearing this kind of gray sweater right now over the
    black top I’ve been wearing all week and the black pants I’ve been
    wearing all week. What are you wearing right now, now that we’re on
    the subject?

  - margaret atwood  
    Red. I’m wearing red, Cheryl. Because I’m old. It picks up the skin
    tones.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You know, I remember you — I think you said that to me the first
    time we met. You looked beautiful. And you said, yes, it picks up my
    skin tones, this color.

  - margaret atwood  
    Think pink, pack black. You must have heard that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    See, I haven’t. And this is why I called you, my dear elder, to give
    me all the best advice. So I’m curious, who do you turn to? It
    sounds like you’re not feeling terribly alone and sad and struggling
    right now. But when you do, who do you to turn to or what do you
    turn to for wisdom?
    
    Or consolation, or enlightenment or comfort.

  - margaret atwood  
    Or just to have a chat. Well, it depends what the subject is.
    
    I’m not — let’s see, how can I put this.
    
    I like to talk things over with people whose opinions I value. So I
    have a number of people in my life that I can do that with. Somewhat
    fewer in number than they used to be, Cheryl. Because in my age
    group, people are dropping off the tree.
    
    So nonetheless, there are younger people who aren’t stupid, believe
    it or not.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How does it feel to lose some of your best friends and the people
    who you used to turn to in hard times? How does that feel, to watch
    people around you dying who you love?

  - margaret atwood  
    When people die. OK, people die. I hate to break this to you. But
    that’s one of the things that they do. And that has been going on
    pretty much my whole life. Not my first rodeo of people dying. And
    it’s always very hard if you value that person. They’re not going to
    be in your life anymore in the way that they used to be. They’ll
    still be in your life. It’s just that there probably won’t be any
    new conversations. If there are some new conversations and you’re
    awake while you’re having them, you’re not alone on the planet
    either. It’s fairly normal for people to turn up who aren’t alive in
    the usual sense anymore.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You feel like the dead talk to you?

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I think if you’re a writer, they’ve been talking to you all
    your life through their work.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Certainly. So you have a poem — speaking of writers talking to you
    through their work. You have a poem that I think you wanted to share
    with me. Would you read it to me?

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. The question is, what did I do with it? Here it is. Here it
    is. I found it. OK, so this is by a poet called Jay Macpherson.
    J-A-Y M-A-C-P-H-E-R-S-O-N. She was actually a teacher of mine. And
    then she became a friend of mine. She’d had a very peculiar life.
    She was one of those English children that was evacuated during
    World War II and ended up in Newfoundland. And was also a very
    instinctive poet. So this poem is called “The Beauty of Job’s
    Daughters.” And it’s in a book of hers called Poems Twice Told. And
    what it is about is the force of the imagination — something that we
    can all think about in these times. So the story of Job is that God
    and the devil decided to have a wager about Job. And God allowed
    Satan to torture Job in various different ways, including killing
    all of his children. So at the end of the story, God admits that
    this hadn’t been fair and gives Job his wealth back and also gives
    him other children. So I always thought that it was a pretty fishy
    story. So I kill all your children. And these new children are
    supposed to make up for that. I don’t think so.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Doesn’t work that way.

  - margaret atwood  
    I don’t think it works that way. But that’s how it works in the
    story. And so this poem is called “The Beauty of Job’s Daughters.”
    The old, the mad, the blind have fairest daughters. Take Job. The
    beasts the accuser sends at evening shoulder his house and shake it.
    He’s not there, attained in age to inwardness of daughters in all
    the land no women found so fair. Angels and sons of God are nearest
    neighbors. And even the accuser may repair to walk with Job in
    pleasures of his daughters. Wide, shining rooms, more warmly lit at
    evening, gardens beyond whose secrets scent the air. Not wiles of
    men, nor envy of the neighbors, riches of earth, nor what heaven
    holds more rare can take from Job the beauty of his daughters, the
    gardens and the rock, music at evening and cup so full that all who
    come must share. Perhaps we passed them? It was late, or evening.
    And surely, those were desert stumps, not daughters. In fact, we
    doubt that they were ever there. The old, the mad, the blind have
    fairest daughters. In all the land, no women found so fair.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You read so beautifully, Margaret.

  - margaret atwood  
    Guess who I learned to read that from?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Who?

  - margaret atwood  
    The person who wrote it.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Really? So Jay was your professor?

  - margaret atwood  
    She was my professor at Victoria College in the University of
    Toronto in 1960, approx.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And did she actually teach you how to read poetry out loud?

  - margaret atwood  
    I heard her read. And one of the things that she said was, some
    people like to read poetry the way actors do. And they call that
    helping the old boy out. But if you read poetry too dramatically, it
    gets in the way of people hearing the words.

  - cheryl strayed  
    She was right. So why did you choose this particular piece to read?

  - margaret atwood  
    It was short.

  - \[laughter\]  
    It’s effective. If I had said I’m going to read you all Beowulf,
    that takes eight hours. You can get all of Beowulf, by the way, read
    by an Icelandic poet. So he gives it the old what for. And he reads
    it in the original. And what you’re hearing is something that’s
    1,000 years old. You’re hearing that voice from the deep past. And
    you won’t be able to understand it, of course. But you can read
    along with Seamus Heaney’s translation for the meaning. And that
    takes eight hours, the whole of the poem.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s always astounded me, that we can read work that is so, so
    ancient and so old, and it still has relevance and meaning to us
    today.

  - margaret atwood  
    Yeah. The difference is that a lot of the languages that we read, we
    don’t know how they were pronounced. But because Icelandic didn’t
    change for 1,000 years, you’re hearing it. That’s how they spoke it.
    So it’s not Grendel. It’s Gr-r-r-endel\!

  - cheryl strayed  
    Can you do that again?

  - margaret atwood  
    Gr-r-r-endel\!

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s impressive.

  - margaret atwood  
    Isn’t it? Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How did you get that voice? How can you do that?

  - margaret atwood  
    I got that voice from Svanur Thorkelsson because I heard him read
    it.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Wow.
    
    You get it done. From making the facemasks, to scaring the squirrels
    away, to getting —

  - margaret atwood  
    Well, I get that from my mother. She used to say, roll up your
    sleeves, girls.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And now, look, you and your sister are doing just that.
    That’s kind of a beautiful circle, isn’t it?

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s what we’re doing. Her sewing is going to be better than mine.
    I’m just telling you that right now. I’m going to have to get back
    in stride with it.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And that’s what you’re going to do when we get off the phone. You’re
    going to get to your sewed work, is that right?

  - margaret atwood  
    That’s what we’re going to do. So she brought a lot of fabrics in.
    They’re very pretty, actually. And we’ve washed them. We will iron
    them. And she brought her cutting board. You’ve got this cutting
    board that measures these things.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, I know that.

  - margaret atwood  
    You have a little wheel that you can just cut along the line. And so
    that’s what we’re going to do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Beautiful. Well, Margaret, it’s been an absolute pleasure to speak
    to you today. And thank you so much for taking the time to talk to
    me. I think you’re exquisitely wonderful, and brilliant and amazing.
    So happy sewing, and my best to your sister and all the squirrels,
    as well.

  - margaret atwood  
    As long as they stay in their place, right?

  - cheryl strayed  
    All right, bye, Margaret.

  - margaret atwood  
    Bye, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye bye.

  - \[music\]  
    I’m Cheryl Strayed. And this is “Sugar Calling.” Next week, the
    great writer, traveler and speaker, Pico Iyer.
    
    Thanks for listening.

## ‘This time is going to give us a bit of a reset button. How are we going to do things differently on the other side?’

*— Margaret Atwood, author*

Today, Cheryl calls up one of the most prolific writers of our
generation, the environmentalist and octogenarian Margaret Atwood.
Margaret shares how she’s spending her time in isolation, including
sewing masks and fending off squirrels (“Day before yesterday, I climbed
out on the roof because we had a squirrel problem,” she tells us).

Cheryl asks Margaret whether she’s afraid for herself — and for the
world — and the two reflect on how to stay hopeful.
