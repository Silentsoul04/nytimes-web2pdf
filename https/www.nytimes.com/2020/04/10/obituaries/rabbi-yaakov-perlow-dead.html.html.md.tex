\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, who inherited the leadership of the Novominsker
Hasidic dynasty that was founded in Poland by his grandfather and
transplanted to Brooklyn a century ago, died on Tuesday at his home in
the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/nyregion/coronavirus-jews-hasidic-ny.html}{Borough
Park section}. He was 89.

The cause was the new coronavirus, according to Agudath Israel of
America, the umbrella ultra-Orthodox organization.

The rabbi, known as a persuasive orator and respected scholar, had been
president of the organization since 1998 and was chairman of its
rabbinical Council of Torah Sages.

He straddled two worlds, defending Haredi, or strict Orthodox,
tradition, but at times going outside the insular Hasidic community to
opine on public policy. Most recently, he urged his followers to heed
the advice of medical experts in the coronavirus pandemic and avoid the
gatherings that are integral to religious rituals.

``We are told that the Jewish law is that we must listen to doctors
whether it's about a sick person on Yom Kippur or a sick person that
requires desecrating Shabbat and so on,'' he said. In contrast to the
funerals of revered ultra-Orthodox figures, which often attract huge
crowds, his service was limited to family only.

While he said students in religious schools should also be offered
classes in secular subjects and called for greater dialogue with Reform
and Conservative Jewish groups, he fiercely condemned the growing
assimilation of American Jews and, in particular, the Open Orthodoxy
movement that favored a greater role for women in rituals and
liberalizing other strictures.

Addressing an Agudath Israel dinner in 2014, he said the Reform and
Conservative movements have ``disintegrated themselves, become
oblivious, fallen into an abyss of intermarriage and assimilation'' and
would be ``relegated to the dustbins of Jewish history'' while the Open
Orthodoxy movement was steeped in heresy.

Rabbi Perlow was born on Nov. 16, 1930, in Brooklyn to Nochum Mordechai
Perlow, whose father, Yaakov, was the first rabbi of the Novominsk
Hasidic sect, named for the city in central Poland (its name was changed
from Novominsk to Minsk Mazowiecki in 1916). His mother, Beila Rochma
Morgenstern, was the daughter of a founder of Agudath Israel in Poland.

He attended Yeshiva Toras Chaim and Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in
Brooklyn and Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, N.J. He graduated with
honors from Brooklyn College.

He taught at Hebrew Theological College in Skokie, Ill., and at a
yeshiva in Washington Heights. After he succeeded his father as the
Novominsker rabbi in 1976, he opened Yeshivas Novominsk-Kol Yehuda, in
Borough Park, Brooklyn. He married Yehudis Eichenstein; she predeceased
him.
