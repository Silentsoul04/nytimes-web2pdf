NEW DELHI — After India’s health ministry repeatedly blamed an Islamic
seminary for spreading the coronavirus — and governing party officials
spoke of “human bombs” and “corona jihad” — a spree of anti-Muslim
attacks has broken out across the country.

Young Muslim men who were passing out food to the poor were [assaulted

</span>Other [Muslims have been beaten

nearly lynched, run out of their neighborhoods or attacked in mosques,
branded as virus spreaders. In Punjab State, loudspeakers at Sikh
temples broadcast messages telling people not to buy milk from Muslim
dairy farmers because it was infected with coronavirus.

Hateful messages have bloomed online. And [a wave of apparently fake
videos](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/surge-in-tiktok-videos-aimed-at-misleading-indian-muslims-over-coronavirus-precautions-1662930-2020-04-03)
has popped up telling Muslims not to wear masks, not to practice social
distancing, not to worry about the virus at all, as if the makers of the
videos wanted Muslims to get sick.

In a global pandemic, there is always the hunt for blame. President
Trump has done it, insisting for a time on calling the coronavirus a
[“Chinese
virus.’’](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html)
All over the world people are pointing fingers, driven by their fears
and anxieties to go after The Other.

Here in India, no other group has been demonized more than the country’s
200 million Muslims, minorities in a Hindu-dominated land of 1.3 billion
people.

From the [crackdown on

a Muslim majority area, to a [new citizenship law that blatantly

this past year has been one low point after another for Indian Muslims
living under an increasingly bold Hindu nationalist government led by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and propelled by majoritarian policies.

In this case, what’s making things worse is that there’s an element of
truth behind the government’s claims. A single Muslim religious movement
has been identified as being responsible for a large share of India’s
8,000-plus coronavirus cases. Indian officials estimated last week that
more than a third of the country’s cases were connected to the group,
Tablighi Jamaat, which held a huge gathering of preachers in India in
March. Similar meetings in
[Malaysia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html)
and
[Pakistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/asia/pakistan-coronavirus-tablighi-jamaat.html)
also led to outbreaks.

“The government was compelled to call out this congregation,” said Vikas
Swarup, a senior official at India’s foreign ministry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said that the gathering in March “had a significant impact on the
containment methods” but denied that the government’s frequent blaming
of the group had “anything to do with a particular
community.”

Tablighi Jamaat is a multinational Muslim missionary movement. A tall,
white, modern building towering over the Nizamuddin West neighborhood of
Delhi serves its global headquarters. The group is one of the world’s
largest faith-based organizations, with tens of millions of members.

The Indian government has been racing to track down anyone from
Tablighi’s seminary and quarantine congregants. Masked police officers
have sealed the headquarters on all sides; the other morning, they
patrolled the area with their fingers on the triggers of assault rifles.

The neighborhood resembles one near a bus depot or a port; the seminary
was the center of the economy, and all around it stand money changers,
guesthouses, travel agencies and gift shops, catering to the Muslim
missionaries who would flow through here.

The virus and the new wave of hatred have changed everything. Mohammed
Haider, who runs a milk stall, one of the few businesses allowed to stay
open under India’s coronavirus lockdown, said, “Fear is staring at us,
from
everywhere.’’

“People need only a small reason to beat us or to lynch us,’’ he said.
“Because of corona.’’

Muslim leaders are afraid. They see the intensifying attacks against
Muslims and remember what happened in February, when [Hindu mobs
rampaged in a working-class neighborhood in
Delhi](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/asia/india-police-muslims.html),
killing dozens, and the police mostly stood aside — or sometimes even
helped the Hindu mobs. In many villages now, Muslim traders are barred
from entering simply because of their faith.

“The government should not have played the blame game,” said Khalid
Rasheed, the chairman of [Islamic Center of
India](http://islamiccentreofindia.com/). “If you present the cases
based on somebody’s religion in your media briefings,’’ he said, “it
creates a big divide.”

“Coronavirus may die,” he added, “but the virus of communal disharmony
will be hard to kill when this is over.”

Tahir Iqbal, a recent university graduate from Kashmir, was among the
4,000 or so gathered at the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in early March
for missionary training. He said people slept, ate and prayed in close
quarters, with little fear of the coronavirus. “We didn’t take it
seriously at the time,” he said.

On March 16, the Delhi government [banned
gatherings](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-bars-assembly-of-over-50-people-orders-shutdown-of-weekly-markets-gyms-clubs/story-OOddakgdnYeKRofgYatXFN.html)of
more than 50 people. Several days later, Mr. Modi announced [a
nationwide
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html).

But instead of dispersing, more than 1,000 people stayed put at the
center. During a March 19 sermon, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi, a Tablighi
Jamaat leader, told followers that coronavirus was “God’s punishment’’
and not to fear it.

About a week later, health inspectors found around 1,300 people still
sheltering at the center without masks or other protective gear. Many
Muslim leaders criticized the group’s center for not closing down.

But by that point, hundreds of congregants had already left. They wended
their way across India by car, bus, train and plane, [spreading the
coronavirus to more than half of India’s
states](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/coronavirus-1023-positive-cases-related-to-tablighi-jamat-reported-in-17-states/story/400188.html),
from beach towns in the Andaman Islands to the hot, farming cities in
the country’s northern plains.

On March 31, the Delhi authorities [filed a criminal
case](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/nizamuddin-markaz-chief-maulana-saad-6-others-booked-full-text-fir-816565)
against Maulana Kandhalvi for “deliberately, willfully, negligently and
malignantly” putting the public’s health at risk. Tablighi Jamaat’s
center was sealed. The maulana, a title for a Muslim scholar,
disappeared.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Indian authorities have been tightening the lockdown on hot spots across
the country, shutting down all movement in areas where coronavirus cases
have been detected. Though the nationwide total remains relatively low,
many fear the highly contagious virus could rip through crowded urban
areas, overwhelming India’s already beleaguered public hospitals.

Indian authorities have used cellphone [data to track Tablighi Jamaat
congregants](https://www.thestatesman.com/india/police-using-cell-phone-data-to-trace-people-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-event-in-delhi-1502873974.html)

at an airport before they could board an evacuation flight out of India.

At a public briefing last week, [Lav Agarwal, a health ministry
spokesman](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rate-of-doubling-of-covid-19-cases-4-1-days-without-tablighi-jamaat-incident-it-would-have-been-7-4-government/articleshow/74994181.cms),
said that the number of days it would have taken India’s coronavirus
cases to double would have been 7.4 — not the more alarming 4.1 days it
hit this past week — had the gathering not
happened.

Some Hindu nationalist politicians and their supporters seized on the
situation, eagerly piling on the anti-Muslim sentiments that have been
building in recent years under Mr. Modi’s government.

Raj Thackeray, the leader of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, a far-right
nationalist party, told local news outlets that Tablighi Jamaat members
“should be shot.”

Rajeev Bindal, a leader within Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, said
Tablighi members were moving through the population “like [human
bombs](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tablighi-members-moving-like-human-bombs-himachal-bjp-chief-821495.html).”

In the village of Harewali, near Delhi, [a mob beat Mehboob
Ali](https://newsd.in/delhi-amid-coronavirus-scare-youth-who-returned-from-jamaat-mob-lynched-in-bawana/),
a young Muslim man, for attending Tablighi Jamaat events, and filmed the
beating.

“Tell us your plan\!” someone shouts in the video. “Was your plan to
spread corona?”

Mr. Ali, bloodied and crouching in a field, shakes his head.

Sensing the backlash against Muslims, India’s health ministry has
stopped blaming Tablighi Jamaat at public briefings.

“Certain communities and areas are being labeled purely based on false
reports,” the health ministry said in [a
statement](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/AddressingSocialStigmaAssociatedwithCOVID19.pdf)
a few days ago. “There is an urgent need to counter such prejudices.”
