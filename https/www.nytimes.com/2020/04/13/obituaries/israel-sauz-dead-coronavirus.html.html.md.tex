\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Israel Sauz of Tulsa, Okla., couldn't wait to see his first child, a
baby boy named Josiah. And he couldn't wait for the world to see him,
too. So he got in close and took a picture for Facebook of his son, fast
asleep in a green onesie, shortly after the boy came into the world one
Sunday last month.

Just 21 days later, on April 5, Mr. Sauz was dead. He was 22.

The cause was complications related to Covid-19, the disease caused by
the coronavirus, according to family friends and the school district
where he attended high school.

Many in Tulsa may not have recognized his name, but they knew the
smiling face --- he was an assistant night manager at a busy QuikTrip
gas station and convenience store about a mile east of downtown Tulsa.
He was still a teenager when he first started working for QuikTrip, a
popular chain based in Tulsa.

He lived in the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow. He and his wife, Krystal,
had celebrated their first wedding anniversary two weeks before Josiah
was born.

``It's kind of been a shocker to people here in Tulsa,'' said Brendan
Jarvis, one of Mr. Sauz's middle-school teachers at Union 6th/7th Grade
Center in Tulsa. ``There's this narrative out there that it's only
hurting people who are already sick or older, and he doesn't fit that
narrative. It took this pandemic to another level of seriousness in this
area.''

Mr. Sauz grew up in Orange County in Southern California and moved to
the Tulsa area. He graduated in 2016 from Tulsa's Union High School,
where he participated in an automotive vocational education program.

``This kid was the best, most respectful kid I've ever met in my life,''
said Jenny Ochwo, a Union High teacher. ``Some kids, they aren't there
yet, mature-wise. So they're kind of like, `Hey, how's it going? What
can you do for me?' But he would really stop and ask you how you were
and wait to hear your response and follow up on it. And that was
something that really impressed me about him.''

Two GoFundMe pages have been started for Mr. Sauz, one for
\href{https://www.gofundme.com/f/funeral-expenses-for-israel-sauz?utm_source=customer\&utm_medium=sms\&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1}{his
funeral expenses} and another for

widow and son}. The two pages have raised more than \$30,000.
