She was the first black female graduate of the school and went on to a
career at the United Nations; she also was a major supporter of sickle
cell research. She was a victim of the coronavirus.

When Lila A. Fenwick was a student at Harvard Law School in the 1950s,
she was doubly invisible. She was a woman and she was black.

Neither of those hurdles meant much to her. ``I knew I was going to be a
lawyer when I was a little girl,'' she told the Harvard Law Bulletin in
2000. ``It never occurred to me that there were going to be any
obstacles.''

In 1956, she was the first black woman to graduate from Harvard Law, and
she went on to become a human rights official at the United Nations, a
lawyer in private practice and a benefactor, establishing, with

Fay Francis-McBarnette}, the
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2611822/}{Foundation
for Research and Education in Sickle Cell Disease}.

Ms. Fenwick died on April 4 at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.

She had been suffering from dementia before contracting the novel
coronavirus, said David Colby Reed, a cousin and her guardian.

Ms. Fenwick graduated from law school in 1956, one of a handful of women
in a class of hundreds. Ruth Bader Ginsburg started the next school
year, when the dean at the time famously challenged the nine women in
the class of the future Supreme Court justice to defend why they were
occupying a place that could have gone to a man.

Harvard Law first accepted women in 1950, for its class of 1953, but it
would be decades before female students felt welcome. ``Ladies Day,''
the monthly tradition of professors calling on female students as if
they were performing bears, as some have described it, was in full,
humiliating swing.

Patricia J. Williams, Harvard Law class of 1975 and a professor of law
and humanities at Northeastern University, said black women there
experienced ``a particularly virulent form of racism and sexism.''

In the early 1990s Professor Williams became one of the first black
female professors at Columbia Law School. She said she was moved when
Ms. Fenwick, whom she had never met, appeared at her office and went on
to audit one of her courses.

``She was so elegant, a lady in the lovely, old fashioned, full sense of
that word,'' Professor Williams said. ``We talked about the loneliness,
what it took to be in a world where you were always different, always
the other and never assumed to be part of the power elite.''

Lila Althea Fenwick was born in Manhattan on May 24, 1932. Her parents,
John and Hilda Fenwick, had emigrated from Trinidad. Her father was a
well-to-do property owner and landlord in Harlem and the Bronx.

Ms. Fenwick graduated from Barnard College in 1953. After law school,
she attended the London School of Economics.

In the 1960s, Ms. Fenwick worked in what was then the Division of Human
Rights at the United Nations, said Bertrand Ramcharan, a former acting
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. She was a specialist
on studies about gender, racial and religious discrimination; the
protection of minorities and indigenous populations; and the right to
emigrate from oppressive countries, he said.

In the late 1960s, she bought an elegant Beaux-Arts rowhouse on West
108th Street where she lived in the parlor and garden floors.

When the division moved its headquarters to Geneva between 1973 and
1974, Ms. Fenwick took early retirement so she could remain close to her
family. She has no immediate survivors.
