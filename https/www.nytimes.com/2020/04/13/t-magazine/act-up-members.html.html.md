It’s been 33 years since [ACT UP](https://actupny.com/) — the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, a direct action group made up of men and
women united in their fury at the lack of response from the government
and pharmaceutical industry to the AIDS crisis beginning in the 1980s —
took to Wall Street on March 24, 1987, to protest public apathy about
and medical profiteering from the epidemic. Since that day, much has
changed: how we think about grass-roots organizing, the ways in which
community among marginalized groups is cultivated and fostered, the life
expectancy and treatment of people living with H.I.V. and AIDS. ****
While many of the issues the group labored to address **** also ****
persist, ACT UP has created an indelible blueprint for ****
on-the-ground activism that has paved the way both for other movements,
including Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, and for subsequent
generations of L.G.B.T.Q. people to continue to fight, unrelentingly,
for justice.

For [T’s Culture
issue](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/culture-issue-2020.html),
which highlights a range of influential creative communities, [we
gathered 98
members](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/act-up-aids.html)
of ACT UP, past and present, for a reunion of sorts at New York’s Manny
Cantor Center in February. As the writer and director David France
explains of the group’s participants in his accompanying essay, ****
“They had little in common beyond what political scientists call a
linked fate: Everyone in those meetings knew someone who was dying or
had died, or else they were marked for death themselves. This brought a
ferocious urgency into the room.” **** Here, in their own words, 12
members explain why they joined.

### [LARRY KRAMER](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/larry-kramer-dead.html), 84  
**Joined in 1987 (founding member)**

From the day I read the July 1981 New York Times
[article](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html)
titled “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals,” I just knew that no one was
going to do anything to respond. Several friends of mine had already
died. So I started writing tirades in the gay press; it scared the crap
out of everyone, and my pieces were published in other gay newspapers
around the country. I worked with the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, which is
a patient care organization, from January 1982, but they wouldn’t
protest visibly. In contrast, ACT UP was a direct-action group and did
nothing *but* protest. It was an exceptionally moving organization.
There was so much love between the men and women fighting side by side.

### IVY KWAN ARCE, 55  
**Joined in 1990**

In 1990, when I first moved to New York, I saw a couple of the graphics
that ACT UP had posted all over the city. One of them said, “Women don’t
get AIDS. They just die.” Underneath that, it listed the risk factors
for women. At the time, I was dating someone who was an IV drug user and
they would tell me, “There’s no reason to get a test, because women
don’t get it.” When I finally got checked, I tested positive. The
doctor who gave me the results said, “The only place that will give you
advice is ACT UP.” I immediately remembered the poster that I had seen,
and I went to a meeting that same day. I met people who were key figures
within the group, and they helped me a lot; I learned not only how to
take part in actions but also how to be part of a supportive community.
They taught me — someone who wasn’t a great speaker and who had no
experience working for AIDS organizations — to take up space in this
movement.

### PETER STALEY, 59  
**Joined in 1987**

I found out I was H.I.V. positive in late 1985 while I was a bond trader
at JPMorgan. I was 24 years old and deep in the closet then. About a
year and a half later, in March of ’87, I was handed a flyer on my way
to work by a new organization called ACT UP that was doing its very
first demonstration on Wall Street. I didn’t see the protest myself — I
was on the trading floor when it happened — but I saw it that night on
TV **** and was really impressed that they made the national news and
that the F.D.A. commissioner held a news conference. I could tell that
it was real, the kind of power that I wanted to tap into right away. I
got myself to the very next meeting and never looked back.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I had a crazy year where I was a closeted bond trader by day and a
radical AIDS activist by night. It ended when **** my CD4 count ****
\[the number of T cells in the body that fight infection and are the
primary target of the virus\] crashed in early ’88. I walked into my
boss’s office the next morning, told him everything and dedicated myself
to AIDS activism from that point on. I felt like I had entered the
movement for very selfish reasons — I was desperate to buy myself some
time — but within months of being part of this extraordinary response
from a community that was filled with love and passion and determination
and anger, I realized I was a part of something far larger than myself,
something that could change the lives of millions of people. I got
totally swept up in that. ACT UP became my church, my social life, what
I did every moment of the day — it’s where I found all my boyfriends\!
And it’s where I became an activist, which has been my title ever since.

### ERIC SAWYER, 66  
**Joined in 1987 (founding member)**

I got involved with ACT UP mainly because I knew that there were a lot
of homeless people with AIDS and I wanted to try to develop housing for
them. In 1987, I called Larry Kramer, who had been a friend of mine
since 1980 — he helped me find doctors when I got sick, and helped my
partner, who died in ’86, with access to medical care — and he told me
about this speech he was going to give at the Gay and Lesbian Community
Center, in which he was going to call for a group to be civilly
disobedient. He asked me if I would be a plant in the audience and bring
some attractive friends to encourage other people to come. So my initial
attendance was driven by a request from Larry to come and help form a
group. But the experience of organizing that first demonstration at the
center was empowering: It allowed me to turn my feelings of anger at the
loss of my partner into some type of action. I became hooked after that.

### ROBERT VAZQUEZ-PACHECO, 64  
**Joined in 1988**

In September 1980, my boyfriend at the time, Jeff, whom I was living
with, was diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma. So, my relationship with the
epidemic started early on. After his death in February 1986, I started
to figure out what I would do with my life. I became a facilitator in my
gay male consciousness-raising group, which met on Mondays in one of the
rooms at the Gay and Lesbian Community Center. When my friend, the
activist David Kirschenbaum, and I left each week, we would walk
downstairs and through the ACT UP meeting. We entered the meeting one
day, and the room was filled with mainly white gay men. I’m a person of
color, and I have to get my bearings when I walk into an overwhelmingly
white space. David asked me, “Well, where do we stand?” I looked around
and found **** that, in that old ACT UP room, the power brokers were in
the right-hand corner at the back. So I said to David, “That’s where we
stand.”

I think the group had done its first Wall Street protest by then, and we
were trying to figure out whether we wanted to get involved. Of course,
I did. After having dealt with what Jeff went through, I was certainly
pissed off enough. I thought, “This is a good way for me to deal with
what I’m feeling now.” Recently, I’ve been trying to write an account,
in my own words, of the racial politics of ACT UP — and about the
whitewashing that’s going on. A lot of academics of color are actually
now starting to write about this. It’s very important, because there
were so many people of color who were part of ACT UP, even at the
beginning — who were there and then died.

### JAMIE BAUER, 61  
**Joined in 1987**

In 1981, I became active in the [Women’s Pentagon
Action](http://www.wloe.org/WLOE-en/background/wpastatem.html), which is
a feminist, anti-militarist group with connections to the War Resisters
**** League (WRL), one of the oldest pacifist organizations in the
United States. I was trained in nonviolent civil disobedience: We would
discuss a demonstration and really walk through the safety of it to make
sure that we weren’t doing anything to intentionally hurt people. When
ACT UP started in 1987, some of the organizers of the first meeting
reached out to the WRL. David McReynolds, a longtime member, and I
dispatched WRL members who understood nonviolent civil disobedience —
and that included the two of us, both queer — to go to the ACT UP
meeting and do a brief training. After that, I just stuck with it.

As a pacifist, for me, it was always about acknowledging your anger and
channeling it into something productive — and, of course, with people
dying, there was so much anger. Although ACT UP did not take a vow of
nonviolence, we had a series of principles that were built upon that; we
had very clearly drawn lines. For me, the biggest struggle was working
with people to make sure that we didn’t overstep those boundaries, that
we didn’t turn into the Weathermen \[the ’60s and ’70s-era radical
faction of the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society\], that we
didn’t bomb buildings — which, in a time of desperation, when you’re
watching all your friends die, would have been an easy direction for us
to go in.

### KENDALL THOMAS, 63  
**Joined in 1987**

The first meeting I went to was in late ’87 at the Gay and Lesbian
Community Center. I walked into the room with a friend and it was
jam-packed. The first thing I noticed was the energy, which was
palpable, of all of those people gathered together. Until that point, I
hadn’t been in a room of people who had come together to talk about what
our community response ought to be to the absolutely crushing
indifference and outright hostility to the AIDS epidemic and people who
had it. It was a transformative moment for me. I felt that something was
possible if we fought **** together — and I had never felt that way
before about H.I.V. and AIDS.

In 1988, **** I became a founding member of the Majority Actions
Committee, which was an affinity group — one of the smaller caucuses
organized around issues such as housing, treatment and data — within ACT
UP. It was made up of people of color. A number of them died before we
had access to effective treatment. That was a moment in which I was able
to connect — in a way, frankly, that I had not been able to do before —
my commitments to racial justice and sexual justice, to racial freedom
and to sexual freedom. The self-identified Black, Latinx and Asian
members who came together in the Majority Actions Committee were able to
bring both a set of experiences and a political understanding to ACT UP
that it would otherwise have lacked.

### JAY BLOTCHER, 59  
**Joined in 1987**

In 1987, I was working as a volunteer for the Gay Men’s Health Crisis,
the AIDS service organization started by a group including Larry Kramer,
helping with the annual AIDS Walk in New York, and I had decided to take
a more active role in manning the phones. I remember one evening, when
we were making calls for donations, a friend of mine walked into our
office in Chelsea and said, “Hey, did you hear there’s going to be a
demonstration on Wall Street tomorrow? They’re going to protest the fact
that AZT is the only drug available to fight AIDS and how expensive it
is.” That resonated with me, so I got up the next morning and went down
to march. That group became ACT UP. I didn’t join officially until the
fall of 1987, after the March on Washington. When I saw ACT UP then, in
all its fiery fury, all of its grandeur, all of its sexy anger, I just
thought “Wow, I want to be a part of this.”

### AVRAM FINKELSTEIN, 68  
**Joined in 1987 (founding member)**

I was meeting, once a week, with the graphic designers, art directors
and artists that developed the iconography that ACT UP would later use —
we created the “Silence=Death” poster in 1986-87 — and I was aware that
Larry Kramer was one of the few people in New York who was writing about
AIDS as a political crisis. When I saw the announcement at the Gay and
Lesbian Community Center that he was going to speak there in March 1987,
replacing Nora Ephron the night that she wasn’t able to make it, I
suggested to the collective **** that instead of meeting that week, we
go hear Larry talk. So I didn’t simply **** hear about ACT UP and go to
a meeting: I was there at the genesis of it. Coming from a family that
was engaged in politics, I probably had a very different experience of
being part of ACT UP than people who came in cold. My parents were
members of the American Communist Party, and my grandmother used to come
to peace marches with me, so a lot of it felt very familiar. It wasn’t
so much formative for me as it was a way of connecting my own political
past to my queer identity.

### GARANCE FRANKE-RUTA, 48  
**Joined in 1988**

I started the first gay and lesbian youth group in Santa Fe, N.M., in
1987 or ’88. But that was really just with friends in high school. The
first action I participated in with ACT UP was the October 1988 protest
against the F.D.A.’s slow drug approval process and the lack of support
for affected communities. That was fairly early in ACT UP’s history, and
the group invited everybody in the broader community to come down to
Rockville, Md., **** for that action. A lot of people I knew were going,
and it seemed like what people who were engaged with the community did.
After that first year, I was involved with the protests primarily.

### ASANTEWAA GAIL HARRIS, 68  
**Joined in 1987**

I was a founding member of the Brooklyn AIDS Task Force \[now [Bridging
Access to Care NYC](https://bac-ny.org/), Brooklyn’s oldest H.I.V. and
AIDS service organization\] and had attended a national conference at
Emory University in 1987 that was sponsored by the American Medical
Association. That experience led me to other conferences, and **** I
can’t remember exactly where the idea of ACT UP membership came up for
me, but it did, and I attended a meeting. So my involvement with ACT UP
started very early on, and it was at around that time that I also joined
the Women’s Caucus and the Majority Actions Committee, two of the
several splinter groups within ACT UP. Hidden since the beginning of
this crisis was its impact on women and children. I’m a third-generation
Brooklynite, so New York City is my community; **** if there was social
justice or human rights work to be done, then I would find it. Together
with the women I was working with in the Caucus, we **** were writing
and including our stories in this movement, and I was pleased with that.

### JASON ROSENBERG, 28

I’ve been a member **** of activist groups since high school, and I

which is part of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, but because I thought
they weren’t doing enough politically to advocate **** for
[PrEP](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html) and destigmatize
H.I.V., I decided to channel all of my energy into ACT UP in 2016. The
people who are part of this long history — it’s now been 33 years —
really changed the way I view a lot of activist work. It’s helpful for
young organizers to seek mentorship from our elders and long-term
survivors. It’s sort of the best practices of protesting. We need to
reference our history to reflect on what’s next in confronting H.I.V.
and the stigma that continues to exist.
