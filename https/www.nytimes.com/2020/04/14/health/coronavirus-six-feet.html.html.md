The rule of thumb, or rather feet, has been to stand six feet apart in
public. That’s supposed to be a safe distance if a person nearby is
coughing or sneezing and is infected with the novel coronavirus,
spreading droplets that may carry virus particles.

And scientists agree that six feet is a sensible and useful minimum
distance, but, some say, farther away would be better.

Six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the
organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation on the idea
that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze
will fall to the ground within six feet.

But some scientists, having looked at studies of air flow and being
concerned about smaller particles called aerosols, suggest that people
consider a number of factors, including their own vulnerability and
whether they are outdoors or in an enclosed room, when deciding whether
six feet is enough distance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot [farther than six feet
according to a recent
study.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No scientists are suggesting a wholesale change in behavior, or
proposing that some other length for separation from another human, like
seven, or nine feet, is actually the right one.

“Everything is about probability,” said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, who is the
head of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st
Century Health Threats at the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering and Medicine. “Three feet is better than nothing. Six feet
is better than three feet. At that point, the larger drops have pretty
much fallen down. Maybe if you’re out of spitting range, that could be
even safer, but six feet is a pretty good
number.”

One complicating factor is that aerosols, smaller droplets that can be
emitted when people are breathing and talking, play some role in
spreading the new coronavirus. Studies have shown that [aerosols can be
created](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973) during certain
hospital or laboratory procedures like when using nebulizers to help
patients inhale medication, which makes such procedures risky for
doctors who do them.

If the aerosols that people exhale in other settings are significant in
spreading the disease, the six-foot distance would not be completely
protective because those are carried more easily by air currents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Aerosols are generally considered to be particles under 5 microns in
diameter, about the size of a red blood cell, and can be spread in the
environment by talking and breathing. But some researchers argue that
this is a false dichotomy. Infectious droplets can’t easily be divided
into those that are big enough to fall to the ground quickly and those
that stay aloft because so much depends on environmental conditions and
how deeply they penetrate into the respiratory tract.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“It’s really a continuum,” said Dr. Donald Milton, who studies
bioaerosols at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.

Even without the launching power of a sneeze, air currents could carry a
flow of aerosol sized virus particles exhaled by an infected person 20
feet or more away.

“In any confined geometry like an office room, meeting room, department
store, food store,” said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at Lehman
College and the City University of New York’s Graduate Center. In a
study not yet peer reviewed, he analyzed air flow and showed how, “the
[vortices in the air are taking the virus to different
places](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13689).”

A preliminary study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found
[evidence of coronavirus genetic
material](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039446v2)
on various surfaces in isolation rooms where infected patients were
being treated, including on air vents more than six feet from the
patients. The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, indicates
that the virus can occasionally travel long distances.

“The virus is so small, it can hitch a ride even on tiny, tiny
particles,” Dr. Fineberg said. “But how important is each size and how
well they can transmit disease is not fully
understood.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

It is also unclear how many virus particles it takes to start an
infection, how long the viral particles remain viable or if studies like
the one in Nebraska simply detected the genetic calling card the virus
left behind.

Spacing is an effective solution because it also reduces the number of
people in a confined space. That reduces the likelihood of an infected
person being in the group. And if there is one, fewer other people might
be infected.

Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease
Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the six-foot
distance would clearly “reduce the number of droplets you come in
contact with. I have no doubt about that.”

But, he said: “The question is what does it take for you to get
infected? And that I think is the trillion-dollar question we have.”

He said, “Maybe all it takes is an aerosol. You don’t need any droplets
at all.” If that’s the case, he said, then someone who is at high risk
would not want to be in the same room with someone who is infected or
might be infected.

Current guidelines already suggest that anyone at high risk should stay
home and not be out in public in the first place. And they seem to be
working. Places where people [reduced travel and started social
distancing weeks
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html),
especially in California, New York and Washington, are starting to show
a reduction in the number of new coronavirus cases.

People still need to shop and take care of necessities, Dr. Osterholm
said, but reducing the risk of exposure to all possible modes of
transmission — infected surfaces, droplets and smaller aerosols — is
important.

“Your job is to limit it as much as you can.”
