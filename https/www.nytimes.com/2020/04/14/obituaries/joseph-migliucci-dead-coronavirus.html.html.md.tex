who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Joseph Migliucci's parents wanted more for their young son than the
family restaurant business. So they gave him the hardest jobs, like
cleaning the floors and washing dishes.

``Finally I put him behind the range and thought, `This will kill him.
He's going to hate it,''' his father, Mario Migliucci,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/15/archives/from-a-family-of-chefs-a-feast-of-robust-neapolitan-food.html}{said
in an article by The New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne} in
1976. ``Not a bit. And now he's good at everything. Terrific bartender,
good host, the works.''

Joseph Migliucci stayed on at the restaurant, Mario's, for nearly a half
century more, maintaining its tradition as a red-sauce cornerstone of
the Bronx's Little Italy on Arthur Avenue in the Belmont section.

Mr. Migliucci, the fourth generation of his family to own the
restaurant, died on April 6 at a hospital in White Plains, N.Y. He was
81. His daughter, Regina Migliucci-Delfino, said the cause was the novel
coronavirus.

The restaurant was opened in 1919 by Joseph's great-grandmother,
Scholastica Migliucci, an Italian immigrant, as a pizzeria with six
tables. Joseph's father, Mario Migliucci, and his Uncle Clemente took
over management in the 1930s, expanded the menu and renamed it Mario's.

Joseph took a job in the restaurant at around age 13, according to his
daughter. In recent decades he and Ms. Migliucci-Delfino ran it.

Mr. Migliucci would come to work each day in a button-down shirt and
suspenders often adorned with a big yellow pin that read, ``I'm the
boss.'' He would add to customers, ``But when I go home, I give the pin
to my wife.''

Mr. Claiborne described the restaurant's fare as ``first‐rate,
unpretentious but adventurous Neapolitan cookery.''

Mario Puzo name-checked the restaurant in his novel ``The Godfather.''
When producers of the movie version asked about filming a scene there,
his father declined. ``He didn't want that stigma,'' Mr. Migliucci said.

Mr. Migliucci was born in Manhattan in Nov. 18, 1938. His mother, Rose
Migliucci, also worked at the restaurant.

He attended Samuel Gompers Industrial High School in the Bronx and went
on to study engineering at a local college before returning to the
family business. ``He loved engineering, but he had a love for people,''
his daughter said. ``And he loved the restaurant business.''

Mr. Migliucci married Francis Lagamma in 1961. Along with Regina, they
had another daughter, Michele. The couple divorced and Mr. Migliucci
married Barbara Farino. They had two children, Nicole and Mario.

Along with his wife and children, he is survived by his sister Diane
Lentini, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Ms. Migliucci-Delfino said she will continue the family legacy and run
the restaurant.
