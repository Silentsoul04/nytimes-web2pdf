# Will the Coronavirus End Israel’s Political Paralysis?

Benny Gantz, who had been seeking to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, is now talking with his rival about forming a unity

JERUSALEM — After three inconclusive elections resulting in a yearlong
impasse, Israel’s president has given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, [until Wednesday
midnight](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/world/middleeast/israel-election-netanyahu-gantz.html?action=click&module=Latest&pgtype=Homepage)
to form a unity government.

If no agreement is reached by then, Israel will edge closer to a fourth
election, despite the state of national emergency created by the
coronavirus crisis.

On Tuesday, six weeks after [the March 2
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/middleeast/israel-election-takeaways.html)
and a series of rancorous on-again, off-again negotiations, the two
sides met for talks and again failed to finalize a deal. Here’s a look
at what’s at stake for the two sides and why Israel still has no elected
government.

The last election, like the two before it, produced no clear winner.

Mr. Gantz, a former army chief and leader of the centrist Blue and White
party who entered politics not much more than a year ago, came out in a
slightly better position than Mr. Netanyahu, the conservative incumbent
and Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.

With more endorsements from members of Parliament, Mr. Gantz was
afforded the first chance to build a coalition. But the anti-Netanyahu
camp, encompassing Arab, Islamic and Jewish ultranationalist parties,
proved too disparate to form a government.

Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party and his right-wing and religious partners
fell short of a majority to form their own government in the 120-seat
Parliament.

The only way forward was for Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to join forces
in a national unity government. Mr. Gantz resisted at first because it
meant reneging on his repeated election promises not to sit in a
government with a prime minister under indictment. Mr. Netanyahu is
facing trial on [charges of bribery, fraud and breach of
trust](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-indicted.html).
He has denied any wrongdoing.

Then the coronavirus hit Israel.

Mr. Netanyahu, a canny political survivor, publicly beseeched Mr. Gantz
to join him in a national emergency government to combat the health
crisis. He proposed sharing the job of prime minister, with Mr.
Netanyahu holding it for the first 18 months, and Mr. Gantz taking over
for the next 18.

The pandemic has sickened thousands of Israelis and killed at least 118
so far. But negotiations over the government bogged down over political
and legal details.

First, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz differ in their approaches to
President Trump’s proposal to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Mr. Netanyahu has pledged to swiftly and unilaterally annex large swaths
of the occupied West Bank, while Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White party has
said it is opposed to unilateral annexation in the absence of broad
international consensus.

The two sides have reportedly come to an agreement on this issue.

More problematic was what critics describe as Mr. Netanyahu’s singular
goal of ensuring he can remain in office despite his legal troubles.

Mr. Netanyahu tried to change the procedures for appointing Supreme
Court judges, according to Blue and White officials. Then, analysts
said, he was seeking a way to circumvent any future Supreme Court
decision barring a candidate charged with crimes — like himself — from
forming a government.

By remaining in office, Mr. Netanyahu gains crucial leverage should he
try to negotiate a deal with state prosecutors, or he might try to
secure immunity from prosecution.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

These demands appeared to be a sticking point for Mr. Gantz, who said he
was holding out to protect fundamental democratic values, particularly
the rule of law.

“Netanyahu and Likud know that we are reasonable partners,” he said on
Monday night. “They also know that there are certain areas on which we
won’t compromise — foremost among them, protecting the rule of law and
safeguarding Israeli democracy. Those are always important, but even
more so during times of
crisis.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or

But Mr. Gantz has come under bitter attack from many former allies and
supporters who saw his willingness to enter into a Netanyahu-led
government, along with Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing and religious
coalition partners, as a betrayal. His party has broken up, with about
half its members headed into the opposition, leaving him with less
leverage and few political options.

“At least don’t call this an emergency government,” Yair Lapid, a former
Gantz ally, [wrote on Twitter on
Tuesday](https://twitter.com/yairlapid/status/1249954842640093185),
noting the lack of attention to health and economic issues in the
negotiations.

## Will a unity government bring national healing and reconciliation?

After a year of political deadlock, a unity deal may provide a temporary
balm for a deeply divided and anxious Israel under lockdown to fight the
coronavirus. But a unity coalition is unlikely to resolve Israel’s
longstanding divisions.

Since Mr. Gantz’s party would be joining a coalition that would include
Mr. Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox allies, there is likely to be little
movement to resolve the [religious-secular
tensions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/world/middleeast/israeli-election-religious-secular.html?searchResultPosition=4)
that have roiled Israeli society for years.

With Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing partners in the government — and with
Mr.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Trump still in office —
there is also unlikely to be any resumption of peace talks with the
Palestinians. The Palestinians have [rejected the Trump administration’s
peace
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/middleeast/palestinian-trump-plan-UN.html)
as hopelessly biased toward Israel.

If a unity government were to move ahead with annexing parts of the
occupied West Bank, Israel’s relations with Egypt and Jordan could also
be severely undermined.

Mr. Netanyahu has taken pride in his handling of the coronavirus crisis
so far.

“Dear citizens of Israel, our ability to respond quickly and flexibly to
the coronavirus challenge is arousing appreciation in many countries,”
he said in a televised address on Monday.

But once the lockdown is lifted, many will find themselves out of work.
So far, the crisis has left more than a million Israelis, out of a
population of nine million, on indefinite unpaid leave or unemployed.

Mr. Netanyahu has said that under his continued stewardship, the country
will prevail.

“Previously, in the two major economic crises of this millennium, I
succeeded — with your help — in moving the Israeli economy on to great
achievements,” he said in the Monday address. “We emerged from the
crises and the Israeli economy flourished. It is my intention, together
with you, to do this again.”
