# The Heartbreaking Last Texts of a Hospital Worker on the Front Lines

Madhvi Aya worked long hours in the emergency room of a hospital in
Brooklyn that was battered by the coronavirus. Then she caught the virus
herself.

Lying in a hospital bed last month, Madhvi Aya understood what was
happening to her.

She had been a doctor in India, then trained to become a physician
assistant after she immigrated to the United States. She had worked for
a dozen years at Woodhull Medical Center, a public hospital in Brooklyn,
where she could see the coronavirus tearing [a merciless
path](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/nyregion/coronavirus-queens-corona-jackson-heights-elmhurst.html)
through the city.

Within days of her last shift as a caregiver, Ms. Aya became a patient.
She had worked in Woodhull’s understaffed emergency room, taking medical
histories, ordering tests and asking about symptoms. Now she had become
infected.

Ms. Aya, 61, was alone in a hospital, less than two miles from her
husband and 18-year-old daughter on Long Island, who could not visit
her. She did not have the solace of familiar colleagues; she had been
admitted to a different facility nearer her home. In a text with her
family, she described horrible chest pain from trying to get out of bed.

“I have not improved the way should have been,” she wrote her husband,
Raj, on March 23.

As she grew sicker, her texts came less frequently and in short,
sporadic bursts.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I miss you mommy,” her daughter, Minnoli, wrote on March 25. She craved
the reassurance of her mother’s hugs, the comfort of crawling into her
bed. “Please don’t give up hope because I haven’t given up. I need my
mommy. I need you to come back to me.”

“Love you,” Ms. Aya wrote the next day.

“Mom be back.”

Ms. Aya could not keep that promise.

Front-line health care workers [face a high
risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-doctors-sick.html)of
contracting the coronavirus, and scores have become sick. But it is less
known how many have died in New York from the virus after working
closely with Covid-19 patients.

Health care systems by and large have not publicly revealed the
identities of those employees, who include [Kious
Kelly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/nurse-dies-coronavirus-mount-sinai.html),
a nurse manager at Mount Sinai West in Manhattan, and Dr. Ronald
Verrier, a surgeon at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. [Doctors,
nurses and
staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/americas/health-workers-attacked.html)
who worked in other capacities at hospitals that have been flooded with
virus patients have also died, according to their families and
colleagues.

Ms. Aya’s text messages and her family’s account of her final days
reveal a woman who spent much of her life devoted to medicine before
succumbing to the [cruel and familiar
arc](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-doctors.html)
of a patient with Covid-19. Her early mild symptoms and quarantine at
home were followed by a rapidly escalating illness and long waits for
care, until she died alone.

Ms. Aya moved to the United States in 1994 to join her husband, who had
immigrated a decade earlier and met her on a return trip to India. She
started working at Woodhull in 2008 and became a senior physician
assistant. Colleagues said she nurtured younger co-workers by drawing on
the experience she had gained as an anesthesiologist and internist in
India, along with her instinct as a caretaker.

“This has been a heavy blow to us all,” Dr. Robert Chin, Woodhull’s
emergency department director, said in an internal email on April 1,
asking for
[donations](https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-madhvi-aya?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m_pd+share-sheet)
to help Ms. Aya’s family, for whom she had been the primary wage earner.

Like many other hospitals, Woodhull had converted one ward after the
next into makeshift intensive care units when the virus [began its surge
in New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-hospitals.html?searchResultPosition=3).
As the hospital verged on running out of ventilators, protective gear
for medical staff and other equipment, it appealed to affiliated medical
centers for help and transferred patients elsewhere.

In the week of Ms. Aya’s death, Woodhull’s emergency department alone
had 20 patients on ventilators, Dr. Chin said.

Another Woodhull employee, a radiology [clerk named Thomas
Soto](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2944721018928457&id=100001717633057),
died of the virus at the hospital last week, 12 days after his first
symptoms. Mr. Soto, 59, worked there for decades and was close to
retirement. “The only reason my dad pushed to work that extra year was
to retire with full pension, and I lost him because of that,” Jonathan
Soto, the older of Mr. Soto’s two sons, said through tears.

A former hospital police officer, Herb A. Houchen, 35, returned to
Woodhull as a Covid patient and also died. He had worked at Woodhull for
more than five years and left behind an 11-year-old
daughter.

Ms. Aya’s daughter, Minnoli, said her emotions have ranged from intense
grief to disbelief. She thinks about becoming a doctor herself and is
angry at a health care system that she believes did not protect its
front-line workers. Sometimes she is angry at her mother for not coming
home.

“I just want to be able to hug her and have her tell me everything is
going to be OK,” Minnoli said.

There is no way to determine how Ms. Aya became infected. While she
worked at Woodhull in early March, front-line employees had not yet been
instructed to wear protective masks for all patients, one staff member
said. Later, as the crisis grew, hospitals realized that people coming
in for apparently unrelated problems were also testing positive for the
virus, potentially exposing unwitting health care workers.

On March 17, Woodhull’s administration advised emergency department
workers to wear masks for all patients. A spokesman for New York City’s
Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees Woodhull, said
protective equipment was available to its health care workers.

Ms. Aya’s shifts could be grueling at [Woodhull, a 320-bed public
hospital](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/woodhull/) at the
intersection of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and Williamsburg. Her
husband often drove her to work from their home in Floral Park as early
as 6 a.m. and picked her up 12 hours later so she could relax in the
car.

“We have to take care of our patients first,” she often
said.

At the beginning of the outbreak, Ms. Aya worried about bringing the
virus home to her 64-year-old husband, whom she had guided through an
aortic bypass in 2017, and her 86-year-old mother, Malti Masrani, for
whom she had cared after a stroke late last year.

She began coughing around the time of her last shift on March 12, Mr.
Aya said. He drove her to Woodhull the next evening so a doctor could
examine her, picking her up many hours later, after she was tested.

For the next few days, they quarantined on different floors of their
Cape Cod-style home. Ms. Aya had no underlying medical conditions,
family members
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

But her cough worsened at home, and she developed a fever. In the early
afternoon of March 18, Mr. Aya dropped his wife off at Long Island
Jewish Medical Center, near their home. He would not see her again.

For an hour and a half, Mr. Aya sat in his car in the hospital parking
lot, texting his wife — almost always addressing her as “SH,” for
“sweetheart”— to check if she had received a chest X-ray and to say
that he had tried to get in to see her.

“You go home I call you I am waiting,” she wrote.

At 4:47 a.m. the next day, Ms. Aya texted that she was still waiting for
a bed. When Mr. Aya woke up, he asked if he could bring her coffee. She
said no. She reported her test had come back from Woodhull. Positive.

“I’m so sorry to hear,” he replied.

They spoke by phone, and she told him to take care of her mother and
bring her daughter home from school.

The next day, Minnoli Aya returned from the University at Buffalo, where
she was a freshman. She believed her mother had pneumonia and hoped to
surprise her. Instead, she learned her mother had contracted the
coronavirus.

“I was just on the floor, and I was broken,” Minnoli said.

Over the next week, she texted with her mother, who continued to
deteriorate. Doctors called Mr. Aya daily. By the end of the week, his
wife was increasingly having trouble breathing.

By the morning of March 29, doctors got ready to put Ms. Aya on a
ventilator. But there was a life-threatening complication, and they
asked Mr. Aya if he wanted to see his wife for what could be the last
time. He worried that his heart condition would put him at risk if he
caught the virus, and Minnoli could be left without a parent.

The decision not to go, he said, has haunted him. That afternoon, the
hospital called to say that his wife had died.

Minnoli, her father and grandmother could not hug each other, because
they were required to stay six feet apart, even though they lived in the
same house. Nor did they want to plan a funeral service that almost no
one would attend, one where they would not be able to view Ms. Aya’s
body. They decided to have her cremated.

Even after her mother died, Minnoli still texted, trying to stay
connected.

“I miss u,” she wrote before going to bed that night. When she woke the
next morning, Minnoli texted, “Thank you for coming to me last night in
my dreams.”

Mr. Aya, concerned about Minnoli, arranged for her to speak to a
therapist by video after his wife’s death. But he is not sure how long
he can afford the expense because Ms. Aya’s health care plan had covered
the family. A representative of her union benefit fund told him by email
that benefits would end 30 days after his wife’s death. “My heart is
broken for you,” the representative wrote in the email, which was
reviewed by The New York Times.

In the weeks since Ms. Aya has been gone, Minnoli has pored over the
messages still sitting in her phone.

“Hi mommy. College is getting so much more stressful now that it’s at
home,” she had written, three days before her mother’s death. “The good
thing is I’m home but I need you to come back here to me. I hope you ate
dinner and I’m still praying for you and haven’t gave up hope.”

“Concentrate,” Ms. Aya responded.

“I am but I want u home.”

“Home soon.”

“I love you mommy with all my heart.”

“Love you.”

Those were Ms. Aya’s final words to her
daughter.
