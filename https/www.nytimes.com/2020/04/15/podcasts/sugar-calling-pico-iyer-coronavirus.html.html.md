### Hosted by Cheryl Strayed, produced by Kelly Prime and edited by Sara Sarasohn. Editorial oversight by Wendy Dorr.

#### Cheryl Strayed calls the writer Pico Iyer to talk about forest fires, the Dalai Lama and losing what you love.

Wednesday, April 15th, 2020

  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Pico Iyer. I first met him on the page when
    I was 20 and I read his book “Video Night in Kathmandu.” And right
    then and there, I knew, this is a writer I’ll follow anywhere. He’s
    published more than a dozen books, many of them about his travels
    around the world, but more importantly, about the journey inward. He
    very beautifully captures the miraculous ordinary moments and
    exchanges that we have on our travels and in life. And he’s always
    looking for the deeper meaning in that. His most recent book is
    called “Autumn Light.” It’s about his life in Japan. He’s there
    right now. And I’m going to give him a call.

  - \[music\]

  - \[line ringing\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hello?

  - pico iyer  
    Hello. Is that Cheryl?

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s Cheryl. Is that Pico?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. I’m so happy to hear your voice. We get to talk at last.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m so excited. At last we get to speak, Pico.

  - pico iyer  
    The feeling’s mutual.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I mean, we’ve corresponded over email, we’ve had a couple of almost
    meetings, but it’s just never happened. So here we are.

  - pico iyer  
    One of the beautiful things this curious moment has brought us, that
    you and I can speak more easily across 6,000 miles than perhaps if
    we were on the same west coast.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Exactly. So tell me, where are you right now?

  - pico iyer  
    I’m in a tiny apartment in a boring suburb in Japan. And there are
    cherry blossoms flowering over every last stream and path, bright
    blue spring morning. The nightingales have been teaching their young
    how to sing. Old folk are taking themselves and their dogs for a
    walk around the neighborhood. And as you probably know, things have
    tightened up quite a bit in Japan, so everybody is braced for maybe
    a spike in coronavirus cases. But for now, things really look very
    much as they always do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And what city are you a suburb of?

  - pico iyer  
    We’re a suburb of the great ancient capital of Nara. So it was the
    capital of Japan in the 8th century, but where we live is this
    little town that looks like it was modeled on the San Fernando
    Valley. It’s a suburb younger than my kids are. We’ve been here 27
    years now, kind of living almost as if we were students. We don’t
    have a car, we don’t have a bicycle. I’ve actually never used a cell
    phone until this conversation, when I’m borrowing my wife’s. So we
    live in quite an isolated place. So I really feel blessed here. And
    of course, everyone here is really, really worried about the sick
    around the world and the people who don’t have a home and the people
    who don’t have resources. But Japan is relatively cushioned from
    that. And so I think people here are very good at remaining calm and
    remaining cheerful, and stoical, too, and realizing that things are
    a little hard right now, but they’re much harder everywhere else.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. So there hasn’t yet been that sense of emergency in Japan.
    How long have you all been socially isolating?

  - pico iyer  
    Well, that really only came in this week. And nobody is blase, but
    for the moment, we feel very lucky, and especially this springtime
    sense, because again, you know this, I’m sure, that everyone loves
    the cherry blossoms in Japan precisely because they don’t last. And
    I think this is a culture that’s always known how to live with
    impermanence because they’ve been living for 1,400 years very close
    to earthquake and tsunami and fire and warfare. And so they know a
    little bit about how to live with the fact that everything is
    constantly uncertain, changing, fragile and mortal. And the cherry
    blossoms are such a good example of that because it’s the fact they
    only last for 10 days that makes them so beautiful. And if they
    lasted forever, we would take them for granted. When I came here, I
    heard this wonderful phrase about how life is about a joyful
    participation in a world of sorrows. In other words, every life ends
    in death, every meeting ends in a separation, but that’s not a
    reason to grieve. It’s actually a reason to find our beauty and joy
    right now.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s beautiful. I love those cherry blossoms. It is so clearly a
    metaphor for what I think the world is experiencing right now, being
    reminded of the fleeting beauty that also ends in a kind of demise
    or a loss. And I’m wondering if you can tell me more about what you
    know about impermanence.

  - pico iyer  
    Well, that’s a beautiful question, and I think I don’t know any more
    than anybody else, except over my 63 years now, I’ve suffered my
    share of losses. And I actually remember very vividly as I’m talking
    to you, there was this one day when I was in my family home in the
    hills of California, and I saw this distant line of orange cutting
    through a hillside. So I went downstairs to call the fire
    department. And when I came upstairs again, I saw that our house was
    encircled by 70-foot flames, a forest fire that was being whipped
    along by 70-mile-per-hour winds. And by the end of that evening,
    three hours later, I had lost my house, every last thing I owned in
    the world, pretty much even my dreams of being a writer because all
    my next three books and all my notes were handwritten, and they were
    gone forever.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And when was this, Pico?

  - pico iyer  
    This was actually in 1990. I remember now, it was a shock to
    everybody, our whole town, but after about a year, I would say that
    there were some people who were shocked and scarred, but thought,
    well, maybe this is a chance to live a little differently and more
    closely to what really calls to me and my deeper self. When it came
    to replacing my things, for example, I realized I didn’t need 90
    percent of my books, my clothes, my furniture. The insurance company
    was ready to replace them, but I could live more lightly. Then I
    thought, well, actually since I don’t have a family home in the
    U.S., maybe I can spend more time in Japan, a country that I really
    feel at home at. And then, since I’d lost all my notes, but I still
    was possessed by the wish to write and haunted by certain subjects,
    I thought, well, now’s the time to try fiction, which I think I
    would have been too scared or shy to try otherwise. So at this great
    remove, 30 years on, I don’t see that fire as entirely a bad thing
    in my life. And I see it as, in many ways, liberating me from the
    habits that I was kind of sleepwalking with through my life. I still
    get scared every time I see walls of flame rise up above the
    mountains above our rebuilt house, which has happened maybe 11 times
    since. But, I feel that that fire reduced me to nothing and forced
    me to think about what I care about, and actually sharpened my sense
    of priorities and made possible my life now.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, right. I think that’s one of the most fascinating things about
    human existence to me. You and I both teach writing. We almost
    taught together at our beloved Esalen Institute in Big Sur- -

  - pico iyer  
    Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — a couple years ago. But one of the things that I’m always struck
    by in my own life, and also in the lives of others — and because I
    teach writing, I get to read so many other people’s stories when we
    ask them to write — so often, those stories are about the hardest
    thing. About the deepest, most painful wound and the time where they
    lost everything. And what’s always true about that is we wouldn’t
    have wished it upon ourselves, we wouldn’t have wished it often upon
    our worst enemy, if we have enemies — I don’t, I hope you don’t,
    either — but they are always the things that teach us the most. I
    always say this to my students. If we went around the circle and I
    said you have to tell everyone how you learned the most important
    lessons of your life, they would almost always be painful
    experiences or big losses. And yet, so we know this to be true,
    right? You know this to be true, I know this to be true. Why do we
    resist it, then? I mean, we still say, but please, universe, don’t
    let the bad thing happen to me.

  - pico iyer  
    I think we resist it the way we resist going to the dentist. We all
    know we’ll be better if that dentist fills our cavity and cleanses
    our infection and straightens our teeth, but nonetheless, we know
    it’s going to be painful to get to that end result. I mean, it’s
    funny what you were just saying, it’s so true. And I think one of
    the things that the fire taught me, I feel, is that it was a
    reminder, as you said, of what we always know, which is that we have
    much less power over the world than we imagine, but I feel we have
    much more power over how we respond to the world than we suspect.
    And really, it’s our responses to circumstances that define us much
    more than the circumstances themselves. And every writer knows —
    well, actually that night of the fire, as soon as I was able to
    escape and drive downtown after three hours, the first thing I did
    was go to a friend’s computer and write a piece about having an
    eyewitness view on this moment of history. And I suppose it was my
    small way of saying — every writer knows this, but I think every
    person can be reminded of it — the fire hasn’t stripped me of
    everything. I still have my feelings, my thoughts, my words. I’m not
    powerless. It’s a wonderful sharing that, when people go into those
    dark places, they’re coming back with gifts to present to their
    readers or their friends that they never would if they were just
    saying it’s a bright day and I’m having a wonderful time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I think maybe that’s those extremes that in both of your
    examples, really, that are given to us by the natural world. There’s
    the outrageous beauty of those cherry blossoms, and then when they
    fade, there’s still beauty. We still have beauty here every day. We
    might have to look a little harder for it, but it’s there. And that
    fire scorches — takes everything from you, and the first thing you
    think after reckoning with that loss is I still have the most
    important things.

  - pico iyer  
    Exactly.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right? I still have everything I need.

  - pico iyer  
    Exactly. That’s right. You know, my parents come from India, and the
    great Shiva, the god of India, is the god of creation and
    destruction. And as you say, fire, water, they’re all about those
    same things. And I think all of us, our first concern is with the
    people who are undefended and on the streets and really sick or in
    bad shape right now. But I think many of us who might have a job to
    return to and a roof over our heads and remain healthy through this
    virus, I think it’s giving us really a chance to remember what
    sustains us and what we care about, which has much more to do with
    what you were just describing — the cherry blossoms, as they flower,
    as they die, the fire — than with what we were probably talking
    about two months ago, which is Meghan and Harry or what’s the latest
    tweet. It’s suddenly cut through all that. And for the fortunate, at
    least, this is a chance suddenly to cut that vicious cycle. Because
    I think for many years, I and many people I know, have felt we’re in
    such a hurry we can’t see what a hurry we’re in. And more and more
    stuff is coming in on us, and we don’t have time to process it. And
    suddenly, nature has intervened and said, OK, come to a halt. Your
    life is out of control. Stop. Now, where do you want your priorities
    to be? What do you want to spend the rest of your life doing? You
    don’t know how long that rest of the life is, but this is your
    chance to get your life in balance a little bit. And I certainly
    felt that in this moment.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It sounds like to me, though, and what I know of you, you already
    are a deeply reflective person. You don’t really do social media or
    really absorb much news. And so how has this experience shifted your
    consciousness? Has it?

  - pico iyer  
    So it’s interesting because I’m not a religious person, but, for
    example, I love tennis, so I spend a lot of time watching Roger
    Federer. And I love — I wish I were exaggerating, I’m not — I love
    writing, so I spend a lot of time reading Alice Munro. And I love
    life, and —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Just so you know, Alice Munro is my favorite writer.

  - pico iyer  
    Actually, I was driving along Highway 1 near Esalen when the news of
    her Nobel came on the radio. And I was so excited, I literally drove
    to the side of the road and jumped up and shouted, “There’s justice
    in the world.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s so beautiful. I love her.

  - pico iyer  
    So I feel I learned so much from reading Alice Munro, so much from
    watching Roger Federer, and so I wanted to spend time trying to turn
    to those people who I think are professionals of life. And in this
    instance, professionals of solitude and what to do with it. So I
    spend a lot of my life, I suppose, hanging out with monks, and, when
    I’m here in our apartment, reading Thomas Merton and Thoreau and
    listening to Leonard Cohen, because I think they’re essentially
    professionals at the art of living. And I want to learn from them. I
    want to find out from them what matters.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. So do I. So you mentioned Leonard Cohen, who I also love. You
    knew him, and you wrote the liner notes for four of his albums,
    correct?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. Yes.
    
    I actually, I first met him when he was living as an ordained Zen
    monk. And of course, it was eye-opening and humbling. And I drove up
    to these high, cold, dark mountains behind Los Angeles. There was a
    man in a tattered black robe who I didn’t even recognize as my
    lifelong \[INAUDIBLE\]. And so Leonard Cohen, at the age of 61,
    spent five years — he could have been doing anything in the world —
    he spent five years just scrubbing floors and shoveling snow,
    cooking for his fellow monks, driving his aged abbot to the doctor.
    And he, more than anyone I’ve met, would tell me this was the great,
    as he would put it, voluptuous and delicious adventure he had found
    in his life. And I thought, when someone in his 60s who really has
    tasted everything — sex, drugs, rock and roll, you name it — says
    that, I should think about it. Because there was a man who’d been
    famous for 40 years, he’s a globally adored heartthrob, but I would
    say he was the wisest, kindest, and least impressed by himself
    person I’ve ever met, other than perhaps the Dalai Lama. And I
    thought, my heavens, this is really an instruction about what
    matters in life. Probably when I was a kid, I dreamed of being
    Leonard Cohen, the wandering minstrel and the cool poet with the
    beautiful girlfriend and the Armani suit. But meeting him in that
    monastery, I thought, no, actually what he’s telling me is about
    selflessness and modesty and becoming an anonymous grunt, which I
    think is how he would refer to himself in that period.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. And you look to him, is he one of your sources of wisdom when
    you — you were talking about the writers who are amongst you, who
    offer those words of consolation and recognition or insight when
    you’re looking for it —

  - pico iyer  
    Absol —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Where do you look?

  - pico iyer  
    You know, I woke up and was listening to him over breakfast this
    morning, some of his earliest songs, and I was noticing something
    interesting, which is, when he was a young man, he was always
    writing about spiritual life. Jesus in his lonely wooden tower and
    Joseph in a manger, Sisters of Mercy. Once he became a monk, he
    didn’t write about the spiritual life, he wrote, just as you were
    saying earlier, about pain and panic and confusion and loss, and the
    fact that mortality, death was coming closer and closer to him. And
    it struck me that, as a young man, he was all about yearning, as so
    many of us are, but once he really gave himself to this unflinching
    discipline, he was just going deep, deep, deep, deep into those dark
    places that you were talking about that you share with fellow
    writers in Esalen and elsewhere. And I think his two great gifts
    were intimacy and honesty. And that’s why, even though he’s left the
    world now, so many people I think feel him to be a very close friend
    and a real guide in difficult times.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. And so Pico, I want to ask you, I know you’ve spent time with
    the Dalai Lama. And you traveled around Japan with him, is that
    correct?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. I mean, I’ve been lucky, I’ve known him since I was a teenager,
    and I wrote a book on him. And so since my book, I travel every year
    across Japan with him. And we traveled up to the tsunami area in
    Japan just a few months after 18,500 people had been killed in the
    tsunami. And we went to this little fishing village called
    Ishinomaki. And when we got there, it was a wasteland. It looked
    like pictures of Hiroshima after the war. And the only thing that
    survived, miraculously, was this little temple in the shelter of a
    mountain. And there were a few little schoolboys in school uniform,
    maybe five years old, who were waiting at the front and shaking his
    hand. And my wife told me that they were chosen because they were
    orphans. They’d just lost their parents. Now the whole community was
    looking after them. But they’d been given the honor of saying hello
    to the Dalai Lama. And then as he was sitting in the temple, he
    said, of course there’s nothing I can give you except my heart and
    my presence. But he suddenly remembered a moment in March 1959 when
    he was in his hometown of Lhasa, Tibet, when he was told he had to
    leave his hometown that night. So no time to say goodbye to his
    friends, he had to leave then and there, and walk for two weeks
    across the highest mountains on the planet to get to safety in
    exile. And of course, as he said that, everyone there knew that, for
    52 years at that point, he’d never been back to his homeland. It’s
    now 60 years he’s never been back to Tibet. And I think it was his
    way of saying, I can’t imagine what you’ve been through, but loss is
    an equal opportunity employer. All of us have lost something, and
    we’re all in this together. And that suffering is a fact of life,
    and actually the grace of it is that it helps us reach towards
    others. I have a great friend who’s a Benedictine monk, and he sent
    this line to his friends last week, which is the best cure for
    anxiety is thinking of others. And I thought, thank heavens for
    monks. Doesn’t matter if you’re a Benedictine or not, that’s really
    good advice. And maybe that’s another of the possibilities that this
    moment holds for us, that we’re not caught up in our own agendas,
    racing off to write this article, give this speech, do that meeting.
    We’re suddenly alone with our thoughts, and our thoughts can turn to
    other people better.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You said in one of your Ted Talks — and I’m not remembering the
    story, so I want you to tell it to me again — it was when you were
    traveling with the Dalai Lama, and you said to him each morning,
    what are we going to do, or what are we going to find, and he said,
    “I don’t know.” Am I getting that right?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. And I think even more impressively, when he’s in an auditorium
    with 30,000 people and, for example, somebody will put up a hand and
    ask a very serious question about either a marriage or children and
    child rearing, and he’ll fool around laughing and say, “You’ve asked
    the worst person in the world. I’m a celibate monk. I don’t know a
    thing about marriage and relationships with a wife and kids. You
    know much more about that.” And I think the first thing I’d say is,
    he has the courage to say that there’s so many areas in the world he
    doesn’t know about, and the humility to point out that we know many
    things about the world that the Dalai Lama doesn’t. Well, you
    mentioned a Ted Talk. And one of the most moving I’ve ever seen was
    given by Pope Francis, who said — the gist of it that I took away
    was, the more powerful you are, the more you have to be humble, and
    the more you have to essentially be kneeling before reality, before
    the future, before all the things that we know that we can’t
    control. And so I love the fact that the Dalai Lama, who so many
    people seek out for wisdom, of which he has a huge amount, still
    will often say I don’t know. Because he doesn’t know what’s
    happening tomorrow. He doesn’t know what’s happening tonight. He’s a
    human being, as he would always stress. And so whenever people talk
    to him about his magical powers, he says, oh, I wish I had magical
    powers. If I did, I’d bring peace to Tibet and peace to the Middle
    East, and I wouldn’t have a sore throat right now. And so don’t look
    to me, the Dalai Lama, as somebody who’s above it all. I, too, am
    surrendering. And he probably surrenders more than most. I think
    that’s what distinguishes people like, probably, Pope Francis and
    Dalai Lama and the ones that we look to for wisdom — Emily
    Dickinson, one of my great heroines — because they’re living even
    more than most of us in that state of surrender. And we think of
    them as all-knowing people, but the beauty of what they’re carrying
    back to us is, I don’t know. None of us knows.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So listen, I love — you and I have a lot of the same taste — I love
    Emily Dickinson, too. But guess what I got to do last year? I got to
    go and write for an hour in her room where she wrote, where she
    lived and where she died. They told me not to touch her bed, but I
    was like a foot away from the bed where she died. And —

  - pico iyer  
    Can I ask what came out of that writing?

  - cheryl strayed  
    You know, it was a radio show in England, I think it was the BBC was
    doing a thing on the life of Emily Dickinson and her legacy. And so
    they invited three writers. It was me, Sharon Olds and Ocean Vuong.
    And we each came at our separately appointed time slots and were
    left alone with the door closed in Emily Dickinson’s bedroom. And I
    sat at her little desk, and I just looked — I spent a lot of the
    time looking out the window, just trying to inhabit her, to see what
    she was seeing. And so I wrote a really kind of little piece about
    what I saw gazing out of Emily Dickinson’s window. It’s never left
    the pages of my journal, and probably never will, but it was a
    moving experience. It reminded me of how much we owe the people who
    came before us and did things that are still inspiring us today, and
    that we’re part of that story, too. Part of impermanence isn’t
    looking at other people and saying, well, they lived and they died
    and life goes on, it’s also seeing that we, too, are going to live
    and die and life goes on.

  - pico iyer  
    I am envious. If you can believe it, just this morning, before our
    conversation began, I was writing about her letters. I’ve always
    loved her poems, but as you know, I think when you read her letters,
    which are the most passionate love letters to her sister-in-law. And
    she would stand at the window you were describing and watch her
    sister-in-law walk to her brother’s house and also get betrayed by
    the brother, and that — just the image of the woman in her room with
    this huge passion that came out in words rather than touch. What
    haunting thing. I should tell you, I’ve been a couple of times to
    Thomas Merton’s monastery, Gethsemane, in Kentucky. And the last
    time I was there, I met the one remaining monk there who studied
    under Thomas Merton and kind of carries the torch for him. And he
    walked me across the fields to Thomas Merton’s hermitage, which is
    about 10 minutes away from the monastery. And as he did, he said,
    I’ve got to tell you, for the last three years, I’ve been having a
    passionate love affair, and I’ve just completely lost my heart to
    this person. So of course, my ears pricked up, who would a monk be
    in love with? And you won’t be surprised to hear that he said Emily
    Dickinson. She’s the one I live for. I read her every day. And when
    we got to Thomas Merton’s hermitage, this monk, who was in about
    late 70s, I would say, sat down and he started reciting Emily
    Dickinson poems, knowing that that was the truest way of keeping the
    legacy of literature. The legacy of solitude, the legacy of
    introspection. Everything that Thomas Merton represented, Emily
    Dickinson represents, too. And when we talk of impermanence, I
    earlier in this conversation said Leonard Cohen died, but everyone
    is listening to his songs and reading his poems still. And so what a
    beautiful permanence is all around us in art and music and poetry
    and nature. The blue skies.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. That is the permanence, art and beauty, and loss and sorrow.
    Those are the permanent universal things.

  - pico iyer  
    Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So one thing I want to ask you, Pico, I want to know if I have this
    right. You were born in England to parents who were born in India,
    and then you all moved to California when you were a kid. Is that
    correct?

  - pico iyer  
    You have it absolutely right, Cheryl. Yes, I moved to California
    when I was about seven. But because of the exchange rates then, and
    also the Californian educational system was very different from the
    English one, I worked out it was cheaper to continue going to school
    in England and flying back three times a year to see my parents than
    to go to the local private school in California. So that’s one of
    the reasons why I got into this traveling madness. I was commuting
    to school by plane alone over the North Pole from the age of nine,
    so I had to define home inwardly. And so I just have to sit here in
    my apartment in Japan talking to you in Portland, and I have in my
    mind’s eye the view through the monastery window in Big Sur. And
    that’s my home that’s inside me and that grounds me, and that
    actually really consoles and inspires me at this moment of
    uncertainty.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And your mother is in California, is that right?

  - pico iyer  
    She is in California. She’s been in hospital for a couple of weeks.
    I was all packed, I was set to fly over to see her, and then I found
    that visitors aren’t allowed in hospitals in California right now,
    for very good reasons. And so again, I would be no closer to her if
    I was in her empty house 10 minutes by car from the hospital than I
    am right now, when I can still talk to her by phone and communicate.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And your mom, just to be clear, doesn’t have the coronavirus.
    She’s simply unwell. Is that right?

  - pico iyer  
    That’s right. She’s safe from the virus. She’s really just suffering
    from being 88 years old. And all being well, this time next week, I
    will be with her in her home because she’s getting better, and I am
    planning to fly over to offer her moral support and company. So I’m
    hoping the end of that story is in sight and it’s a happy ending.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s nice. I know so many people are really, really afraid for
    their elderly parents right now because we keep hearing over and
    over, right, that this virus is especially dangerous for people the
    older they are. Have you been particularly afraid for your mom
    during this time?

  - pico iyer  
    Because her health is always uncertain and I know how frail she is,
    I was worried when she went to the hospital. And before the
    ambulance took her to the hospital, the paramedic very kindly called
    me in Japan and said, do you allow us to take your mother to the
    hospital, even though we’re taking her into a place of maximal risk?
    And I thought I had to take that risk on on her behalf. And yes, she
    suffers from asthma. I suffer from asthma, my wife suffers from
    asthma. My wife and I are both in our 60s. We’re all really in a
    state of risk. But I think the broader thing is, I’m sure you’ve
    found, it’s one of the things that growing older brings us. I
    remember when I was in my 20s, I was really scared of dying. I
    thought, what will happen to my brilliant career, all the books I
    could write, all the places I could see? You know, silly, silly,
    silly, silly stuff. And as I got older, I realized what I’m most
    scared of is seeing my loved ones die or, if I died, what would
    happen to them. They would be, financially and in other ways,
    undefended. I’m much more concerned for my mother, and actually for
    my wife and for my kids, than I am for me, because that would be the
    real heartbreak, if my wife was left alone or if my mother were to
    see her son go before her. That’s always one of the hardest things.
    And I’m grateful for the passing years for teaching me that it’s
    really other people’s deaths that we’re most scared about, not our
    own.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right.

  - pico iyer  
    And the other thing that had come to my mind — again, we spoke about
    the Dalai Lama — and in the last year or two, he’s been talking a
    lot about what he calls emotional disarmament. And I take that to
    mean he thinks, of course, because he embodies it, the most
    important thing is to keep our hearts open, to feel for everything,
    and for one another. But he thinks that anger, panic, and confusion
    keep us away from reality, prevent us from making clear decisions.
    And some people are surprised that I, as a journalist, make sure I
    never take in more than five minutes of the news every day, but
    ideally two minutes of the news every day, or less. And I think
    that’s because I don’t want to be in a state of panic or
    confusion. It’s really important to want to know what’s going on in
    the world, and especially this moment, it’s very important to know
    what we can and cannot do, what precautions we have to take. But I
    think you can do all of that in a couple of minutes in the day. And
    then for the rest of the day, the poems we’ve been discussing, the
    wise people we’ve been thinking about, our family, our friends, I
    think that’s going to make us much better prepared for what’s going
    to happen than keeping up with every last second of speculation and
    opinion and science we don’t know what to do with.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think that that’s such a fine distinction. Absorbing too much news
    can easily make us feel panicked, right? Absorbing enough that you
    have the information you need for clarity is what the goal is, but
    so many of us have a hard time shutting it off. And I know that, in
    my own life, that there is that tendency to think that, if I pay
    attention to everything that’s being said about this virus or about
    these times or the economic fallout, that in some way I can maybe
    stop it from happening, or stop it from happening as bad for me. And
    yet, there is panic at the center of that, and a kind of lie at the
    center of that because, of course, we can’t control it. When you
    were talking, and we’ve been talking so much about mortality, I was
    remembering this time, it was actually the last day of the year. It
    was December 31, 1991, so I was I was 23. And I was driving with the
    man who was then my husband. We were driving from Minneapolis up to
    this place called Madeline Island in Lake Superior, off the sort of
    shoreline of Wisconsin. And it was a snowy, icy day, as it often is.
    My ex-husband was driving, and I was in the passenger seat, and we
    lost control of the car. It just started to skid on the ice. We were
    going 55 miles an hour, and suddenly we were just sailing all over
    the highway. And it was terrifying. It was the only time in my life
    that I honestly thought I was going to die. And I was saying to my
    ex-husband, get control of the car, get control of the car, get
    control of the car over and over again, as we were just spinning out
    all over. And then there was this moment where the car just left the
    highway, like we just went airborne off the side of the road. And
    the ditch was far below, so we were flying. And we were going to
    crash. And I stopped saying get control of the car, and both my
    ex-husband and I at the same moment, at the very same moment when we
    hit the air, looked at each other and grabbed each other. And we
    said I love you at the same time. And then the car crashed. And we
    survived, but what shook me most deeply is that moment that we went,
    both of us, simultaneously, from panic to clarity. And inside that
    clarity was the only thing that matters: We just wanted to say I
    love you one more time to each other. And it wasn’t scary. It wasn’t
    panic. It was just the truth. And I’ve always thought that there’s
    something about that those two things can sit so closely beside each
    other, can exist even within the same second, that there was
    something revealing about that. And maybe there’s something in that
    that’s relevant for now, too.

  - pico iyer  
    I’m silenced by that. That is such a haunting, beautiful story. All
    of life is right in that moment. How many miracles in every day
    actually keep us going? We often notice only the terrible things
    that happen, and don’t realize how many wonderful things are taken
    for granted. At the time of our forest fire, I thought, “Oh, if only
    I’d had five more minutes, I’d have been able to save everything
    that’s important to me.” And then I thought, “Well, if only I’d had
    five less minutes, I’d have been dead.” I’m so glad you survived
    that accident, and even more, that you can share that story, because
    I think just having that story in our heads can turn our life in a
    better direction.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. I got to see that. I got to live that. And I hope it’s what I
    do the next time around, too. I hope so.

  - pico iyer  
    Yeah, I mean it’s kind of like a dress rehearsal. I often think it’s
    one of the graces that we have as a writer, that we can use our, so
    to speak, job to help prepare us for these things, and to think
    through the inevitable stuff of life, which otherwise I find I’m
    much too ready to ignore.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Indeed. Pico, it has been an absolute pleasure to talk to you.
    You’ve made me feel comforted and inspired and enlightened. So
    thank you. Thank you for speaking to me from all the way across
    these miles.

  - pico iyer  
    Thank you for inviting me to be a part of this.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye, Pico.

  - pico iyer  
    Bye bye.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Pico Iyer. I first met him on the page when
    I was 20 and I read his book “Video Night in Kathmandu.” And right
    then and there, I knew, this is a writer I’ll follow anywhere. He’s
    published more than a dozen books, many of them about his travels
    around the world, but more importantly, about the journey inward. He
    very beautifully captures the miraculous ordinary moments and
    exchanges that we have on our travels and in life. And he’s always
    looking for the deeper meaning in that. His most recent book is
    called “Autumn Light.” It’s about his life in Japan. He’s there
    right now. And I’m going to give him a call.

  - \[music\]

  - \[line ringing\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hello?

  - pico iyer  
    Hello. Is that Cheryl?

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s Cheryl. Is that Pico?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. I’m so happy to hear your voice. We get to talk at last.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m so excited. At last we get to speak, Pico.

  - pico iyer  
    The feeling’s mutual.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I mean, we’ve corresponded over email, we’ve had a couple of almost
    meetings, but it’s just never happened. So here we are.

  - pico iyer  
    One of the beautiful things this curious moment has brought us, that
    you and I can speak more easily across 6,000 miles than perhaps if
    we were on the same west coast.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Exactly. So tell me, where are you right now?

  - pico iyer  
    I’m in a tiny apartment in a boring suburb in Japan. And there are
    cherry blossoms flowering over every last stream and path, bright
    blue spring morning. The nightingales have been teaching their young
    how to sing. Old folk are taking themselves and their dogs for a
    walk around the neighborhood. And as you probably know, things have
    tightened up quite a bit in Japan, so everybody is braced for maybe
    a spike in coronavirus cases. But for now, things really look very
    much as they always do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And what city are you a suburb of?

  - pico iyer  
    We’re a suburb of the great ancient capital of Nara. So it was the
    capital of Japan in the 8th century, but where we live is this
    little town that looks like it was modeled on the San Fernando
    Valley. It’s a suburb younger than my kids are. We’ve been here 27
    years now, kind of living almost as if we were students. We don’t
    have a car, we don’t have a bicycle. I’ve actually never used a cell
    phone until this conversation, when I’m borrowing my wife’s. So we
    live in quite an isolated place. So I really feel blessed here. And
    of course, everyone here is really, really worried about the sick
    around the world and the people who don’t have a home and the people
    who don’t have resources. But Japan is relatively cushioned from
    that. And so I think people here are very good at remaining calm and
    remaining cheerful, and stoical, too, and realizing that things are
    a little hard right now, but they’re much harder everywhere else.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. So there hasn’t yet been that sense of emergency in Japan.
    How long have you all been socially isolating?

  - pico iyer  
    Well, that really only came in this week. And nobody is blase, but
    for the moment, we feel very lucky, and especially this springtime
    sense, because again, you know this, I’m sure, that everyone loves
    the cherry blossoms in Japan precisely because they don’t last. And
    I think this is a culture that’s always known how to live with
    impermanence because they’ve been living for 1,400 years very close
    to earthquake and tsunami and fire and warfare. And so they know a
    little bit about how to live with the fact that everything is
    constantly uncertain, changing, fragile and mortal. And the cherry
    blossoms are such a good example of that because it’s the fact they
    only last for 10 days that makes them so beautiful. And if they
    lasted forever, we would take them for granted. When I came here, I
    heard this wonderful phrase about how life is about a joyful
    participation in a world of sorrows. In other words, every life ends
    in death, every meeting ends in a separation, but that’s not a
    reason to grieve. It’s actually a reason to find our beauty and joy
    right now.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s beautiful. I love those cherry blossoms. It is so clearly a
    metaphor for what I think the world is experiencing right now, being
    reminded of the fleeting beauty that also ends in a kind of demise
    or a loss. And I’m wondering if you can tell me more about what you
    know about impermanence.

  - pico iyer  
    Well, that’s a beautiful question, and I think I don’t know any more
    than anybody else, except over my 63 years now, I’ve suffered my
    share of losses. And I actually remember very vividly as I’m talking
    to you, there was this one day when I was in my family home in the
    hills of California, and I saw this distant line of orange cutting
    through a hillside. So I went downstairs to call the fire
    department. And when I came upstairs again, I saw that our house was
    encircled by 70-foot flames, a forest fire that was being whipped
    along by 70-mile-per-hour winds. And by the end of that evening,
    three hours later, I had lost my house, every last thing I owned in
    the world, pretty much even my dreams of being a writer because all
    my next three books and all my notes were handwritten, and they were
    gone forever.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And when was this, Pico?

  - pico iyer  
    This was actually in 1990. I remember now, it was a shock to
    everybody, our whole town, but after about a year, I would say that
    there were some people who were shocked and scarred, but thought,
    well, maybe this is a chance to live a little differently and more
    closely to what really calls to me and my deeper self. When it came
    to replacing my things, for example, I realized I didn’t need 90
    percent of my books, my clothes, my furniture. The insurance company
    was ready to replace them, but I could live more lightly. Then I
    thought, well, actually since I don’t have a family home in the
    U.S., maybe I can spend more time in Japan, a country that I really
    feel at home at. And then, since I’d lost all my notes, but I still
    was possessed by the wish to write and haunted by certain subjects,
    I thought, well, now’s the time to try fiction, which I think I
    would have been too scared or shy to try otherwise. So at this great
    remove, 30 years on, I don’t see that fire as entirely a bad thing
    in my life. And I see it as, in many ways, liberating me from the
    habits that I was kind of sleepwalking with through my life. I still
    get scared every time I see walls of flame rise up above the
    mountains above our rebuilt house, which has happened maybe 11 times
    since. But, I feel that that fire reduced me to nothing and forced
    me to think about what I care about, and actually sharpened my sense
    of priorities and made possible my life now.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, right. I think that’s one of the most fascinating things about
    human existence to me. You and I both teach writing. We almost
    taught together at our beloved Esalen Institute in Big Sur- -

  - pico iyer  
    Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — a couple years ago. But one of the things that I’m always struck
    by in my own life, and also in the lives of others — and because I
    teach writing, I get to read so many other people’s stories when we
    ask them to write — so often, those stories are about the hardest
    thing. About the deepest, most painful wound and the time where they
    lost everything. And what’s always true about that is we wouldn’t
    have wished it upon ourselves, we wouldn’t have wished it often upon
    our worst enemy, if we have enemies — I don’t, I hope you don’t,
    either — but they are always the things that teach us the most. I
    always say this to my students. If we went around the circle and I
    said you have to tell everyone how you learned the most important
    lessons of your life, they would almost always be painful
    experiences or big losses. And yet, so we know this to be true,
    right? You know this to be true, I know this to be true. Why do we
    resist it, then? I mean, we still say, but please, universe, don’t
    let the bad thing happen to me.

  - pico iyer  
    I think we resist it the way we resist going to the dentist. We all
    know we’ll be better if that dentist fills our cavity and cleanses
    our infection and straightens our teeth, but nonetheless, we know
    it’s going to be painful to get to that end result. I mean, it’s
    funny what you were just saying, it’s so true. And I think one of
    the things that the fire taught me, I feel, is that it was a
    reminder, as you said, of what we always know, which is that we have
    much less power over the world than we imagine, but I feel we have
    much more power over how we respond to the world than we suspect.
    And really, it’s our responses to circumstances that define us much
    more than the circumstances themselves. And every writer knows —
    well, actually that night of the fire, as soon as I was able to
    escape and drive downtown after three hours, the first thing I did
    was go to a friend’s computer and write a piece about having an
    eyewitness view on this moment of history. And I suppose it was my
    small way of saying — every writer knows this, but I think every
    person can be reminded of it — the fire hasn’t stripped me of
    everything. I still have my feelings, my thoughts, my words. I’m not
    powerless. It’s a wonderful sharing that, when people go into those
    dark places, they’re coming back with gifts to present to their
    readers or their friends that they never would if they were just
    saying it’s a bright day and I’m having a wonderful time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I think maybe that’s those extremes that in both of your
    examples, really, that are given to us by the natural world. There’s
    the outrageous beauty of those cherry blossoms, and then when they
    fade, there’s still beauty. We still have beauty here every day. We
    might have to look a little harder for it, but it’s there. And that
    fire scorches — takes everything from you, and the first thing you
    think after reckoning with that loss is I still have the most
    important things.

  - pico iyer  
    Exactly.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right? I still have everything I need.

  - pico iyer  
    Exactly. That’s right. You know, my parents come from India, and the
    great Shiva, the god of India, is the god of creation and
    destruction. And as you say, fire, water, they’re all about those
    same things. And I think all of us, our first concern is with the
    people who are undefended and on the streets and really sick or in
    bad shape right now. But I think many of us who might have a job to
    return to and a roof over our heads and remain healthy through this
    virus, I think it’s giving us really a chance to remember what
    sustains us and what we care about, which has much more to do with
    what you were just describing — the cherry blossoms, as they flower,
    as they die, the fire — than with what we were probably talking
    about two months ago, which is Meghan and Harry or what’s the latest
    tweet. It’s suddenly cut through all that. And for the fortunate, at
    least, this is a chance suddenly to cut that vicious cycle. Because
    I think for many years, I and many people I know, have felt we’re in
    such a hurry we can’t see what a hurry we’re in. And more and more
    stuff is coming in on us, and we don’t have time to process it. And
    suddenly, nature has intervened and said, OK, come to a halt. Your
    life is out of control. Stop. Now, where do you want your priorities
    to be? What do you want to spend the rest of your life doing? You
    don’t know how long that rest of the life is, but this is your
    chance to get your life in balance a little bit. And I certainly
    felt that in this moment.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It sounds like to me, though, and what I know of you, you already
    are a deeply reflective person. You don’t really do social media or
    really absorb much news. And so how has this experience shifted your
    consciousness? Has it?

  - pico iyer  
    So it’s interesting because I’m not a religious person, but, for
    example, I love tennis, so I spend a lot of time watching Roger
    Federer. And I love — I wish I were exaggerating, I’m not — I love
    writing, so I spend a lot of time reading Alice Munro. And I love
    life, and —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Just so you know, Alice Munro is my favorite writer.

  - pico iyer  
    Actually, I was driving along Highway 1 near Esalen when the news of
    her Nobel came on the radio. And I was so excited, I literally drove
    to the side of the road and jumped up and shouted, “There’s justice
    in the world.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s so beautiful. I love her.

  - pico iyer  
    So I feel I learned so much from reading Alice Munro, so much from
    watching Roger Federer, and so I wanted to spend time trying to turn
    to those people who I think are professionals of life. And in this
    instance, professionals of solitude and what to do with it. So I
    spend a lot of my life, I suppose, hanging out with monks, and, when
    I’m here in our apartment, reading Thomas Merton and Thoreau and
    listening to Leonard Cohen, because I think they’re essentially
    professionals at the art of living. And I want to learn from them. I
    want to find out from them what matters.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. So do I. So you mentioned Leonard Cohen, who I also love. You
    knew him, and you wrote the liner notes for four of his albums,
    correct?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. Yes.
    
    I actually, I first met him when he was living as an ordained Zen
    monk. And of course, it was eye-opening and humbling. And I drove up
    to these high, cold, dark mountains behind Los Angeles. There was a
    man in a tattered black robe who I didn’t even recognize as my
    lifelong \[INAUDIBLE\]. And so Leonard Cohen, at the age of 61,
    spent five years — he could have been doing anything in the world —
    he spent five years just scrubbing floors and shoveling snow,
    cooking for his fellow monks, driving his aged abbot to the doctor.
    And he, more than anyone I’ve met, would tell me this was the great,
    as he would put it, voluptuous and delicious adventure he had found
    in his life. And I thought, when someone in his 60s who really has
    tasted everything — sex, drugs, rock and roll, you name it — says
    that, I should think about it. Because there was a man who’d been
    famous for 40 years, he’s a globally adored heartthrob, but I would
    say he was the wisest, kindest, and least impressed by himself
    person I’ve ever met, other than perhaps the Dalai Lama. And I
    thought, my heavens, this is really an instruction about what
    matters in life. Probably when I was a kid, I dreamed of being
    Leonard Cohen, the wandering minstrel and the cool poet with the
    beautiful girlfriend and the Armani suit. But meeting him in that
    monastery, I thought, no, actually what he’s telling me is about
    selflessness and modesty and becoming an anonymous grunt, which I
    think is how he would refer to himself in that period.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. And you look to him, is he one of your sources of wisdom when
    you — you were talking about the writers who are amongst you, who
    offer those words of consolation and recognition or insight when
    you’re looking for it —

  - pico iyer  
    Absol —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Where do you look?

  - pico iyer  
    You know, I woke up and was listening to him over breakfast this
    morning, some of his earliest songs, and I was noticing something
    interesting, which is, when he was a young man, he was always
    writing about spiritual life. Jesus in his lonely wooden tower and
    Joseph in a manger, Sisters of Mercy. Once he became a monk, he
    didn’t write about the spiritual life, he wrote, just as you were
    saying earlier, about pain and panic and confusion and loss, and the
    fact that mortality, death was coming closer and closer to him. And
    it struck me that, as a young man, he was all about yearning, as so
    many of us are, but once he really gave himself to this unflinching
    discipline, he was just going deep, deep, deep, deep into those dark
    places that you were talking about that you share with fellow
    writers in Esalen and elsewhere. And I think his two great gifts
    were intimacy and honesty. And that’s why, even though he’s left the
    world now, so many people I think feel him to be a very close friend
    and a real guide in difficult times.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. And so Pico, I want to ask you, I know you’ve spent time with
    the Dalai Lama. And you traveled around Japan with him, is that
    correct?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. I mean, I’ve been lucky, I’ve known him since I was a teenager,
    and I wrote a book on him. And so since my book, I travel every year
    across Japan with him. And we traveled up to the tsunami area in
    Japan just a few months after 18,500 people had been killed in the
    tsunami. And we went to this little fishing village called
    Ishinomaki. And when we got there, it was a wasteland. It looked
    like pictures of Hiroshima after the war. And the only thing that
    survived, miraculously, was this little temple in the shelter of a
    mountain. And there were a few little schoolboys in school uniform,
    maybe five years old, who were waiting at the front and shaking his
    hand. And my wife told me that they were chosen because they were
    orphans. They’d just lost their parents. Now the whole community was
    looking after them. But they’d been given the honor of saying hello
    to the Dalai Lama. And then as he was sitting in the temple, he
    said, of course there’s nothing I can give you except my heart and
    my presence. But he suddenly remembered a moment in March 1959 when
    he was in his hometown of Lhasa, Tibet, when he was told he had to
    leave his hometown that night. So no time to say goodbye to his
    friends, he had to leave then and there, and walk for two weeks
    across the highest mountains on the planet to get to safety in
    exile. And of course, as he said that, everyone there knew that, for
    52 years at that point, he’d never been back to his homeland. It’s
    now 60 years he’s never been back to Tibet. And I think it was his
    way of saying, I can’t imagine what you’ve been through, but loss is
    an equal opportunity employer. All of us have lost something, and
    we’re all in this together. And that suffering is a fact of life,
    and actually the grace of it is that it helps us reach towards
    others. I have a great friend who’s a Benedictine monk, and he sent
    this line to his friends last week, which is the best cure for
    anxiety is thinking of others. And I thought, thank heavens for
    monks. Doesn’t matter if you’re a Benedictine or not, that’s really
    good advice. And maybe that’s another of the possibilities that this
    moment holds for us, that we’re not caught up in our own agendas,
    racing off to write this article, give this speech, do that meeting.
    We’re suddenly alone with our thoughts, and our thoughts can turn to
    other people better.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You said in one of your Ted Talks — and I’m not remembering the
    story, so I want you to tell it to me again — it was when you were
    traveling with the Dalai Lama, and you said to him each morning,
    what are we going to do, or what are we going to find, and he said,
    “I don’t know.” Am I getting that right?

  - pico iyer  
    Yes. And I think even more impressively, when he’s in an auditorium
    with 30,000 people and, for example, somebody will put up a hand and
    ask a very serious question about either a marriage or children and
    child rearing, and he’ll fool around laughing and say, “You’ve asked
    the worst person in the world. I’m a celibate monk. I don’t know a
    thing about marriage and relationships with a wife and kids. You
    know much more about that.” And I think the first thing I’d say is,
    he has the courage to say that there’s so many areas in the world he
    doesn’t know about, and the humility to point out that we know many
    things about the world that the Dalai Lama doesn’t. Well, you
    mentioned a Ted Talk. And one of the most moving I’ve ever seen was
    given by Pope Francis, who said — the gist of it that I took away
    was, the more powerful you are, the more you have to be humble, and
    the more you have to essentially be kneeling before reality, before
    the future, before all the things that we know that we can’t
    control. And so I love the fact that the Dalai Lama, who so many
    people seek out for wisdom, of which he has a huge amount, still
    will often say I don’t know. Because he doesn’t know what’s
    happening tomorrow. He doesn’t know what’s happening tonight. He’s a
    human being, as he would always stress. And so whenever people talk
    to him about his magical powers, he says, oh, I wish I had magical
    powers. If I did, I’d bring peace to Tibet and peace to the Middle
    East, and I wouldn’t have a sore throat right now. And so don’t look
    to me, the Dalai Lama, as somebody who’s above it all. I, too, am
    surrendering. And he probably surrenders more than most. I think
    that’s what distinguishes people like, probably, Pope Francis and
    Dalai Lama and the ones that we look to for wisdom — Emily
    Dickinson, one of my great heroines — because they’re living even
    more than most of us in that state of surrender. And we think of
    them as all-knowing people, but the beauty of what they’re carrying
    back to us is, I don’t know. None of us knows.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So listen, I love — you and I have a lot of the same taste — I love
    Emily Dickinson, too. But guess what I got to do last year? I got to
    go and write for an hour in her room where she wrote, where she
    lived and where she died. They told me not to touch her bed, but I
    was like a foot away from the bed where she died. And —

  - pico iyer  
    Can I ask what came out of that writing?

  - cheryl strayed  
    You know, it was a radio show in England, I think it was the BBC was
    doing a thing on the life of Emily Dickinson and her legacy. And so
    they invited three writers. It was me, Sharon Olds and Ocean Vuong.
    And we each came at our separately appointed time slots and were
    left alone with the door closed in Emily Dickinson’s bedroom. And I
    sat at her little desk, and I just looked — I spent a lot of the
    time looking out the window, just trying to inhabit her, to see what
    she was seeing. And so I wrote a really kind of little piece about
    what I saw gazing out of Emily Dickinson’s window. It’s never left
    the pages of my journal, and probably never will, but it was a
    moving experience. It reminded me of how much we owe the people who
    came before us and did things that are still inspiring us today, and
    that we’re part of that story, too. Part of impermanence isn’t
    looking at other people and saying, well, they lived and they died
    and life goes on, it’s also seeing that we, too, are going to live
    and die and life goes on.

  - pico iyer  
    I am envious. If you can believe it, just this morning, before our
    conversation began, I was writing about her letters. I’ve always
    loved her poems, but as you know, I think when you read her letters,
    which are the most passionate love letters to her sister-in-law. And
    she would stand at the window you were describing and watch her
    sister-in-law walk to her brother’s house and also get betrayed by
    the brother, and that — just the image of the woman in her room with
    this huge passion that came out in words rather than touch. What
    haunting thing. I should tell you, I’ve been a couple of times to
    Thomas Merton’s monastery, Gethsemane, in Kentucky. And the last
    time I was there, I met the one remaining monk there who studied
    under Thomas Merton and kind of carries the torch for him. And he
    walked me across the fields to Thomas Merton’s hermitage, which is
    about 10 minutes away from the monastery. And as he did, he said,
    I’ve got to tell you, for the last three years, I’ve been having a
    passionate love affair, and I’ve just completely lost my heart to
    this person. So of course, my ears pricked up, who would a monk be
    in love with? And you won’t be surprised to hear that he said Emily
    Dickinson. She’s the one I live for. I read her every day. And when
    we got to Thomas Merton’s hermitage, this monk, who was in about
    late 70s, I would say, sat down and he started reciting Emily
    Dickinson poems, knowing that that was the truest way of keeping the
    legacy of literature. The legacy of solitude, the legacy of
    introspection. Everything that Thomas Merton represented, Emily
    Dickinson represents, too. And when we talk of impermanence, I
    earlier in this conversation said Leonard Cohen died, but everyone
    is listening to his songs and reading his poems still. And so what a
    beautiful permanence is all around us in art and music and poetry
    and nature. The blue skies.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. That is the permanence, art and beauty, and loss and sorrow.
    Those are the permanent universal things.

  - pico iyer  
    Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So one thing I want to ask you, Pico, I want to know if I have this
    right. You were born in England to parents who were born in India,
    and then you all moved to California when you were a kid. Is that
    correct?

  - pico iyer  
    You have it absolutely right, Cheryl. Yes, I moved to California
    when I was about seven. But because of the exchange rates then, and
    also the Californian educational system was very different from the
    English one, I worked out it was cheaper to continue going to school
    in England and flying back three times a year to see my parents than
    to go to the local private school in California. So that’s one of
    the reasons why I got into this traveling madness. I was commuting
    to school by plane alone over the North Pole from the age of nine,
    so I had to define home inwardly. And so I just have to sit here in
    my apartment in Japan talking to you in Portland, and I have in my
    mind’s eye the view through the monastery window in Big Sur. And
    that’s my home that’s inside me and that grounds me, and that
    actually really consoles and inspires me at this moment of
    uncertainty.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And your mother is in California, is that right?

  - pico iyer  
    She is in California. She’s been in hospital for a couple of weeks.
    I was all packed, I was set to fly over to see her, and then I found
    that visitors aren’t allowed in hospitals in California right now,
    for very good reasons. And so again, I would be no closer to her if
    I was in her empty house 10 minutes by car from the hospital than I
    am right now, when I can still talk to her by phone and communicate.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And your mom, just to be clear, doesn’t have the coronavirus.
    She’s simply unwell. Is that right?

  - pico iyer  
    That’s right. She’s safe from the virus. She’s really just suffering
    from being 88 years old. And all being well, this time next week, I
    will be with her in her home because she’s getting better, and I am
    planning to fly over to offer her moral support and company. So I’m
    hoping the end of that story is in sight and it’s a happy ending.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s nice. I know so many people are really, really afraid for
    their elderly parents right now because we keep hearing over and
    over, right, that this virus is especially dangerous for people the
    older they are. Have you been particularly afraid for your mom
    during this time?

  - pico iyer  
    Because her health is always uncertain and I know how frail she is,
    I was worried when she went to the hospital. And before the
    ambulance took her to the hospital, the paramedic very kindly called
    me in Japan and said, do you allow us to take your mother to the
    hospital, even though we’re taking her into a place of maximal risk?
    And I thought I had to take that risk on on her behalf. And yes, she
    suffers from asthma. I suffer from asthma, my wife suffers from
    asthma. My wife and I are both in our 60s. We’re all really in a
    state of risk. But I think the broader thing is, I’m sure you’ve
    found, it’s one of the things that growing older brings us. I
    remember when I was in my 20s, I was really scared of dying. I
    thought, what will happen to my brilliant career, all the books I
    could write, all the places I could see? You know, silly, silly,
    silly, silly stuff. And as I got older, I realized what I’m most
    scared of is seeing my loved ones die or, if I died, what would
    happen to them. They would be, financially and in other ways,
    undefended. I’m much more concerned for my mother, and actually for
    my wife and for my kids, than I am for me, because that would be the
    real heartbreak, if my wife was left alone or if my mother were to
    see her son go before her. That’s always one of the hardest things.
    And I’m grateful for the passing years for teaching me that it’s
    really other people’s deaths that we’re most scared about, not our
    own.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right.

  - pico iyer  
    And the other thing that had come to my mind — again, we spoke about
    the Dalai Lama — and in the last year or two, he’s been talking a
    lot about what he calls emotional disarmament. And I take that to
    mean he thinks, of course, because he embodies it, the most
    important thing is to keep our hearts open, to feel for everything,
    and for one another. But he thinks that anger, panic, and confusion
    keep us away from reality, prevent us from making clear decisions.
    And some people are surprised that I, as a journalist, make sure I
    never take in more than five minutes of the news every day, but
    ideally two minutes of the news every day, or less. And I think
    that’s because I don’t want to be in a state of panic or
    confusion. It’s really important to want to know what’s going on in
    the world, and especially this moment, it’s very important to know
    what we can and cannot do, what precautions we have to take. But I
    think you can do all of that in a couple of minutes in the day. And
    then for the rest of the day, the poems we’ve been discussing, the
    wise people we’ve been thinking about, our family, our friends, I
    think that’s going to make us much better prepared for what’s going
    to happen than keeping up with every last second of speculation and
    opinion and science we don’t know what to do with.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I think that that’s such a fine distinction. Absorbing too much news
    can easily make us feel panicked, right? Absorbing enough that you
    have the information you need for clarity is what the goal is, but
    so many of us have a hard time shutting it off. And I know that, in
    my own life, that there is that tendency to think that, if I pay
    attention to everything that’s being said about this virus or about
    these times or the economic fallout, that in some way I can maybe
    stop it from happening, or stop it from happening as bad for me. And
    yet, there is panic at the center of that, and a kind of lie at the
    center of that because, of course, we can’t control it. When you
    were talking, and we’ve been talking so much about mortality, I was
    remembering this time, it was actually the last day of the year. It
    was December 31, 1991, so I was I was 23. And I was driving with the
    man who was then my husband. We were driving from Minneapolis up to
    this place called Madeline Island in Lake Superior, off the sort of
    shoreline of Wisconsin. And it was a snowy, icy day, as it often is.
    My ex-husband was driving, and I was in the passenger seat, and we
    lost control of the car. It just started to skid on the ice. We were
    going 55 miles an hour, and suddenly we were just sailing all over
    the highway. And it was terrifying. It was the only time in my life
    that I honestly thought I was going to die. And I was saying to my
    ex-husband, get control of the car, get control of the car, get
    control of the car over and over again, as we were just spinning out
    all over. And then there was this moment where the car just left the
    highway, like we just went airborne off the side of the road. And
    the ditch was far below, so we were flying. And we were going to
    crash. And I stopped saying get control of the car, and both my
    ex-husband and I at the same moment, at the very same moment when we
    hit the air, looked at each other and grabbed each other. And we
    said I love you at the same time. And then the car crashed. And we
    survived, but what shook me most deeply is that moment that we went,
    both of us, simultaneously, from panic to clarity. And inside that
    clarity was the only thing that matters: We just wanted to say I
    love you one more time to each other. And it wasn’t scary. It wasn’t
    panic. It was just the truth. And I’ve always thought that there’s
    something about that those two things can sit so closely beside each
    other, can exist even within the same second, that there was
    something revealing about that. And maybe there’s something in that
    that’s relevant for now, too.

  - pico iyer  
    I’m silenced by that. That is such a haunting, beautiful story. All
    of life is right in that moment. How many miracles in every day
    actually keep us going? We often notice only the terrible things
    that happen, and don’t realize how many wonderful things are taken
    for granted. At the time of our forest fire, I thought, “Oh, if only
    I’d had five more minutes, I’d have been able to save everything
    that’s important to me.” And then I thought, “Well, if only I’d had
    five less minutes, I’d have been dead.” I’m so glad you survived
    that accident, and even more, that you can share that story, because
    I think just having that story in our heads can turn our life in a
    better direction.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. I got to see that. I got to live that. And I hope it’s what I
    do the next time around, too. I hope so.

  - pico iyer  
    Yeah, I mean it’s kind of like a dress rehearsal. I often think it’s
    one of the graces that we have as a writer, that we can use our, so
    to speak, job to help prepare us for these things, and to think
    through the inevitable stuff of life, which otherwise I find I’m

## ‘The most important thing is to keep our hearts open, to feel for everything, and for one another.’

*— Pico Iyer, author*

Today, Cheryl calls Pico Iyer, the travel writer and novelist, at his
apartment in Japan. Pico tells the story of losing his home to a forest
fire in the early ’90s, and the unexpected lessons in that loss. “I feel
we have much more power over how we respond to the world than we
suspect,” he tells Cheryl.

Cheryl asks Pico about his travels with the Dalai Lama, and the two
discuss coming to grips with impermanence — via the fleeting beauty of a
cherry blossom.
