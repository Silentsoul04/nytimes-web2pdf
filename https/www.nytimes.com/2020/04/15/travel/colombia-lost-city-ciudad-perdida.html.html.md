# A Visual Trek Through the Sweltering Jungle: In Search of Colombia’s ‘Lost City’

</div>

Ciudad Perdida, an ancient city that predates Machu Picchu by several
hundred years, has become one of South America’s most rewarding
adventure
destinations.

*This week, Stephen Hiltner, an editor on the Travel desk, invites you

Colombia.*

-----

It was the third day of our trek through the Colombian jungle, just
before 5 a.m., when Ailyn Paul, one of our guides, came by to rouse us
from our narrow bunks.

“Sudados\!” she said, calling out our group’s nickname — The Sweaty Ones
— through the scant privacy of our mosquito netting. “Wake up\! It’s
time to visit the Lost City.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

A little over an hour later — after reluctantly pulling on a damp
long-sleeved shirt and gulping down eggs and
[arepas](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015180-colombian-corn-and-cheese-arepas)
at our campsite — I hopped across the Buritaca River and found myself
staring up at the base of some 1,200 stone steps. At the top lay our
destination: Ciudad Perdida, Colombia’s “Lost City,” the home of an
ancient people, the Tairona, who occupied this pocket of South America
for more than a millennium before the first Spanish settlements appeared
here in the early 1500s.

Lost to memory for 400 years before its accidental rediscovery in the
1970s, Ciudad Perdida is stunning in its scale and complexity: an
80-acre site — parts of which date to the seventh century — with
terraces, plazas, canals, storehouses, stone paths and staircases, many
of them remarkably preserved.

At its peak, archaeologists have deduced, about 2,500 people may have
lived here. But exploring Ciudad Perdida is a hard-earned prize: The
only way to reach the site is by completing the nearly 30-mile
round-trip trek through the unbearably hot, mountainous,
mosquito-swirling Colombian rainforest that surrounds
it.

The trail to Ciudad Perdida follows the Buritaca River, whose waters
offer trekkers a chance to cool off during unforgivingly hot days.

Facilities along the route are basic, and ongoing construction at many
of the camps and snack shops hints at increasing numbers of visitors.

Armed Colombian soldiers — stationed at the site for security purposes —
are a fixture in and around the ancient city.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Before the coronavirus pandemic, tourism at Ciudad Perdida had increased
dramatically since 2008, though its popularity as an adventure
destination and archaeological site is still dwarfed by its main South
American rival, Machu Picchu, which in 2019 drew thousands of tourists
per day — most of whom opted not to hike there but to arrive instead by
train and bus.

Ciudad Perdida, by comparison, where hiking remains the only way in and
out, drew about 70 people per day last year. And so far, the various
groups who hold sway over the area — including four Indigenous groups,
the [Colombian Institute of Anthropology and
History](https://www.icanh.gov.co/) and the [Global Heritage
Fund](https://globalheritagefund.org/what-we-do/projects-and-programs/ciudad-perdida/)
— have resisted plans to ease access. (A proposed cable car that would
have facilitated entry, for example, has been rejected on multiple
occasions.) “The trek,” said [Santiago
Giraldo](https://thecitypaperbogota.com/features/giraldo-living-among-ruins/8199),
an anthropologist and archaeologist who has worked in the region for
more than 20 years, “is the first line of conservation defense.”

Even so, ubiquitous construction at snack huts and overnight camps hints
at both increasing numbers of visitors and a greater local dependence on
tourism. These trends are mirrored in Colombia more broadly, where
international tourism nearly tripled between 2010 and 2018, from 1.4
million to about 3.9 million, according to figures from [The World
Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL?locations=CO).

Ciudad Perdida, just one of several hundred ancient Taironan settlements
in the area, extends over the crest and slopes of a hill that rises from
the Buritaca River. It was rediscovered by looters and heavily raided
before one of the looters’ patrons alerted an official at the Gold
Museum in
[Bogotá](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/travel/what-to-do-in-bogota.html),
sparking a visit by archaeologists from the Colombian Institute of
Anthropology in 1976. (The [longer version of its
rediscovery](https://popular-archaeology.com/article/a-tale-of-cities-lost-and-found/)
is worth reading.)

There are several distinct sectors at the site, and the many complex,
multilevel terraces and other stone structures, archaeologists
speculate, served a range of functions: social, commercial, political,
residential, ritualistic. The ascending tiered terraces of the central
axis span a narrow ridgeline; the larger terraces were likely used as
public spaces for civil or political events. Viewed from the top, these
pristine patches appear to have sprouted miraculously from the
encroaching
jungle.

What’s remarkable (and a little disconcerting) about the site, from a
tourist’s perspective, is that visitors are free to roam its mostly
vacant grounds. And that’s partly a consequence of its layout. “It’s an
architecture that’s very alien to us,” Mr. Giraldo explained. “There’s
really no such thing as private or public space, as we understand it.
That can be a bit unsettling for many people — and it makes it difficult
to tease out what belonged to whom.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The city’s past is rich and intriguing. Ongoing archaeological research
has identified structures buried many feet below the visible terraces,
suggesting that the area was initially settled sometime around the
seventh century. (It likely began acquiring its current form sometime
around the 12th century and was abandoned — due to a large number of
epidemic cycles — in the late 16th century.)

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The large terraces on Ciudad
Perdida’s central axis were likely used as public

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rise in tourism at Ciudad Perdida is generally attributed to
demobilization among the rebel groups who long controlled the area. For
years, the threat of violence — much of it tied to the cultivation of
coca plants and the production of cocaine — helped keep people out.

In 2003, for example, members of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a
Marxist guerrilla group, [kidnapped eight visitors to the
site](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/oct/24/colombia-lost-city-kidnapping),
holding some of them for 101 days. (Ironically, as our lead guide,
Iderle Muñoz, explained, international coverage of the kidnapping
eventually led to a surge in visitors — an unlikely marketing campaign.)

Violence in the area is no longer a serious threat to trekkers. The
Colombian army maintains several outposts in and around the site, as
much to aid with accidents along the trail, it seems, as to protect the
place.

The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, which surrounds Ciudad Perdida, is one
of the world’s highest coastal mountain ranges.

In addition to its Indigenous reservations, the mountains are dotted
with non-reservation areas — mostly coffee and livestock farms.

Of the four Indigenous groups who occupy the area, two — the Kogi and
Wiwa — are regularly encountered on the trails.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In many respects, Ciudad Perdida offers a model of sustainable tourism.
Solo, unguided hikes here are forbidden. Instead, would-be visitors must
pay 1,150,000 Colombian pesos (about $300) to join a four- or five-day
guided tour, the fee for which includes meals (carried in on mules) and
basic accommodation at simple camps. (I used
[Expotur](https://expotur-eco.com/en/) and was continually impressed
with the knowledge and expertise of the guides.) All of the guides are
locals, or based in nearby [Santa
Marta](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/travel/19nextstop.html) — as
are the cooks, porters and mule drivers. The campsites, too, are locally
owned. Money from trekkers, in other words, has flowed back to the local
communities.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By some estimates, the mountain range surrounding Ciudad Perdida — the
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta — is home to around 60,000 Indigenous
people, along with 350,000 campesinos, or rural farmers.

Guide companies work to facilitate interactions with the communities,
and meaningful exchanges do occur. Twice en route, for example, local
men displayed and discussed their
[poporos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43M-J5ReoqQ), intensely
personal devices used to store burned and crushed seashells, which, when
mixed in the mouth with chewed coca leaves, help stimulate the coca
plant’s active ingredients. Guides are also eager to stress that tourism
helps provide around 600 local families with a steady
income.

There’s no doubt, though, that the site’s growing popularity has caused
friction with local inhabitants. Exchanges are sometimes fraught. Some
locals actively engage with trekkers by selling supplies at shacks along
the way, and greeting those whom they pass on the trail. But others,
understandably, seem to be exasperated by the steady stream of gawking
tourists, an increasing number of whom are clogging trails, leaving
behind waste, and introducing unsanctioned technologies into largely
off-the-grid Indigenous cultures.

Moreover, many visitors (most of them are international) belong to
socioeconomic classes that are disproportionately contributing to
climate change — an [existential
threat](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2019/11/indigenous-protectors-sacred-peaks-secret-until-now/)
to Indigenous ways of life. The [moral dilemma posed by international
travel](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/travel/traveling-climate-change.html)
has never felt so immediate to me as when, on the final night of our
trek, a Kogi elder implored us to respect Mother Earth.

Cultural, historical and archaeological draws aside, perhaps the most
thrilling aspect of trekking to Ciudad Perdida — a destination which, on
most tours, you’ll have just three hours to explore — is that the site
pulls its visitors through the lush beauty of the Colombian rainforest.

The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is one of the most biologically diverse
mountain ranges on the planet. A staggering array of plants and animals
can be found here, including around [630 species of
birds](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/04/27/475716092/as-colombia-grows-safer-tourists-especially-bird-lovers-flock-back)
— many of which are endemic, or found nowhere else on earth.

All along the edges of the trail, the jungle, folded in its tangles and
thickets, stands like an impenetrable wall. More than once, staring into
its depths and transfixed by a melodic bird call or by an impossibly
vibrant flower, I glanced back toward the hiking path only to realize
that I’d fallen more than an hour behind my group. I’d then skitter
ahead to regain
ground.

Skittering, though, wasn’t always possible. At certain points the trek
was a grueling slog: sweltering heat, steep dirt trails, direct exposure
to the tropical sun, and all of it with a continual swirl of mosquitoes
menacing about my head and neck and arms and legs. I sweated through my
clothes within the first 10 minutes on the very first day. I had a
couple backup shirts tucked away in my pack, but my hiking pants — which
I hung up hopelessly each night in the damp, warm air — never completely
dried. The fact that I hardly minded is a testament to the enchantment
of the
jungle.

The trek also enforced a welcome disconnection from all the screens
whose ubiquitous glow often fills my waking hours — a reality that now,
in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, when almost every one of my
daily routines hinges on digital connectivity, seems difficult to
conjure.

At our final camp, after three days without scrolling, I handed my phone
to a woman working the snack shop; for 5,000 Colombian pesos ($1.25),
she entered the camp’s Wi-Fi password. Mostly I was hoping to back up
some of my images. But suddenly the world came crashing back with a
vengeance: texts from friends and family, an early Covid-19 warning from
the C.D.C., news about a dip in the markets.

The government\! The markets\! How absurdly remote it all seemed\! If
anything makes you realize just how fantastically intangible stocks are,
I thought, it’s the visceral reality of the jungle, where you shake out
your boots in the mornings to be sure they’re free of scorpions.

Of course, the trek, which I made in February, now feels like a lifetime
ago — a different world, a different era. I spoke by phone this week
with Ailyn, one of my guides, who said that tours have been suspended
indefinitely. Her most immediate concern was for the well-being of the
Indigenous groups; they could be especially vulnerable if exposed to the
virus, she said. But as with [many on the front lines of the travel
industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/travel/coronavirus-travel-hospitality-workers.html),
she was also concerned about the welfare of her fellow guides, cooks and
porters, all of whom have come to depend on the trekkers for their
livelihoods.

As for the site itself, there’s little cause for concern: Ciudad Perdida
has a long history of surviving dormancy. And so the great Taironan city
is once again hidden away in the jungle — lost for now to adventurous
discovery, if not to memory.
