# Students Might Have to Take College Admissions Tests at Home This Fall

The coronavirus is forcing the SAT and ACT to develop digital versions
of the standardized tests in case schools remain closed. Critics fear
that could deepen inequities.

Pencils down.

The
[SAT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/at-home-sat-coronavirus.html)
and the ACT, standardized tests that serve as a gateway to college for
millions of applicants each year, announced on Wednesday that they would
develop digital versions for students to take at home in the fall if the
coronavirus pandemic continues to require social distancing.

The switch would mark one of the most significant changes in the history
of the admissions tests, which are normally taken with a sharpened No. 2
pencil and paper in a highly secure setting, under the watchful eye of
proctors.

David Coleman, the chief executive of the College Board, a nonprofit
organization that oversees the SAT and brings in more than $1 billion a
year in revenue, described the possibility of at-home testing as
“unlikely” in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. He also
announced that the June testing date for the SAT, like others this
spring, would be canceled.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokesman for the ACT, the rival test, said it too was prepared to
move to at-home digital testing in the fall, if necessary.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even the possibility brought stark warnings from critics and testing
experts, who said at-home tests could exacerbate inequality, raise
privacy issues and make it easier to cheat. Test security is a
significant concern in the wake of [last year’s college admissions
scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/admissions-scandal.html),
in which prosecutors accused some wealthy parents of helping their
children cheat on the tests to get into exclusive universities.

Low-income students already face disadvantages when it comes to testing,
including a lack of access to private tutors, study guides and other
means available to wealthy students trying to boost their scores. Making
them take a high-stakes test at home could put them at a further
disadvantage, experts
said.

“You’re going to have an upper-middle-class kid with his own bedroom and
his own computer system with a big monitor in a comfortable environment
taking his SATs,” said Mark Sklarow, chief executive of the Independent
Educational Consultants Association, which represents private college
admissions coaches. “And you’re going to have a kid who lives in a home
maybe with spotty broadband, one family computer in the dining room.”

He added, “I don’t know how that can be equitable.”

The College Board’s president, Jeremy Singer, described plans for a
remote proctoring system that “locks down everything else in the
computer. The camera and microphone are on, you can detect any movement
in the room. If the parents are in there, next to them, that would be
detected.”

Experts said many families might be reluctant to give the organization
such extensive access to their private devices.

“That’s a big privacy issue, both to lock down your computer and to put
some kind of client on your computer to be able to do that,” said
Jonathan Supovitz, a professor of leadership and policy at the Graduate
School of Education for the University of Pennsylvania.

The development of an online option is an indication that the testing
companies are fighting for their lives. The fairness of standardized
testing was already under increasing attack before the virus, with some
colleges and universities moving away from the tests as an application
requirement.

In the wake of the pandemic, more colleges have at least temporarily
[made ACT and SAT results
optional](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/sat-act-test-optional-colleges-coronavirus.html)
for 2021 applicants, including the vast University of California system,
Tulane, Case Western Reserve and Williams College.

Mr. Coleman said the College Board was planning to make up for the loss

end of the year, beginning in August, if restrictions on in-person
gatherings have been lifted.

The organization has already announced that it will give Advanced
Placement tests at home in May because of the virus. Those
subject-matter tests for high school students, most of whom have taken
A.P. courses, will become a kind of dress rehearsal for a digital
SAT.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

All of this has heightened the anxiety level for those applying to
college. Jessica Cohen, 17, a junior at South High Community School in
Worcester, Mass., had been studying for the SAT and hoping to take it
multiple times to get the highest possible score, she said. But now she
may forgo the test entirely.

“I just don’t know how many colleges will require SATs,” she said. Among
her top choices are Smith College, College of the Holy Cross and Mount
Holyoke College, which are already test-optional institutions.

Ms. Cohen also noted that many of her public school classmates did not
have reliable internet access, making it unfair to expect them to take
the SAT at home. “That would be impossible for them,” she said.

Angela Nguyen, 17, a junior at the School for the Talented and Gifted in
Dallas, took the SAT in November but was not happy with her score. She
has been preparing to retake the test, she said, and is concerned that
waiting until August could affect her performance. She does not expect
to be at her peak academically over the summer, after a long break from
school.

With at-home testing, the College Board said it would build on its
previous experience giving the SAT digitally to tens of thousands of
students in several states. But the scale of a nationwide effort would
be much larger, involving more than a million high school juniors.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Coleman said the College Board had been calling low-income families
in an effort to understand the conditions in their homes, like the
amount of internet bandwidth. The testing software would be available in
advance, he said, so students would not be logging in for the first time
on testing day.

And the College Board would provide a makeup day for students who had
technological failures, he said. “Some percentage of students will have
errors that cannot be predicted, and we are preparing for that.”
