\section{Students Might Have to Take College Admissions Tests at Home
This
Fall}\label{students-might-have-to-take-college-admissions-tests-at-home-this-fall}}

The coronavirus is forcing the SAT and ACT to develop digital versions
of the standardized tests in case schools remain closed. Critics fear
that could deepen inequities.

Pencils down.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/at-home-sat-coronavirus.html}{SAT}
and the ACT, standardized tests that serve as a gateway to college for
millions of applicants each year, announced on Wednesday that they would
develop digital versions for students to take at home in the fall if the
coronavirus pandemic continues to require social distancing.

The switch would mark one of the most significant changes in the history
of the admissions tests, which are normally taken with a sharpened No. 2
pencil and paper in a highly secure setting, under the watchful eye of
proctors.

David Coleman, the chief executive of the College Board, a nonprofit
organization that oversees the SAT and brings in more than \$1 billion a
year in revenue, described the possibility of at-home testing as
``unlikely'' in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. He also
announced that the June testing date for the SAT, like others this
spring, would be canceled.

A spokesman for the ACT, the rival test, said it too was prepared to
move to at-home digital testing in the fall, if necessary.

Even the possibility brought stark warnings from critics and testing
experts, who said at-home tests could exacerbate inequality, raise
privacy issues and make it easier to cheat. Test security is a
significant concern in the wake of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/admissions-scandal.html}{last
year's college admissions scandal}, in which prosecutors accused some
wealthy parents of helping their children cheat on the tests to get into
exclusive universities.

Low-income students already face disadvantages when it comes to testing,
including a lack of access to private tutors, study guides and other
means available to wealthy students trying to boost their scores. Making
them take a high-stakes test at home could put them at a further
disadvantage, experts said.

``You're going to have an upper-middle-class kid with his own bedroom
and his own computer system with a big monitor in a comfortable
environment taking his SATs,'' said Mark Sklarow, chief executive of the
Independent Educational Consultants Association, which represents
private college admissions coaches. ``And you're going to have a kid who
lives in a home maybe with spotty broadband, one family computer in the
dining room.''

He added, ``I don't know how that can be equitable.''

The College Board's president, Jeremy Singer, described plans for a
remote proctoring system that ``locks down everything else in the
computer. The camera and microphone are on, you can detect any movement
in the room. If the parents are in there, next to them, that would be
detected.''

Experts said many families might be reluctant to give the organization
such extensive access to their private devices.

``That's a big privacy issue, both to lock down your computer and to put
some kind of client on your computer to be able to do that,'' said
Jonathan Supovitz, a professor of leadership and policy at the Graduate
School of Education for the University of Pennsylvania.

The development of an online option is an indication that the testing
companies are fighting for their lives. The fairness of standardized
testing was already under increasing attack before the virus, with some
colleges and universities moving away from the tests as an application
requirement.

In the wake of the pandemic, more colleges have at least temporarily
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/sat-act-test-optional-colleges-coronavirus.html}{made
ACT and SAT results optional} for 2021 applicants, including the vast
University of California system, Tulane, Case Western Reserve and
Williams College.

Mr. Coleman said the College Board was planning to make up for the loss
of spring testing dates by offering SAT exams every month through the
end of the year, beginning in August, if restrictions on in-person
gatherings have been lifted.

The organization has already announced that it will give Advanced
Placement tests at home in May because of the virus. Those
subject-matter tests for high school students, most of whom have taken
A.P. courses, will become a kind of dress rehearsal for a digital SAT.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All of this has heightened the anxiety level for those applying to
college. Jessica Cohen, 17, a junior at South High Community School in
Worcester, Mass., had been studying for the SAT and hoping to take it
multiple times to get the highest possible score, she said. But now she
may forgo the test entirely.

``I just don't know how many colleges will require SATs,'' she said.
Among her top choices are Smith College, College of the Holy Cross and
Mount Holyoke College, which are already test-optional institutions.

Ms. Cohen also noted that many of her public school classmates did not
have reliable internet access, making it unfair to expect them to take
the SAT at home. ``That would be impossible for them,'' she said.

Angela Nguyen, 17, a junior at the School for the Talented and Gifted in
Dallas, took the SAT in November but was not happy with her score. She
has been preparing to retake the test, she said, and is concerned that
waiting until August could affect her performance. She does not expect
to be at her peak academically over the summer, after a long break from
school.

With at-home testing, the College Board said it would build on its
previous experience giving the SAT digitally to tens of thousands of
students in several states. But the scale of a nationwide effort would
be much larger, involving more than a million high school juniors.

Mr. Coleman said the College Board had been calling low-income families
in an effort to understand the conditions in their homes, like the
amount of internet bandwidth. The testing software would be available in
advance, he said, so students would not be logging in for the first time
on testing day.

And the College Board would provide a makeup day for students who had
technological failures, he said. ``Some percentage of students will have
errors that cannot be predicted, and we are preparing for that.''
