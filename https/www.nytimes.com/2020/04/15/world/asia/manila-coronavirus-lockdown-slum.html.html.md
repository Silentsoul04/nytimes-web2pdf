MANILA — Even before the coronavirus arrived in Manila, a saying in the
capital’s sprawling San Roque slum — “no one dies from a fever” —
crystallized the many threats that its residents faced in their daily
lives.

Drug-fueled petty crime. Food shortages. Overcrowding and poor
sanitation. Fever, body aches and coughs were commonplace long before
the virus came.

President Rodrigo Duterte’s [lockdown of
Luzon](https://www.rappler.com/nation/256432-duterte-extends-luzon-lockdown-april-30-2020-coronavirus-pandemic),
the Philippines’ largest island and home to Manila, is moving into its
second month, plunging San Roque’s people even deeper into poverty as
the virus continues to rage. Yet the restrictions have not stopped
runny-nosed children from playing tag in the slum’s labyrinth of
alleyways, as parents shout halfhearted admonitions to stay away from
one another.

Home to roughly 6,000 families — conservatively, about 35,000 people —
San Roque, in Manila’s northern suburb of Quezon City, has for years
been home to some of the poorest people on the fringes of Philippine

Many of the men are day laborers who work at construction sites in the

took them to the slum’s squalid shanties, made from dilapidated
cardboard and rusting iron sheet roofing.

“Now it is a nightmare for people like us,” said Susana Baldoza, a
grandmother of four who has lived nearly half of her 59 years in San
Roque, subsisting on odd jobs. “Now that there is a lockdown, we can’t
go outside to look for jobs, to survive.”

aid has been slow to trickle in. Now, neighbors are helping neighbors,

residents.

Frustration over the lockdown recently exploded into violence. An April
1 gathering in San Roque became an impromptu rally, with dozens taking
to the streets demanding answers from the government about when they
would receive promised relief.

Police officers in riot gear and fatigues responded with force,
scuffling with protesters and sending 21 people to jail. Mr. Duterte
accused Kadamay, a group that advocates for the poor, of inciting the
violence, and warned that his government would not be lenient toward
those who challenged
it.

So far, there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in San
Roque, though Ms. Baldoza is almost sure that residents have been
infected. “I pray to God that there won’t be any, but how could there be
none?” she said.

As of Wednesday, 349 people had died in the Philippines from Covid-19,
the disease caused by the virus, and 5,453 infections had been
confirmed. But that figure is likely to rise sharply, with the
Philippine government having [just begun mass testing this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/14/world/asia/14reuters-health-coronavirus-philippines.html?searchResultPosition=21).

Community leaders in San Roque have been tacking up cardboard signs
reminding people not to spit. Some people have started wearing face
masks, but most don’t. Wearing them in the city’s stifling heat can be
suffocating, some said; others said they would rather spend what little
money they had on food.

Yumi Castillo, a volunteer social worker with Kadamay, said it was hard
to explain the concept of social distancing to people who spend their
lives crammed into small, makeshift spaces.

Her group had printed out information about the virus for volunteers to

alleyways and streets, the message didn’t seem to be getting through.

“There are practically no health services here. No one teaches them,”
Ms. Castillo said at a community center where rice, food, drinking water
and rubbing alcohol were sorted and
stored.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Ms. Baldoza, the grandmother of four, was volunteering as a cook for a
community kitchen in San Roque, serving fried herring over rice,
courtesy of the Catholic Church and a civic group that has been helping
residents weather the crisis.

“People here are very poor, as you can see,” said Ms. Baldoza, frying
fish outdoors in a wok. “We don’t have money and the luxury of going to
the supermarkets. We haven’t received help from the government, no help
from the outside except the donations that they give us. And people
can’t
work.”

Her neighbor Analyn Mikunog was waiting for the food to be served. Ms.
Mikunog’s partner has no permanent job, though sometimes he is lucky
enough to find work on construction sites. He had just been hired as a
day laborer when Mr. Duterte imposed the lockdown.

Now, the family’s future is bleak. With four young children to feed, the
gaunt-looking Ms. Mikunog, 28, said she was at her wits’ end trying to
figure out how they would survive.

“Sometimes we talk, and wonder how long this lockdown will last,” she
said. “Will we die hungry?”

Priests in clerical collars and rugged jeans were busily making lunches,
but their camaraderie belied the seriousness of the situation. As the
meals were being prepared, riot police officers moved in to break up the
feeding program. They accused leftist organizations of using it to
recruit people to campaign against the government.

The officers, some in black uniforms and others in combat fatigues,
carried batons and long firearms. They confiscated signs that read,
“Help, Not Jail.” After tense negotiations, a commander, who refused
to identify himself, finally relented. But he warned the group to break
up after the food was distributed, and to practice social distancing.

“We are just serving the people,” said King Garcia, a 39-year-old
priest.

“The government has left them in the fringes at a time when they needed
help the most,” he said. “If the virus does not kill them, hunger
will.”
