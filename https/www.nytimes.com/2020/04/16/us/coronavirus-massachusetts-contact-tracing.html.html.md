# An Army of Virus Tracers Takes Shape in Massachusetts

</div>

Asian countries have invested heavily in digital contact tracing, which
uses technology to warn people when they have been exposed to the
coronavirus. Massachusetts is using an old-fashioned means:
people.

BOSTON — Alexandra Cross, a newly minted state public health worker,
dialed a stranger’s telephone number on Monday, her heart racing.

It was Ms. Cross’s first day as part of Massachusetts’s fleet of
[contact
tracers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps.html),
responsible for tracking down people who have been exposed to the
coronavirus, as soon as possible, and warning them. On her screen was
the name of a woman from Lowell.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“One person who has recently been diagnosed has been in contact with
you,” the script told her to say. “Do you have a few minutes to discuss
what that exposure might mean for you?” Forty-five minutes later, Ms.
Cross hung up the phone. They had giggled and commiserated. Her file was
crammed with information.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She was taking her first steps up a Mount Everest of cases.

Massachusetts is the first state to invest in an ambitious
[contact-tracing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/nyregion/nyc-contact-tracing.html)
program, budgeting $44 million to hire 1,000 people like Ms. Cross. The
program represents a bet on the part of Gov. Charlie Baker that the
state will be able to identify pockets of infection as they emerge, and
prevent infected people from spreading the virus further.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This could help Massachusetts in the coming weeks and months, as it
seeks to relax strict social-distancing measures and reopen its economy.

Contact tracing has helped Asian countries like South Korea and
Singapore contain the spread of the virus, but their systems rely on
[digital
surveillance,](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936)
using patients’ digital footprints to alert potential contacts, an
intrusion that many Americans would not accept.

Massachusetts is building its response around an old-school,
labor-intensive method: people. Lots of them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s not cheap,” Governor Baker, a Republican, said. “But the way I
look at it, the single biggest challenge we’re going to have is giving
people confidence and comfort that we know where the virus is.”

The state is [currently experiencing a surge of
cases](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/mass-gov-baker-to-provide-update-on-coronavirus-response-2/2107985/)
that is expected to last for the next week, after which it may start to
consider easing social-distancing rules. Robust contact tracing,
combined with ramped-up testing, could smooth that process, the governor
said.

“It’s hard to see how we create a sense of safety if we don’t have a
program like this in place,” he said.

The idea of [training a corps of contact

is emerging in many places at the same time, as leaders think ahead to
the point when social-distancing constraints will be
lifted.

President Trump was expected to announce that the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention would hire hundreds of people to perform contact
tracing as part of his push to allow the country to go back to work and
school, a top government official said this week. San Francisco is
[assembling and training 150
volunteers](https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-contact-tracing-coronavirus-tracnig-bay-area-lockdown-shelter-in-place/6090943/)
to augment the contact-tracing efforts of its own public health
department. Ireland is [deploying 1,000 furloughed government
workers](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/large-number-of-public-service-staff-to-be-redeployed-to-contact-tracing-1.4212937)
to do contact tracing.

This means restoring capacity that has been pared away for decades by
cuts to public health budgets, said Allyson Pollock, the director of the
Institute of Health and Society at Newcastle University in the northeast
of England.

The Massachusetts program is staged by the nonprofit [Partners in
Health](https://www.pih.org/), whose doctors have led responses to
infectious disease — Ebola, Zika, drug-resistant tuberculosis, cholera
and typhoid fever, among others — in the world’s poorest countries.

It is built around one-on-one telephone interviews of newly diagnosed
patients and their contacts, so that subjects must answer the phone when
it rings. Paul Farmer, a physician-anthropologist and one of the group’s
founders, said there was no substitute for the bond of trust formed by a
human contact tracer.

“Somebody needs to say to people who are worried and not feeling well,
‘We got you,’” he said. “‘If this is Covid-19, we got you. And we’ll
look out for your contacts, your spouse and your children.’ And I think
that’s another thing you can do remotely or virtually, is reassure
people that there is no reason to believe everything is lost.”

tuberculosis outbreak as a medical student.

His eyeglass frames had broken, something he cheerfully blamed on the
pandemic, and he had to balance them on the bridge of his nose as he
spoke.

“Once you get in someone’s space — this is going to be different, to the
extent that it is virtual — but sitting with folks in their homes, the
subtext of these tracings was, ‘Hey, we want to help you and your
family,’” he said.

The downside of human contact tracing is that it is expensive, can
overlook contacts a subject may not recall, and, some argue, is too slow
for a fast-moving virus.

“Using automation to do it, cellphones and triangulations of data, that
is the easiest and fastest way, and probably the most effective way to
do this,” said Ranu S. Dhillon, a physician at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital in Boston, who advised the government of Guinea on the Ebola
outbreak.

“If you’re taking one or two days to manually figure out where someone
went, you’re adding more time where people can transmit it to others,”
he said.

But human outreach is a standard public health practice, first used in
many countries to [seek out sexual partners of men and
women](https://academic.oup.com/shm/article-abstract/9/2/195/1643760?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
known to be carriers of sexually transmitted diseases.

It was gritty, solitary work. [A contact tracer who worked in New
Zealand in the 1970s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400831)
described spending her evenings in bars and boardinghouses, tracking
down subjects based on sketchy descriptions, like, “she goes to the
hotel at Friday nights and she drinks Southern Comforts,” and “Kathleen
— with a generous superstructure.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The work required such abnormal hours and such secrecy, the contract
tracer told the historian Antje Kampf that it was difficult to have a
social life or marriage. “I sometimes wonder if I was chosen for the job
because I was a loner, or if it was the other way around,” she said.

In recent years, jolted by SARS and then by MERS, Asian countries have
poured resources into contact tracing, combining sophisticated digital
tools with large networks of public health outreach workers.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of

        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“We’re sitting back, hunkering down, waiting to see what the virus is
going to do to us,” he said. The language of South Korean colleagues, he
said, “was completely different from the language I was hearing in the
U.S. They were talking about the virus as if it were a person. Telling
me how tricky it was. It was the experience of chasing it down.”

In a late-night phone call at the end of March, Dr. Kim pitched his idea
to Governor Baker, [pointing to data from Wuhan,
China](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1),
that showed that social distancing alone could not bring the virus’s
spread rate low enough to lift the current restrictions.

“When people say you can’t do that, it’s too labor-intensive, it makes
no sense to me,” he said. “Ask all the people sheltering in place, the
70 percent of people who have lost income — I would ask those people,
how much is it worth to us to really get on top of it? $100 billion?
$500 billion?”

Governor Baker, who listened to the pitch in his car that night, said he
appreciated that Dr. Kim could point to concrete experiences of battling
outbreaks in African countries and in Haiti.

“I have people reaching out to me all day with theoretical things that
we could do, God love ’em,” he said. He said he had also heard from
“everyone who had a phone-pinging program,” and that digital tracing
may be integrated into the state’s program later, but that human
outreach was critical to reaching people without an easy way to isolate
themselves.

“You’ve got to be able to connect to people in some way that’s
meaningful that’s beyond a ping on the phone,” he said.

Already, Massachusetts’ local departments of health had been carrying
out contact tracing, assisted by 1,700 volunteers from the state’s
academic public health community.

The 1,000 new jobs, announced at a news conference on April 3, set off a
deluge of applications, now numbering around 15,000. Ms. Cross, 27, who
is training to be a nutritionist, said she was so emotional about taking
part that she wept during her recorded
interview.

“I feel like I have all this energy that I want to funnel into
prevention,” she said.

Harvey Schwartz, 72, a retired civil rights lawyer from Ipswich, said he
sent in his application within 15 minutes of Governor Baker’s
announcement, offering to work without pay.

“I’ve been spending two and a half hours every morning reading the news,
and getting more and more depressed,” he said. “This is the antidote to
that.”

“Cohort One” of the state’s program — a group of around 80 hires, among
them graduate students, Peace Corps volunteers, medical assistants and
retired nurses — logged on for the first time last Thursday, to learn
the nuts and bolts of the system.

Each time a citizen tests positive, the results will be immediately
shared with a case investigator through a secure database. Within two
hours, the case investigator will aim to reach the patient by phone and
compile a list of every person he or she had been in close contact with
in the 48 hours before the onset of symptoms.

The names of the contacts — the expectation is 10 people per new case —
will then be passed to contact tracers, who will attempt to reach each
one by telephone within 48 hours, calling back three times in succession
to signal the call’s importance. For now, tracers are not leaving
messages or callback numbers.

The contact tracers, speaking from their prepared script, will inform
the contact of approximately when they were exposed, and then take an
inventory of symptoms, talk the contact through quarantine requirements,
and help arrange assistance with food or housing if the contact cannot
easily quarantine.

The new contact tracers began placing their first calls over the
weekend.

“It was a real microscopic look into the lives of people who have this
disease,” said Mr. Schwartz, the former civil rights lawyer, who reached
around 10 people in his first eight-hour shift. To his relief, they all
seemed eager to speak to him.

“Some people were lonely,” he said. “Some people were glad the state was
involved. A few people named the governor by name.”

David Novak, 53, a social worker, found that his conversations were
stretching to 30 or 40 minutes apiece, as the people he contacted told
him about their difficulties maintaining distance from their family
members.

One woman told him how strange it is, after a long marriage, to sleep
away from her husband.

“This is where the human element of public health comes in,” Mr. Novak
said. “You can use technology to make the humans more efficient, but if
you take the humans out of it, how do you ask questions?”

“You’re going to have to talk to them,” he said.
