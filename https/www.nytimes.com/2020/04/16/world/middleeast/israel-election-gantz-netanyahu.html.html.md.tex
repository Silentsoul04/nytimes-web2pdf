Falter}\label{israel-edges-closer-to-4th-election-as-unity-talks-falter}}

After a year of political deadlock, lawmakers have just 21 days to come
up with a formula for a majority government.

JERUSALEM --- The Israeli president on Thursday handed the task of
forming a government to Parliament, starting a 21-day countdown that
could lead to new elections, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
his chief rival, Benny Gantz,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/world/middleeast/israel-coronavirus-netanyahu-gantz.html}{missed
another midnight deadline} to reach a power-sharing agreement.

The step, which was mainly technical, on its own does little to find a
way through
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-election-rivlin-netanyahu-gantz.html}{Israel's
yearlong political impasse}. Neither Mr. Netanyahu nor Mr. Gantz can
currently muster a majority without joining forces, and their parties
issued a joint statement on Thursday saying that negotiations for a
unity government would continue.

But the step taken by the president, Reuven Rivlin, set a timer: By law,
lawmakers have 21 days to come up with a viable government, whether a
unity coalition or some other configuration. Failing that, Parliament
will automatically disperse on May 7 and, for the fourth time in little
over a year, send Israelis back to the ballot box.

The last election, on March 2,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/middleeast/israel-election-takeaways.html}{produced
no clear winner}. Mr. Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister
and leader of the conservative Likud party, has beseeched Mr. Gantz, a
former army chief who is leader of the centrist Blue and White party, to
join him in a national emergency government to contend with the
coronavirus crisis.

Citing the common good, Mr. Gantz entered into talks last month,
upending his repeated election promises not to sit in a government with
a prime minister under indictment. Mr. Netanyahu is facing trial on
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-indicted.html}{charges
of bribery, fraud and breach of trust}. He has denied any wrongdoing.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/world/16israel02/merlin_169495728_eeb5396b-fa85-4cc9-b5d5-c2a64d32be54-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Mr. Netanyahu proposed sharing the job of prime minister, with Mr.
Netanyahu holding it for the first 18 months and Mr. Gantz taking over
for the next 18.

But the unity talks got stuck, according to Blue and White officials,
because Mr. Netanyahu sought guarantees to ensure that he could remain
in office despite his legal troubles. His team's proposals include
circumventing or overriding any future Supreme Court rulings that bar
him from forming a government or, later on, from serving as a deputy to
Mr. Gantz, while under indictment.

Despite saying that he is relatively flexible on other issues, Mr. Gantz
has pledged to uphold Israel's democratic institutions and the rule of
law. Mr. Netanyahu's advisers say that they are trying to find a deal
that will work and don't want to risk being shot down by what they view
as an overly activist court. But critics have questioned Mr. Netanyahu's
intentions all along.

``Now it is going to come down to a matter of trust,'' Ben Caspit, a
political columnist,
\href{https://www.maariv.co.il/journalists/Article-760128}{wrote in the
newspaper Maariv on Thursday}. ``Are the problems that were found by
Netanyahu's consultants real, and is their only goal to save the deal
before it falls apart? Or is this for the umpteenth time yet another
typical Netanyahu gambit that is designed to reshuffle the deck at the
very last moment? There are signs pointing in both directions.''

Mr. Gantz was given first crack at forming a government after he and the
other anti-Netanyahu forces emerged from the March 2 election in a
slightly better position than Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing and religious
alliance.

Now that the mandate has passed to Parliament, Mr. Netanyahu may try to
lure a couple of defectors from across the lines to make up his own
narrow government. Analysts also suggested that a couple of recent
flattering opinion polls may have encouraged him to take his chances in
a fourth election.

Mr. Gantz has fewer options. His decision to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gantz-government.html}{enter
into talks with Mr. Netanyahu} led to a bitter breakup of his party and
dealt a blow to his credibility.

There is still talk among the opposition of advancing legislation
blocking Mr. Netanyahu from serving another term. But time is short, and
as long as unity talks are in play, Mr. Gantz, who is currently the
Parliament speaker, may stall that initiative.

Moshe Yaalon --- who was a Likud defense minister under Mr. Netanyahu,
later joined
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/middleeast/israel-generals-politics-netanyahu.html}{the
Blue and White alliance} and has now also split from that --- exhorted
Mr. Gantz late Wednesday to ``step back from the abyss'' and not give in
to Mr. Netanyahu's demands to bypass the Supreme Court.

On Twitter on Thursday,
\href{https://twitter.com/bogie_yaalon/status/1250639368261447680}{Mr.
Yaalon accused Mr. Netanyahu} of having taken Likud and the country
hostage, ``leading to three elections, and now maybe a fourth.''
