\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Ferdi German, an Army veteran and former college baseball player who
worked as a subway car inspector in New York City, died on Thursday in a
hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was 41.

The cause was the novel coronavirus, his wife, Aitza, said.

Mr. German was one of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-mta-subway.html}{more
than 6,000 workers} for New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority
who have fallen sick or have self-quarantined because of the virus. At
least 59 have died.

Ferdi Amaury German was born on Oct. 4, 1978, in Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic. His father, Ferdinan, was a cabdriver and his
mother, Leonora (Alfaro) German, worked in a cafeteria. Both are
retired.

The family moved to the Bronx in the late 1980s and Mr. German attended
Christopher Columbus High School. He enlisted in the Army in 1997, after
graduating.

He attended the Army Airborne School and served as a specialist. He was
injured after jumping out of a plane, and was honorably discharged in
2000.

Mr. German enrolled in Iona College and, after a semester, transferred
to Lehman College, where he played third base on the baseball team. He
graduated with a bachelor's in psychology and soon began working as a
train mechanic in New Jersey.

Mr. German met Aitza Sosa in 2000, and the couple married five years
later. Their son, Elijah, was born soon after, and the family moved from
the Bronx to Highland, N.Y., in 2009. In addition to his wife, son and
parents, Mr. German is survived by his sister, Margaret, and his
brother, Roni.

Mr. German began working for the M.T.A. in 2007 as a car inspector at
the 207th street overhaul garage in Manhattan and was elected a shop
steward.

The car inspectors at the city's two M.T.A. overhaul shops fix urgent
issues --- like broken doors or air-conditioner systems --- and perform
preventive maintenance on all of the city's subway cars. The other shop
is at Coney Island.

``Every five years, we pretty much replace everything that could be
replaced on a subway car,'' Mr. German's co-worker, Alfredo Polanco Jr.,
said.

Mr. Polanco said that though more than 800 people worked in the 207th
street shop, nearly everyone knew Mr. German.

``It'll be a tremendous loss in the shop,'' Mr. Polanco said. ``This guy
could go anywhere and talk to anybody and he was just loved by
everybody.''
