\section{Raymond Copeland, Sanitation Worker Who Hit His Stride, Dies at
46}\label{raymond-copeland-sanitation-worker-who-hit-his-stride-dies-at-46}}

He raised three girls as a single father. He was engaged and just coming
into his stride in midlife. Then he got the coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Raymond Copeland was so proud of his job with the New York City
Department of Sanitation that he kept a dollar-store trinket in his car
with the word ``strongest,'' a reference to the nickname for his
department that goes along with New York's Finest (police officers) and
New York's Bravest (firefighters).

For Mr. Copeland, who raised three girls as a single father after their
mother died, the job offered economic security. Once his children grew
up, he was able to travel to Caribbean vacation spots, and planned to
buy a house with his fiancée, Tameka Robinson, a fellow sanitation
worker.

``Ray was living his best life the last couple of years,'' said Mike
Arroyo, who knew Mr. Copeland since 1988, when they were teenagers in
the South Bronx who bonded over their mutual love of hip-hop.

Mr. Copeland died on April 5 in Queens, N.Y. He was 46. The cause was
complications of Covid-19, according to the Sanitation Department, which
\href{https://twitter.com/NYCSanitation/status/1247554105096224769}{said
on Twitter} that Mr. Copeland was the department's first employee to die
of the novel virus.

Working out of District 12, which covers a large swath of southeastern
Queens, including Jamaica, Hollis and St. Albans, Mr. Copeland drove a
truck and collected waste in a two-person crew.

``He was like a book with the job,'' said Tyrone Taliaferro, a
co-worker. ``If I had a question about the rules, I could call him and
he could tell me.''

Ms. Robinson, also assigned to District 12, started dating Mr. Copeland
in 2015. The pair were inseparable, together at work and at home in St.
Albans.

Raymond Derrick Copeland was born on Oct. 9, 1973, in the Bronx and
graduated from the borough's William H. Taft High School. Later, he
moved with his daughters to Queens and worked as a school bus driver.

Mr. Copeland joined the Sanitation Department in 2014. The job filled
him with a sense of accomplishment but also, during the coronavirus
pandemic, put him
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/opinion/coronavirus-worker-strike.html}{on
the front lines.} Sanitation workers are considered essential employees.
And they interact with the public and work in close quarters, both in
the field and back at the garage.

According to Belinda Mager, a department spokeswoman, 459 employees have
tested positive for the virus so far. Of those, 87 have resumed work.

Mr. Copeland became sick in mid-March, after returning home from a
vacation to Aruba with Ms. Robinson. He thought he had caught a cold but
soon developed flulike symptoms and had difficulty breathing and was
hospitalized.

In addition to Ms. Robinson, Mr. Copeland is survived by his daughters,
Malika and Jenay; a stepdaughter, Naeemah Seifullah; two grandsons; a
sister, Lynn Derrick; and a brother, Randall Derrick.

Ms. Seifullah said Aruba was Mr. Copeland's favorite place. She and her
sisters have agreed that ``when everything settles, we'll take a trip
and release his ashes.''
