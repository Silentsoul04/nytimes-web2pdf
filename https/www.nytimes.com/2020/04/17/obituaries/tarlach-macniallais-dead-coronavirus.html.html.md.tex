Mr. MacNiallais helped organize the St. Pat's For All Parade in Queens,
a more inclusive version of the annual parade on Fifth Avenue.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

The month of March began with a glorious Sunday morning, perfect for the
St. Pat's For All Parade in Queens that celebrates diversity and
equality as much as Irish heritage and culture. Among the organizers was
the gregarious Tarlach MacNiallais, who had worked long and hard for
inclusion of the long excluded.

He was known for his decades of advocacy for L.G.B.T. and disability
rights. ``A battering ram on issues of importance,'' according to
Harriet Golden, a vice president at A.H.R.C. New York City, an
organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities, where Mr. MacNiallais worked for nearly 35 years.

Mr. MacNiallais died on April 1. He was 57. The cause was complications
of the coronavirus, according to friends and family.

He was born Terence Nellis in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on Oct. 9,
1962, the tenth of 11 children of John James Nellis, a bus conductor,
and Una Nellis, a homemaker. He later adopted the Irish language version
of his name, pronounced TAR-lock MACK-neel-ish.

As a university student, he protested against British imperialism and
emerged as a gay rights advocate. He responded to the ``Save Ulster From
Sodomy'' campaign --- an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep
homosexual acts illegal in Northern Ireland --- by helping to mount a
counter campaign with the slogan ``Save Sodomy From Ulster.''

He moved to New York in the mid-1980s and became involved in the
protracted struggle by L.G.B.T. groups to be fully included in the St.
Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. Many years later, he became a
member of the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade formation
committee, and marched in the parade with the Lavender and Green
Alliance in 2016.

Brendan Fay, a friend and fellow activist, emphasized that Mr.
MacNiallais's well-publicized activism for inclusive parades should not
overshadow an equal passion. ``Most of his life in this city was
advocating for people with disabilities,'' Mr. Fay said.

Mr. MacNiallais tested positive for the virus in mid-March and died at
NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, with the texted words
of loved ones being read to him by a nurse. He is survived by his
husband, Juan Nepomuceno, nine siblings and three stepchildren.

On that March Sunday, the day the city's first case of coronavirus was
confirmed, the St. Pat's For All Parade moved joyously through a corner
of Queens before ending in the Woodside neighborhood, where organizers
gathered for an after-party at the Saints \& Sinners Pub. Amid the
singing and drinking and cheering, the booming voice of Mr. MacNiallais
was ``soaring above the lot of us,'' Mr. Fay recalled.

Everything else, he said, ``seemed far away.''
