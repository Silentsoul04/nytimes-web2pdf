*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Stanley Chera, a major New York real estate developer, a prominent
philanthropist and a friend of President Trump, died on April 11 at a
Manhattan hospital after a nearly monthlong struggle with the
coronavirus. He was 77.

President Trump confirmed the death on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249808119217172489)
in a message of condolence addressed to the family. “My deepest
sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late, great,
Stanley Chera, one of Manhattan’s most brilliant real estate minds,” he
wrote.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Chera’s wife, Frieda, known as Cookie, also had the illness but has
recovered.

Mr. Chera was a founder of Crown Acquisitions, a real estate firm, and
owned several well-known properties in Manhattan, including the St.
Regis New York Hotel and the Cartier Mansion.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While some of Crown’s tenants include global luxury brands like Louis
Vuitton and Versace, the firm also owns more modest properties in
blue-collar neighborhoods of New York that are leased to Duane Reade,
Sprint and Planet Fitness, according to The Real Deal, a real estate
publication.

Mr. Chera and the president shared a longtime bond as fellow New York
developers. Mr. Chera and his wife were early financial backers of Mr.
Trump’s quest for the presidency, giving more than a half-million
dollars since 2016 to his election and re-election campaigns.

As the coronavirus pandemic spread to New York, Mr. Trump advised Mr.
Chera to leave the city and move to his summer home near the oceanfront
town of Deal, N.J. Deal is [dominated by vacation
homes](https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/dominating-deal/) owned
by [New York retail moguls of Syrian Jewish
heritage](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/nyregion/25deal.html), as
Mr. Chera was.

Mr. Chera took the president’s advice. But he fell ill anyway, and at
the end of March was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill
Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump took the unusual step of speaking publicly about his friend’s
illness.

“I had a friend who went to a hospital the other day,” the president
said from the White House. “He’s a little older, and he’s heavy, but
he’s a tough person.”

Alluding to the lethal nature of the coronavirus, Mr. Trump added, “The
speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it’s
horrible.”

The severity of Mr. Chera’s case was said to have helped persuade Mr.
Trump to take the pandemic more seriously and to extend social
distancing guidelines until the end of April.

“Boy, did that hit home,” Bill White, a prominent New York donor to Mr.
Trump’s campaign, [told Vanity
Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/inside-trumps-decision-to-back-off-of-his-easter-coronavirus-miracle)
this month. “Stan is like one of his best friends.”

Stanley Isaac Chera was born on Oct. 22, 1942, in Brooklyn. He and his
father, Isaac, founded and ran a chain of children’s specialty stores in
the New York area.

Shortly after opening their first stores, they began acquiring the
buildings they operated out of, then the buildings nearby, then entire
blocks. Within a generation they had parlayed their holdings into one of
New York’s biggest retail empires. Along the way, Stanley’s three sons —
Richard, Haim and Isaac — became part of the business. Their real estate
deals sometimes have run in the billions of dollars.

In addition to his wife and sons, Mr. Chera’s survivors include several
grandchildren.

Despite having founded his empire on retail, Mr. Chera told The New York
Times in 2010 that he hated to shop; he said he could buy 10 suits in 15
minutes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Chera was heavily involved in charitable activities. He donated
millions to the [Rabin Medical
Center](https://hospitals.clalit.co.il/rabin/en/Pages/default.aspx) in
Israel, [National Jewish Health](https://www.nationaljewish.org/home)
and charities for special needs children. His son Haim told The Real
Deal that his father had been a champion of the underprivileged — “a
captain of the team for the correct and just, not the
popular.”
