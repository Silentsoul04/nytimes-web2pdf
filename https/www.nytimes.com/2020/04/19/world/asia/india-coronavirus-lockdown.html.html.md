BHOND, India — On the long, straight road into the farming village of
Bhond, past fields of tomatoes, eggplant and rust-colored wheat, stood a
police barricade, an incongruous sight for a settlement so small and
remote.

Beyond the sweating police officers lay a second line of defense.
Villagers armed with sticks, their faces covered with fraying bandannas,
blocked the road. Fearful of the spread of the coronavirus, they were
determined to enforce the government’s stay-at-home orders and keep
outsiders from entering their hamlet.

No one is paying these men. They are out here all day, every day, under
the withering sun, even as the farms behind them collapse under debt.

“Police or no police, we will continue,’’ said Mubarik Khan, a tomato
farmer who has been guarding the gates to Bhond, about 50 miles from New
Delhi, for the past three weeks. “I’m worried, we’re all worried, but I
feel a sense of duty to be out here.”

A fractious country of 1.3 billion people where it has long been
difficult to get individuals and communities to follow the rules, India
has pursued its coronavirus lockdown — the world’s largest — with
remarkable zeal.

People aren’t just dutifully following the law. Many are going above and
beyond it. Volunteer virus patrol squads are popping up everywhere,
casting an extra net of vigilance over the entire country. Neighborhoods
are imposing extra rules and sealing themselves off.

The volunteer efforts could help India protect its people from the
pandemic, given the state of most Indian hospitals, the enormous
population and living conditions like packed slums that leave its people
particularly susceptible to outbreaks.

India has reported about 16,000 confirmed infections and 500 deaths, far
less per capita than many richer countries. But its testing rates are
also lower, and some health experts believe the virus may be lurking
here and there, undetected.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many Indians are falling in line because they fear falling ill in a
country with a weak health care system offering treatments they cannot
afford. But the popularity of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi,
explains part of the obedience. For many people here, this is Mr. Modi’s
lockdown, and what he says goes. His government is India’s most powerful
in decades, so many Indians are scared to break his
rules.

Praising his countrymen for behaving like a [“disciplined
soldier,”](https://www.narendramodi.in/text-of-pm-s-address-to-the-nation-549264)
Mr. Modi has tried to cultivate a sense of fraternity under the
lockdown. Recently he asked all Indians to [stand in their doorways at a
certain time and clap and make
noise](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/03/23/covid-19-india-observes-janta-curfew-pm-modi-says-long-battle-ahead.html).

In both instances, millions obeyed.

India’s lockdown is nearly a month old, and Mr. Modi recently extended
it to May 3. As it grinds on, it has won praise but also elicited
concerns about overzealous enforcement, especially targeting the poor
and
minorities.

Lower castes are being shunned more than usual. The term “social
distancing” plays straight into centuries of ostracism of certain groups
who until recent times were called “untouchable.”

Muslims, a large minority in a Hindu-dominated land, are also facing a
burst of bigotry and attacks. The Indian government keeps pointing out
that [an Islamic seminary in New Delhi was responsible for spreading
thousands of
infections](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/world/asia/india-coronavirus-muslims-bigotry.html).
Now many Indians believe that all Muslims carry a higher risk of
spreading the coronavirus.

“This is one of the problems of overzealousness,’’ said Adarsh Shastri,
a politician in the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition
party. “People get a chance to enforce the laws per their own personal
prejudice.”

As in the United States and other countries, the lockdown has snarled
the supply chain. Farmers have been cut off from their markets, and
hungry people from food.

Some of these problems have been made worse by the way lockdown rules
are interpreted. For example, produce trucks are supposed to be allowed
to pass through checkpoints. But many Indians now fear truck drivers as
virus vectors. Trucks packed with vegetables have been turned back by
police officers and volunteer guards.

In perhaps an acknowledgment that the lockdown has been especially
tight, the government plans to encourage officially on Monday the
unshackling of industries such as agriculture, rubber and tea
plantations, cargo freight and water conservation projects — some of
which were supposed to be open anyway. The new guidance will cover only
areas without many
infections.

Indians across the country have followed the instructions to retreat
indoors, no matter how cramped their living spaces. One member at a time
emerges to get food, which is usually not every day, and always with a
mask on.

Still, fear keeps growing. More communities are imposing their own
measures to tighten the lockdown further and all but stop the flow of
people.

In one case, in Delhi, [a son turned in his own
father](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/father-always-out-roaming-during-lockdown-son-calls-police-820942.html)
for stepping outside. In another, in West Bengal State, some families
who wanted to maintain social distancing asked their loved ones to
[sleep in
trees](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/03/29/returning-labourers-in-bengal-village-made-to-stay-in-tree-houses.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Neighborhood associations, especially in wealthy areas, have become
extra careful. One association in Ghaziabad, near Delhi, tried to
require all residents to download the government’s official coronavirus
app on their phones, until several residents complained it was an
invasion of privacy.

In Jor Bagh, a New Delhi enclave of parks, bird song and
multimillion-dollar apartments, the leaders of the residents’
association have curtailed the movement of residents, guests and staff,
barring workers like private security guards or pizza deliverymen who
are supposed to be exempt from the
restrictions.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Some residents grumbled about the inconvenience of not having food
delivered to their doors. But those grumbles stopped after [a pizza
deliveryman in another Delhi neighborhood got
sick](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-pizza-coronavirus-covid-19-6364606/)and
the occupants of 72 homes he had recently served were put under
quarantine. Most Jor Bagh residents seem appreciative of the extra
rules.

In rural areas, volunteer virus squads patrol the roads day and night.
Some carry sticks, sickles and pockets full of nails for puncturing the
tires of cars they deem suspicious.

“You can call us civil defense,’’ said Monu Manesar, the head protector
of his village in Haryana State.

As a van approached, he shouted: “Hey, stop\! What are you carrying in
there?”

He peered into the van and saw boxes of bees from a honey farm.

“It’s a honeycomb,” he told the three men helping him. “Let them go.”

Mr. Manesar is a district coordinator for [Bajrang
Dal](https://www.news18.com/news/india/bulandshahr-violence-bajrang-dal-leader-who-complained-of-cow-slaughter-arrested-for-cops-murder-bjp-and-vhp-men-other-accused-1959599.html),
a Hindu nationalist group that over the years has been blamed for
attacks on non-Hindus. The fact that some of these virus patrol squads
include the same people who have targeted minorities in the past may
explain recent hate crimes connected to the
coronavirus.

Nearly two weeks ago, Sahimuddin, a reserve police officer and a Muslim
who, like many in India, goes by one name, was riding his motorcycle on
a rural road about 40 miles south of Delhi. A group of farmers manning a
barricade at one village questioned him and then called ahead to the
next village to be on the lookout.

As Mr. Sahimuddin approached the next village, several Hindu farmers at
a barricade threw a noose around his neck and yanked him off his bike.
They beat him viciously, nearly crushing his windpipe, Mr. Sahimuddin’s
family said. Police officers corroborated their account.

He is now in a hospital, voiceless and struggling to breathe.

“You don’t know how much this angers me,’’ said his wife, Sameena.
“Those men had no business stopping my husband.”

In another community, in southern India, upper caste residents recently
dug a five-foot-deep trench around the homes of several Dalits, the
lowest on the caste ladder, to keep the communities separate.

On Sunday evening, possibly as a response to the growing reports of hate
crimes, Mr. Modi said on Twitter that the [coronavirus does not
