​The North’s Foreign Ministry ​disputed an assertion by President Trump

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Sunday denied President Trump’s
assertion that its leader, [Kim
Jong-un](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/asia/kim-jong-un-absence-north-korea.html),
had sent a letter to him, and suggested that Mr. Trump was using his
vaunted relationship with Mr. Kim for “selfish purposes.”

Mr. Trump said the day before during his daily press briefing on the
coronavirus that he had received a “nice note” from Mr. Kim.

“I received a nice note from him recently. It was a nice note. I think
we’re doing fine,” Mr. Trump[told reporters on
Saturday](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4869685/user-clip-mad-man) at
the White House. He also claimed that the United States would have been
at war with North Korea had he not been elected and played down the
threat of [short-range missile
tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/world/asia/north-korea-fires-missiles.html)
that North Korea has been conducting since March.

During a phone conversation with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea,
Mr. Trump also ​said he had received a “warm letter” from the North
Korean leader, Mr. Moon’s aides told reporters on Sunday. But ​later
Sunday, ​the North’s Foreign Ministry ​said, “There was no letter
addressed recently to the U.S. president by the supreme leadership” of
the North.

“He could have referred to the personal letters that had been exchanged
in the past, we are not sure,” the ministry said in a statement carried
by the North’s official news agency.

“We are about to look into the matter to see if the U.S. leadership
seeks anything in feeding the ungrounded story into the media,” it said,
warning that the​ relationship between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump should not
“be misused for meeting selfish purposes,” or “for diversion.”

Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have in the past often praised their unusual
relationship. They exchanged a number of personal letters before and
after [their first
summit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/north-korea-summit.html)
meeting, in Singapore in 2018, and at one point Mr. Trump said he and
Mr. Kim had fallen [“in
love.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV6mVmAVQU4)

Last month, North Korea
[revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/asia/coronavirus-north-korea-trump-kim.html)
— and the White House later confirmed — that Mr. Trump had sent a letter
to Mr. Kim expressing his willingness to help the North battle the
coronavirus. North Korea has taken vigorous steps against the pandemic,
and claims it has not had a single [case of
Covid-19.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html)

Relations between Pyongyang and Washington have cooled since [the
leaders’ second summit
meeting,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/world/asia/trump-kim-vietnam-summit.html)
in Vietnam in February 2019, collapsed over differences regarding how
quickly North Korea should dismantle its nuclear weapons program and
when Washington should ease sanctions against the North.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since then, Mr. Kim has repeatedly said that North Korea was no longer
interested in diplomacy with the United States unless it changed what he
called its hostile policy, including sanctions. North Korea has also
said the “special personal relations” between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump were
not enough to improve their countries’ ties.
