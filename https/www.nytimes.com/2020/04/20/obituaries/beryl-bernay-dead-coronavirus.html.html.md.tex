who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Many Americans seek professional reinvention as a way to animate their
lives. For Beryl Bernay, her life was defined by it.

Ms. Bernay --- an actor, fashion designer, photographer, journalist,
painter and amateur anthropologist --- died on March 29 in Manhattan.
She was 94. The cause was complications of the coronavirus, her niece,
Carol Gonzalez, said.

Beryl Bernstein was born on March 2, 1926, in Brooklyn to Russian émigré
parents. Her father, Barney, who changed the family name to Berney when
she was a child, was a garment worker and her mother, Sade Berney, sold
stockings and taught kindergarten. (Their daughter began spelling her
name Bernay in adulthood.)

She graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan at 15. Too
young to attend college, she worked at Franklin Simon \& Company as a
draper and designer for teen and preteen fashions, Ms. Gonzalez said.
She went on to attend Pennsylvania State University.

Ms. Bernay took acting classes with
\href{https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/the-definitive-guide-to-uta-hagens-acting-technique-68922/}{Uta
Hagen} and \href{https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0074596/}{Herbert Berghof}
and appeared in several shows, including a 1955 production of Thornton
Wilder's ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' in Paris with
\href{https://www.biography.com/actor/helen-hayes}{Helen Hayes} and
\href{https://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/mary-martin/}{Mary
Martin}.

During her time in Paris, she drove to the south of France to seek out
Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall, whom she captured
\href{https://www.thevillager.com/2004/10/westbeth-artist-reveals-a-remarkable-life/}{in
photographic portraits} which she sent to Harper's Weekly, along with an
article, which published them.

Then there was a foray into children's programming. Between 1962 and
1965, she was the creative force behind ``All Join Hands,'' a program
produced by the United Nations Children's Fund in which she and her
puppet co-hosts, Miss Bookworm and Doodle the Travel Bug, narrated a
show highlighting different countries.

Ms. Bernay held a number of jobs at United Nations agencies, often as a
communications official. In those positions she frequently visited
Indonesia.

``Beryl Bernay was an astute observer of not only the political
situation in Indonesia,'' said Wayne Forrest, the president of the
American Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, ``she also had an abiding
interest in the culture of Bali, which she helped introduce to American
audiences.''

In July of 1977, she accompanied Margaret Mead, whom she had met in a
class at Columbia University, to work as her assistant on the
anthropologist's last field trip to the Balinese mountain village of
Bayung Gede. Her photographs from that trip were displayed at the Museum
of Natural History in New York. Through it all, she also painted.

Ms. Bernay's two marriages ended in divorce.

In 2011, she told a reporter she was reluctant to give up any of her
interests, all of which she dabbled in late into her life. ``I really
enjoy each one of my things when I'm doing it,'' she said, ``and when
I'm not doing it, I miss it.''
