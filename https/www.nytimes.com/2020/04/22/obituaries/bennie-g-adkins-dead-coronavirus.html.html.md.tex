\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Bennie G. Adkins received the Medal of Honor, the military's highest
award for valor, at a White House ceremony in September 2014. While he
was mainly remembered for an extraordinary act of bravery in the Vietnam
War, he devoted his postwar years to helping both his community members
in Alabama and latter-day Special Forces troops better their lives
through education.

As a Green Beret sergeant, Mr. Adkins played a major role in preventing
the annihilation of his outnumbered unit when it was ambushed in March
1966 at its remote South Vietnam camp.

``During the 38-hour battle and 48 hours of escape and evasion, Adkins
fought with mortars, machine guns, recoilless rifles, small arms and
hand grenades, killing an estimated 135 to 175 of the enemy and
sustaining 18 different wounds,''
\href{https://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/adkins/}{the Medal of Honor
citation} read.

Mr. Adkins was among the last holdouts among the American troops who
were evacuated by helicopter before being airlifted out of the camp in a
bizarre conclusion to the battle.

He liked to tell how a tiger that had evidently been stalking the
combatants appeared on the scene; he surmised that the enemy had spotted
it, too. ``The North Vietnamese were more afraid of the tiger than we
were,'' he said. ``They backed off.''

Mr. Adkins, who spent three tours of duty in Vietnam, retired from the
Army in 1978 as a Command Sergeant Major.

He died on Friday at a hospital in Opelika, Ala., at 86. His son W.
Keith Adkins, a physician, said the cause was complications of the
coronavirus. He had twice been hospitalized since March, when he
experienced respiratory problems.

After leaving the military, Mr. Adkins received a bachelor's degree and
two master's degrees from Troy University in Alabama, in education and
management, and founded an accounting firm.

He taught adult education classes to help others pursue college
educational opportunities just as he had.

``He loved people,'' Keith Adkins said in an interview. ``He looked to
give back.''

Three years ago, Mr. Adkins founded the
\href{https://www.bennieadkinsfoundation.org/}{Bennie Adkins Foundation}
to provide college scholarships to noncommissioned Special Forces
officers to help their transition into civilian life. It has awarded
about 50 scholarships to date, Keith Adkins said.

Bennie Gene Adkins was a native of Waurika, Okla., near the Texas
border, and the son of a farmer. He was a longtime resident of Opelika,
a city in east-central Alabama.

In addition to his son Keith, he is survived by his son Michael; his
daughter, Mary Ann Blake; his brothers Gerrol and Jim; and many
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His wife,
\href{https://www.jeffcoattrant.com/notices/MaryN-Adkins}{Mary
(Arington) Adkins}, died in 2019, and his sons Dennis and Wayne also
died before him.

When President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Mr. Adkins,
he began by talking of Mr. Adkins's long devotion to service.

As Mr. Obama put it: ``The first thing you need to know is when Bennie
and I met in the Oval Office, he asked if he could sign back up.''
