His donation of a violin to a 12-year-old Bronx girl spawned an

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Joseph Feingold, a Holocaust survivor who found unexpected fame late in
life as the co-star of ``Joe's Violin,'' an Oscar-nominated short
documentary, died on April 15 at Mt. Sinai West Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 97.

His stepdaughter Ame Gilbert said the cause was complications of
Covid-19.

In 2014, Mr. Feingold was listening to his favorite classical music
station, WQXR, when he heard about a
\href{https://www.mhopus.org/}{program that gives used instruments} to
New York City schoolchildren. He took the bus from his home on
Manhattan's Upper West Side to Lincoln Center, and donated a cherished
violin he no longer played because his fingers had grown stiff.

Mention of his donation was made over the radio. The violin --- and Mr.
Feingold --- had quite a story, as Kahane Cooperman, a filmmaker who was
listening, soon discovered.

Born on March 23, 1923, in Warsaw, Joseph Feingold was 17 when the Nazis
invaded Poland. He and his father, Aron, a shoemaker, fled to the
Russian-occupied east seeking safety. They were caught by the Russian
army and sent to separate labor camps in Siberia. Six years of
near-starvation and freezing cold followed.

Mr. Feingold's mother, Ruchele, and a younger brother, Henry, had both
stayed behind in Poland and perished in the concentration camps, he
later learned. Another brother, Alex, miraculously survived Auschwitz
and Bergen-Belsen.

While he was at a displaced person's camp near Frankfurt, Germany, Mr.
Feingold spotted a violin at a flea market and traded cigarettes for it.
Music reminded him of happier times before the war, he said in a
self-published memoir. Mr. Feingold back then would accompany his mother
on the violin as she sang for family and guests.

Mr. Feingold emigrated to New York City along with his father and
brother and the flea-market violin.

The trauma of the Holocaust trailed him. He got a late start in life,
graduating from Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture
when he was 39 and marrying his wife, Regina, in his late 40s.

He became a successful architect known for his mastery of the city's
byzantine building codes. He bought a brownstone on the Upper West Side
and a ramshackle farmhouse in Ghent, N.Y., rebuilding the house and old
barns, and cutting paths through the woods, to make a beloved retreat
for himself and gathering place for family and friends.

Ms. Cooperman recounted Mr. Feingold's saga in her 2017 documentary and
also told the story of the violin's recipient, Brianna Perez, a
12-year-old Dominican girl from the Bronx, and the friendship that
formed between the two.

In addition to Ms. Gilbert, Mr. Feingold is survived by four
step-grandchildren and a step-great-granddaughter.

Mr. Feingold was capable of great generosity and expressions of joy and
love. But at times he also had difficulty in being open and warm given
what he went through, relatives said. His relationship with his brother
was complicated by the tragic history they shared.

After his brother died last month from pneumonia, Mr. Feingold started
having nightmares about the Holocaust.

Apparently, such dreams had haunted him periodically for years, though
Ms. Gilbert said she learned that only recently. She wished it were
sooner. ``It would have allowed me more compassion,'' she said.
