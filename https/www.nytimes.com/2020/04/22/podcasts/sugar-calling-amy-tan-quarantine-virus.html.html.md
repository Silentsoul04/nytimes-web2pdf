  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Amy Tan. I fell in love with her a long
    time ago, when her first book “The Joy Luck Club” came out. I read
    it right away, in 1989, and I was utterly astonished and astounded
    by the lives she wrote about in those pages. And especially the
    dynamics between the mother and the daughter in that book really
    moved me deeply. Amy Tan is also the author of “The Valley of
    Amazement,” “The Kitchen God’s Wife,” and other books. Most
    recently, she wrote a memoir called “Where the Past Begins.” It’s
    about her life as a writer and also about her family history and how
    it has been brought to bear on her life. I’m going to give her a
    call.

  - amy tan  
    Hello?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Amy?

  - amy tan  
    Yes?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, this is Cheryl.

  - amy tan  
    Hi. Hi, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, it’s so nice to hear your voice.

  - amy tan  
    Good to hear you too.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So where are you right now? Where am I calling you?

  - amy tan  
    You are calling me in my home in Sausalito.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So you’re socially isolating with your husband, is that right, your
    husband Lou?

  - amy tan  
    My husband, yes. My husband and two dogs, we are in this house. I
    feel very, very lucky actually to be here in this particular house,
    which I actually built, with the idea that one day we’d be old and
    not be able to go out, and what would I need to feel like it was OK
    to be sequestered in a way from the world.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And what did that turn out to be? What is your house like? And what
    can you see from your windows?

  - amy tan  
    It’s like a treehouse, and it’s surrounded by oak trees, and windows
    all on three sides of this great room that I’m sitting in.
    Everything is ADA compliant, so if I would be in a wheelchair, I
    could go anywhere. The bathrooms are all sliding doors. The entries
    outside. So it’s all set up for getting old, and I hope I get old.
    But what I see, I see oak trees. But the main thing I see is Angel
    Island. Which is, I see the bay. I see San Francisco Bay, Raccoon
    Strait, Sausalito Harbor, but in the middle of all that is Angel
    Island. Do you know what Angel Island is? Do you know its history?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I want to say that there — was it a place where immigrants came. Is
    that right?

  - amy tan  
    Yes, in particular Chinese people. It was a quarantine station. I
    just think it’s so ironic in a terrible way that this is the symbol
    that I’m looking at daily is the quarantine where people did not
    know when they would get out of this place and what the future would
    be and if they would be sent back. So great uncertainty and
    unhappiness there.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And when was that in existence? What years?

  - amy tan  
    That was, I think it was like 1910 until 1940 or so. The dates are
    approximate. But I used to live in the house that’s next to the
    current one that we have, and that was built in 1908. And I would
    look at the house and think, the woman who lived in this house in
    1908 would look at that island, and that’s where all these Chinese
    people were imprisoned really, and that I was the person now looking
    at this island, and I was the Chinese woman looking at it. So I had
    a great deal of connection between me and what I was seeing, a great
    deal of gratitude that I was on the other side of that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Your parents both immigrated from China in the ‘40s, is that
    correct?

  - amy tan  
    Yes, ‘47 for my father and ‘49 for my mother.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And where did they come when — how did they arrive to the United
    States?

  - amy tan  
    My father came by boat, and my mother flew on Philippine Airlines.
    She had to take a boat from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then
    eventually she flew. She couldn’t wait for the boat. She wanted to
    be reunited with my father. And they were in San Francisco, and by
    then there was no quarantine station. But they came on student
    visas, which then lapsed, and then they became illegal. So they
    faced deportation for about 10 years.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And then finally were able to become U.S. citizens?

  - amy tan  
    Yes. Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And how were they able to become citizens?

  - amy tan  
    Eventually, they got, I think, a kind of residency. And I just
    remember that when I was about — it was around 1962 or so, and I
    remember being at home and my parents were crying, and they had just
    come back from being sworn in as American citizens. And I couldn’t
    appreciate that. It was like, oh, big deal, they went and took a
    test, and now they’re citizens. So what, you know? I had no idea
    that for all those years, they had been facing this terrible
    uncertainty. Because we were kids, we were born here, we’re
    Americans. We didn’t know any different. We didn’t know anything
    about China.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Obviously, your work has been so deeply about your past and
    your family’s history. And I guess I’m curious. I know you became a
    writer, with “The Joy Luck Club” being published when you were in
    your 30s, you were kind of surprised essentially to become a
    novelist?

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was a short story writer. Somebody else called
    it a novel. It was a series of short stories really.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You’re right. I always forget that. It’s that the stories in “The
    Joy Luck Club” sit together so beautifully, it reads to me like a
    novel. What I was so moved by is really at the heart of that book is
    that mother-daughter bond. And I’m curious, how did you come to
    write about that mother and daughter, and what did your real mother
    make of it when she read the book when the book came out?

  - amy tan  
    I was writing this at a time when I was not really that close to my
    mother. It was more of a detente or more of an avoidance of
    situations that might inflame both of us. And when I started to
    write, these stories just naturally came out when I began writing
    about a girl, then suddenly her mother injected herself into the
    story. And I began to see how much of who I was had been formed by
    my — whatever I had absorbed from my mother, but also how I had
    reacted, rebelled against her. So I started writing this, and
    ironically, the voices that were the easiest to me were the mothers.
    And I realized how much I really had paid attention, and I was
    trying to figure out what these mothers — my mother’s intention had
    been, especially in telling these stories about the past that I
    always thought were so boring. Or you know I’d say, you’ve told me
    that already, which was the wrong thing to say to her. If I said
    that to her, she’d just go into a fury and then threaten to kill
    herself. So I had to be very careful and just kind of tune out and
    just, yeah, yeah, mm-hm.

  - cheryl strayed  
    If you said, mom, you already told me that story, she would threaten
    to kill herself?

  - amy tan  
    Often, if there was anything that made her feel that she was
    unappreciated or that I’d rather she not be there at that particular
    moment, yes, it would lead to a suicide threat and occasionally
    suicide attempts. And so that was something I grew up with, which
    shaped me a great deal. Not that I’m suicidal, but in looking at
    what it was that made my mother feel suicidal, that she had a kind
    of helplessness, a loneliness, an inability to control what was
    happening in her life. She got that from her mother, who did kill
    herself, and her mother killed herself because she was forced to
    become a concubine after she was widowed. And she was widowed when
    her husband, my grandfather, died during the pandemic in 1919.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right, the Spanish influenza pandemic.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And this was in Shanghai? They were in Shanghai when —

  - amy tan  
    Yes. Yes, in Shanghai. For the reason that I’m writing, which is to
    understand this transference, this inheritance of emotion over
    generations. Your reactions, the way you think about the world, your
    philosophy, your cosmology of how you view things, how the universe
    operates and how you operate within that world, that came from, I
    think in many ways, from the pandemic, which changed the direction
    of our family’s life. And so that suicide came out of that, and my
    mother, being the suicidal child who watched her mother die at age
    9, was the mother I ended up with, who guided me to who I am today
    and how I react to things.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I love thinking about the ways that our mothers, the ways they
    shaped us not just as humans, but as writers, and I’m really struck
    by what you said about your mom, about her helplessness. And I do
    think that when you’re angry and you threaten somebody with your
    suicide, that is a way of really expressing a profound helplessness.
    And yet, I think of your mom and everything you’ve said about her or
    written about her, she was such a resilient person. She was such a
    survivor, right?

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. Yeah, it was a great contradiction that she could go through
    anything, and yet there would be the smallest thing that would make
    her feel annihilated. But you’re right, she had such fortitude, such
    resilience, but it came across in ways that really made me want to
    not be like her. I mean, one of her things is she constantly
    worried, and she would try to find the reasons why something
    happened. And if she could find the reason, then she couldn’t do it.
    But at the same time, she could handle the reality of what was going
    on and just be strong and push through and tell people she wasn’t
    taking this. And she had very strong opinions, very strong ethics.
    She would become livid if anybody was condescending to her, and she
    couldn’t always fight back and say, don’t you dare treat me that
    way, because she was a Chinese woman who didn’t speak English very
    well. And people would treat her in this way, patronizing,
    condescending way, but that would make her livid. And that’s
    something she passed on to me. I get a just immediate reaction where
    I explode if somebody is treating me in a patronizing way.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. It’s so amazing to me the ways that we carry our mothers
    within us, positive and negative. My mom died when she was 45.

  - amy tan  
    So young.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yes. You know, Amy, I feel connected to you. I’ve never met you, but
    part of you is embedded in part of me because — I’m going to cry —
    because “The Joy Luck Club” was one of the last books that my mom
    and I read together.

  - amy tan  
    Oh —

  - cheryl strayed  
    And —

  - amy tan  
    — God.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — we both loved it so much. And it was — I had a really different
    kind of relationship with my mom than the one you had with yours,
    but there was a language, there was something that you gave us that
    allowed us to talk even more fully about our relationship. And it
    was you, your book, “The Joy Luck Club” opened up that dialogue in
    the last year of my mom’s life. I remember —

  - amy tan  
    Wow.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — so your book came out two years before my mom died, and then the
    movie of it came out two years after she died. And I remember
    sitting in the theater watching it alone, and I remember just crying
    and thinking, I wish — my mother should be here with me.

  - amy tan  
    Oh. Oh, well, that makes me cry to hear that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m sorry, I’m not supposed to —

  - amy tan  
    Thank you for telling me. No, no, it’s a good thing. It’s good when
    you’re moved to tears.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m not supposed to cry, but.

  - amy tan  
    No.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I know you have also experienced deep grief. Your brother Peter and
    your father John both died in 1968, when you were 15, and they died
    of the same thing.

  - amy tan  
    Yes.
    
    It was — it actually started in ‘67 and ended — it was exactly one
    year, February to February. My brother first became ill. My older
    brother, who I adored.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And how old was he at the time?

  - amy tan  
    He died just about a week before he turned 17, and he had a brain
    tumor, a kind of brain tumor that would today be curable. And two
    weeks before he died, my father was diagnosed with glioblastoma, and
    then he died six months later. So it was one solid year. There was
    no break whatsoever, February to February, of this specter of doom,
    but also a need to pretend that everything was OK and a miracle
    would happen. And the pretense is what I hated, the, what I consider
    to be the false hope at the time, and that is something I write a
    lot about. I want to understand this notion, and is there anything
    in the way of hopelessness or futile hope? And I’ve come away
    thinking, no, hope is a very, very important part of this that we
    have to really safeguard. We have to keep that because that is part
    of what gives us fortitude. And it could be the most impossible
    situation, but for you to see a future, you have to cling to that.
    And I feel that very strongly.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And yet, when you were a kid and your family was facing this
    horrific couple of years, you resented that sense that there should
    be hope?

  - amy tan  
    Oh, yeah. It made me angry because I felt that it was a betrayal,
    especially after my brother died, that the miracle didn’t happen and
    they were still going through this. My father was a Baptist
    minister. He was an engineer, but he was also a Baptist minister. So
    this religious component was part of it. If we were good enough, if
    we prayed hard enough, the miracle would happen. And it didn’t
    happen, so it was either that I didn’t get the reward or I was not
    good enough. And it made me cynical, which is a terrible thing to
    have happen when you’re a young person. I don’t know when cynicism
    comes into a child’s life, when they first recognize it in
    themselves, but I certainly felt it when I was 14 and 15.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm-hm. And when your family, really almost half of your family died.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah, and what I thought was the best half of the family because I
    loved my brother and my father. I was a daddy’s girl, and he was
    supposed to protect me from my mother, and he left. And then I was
    angry at my father because he abandoned me by dying.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. I’m curious, that experience that you had — we’re seeing the
    numbers every day climb of the people around the globe who have died
    of Covid-19. And I’m curious if knowing that so many people are
    grieving the loss of loved ones, if that’s made you at all remember
    or think about what you experienced as a young woman when suddenly
    you lost people in your life?

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. I think more than anything, it’s not simply the grief, it’s
    not knowing. Not knowing when this is going to end. During the time
    my father and brother were dying, my mother made us feel it was a
    curse and we would all die. So we were waiting for something worse,
    even worse to happen, and the worst that happened was my mother went
    crazy, to use a very non-psychiatric term. So I think it’s that
    uncertainty and the feeling of something impending that is worse
    than what is presently happening. And each day, we are overwhelmed
    by news, the numbers. It’s a crescendo of these numbers, and it just
    doesn’t stop. And it starts with this incredulity. People wake up in
    the morning and say, it was just a bad dream. And then you’re
    incredulous to find, no, it’s real. And each day, that momentary
    sense of disbelief, I think, overtakes a lot of us, and then we
    settle into it and say, oh my God, when is this going to stop? And
    all these people are giving us information, and who’s telling the
    truth or who knows the truth? Nobody could possibly know. This has
    never happened before with this particular disease. So I think that
    uncertainty combined with losses, and not for me — it’s not so much
    that I fear dying for myself, I fear it for my husband. We’ve been
    together for 50 years, and I don’t know what I would do if something
    happened to him.
    
    My fear for friends who have certain conditions that would make them
    very vulnerable, besides age. I have lost one friend who,
    ironically, tragically, was the person who wrote the textbook on
    pulmonary disease, and he died from Covid-19.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, I’m so sorry.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    What was his name?

  - amy tan  
    John Murray. His wife is Diane Johnson, the novelist. I don’t know
    if you’ve heard of her.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah.

  - amy tan  
    So we’ve been friends for about 30-some years, and so it was very,
    very sad.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So we’re afraid of our friends dying. You also mentioned you’re
    afraid of your husband Lou dying. I’m wondering what you’re doing to
    manage that feeling that you describe so well, which I do think is
    very much like grief, that you wake up, you forget for a moment
    what’s true, and then you remember the truth. And I remember this
    over and over in the first year or so after my mom died, that I
    would wake up — there was something kind of safe about the dream
    life, and I’d wake up and think, oh, she’s dead. And you’re right,
    this is exactly what I’ve thought during the pandemic. And it’s
    because the world — I always say, when you lose somebody who is
    essential to you, the world as you know it ends, and you have to
    figure out how to live in the new world without that person. And
    here we are in the pandemic, that the world as we knew it has ended.
    And so how are you navigating in the new world?

  - amy tan  
    I have anxiety like everybody else, and it comes as a sense of
    breathlessness. I don’t really know it in my head until I feel it in
    my body, and I say, why do I feel I can’t breathe? And I know I
    don’t have Covid-19, but I just think, what’s going on? And then I
    recognize the anxiety, and I know that what it would be is suddenly
    this affecting us and Lou getting sick and what would I do and
    losing him. So what I do that is different from my mother is not
    worry about — not focus on, how did this happen, where does this
    come from? Is to be super prepared. I am known among my friends as
    Debbie Downer. I’m the person who gets prepared for every single
    disaster. I have a shed full of stuff for earthquakes. I have things
    for —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Really?

  - amy tan  
    I have shelves with grab bags to go, with everything you need for a
    wildfire. So when this pandemic first started, I went and gathered a
    lot of the stuff I already had, which included masks. I have
    goggles. I have sterilizing things, UV water purifiers, all of that
    kind of stuff, gloves. I already had that stuff, and then I added to
    that. And then I know that something could happen, but I would have
    control, some degree of control.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Some degree of control.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah, some degree of control. I can’t control everything, but I
    won’t fall to pieces. I have a little box that has everything, and
    I know I go there, I have procedure, so I can be methodical.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It is such a fine line, isn’t it, between your friends kind of
    making fun of you because you have all this stuff, and yet it’s
    actually kind of reasonable. I too — I live in Portland, Oregon,
    where we’re all just waiting for this major earthquake that they
    keep saying is overdue. And for years now, I kept thinking, I have
    to buy those earthquake preparedness packs. And the first week that
    it got real in my household, I bought these 20-year bags for seven
    people. My family’s only four, but I figure we’ll help out a few
    neighbors too if we can. And I think when my kids saw this, they’re
    like, mom, you’re kind of weird. But the thing is, I wasn’t trying
    to alarm anyone. I’m trying to be prepared. But —

  - amy tan  
    How can — I don’t know why people would deny that. It’s this
    superstitious mentality of, if you do it, it’s going to happen.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, and that’s, I want to go back to — this is something that I
    really am curious about, because when your brother and father died
    in the late ‘60s, we just had such a different culture of the ways
    that we talk about death, a very different culture of grief. I mean,
    that it was this topic that was to be avoided. And I’m curious, here
    you are, my heart breaks for you, Amy, this teenage girl. You’ve
    lost your big brother, your father. I’m sure you were also maybe
    afraid that you too might get sick and die, all of those things. And
    I’m curious, so many people out there right now are having to face
    these big losses and having to grieve, and I know a lot of people
    around them are wondering, what do I say? How do I address this
    sorrow, this monumental sorrow? And I’m curious, what do you wish
    people did or said to you during your time of greatest need and loss
    and sorrow?

  - amy tan  
    Well, you have to keep in mind I was very young. I mean, I was a
    teenager, and I wanted to have a normal life. I wanted to be asked
    out on a date. I’d never been asked out on a date. I wanted to have
    that life and to escape. And I think about that with a lot of the
    kids today, and that I want to say, I understand if you want to
    escape, that you want to leave the house, or you just want to take
    your mind out of this. You don’t want to be with family. You don’t
    want to be supportive. You want somebody to say to you, that’s fine
    the way that you feel, that’s natural. That’s what I would have
    wanted. I’m sure there are a lot of people out there who do that for
    their kids. But I think parents, adults are so overwhelmed by what’s
    happening, they may be demanding more things from their kids, that
    they behave better, that they — and you know what happens is you
    behave worse. Instead of making things easier for your family, you
    make it harder because you resent it. You’re scared, and you can’t
    express that because you’re a teenager, and nothing scares you, so
    to speak. And I wanted to just have somebody say, I know why you’re
    angry. I needed some understanding. There was a complication on top
    of that is that a few days or a week or two before my father died, I
    was caught reading a dirty book, “Catcher in the Rye,” and —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, my goodness.

  - amy tan  
    — a banned book. So the youth minister came to counsel me, and he
    sexually molested me. He threw me down on my bed and sexually
    molested me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Amy.

  - amy tan  
    So that day, it was — before the miracle busted up, exploded in our
    faces, that was already gone. The whole idea that religion and
    people and praying together and community, that was gone too. I came
    out of that room a different person.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Amy.

  - amy tan  
    And ultimately — no, no — ultimately, I’m glad because what it
    taught me is that I have to ask my own questions. I have to say,
    what is it that I really feel? What’s hypocritical? What’s truly not
    kindness and being a good person?
    
    And so I ask those questions myself. It doesn’t get dictated to me
    in the way that it used to because the spokespeople for what is good
    and evil are not necessarily coming from the best sources. So I
    learned that. You don’t take dictation, you find the truth.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, and you have to be awake to it. I think we share that
    experience too. I’ve been sexually abused. And I think that, for me,
    the most meaningful act probably in my life has been that move that
    you just described. Where you take an awful thing that happened to
    you, the death of an essential person in your life who you love or a
    sexual violation, you take that really, really ugly thing and make
    it, in some ways, beautiful. You make it not disempower you, but be
    the place, the source of your power. Adrienne Rich talks about our
    wounds being the source of our greatest power. I really believe
    that.

  - amy tan  
    I want to just interject something here. I was talking to a friend,
    a psychiatrist, about people who go through terrible things and they
    have that with them the rest of their lives, and it makes them a
    little dysfunctional or greatly dysfunctional. And I wouldn’t want
    people to feel guilty that they weren’t able to find their strength
    when a terrible thing happened to them or a series of terrible
    things. So I just say that because there are a lot of people going
    through terrible stuff right now, and maybe they’re not going to be
    able to come out and say, I’m resilient. Maybe they’re just going to
    fall apart. And I just want to say, that’s good, lift your hand and
    ask for help.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I think, too, one of the things about resilience that I’ve
    observed in my own life and so many people who I admire is that
    resilience doesn’t necessarily happen the next day, right? Sometimes
    you have to wander around in the darkness for a decade, for two
    decades. I mean, anyone who’s ever recovered from a long addiction
    or changed their lives in these radically essential ways knows this
    to be true. So it’s also never too late to —

  - amy tan  
    Exactly, yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — find that strength.

  - amy tan  
    Mm-hm. It’s there, it’s rooted, and it can come out, and you know,
    it can surprise you. I wonder about so many people and how they’re
    going to deal with this, and that becomes part of the thing that
    makes me anxious, that what’s going to happen to this world? Because
    I’m going to come out OK. My life now is not a lot different from
    what it has been as a writer. But what about these people in these
    tiny places who are going to lose those tiny places? What’s going to
    happen to them? So I think part of it is to feel you can’t do
    anything, but I think it’s important to feel compassion, to
    empathize as much as you can, which is what I think we do as fiction
    writers. It’s our practice to do that. Imagination I think, is the
    closest thing we have to compassion.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, yeah. You wrote something really beautiful that I wrote down in
    my notebook in your memoir, “Where the Past Begins.” You said that
    Jane Eyre taught you that loneliness had more to do with being
    misunderstood than being alone. And I think it’s a wonderful example
    of what you’re saying, that as memoirists, fiction writers, as
    writers, it’s not about delivering the message to everyone that
    would be the one wise thing, but making people feel seen and
    recognized. I’m curious, I asked you to read something to me, and
    can I ask you to share the poem?

  - amy tan  
    Now, the poem that I’ve chosen has to do with the fact that as
    writers, I think that, for many of us, what draws us to writing is
    to come up with a way to express the exact feeling at the exact
    moment, and that when somebody reads that, they say, that’s how it
    is for me. And that’s what this poem is about. This poem was written
    by my editor, who’s also my publisher and is also a renowned poet,
    Dan Halpern. He wrote this five years ago. He didn’t remember
    writing it, but he knew that he must’ve written it because it was
    published in Poetry about five years ago.

  - cheryl strayed  
    He doesn’t remember writing it?

  - amy tan  
    He doesn’t remember, and it is so prescient.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s funny. So, yeah, it’s prescient. It’s called
    “Pandemania,” right?

  - amy tan  
    “Pandemania.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    By Daniel Halpern.

  - amy tan  
    Daniel Halpern. Here it is.
    
    “There are fewer introductions in plague years, hands held back,
    jocularity no longer bellicose, even among men. Breathing’s
    generally wary, labored, as they say, when the end is at hand. But
    this is the everyday intake of the imperceptible life force willed
    now, slow. Well, just cautious in inhabited air. As for ongoing
    dialogue, no longer an exuberant plosive to make a point, but a new
    squirreling of airspace, a new sense of boundary.
    
    “Genghis Khan said the hand is the first thing one man gives to
    another. Not in this war. A gesture of limited distance now
    suffices, a nod, a minor smile or a hand slightly raised, not in
    search of its counterpart, just a warning within the acknowledgment
    to stand back. Each beautiful stranger a barbarian breathing on the
    other side of the gate.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    Amy, what a perfect poem for this moment.

  - amy tan  
    I know.

  - cheryl strayed  
    This is honestly my life. I walk around Northeast Portland and I
    greet people with a seeming sense of pleasantry from a distance, but
    I think, barbarian, stay on the other side of that gate.

  - amy tan  
    You’re infected. Are you infected? Or, why aren’t you wearing a
    mask? Or why are you too close to me?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Do you walk around your neighborhood? Are you having this same
    experience?

  - amy tan  
    I’ve done it twice. But we see people running by, no masks, too
    close, coming by too close to us, and I think it’s impolite. I think
    it’s hostile. So there’s a new separateness that has come up among
    strangers.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And that actually scares me, that dynamic, because I sense in
    myself sometimes that building sense of not just fear, but almost
    this — Daniel in this poem, he even says, he mentions this term war.
    It’s you against me, and you stay in your breath space and I’ll stay
    in mine. And I can’t help but fear what’s already gone on so much
    over the last many years and probably through all of history, but
    especially in the last few years this anti-immigrant sentiment —

  - amy tan  
    Oh my God, yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — the attacks against many Asian-Americans in the U.S.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah, especially now. Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And, right, even our president calling it the Chinese virus. And I’m
    afraid about that dynamic of this.

  - amy tan  
    And I just want to say this thing about Chinese virus. Some people
    say, well, we called it Ebola. Ebola River is where Ebola was.
    Ebolese, they’re not people. You’re not saying the “Ebolese.”
    Chinese is a race. Chinese is not a location. Chinese live
    throughout the world, including the United States, people who were
    born in this country. And he has made it a race card, and that’s
    what angers me so much in how they have renamed this virus. They
    have made it race, not location. So the thing about with people who
    go running by without a mask, it’s not ignorance because I have read
    online the hostile remarks. It’s like, you don’t tell us what to do,
    we don’t have to wear that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. Yeah, I’ve seen it. I just try to assume — my nature is just
    to assume goodwill. I don’t, I never believe that the barbarians are
    at the gate, and maybe that’s just because I’m an idiot. But I
    always want to assume the good in people, so —

  - amy tan  
    Well, the barbarians are within. I mean —

  - cheryl strayed  
    We are the barbarians at the gate.

  - amy tan  
    — we are barbarians, all of us are barbarians.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, one runner without a mask to screw it all up. Yeah, no, I’m
    with you, sister.

  - amy tan  
    Just temporarily.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m with you.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So, Amy, what an absolute pleasure it has been to talk to you.

  - amy tan  
    Oh, really nice talking to you too. It’s such a pleasure to talk
    about these things that we’re feeling, that we’re sharing, just to
    have the companionship of feeling. We’re not together, but we are.
    They’re thoughts or feelings that have been in me, but when somebody
    gives you a vehicle for letting it come out, it’s always a wonderful
    outlet, a purge.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. Thank you, my dear.

  - amy tan  
    OK.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Lovely talking to you.

  - amy tan  
    All right.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye, bye.

  - amy tan  
    Bye, bye.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Amy Tan. I fell in love with her a long
    time ago, when her first book “The Joy Luck Club” came out. I read
    it right away, in 1989, and I was utterly astonished and astounded
    by the lives she wrote about in those pages. And especially the
    dynamics between the mother and the daughter in that book really
    moved me deeply. Amy Tan is also the author of “The Valley of
    Amazement,” “The Kitchen God’s Wife,” and other books. Most
    recently, she wrote a memoir called “Where the Past Begins.” It’s
    about her life as a writer and also about her family history and how
    it has been brought to bear on her life. I’m going to give her a
    call.

  - \[music\]

  - \[line ringing\]

  - amy tan  
    Hello?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Amy?

  - amy tan  
    Yes?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, this is Cheryl.

  - amy tan  
    Hi. Hi, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, it’s so nice to hear your voice.

  - amy tan  
    Good to hear you too.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So where are you right now? Where am I calling you?

  - amy tan  
    You are calling me in my home in Sausalito.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So you’re socially isolating with your husband, is that right, your
    husband Lou?

  - amy tan  
    My husband, yes. My husband and two dogs, we are in this house. I
    feel very, very lucky actually to be here in this particular house,
    which I actually built, with the idea that one day we’d be old and
    not be able to go out, and what would I need to feel like it was OK
    to be sequestered in a way from the world.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And what did that turn out to be? What is your house like? And what
    can you see from your windows?

  - amy tan  
    It’s like a treehouse, and it’s surrounded by oak trees, and windows
    all on three sides of this great room that I’m sitting in.
    Everything is ADA compliant, so if I would be in a wheelchair, I
    could go anywhere. The bathrooms are all sliding doors. The entries
    outside. So it’s all set up for getting old, and I hope I get old.
    But what I see, I see oak trees. But the main thing I see is Angel
    Island. Which is, I see the bay. I see San Francisco Bay, Raccoon
    Strait, Sausalito Harbor, but in the middle of all that is Angel
    Island. Do you know what Angel Island is? Do you know its history?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I want to say that there — was it a place where immigrants came. Is
    that right?

  - amy tan  
    Yes, in particular Chinese people. It was a quarantine station. I
    just think it’s so ironic in a terrible way that this is the symbol
    that I’m looking at daily is the quarantine where people did not
    know when they would get out of this place and what the future would
    be and if they would be sent back. So great uncertainty and
    unhappiness there.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And when was that in existence? What years?

  - amy tan  
    That was, I think it was like 1910 until 1940 or so. The dates are
    approximate. But I used to live in the house that’s next to the
    current one that we have, and that was built in 1908. And I would
    look at the house and think, the woman who lived in this house in
    1908 would look at that island, and that’s where all these Chinese
    people were imprisoned really, and that I was the person now looking
    at this island, and I was the Chinese woman looking at it. So I had
    a great deal of connection between me and what I was seeing, a great
    deal of gratitude that I was on the other side of that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Your parents both immigrated from China in the ‘40s, is that
    correct?

  - amy tan  
    Yes, ‘47 for my father and ‘49 for my mother.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And where did they come when — how did they arrive to the United
    States?

  - amy tan  
    My father came by boat, and my mother flew on Philippine Airlines.
    She had to take a boat from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then
    eventually she flew. She couldn’t wait for the boat. She wanted to
    be reunited with my father. And they were in San Francisco, and by
    then there was no quarantine station. But they came on student
    visas, which then lapsed, and then they became illegal. So they
    faced deportation for about 10 years.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And then finally were able to become U.S. citizens?

  - amy tan  
    Yes. Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And how were they able to become citizens?

  - amy tan  
    Eventually, they got, I think, a kind of residency. And I just
    remember that when I was about — it was around 1962 or so, and I
    remember being at home and my parents were crying, and they had just
    come back from being sworn in as American citizens. And I couldn’t
    appreciate that. It was like, oh, big deal, they went and took a
    test, and now they’re citizens. So what, you know? I had no idea
    that for all those years, they had been facing this terrible
    uncertainty. Because we were kids, we were born here, we’re
    Americans. We didn’t know any different. We didn’t know anything
    about China.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Obviously, your work has been so deeply about your past and
    your family’s history. And I guess I’m curious. I know you became a
    writer, with “The Joy Luck Club” being published when you were in
    your 30s, you were kind of surprised essentially to become a
    novelist?

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was a short story writer. Somebody else called
    it a novel. It was a series of short stories really.

  - cheryl strayed  
    You’re right. I always forget that. It’s that the stories in “The
    Joy Luck Club” sit together so beautifully, it reads to me like a
    novel. What I was so moved by is really at the heart of that book is
    that mother-daughter bond. And I’m curious, how did you come to
    write about that mother and daughter, and what did your real mother
    make of it when she read the book when the book came out?

  - amy tan  
    I was writing this at a time when I was not really that close to my
    mother. It was more of a detente or more of an avoidance of
    situations that might inflame both of us. And when I started to
    write, these stories just naturally came out when I began writing
    about a girl, then suddenly her mother injected herself into the
    story. And I began to see how much of who I was had been formed by
    my — whatever I had absorbed from my mother, but also how I had
    reacted, rebelled against her. So I started writing this, and
    ironically, the voices that were the easiest to me were the mothers.
    And I realized how much I really had paid attention, and I was
    trying to figure out what these mothers — my mother’s intention had
    been, especially in telling these stories about the past that I
    always thought were so boring. Or you know I’d say, you’ve told me
    that already, which was the wrong thing to say to her. If I said
    that to her, she’d just go into a fury and then threaten to kill
    herself. So I had to be very careful and just kind of tune out and
    just, yeah, yeah, mm-hm.

  - cheryl strayed  
    If you said, mom, you already told me that story, she would threaten
    to kill herself?

  - amy tan  
    Often, if there was anything that made her feel that she was
    unappreciated or that I’d rather she not be there at that particular
    moment, yes, it would lead to a suicide threat and occasionally
    suicide attempts. And so that was something I grew up with, which
    shaped me a great deal. Not that I’m suicidal, but in looking at
    what it was that made my mother feel suicidal, that she had a kind
    of helplessness, a loneliness, an inability to control what was
    happening in her life. She got that from her mother, who did kill
    herself, and her mother killed herself because she was forced to
    become a concubine after she was widowed. And she was widowed when
    her husband, my grandfather, died during the pandemic in 1919.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right, the Spanish influenza pandemic.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And this was in Shanghai? They were in Shanghai when —

  - amy tan  
    Yes. Yes, in Shanghai. For the reason that I’m writing, which is to
    understand this transference, this inheritance of emotion over
    generations. Your reactions, the way you think about the world, your
    philosophy, your cosmology of how you view things, how the universe
    operates and how you operate within that world, that came from, I
    think in many ways, from the pandemic, which changed the direction
    of our family’s life. And so that suicide came out of that, and my
    mother, being the suicidal child who watched her mother die at age
    9, was the mother I ended up with, who guided me to who I am today
    and how I react to things.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I love thinking about the ways that our mothers, the ways they
    shaped us not just as humans, but as writers, and I’m really struck
    by what you said about your mom, about her helplessness. And I do
    think that when you’re angry and you threaten somebody with your
    suicide, that is a way of really expressing a profound helplessness.
    And yet, I think of your mom and everything you’ve said about her or
    written about her, she was such a resilient person. She was such a
    survivor, right?

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. Yeah, it was a great contradiction that she could go through
    anything, and yet there would be the smallest thing that would make
    her feel annihilated. But you’re right, she had such fortitude, such
    resilience, but it came across in ways that really made me want to
    not be like her. I mean, one of her things is she constantly
    worried, and she would try to find the reasons why something
    happened. And if she could find the reason, then she couldn’t do it.
    But at the same time, she could handle the reality of what was going
    on and just be strong and push through and tell people she wasn’t
    taking this. And she had very strong opinions, very strong ethics.
    She would become livid if anybody was condescending to her, and she
    couldn’t always fight back and say, don’t you dare treat me that
    way, because she was a Chinese woman who didn’t speak English very
    well. And people would treat her in this way, patronizing,
    condescending way, but that would make her livid. And that’s
    something she passed on to me. I get a just immediate reaction where
    I explode if somebody is treating me in a patronizing way.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. It’s so amazing to me the ways that we carry our mothers
    within us, positive and negative. My mom died when she was 45.

  - amy tan  
    So young.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yes. You know, Amy, I feel connected to you. I’ve never met you, but
    part of you is embedded in part of me because — I’m going to cry —
    because “The Joy Luck Club” was one of the last books that my mom
    and I read together.

  - amy tan  
    Oh —

  - cheryl strayed  
    And —

  - amy tan  
    — God.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — we both loved it so much. And it was — I had a really different
    kind of relationship with my mom than the one you had with yours,
    but there was a language, there was something that you gave us that
    allowed us to talk even more fully about our relationship. And it
    was you, your book, “The Joy Luck Club” opened up that dialogue in
    the last year of my mom’s life. I remember —

  - amy tan  
    Wow.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — so your book came out two years before my mom died, and then the
    movie of it came out two years after she died. And I remember
    sitting in the theater watching it alone, and I remember just crying
    and thinking, I wish — my mother should be here with me.

  - amy tan  
    Oh. Oh, well, that makes me cry to hear that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m sorry, I’m not supposed to —

  - amy tan  
    Thank you for telling me. No, no, it’s a good thing. It’s good when
    you’re moved to tears.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m not supposed to cry, but.

  - amy tan  
    No.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I know you have also experienced deep grief. Your brother Peter and
    your father John both died in 1968, when you were 15, and they died
    of the same thing.

  - amy tan  
    Yes.
    
    It was — it actually started in ‘67 and ended — it was exactly one
    year, February to February. My brother first became ill. My older
    brother, who I adored.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And how old was he at the time?

  - amy tan  
    He died just about a week before he turned 17, and he had a brain
    tumor, a kind of brain tumor that would today be curable. And two
    weeks before he died, my father was diagnosed with glioblastoma, and
    then he died six months later. So it was one solid year. There was
    no break whatsoever, February to February, of this specter of doom,
    but also a need to pretend that everything was OK and a miracle
    would happen. And the pretense is what I hated, the, what I consider
    to be the false hope at the time, and that is something I write a
    lot about. I want to understand this notion, and is there anything
    in the way of hopelessness or futile hope? And I’ve come away
    thinking, no, hope is a very, very important part of this that we
    have to really safeguard. We have to keep that because that is part
    of what gives us fortitude. And it could be the most impossible
    situation, but for you to see a future, you have to cling to that.
    And I feel that very strongly.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And yet, when you were a kid and your family was facing this
    horrific couple of years, you resented that sense that there should
    be hope?

  - amy tan  
    Oh, yeah. It made me angry because I felt that it was a betrayal,
    especially after my brother died, that the miracle didn’t happen and
    they were still going through this. My father was a Baptist
    minister. He was an engineer, but he was also a Baptist minister. So
    this religious component was part of it. If we were good enough, if
    we prayed hard enough, the miracle would happen. And it didn’t
    happen, so it was either that I didn’t get the reward or I was not
    good enough. And it made me cynical, which is a terrible thing to
    have happen when you’re a young person. I don’t know when cynicism
    comes into a child’s life, when they first recognize it in
    themselves, but I certainly felt it when I was 14 and 15.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm-hm. And when your family, really almost half of your family died.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah, and what I thought was the best half of the family because I
    loved my brother and my father. I was a daddy’s girl, and he was
    supposed to protect me from my mother, and he left. And then I was
    angry at my father because he abandoned me by dying.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. I’m curious, that experience that you had — we’re seeing the
    numbers every day climb of the people around the globe who have died
    of Covid-19. And I’m curious if knowing that so many people are
    grieving the loss of loved ones, if that’s made you at all remember
    or think about what you experienced as a young woman when suddenly
    you lost people in your life?

  - amy tan  
    Yeah. I think more than anything, it’s not simply the grief, it’s
    not knowing. Not knowing when this is going to end. During the time
    my father and brother were dying, my mother made us feel it was a
    curse and we would all die. So we were waiting for something worse,
    even worse to happen, and the worst that happened was my mother went
    crazy, to use a very non-psychiatric term. So I think it’s that
    uncertainty and the feeling of something impending that is worse
    than what is presently happening. And each day, we are overwhelmed
    by news, the numbers. It’s a crescendo of these numbers, and it just
    doesn’t stop. And it starts with this incredulity. People wake up in
    the morning and say, it was just a bad dream. And then you’re
    incredulous to find, no, it’s real. And each day, that momentary
    sense of disbelief, I think, overtakes a lot of us, and then we
    settle into it and say, oh my God, when is this going to stop? And
    all these people are giving us information, and who’s telling the
    truth or who knows the truth? Nobody could possibly know. This has
    never happened before with this particular disease. So I think that
    uncertainty combined with losses, and not for me — it’s not so much
    that I fear dying for myself, I fear it for my husband. We’ve been
    together for 50 years, and I don’t know what I would do if something
    happened to him.
    
    My fear for friends who have certain conditions that would make them
    very vulnerable, besides age. I have lost one friend who,
    ironically, tragically, was the person who wrote the textbook on
    pulmonary disease, and he died from Covid-19.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, I’m so sorry.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    What was his name?

  - amy tan  
    John Murray. His wife is Diane Johnson, the novelist. I don’t know
    if you’ve heard of her.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah.

  - amy tan  
    So we’ve been friends for about 30-some years, and so it was very,
    very sad.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So we’re afraid of our friends dying. You also mentioned you’re
    afraid of your husband Lou dying. I’m wondering what you’re doing to
    manage that feeling that you describe so well, which I do think is
    very much like grief, that you wake up, you forget for a moment
    what’s true, and then you remember the truth. And I remember this
    over and over in the first year or so after my mom died, that I
    would wake up — there was something kind of safe about the dream
    life, and I’d wake up and think, oh, she’s dead. And you’re right,
    this is exactly what I’ve thought during the pandemic. And it’s
    because the world — I always say, when you lose somebody who is
    essential to you, the world as you know it ends, and you have to
    figure out how to live in the new world without that person. And
    here we are in the pandemic, that the world as we knew it has ended.
    And so how are you navigating in the new world?

  - amy tan  
    I have anxiety like everybody else, and it comes as a sense of
    breathlessness. I don’t really know it in my head until I feel it in
    my body, and I say, why do I feel I can’t breathe? And I know I
    don’t have Covid-19, but I just think, what’s going on? And then I
    recognize the anxiety, and I know that what it would be is suddenly
    this affecting us and Lou getting sick and what would I do and
    losing him. So what I do that is different from my mother is not
    worry about — not focus on, how did this happen, where does this
    come from? Is to be super prepared. I am known among my friends as
    Debbie Downer. I’m the person who gets prepared for every single
    disaster. I have a shed full of stuff for earthquakes. I have things
    for —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Really?

  - amy tan  
    I have shelves with grab bags to go, with everything you need for a
    wildfire. So when this pandemic first started, I went and gathered a
    lot of the stuff I already had, which included masks. I have
    goggles. I have sterilizing things, UV water purifiers, all of that
    kind of stuff, gloves. I already had that stuff, and then I added to
    that. And then I know that something could happen, but I would have
    control, some degree of control.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Some degree of control.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah, some degree of control. I can’t control everything, but I
    won’t fall to pieces. I have a little box that has everything, and
    I know I go there, I have procedure, so I can be methodical.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It is such a fine line, isn’t it, between your friends kind of
    making fun of you because you have all this stuff, and yet it’s
    actually kind of reasonable. I too — I live in Portland, Oregon,
    where we’re all just waiting for this major earthquake that they
    keep saying is overdue. And for years now, I kept thinking, I have
    to buy those earthquake preparedness packs. And the first week that
    it got real in my household, I bought these 20-year bags for seven
    people. My family’s only four, but I figure we’ll help out a few
    neighbors too if we can. And I think when my kids saw this, they’re
    like, mom, you’re kind of weird. But the thing is, I wasn’t trying
    to alarm anyone. I’m trying to be prepared. But —

  - amy tan  
    How can — I don’t know why people would deny that. It’s this
    superstitious mentality of, if you do it, it’s going to happen.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, and that’s, I want to go back to — this is something that I
    really am curious about, because when your brother and father died
    in the late ‘60s, we just had such a different culture of the ways
    that we talk about death, a very different culture of grief. I mean,
    that it was this topic that was to be avoided. And I’m curious, here
    you are, my heart breaks for you, Amy, this teenage girl. You’ve
    lost your big brother, your father. I’m sure you were also maybe
    afraid that you too might get sick and die, all of those things. And
    I’m curious, so many people out there right now are having to face
    these big losses and having to grieve, and I know a lot of people
    around them are wondering, what do I say? How do I address this
    sorrow, this monumental sorrow? And I’m curious, what do you wish
    people did or said to you during your time of greatest need and loss
    and sorrow?

  - amy tan  
    Well, you have to keep in mind I was very young. I mean, I was a
    teenager, and I wanted to have a normal life. I wanted to be asked
    out on a date. I’d never been asked out on a date. I wanted to have
    that life and to escape. And I think about that with a lot of the
    kids today, and that I want to say, I understand if you want to
    escape, that you want to leave the house, or you just want to take
    your mind out of this. You don’t want to be with family. You don’t
    want to be supportive. You want somebody to say to you, that’s fine
    the way that you feel, that’s natural. That’s what I would have
    wanted. I’m sure there are a lot of people out there who do that for
    their kids. But I think parents, adults are so overwhelmed by what’s
    happening, they may be demanding more things from their kids, that
    they behave better, that they — and you know what happens is you
    behave worse. Instead of making things easier for your family, you
    make it harder because you resent it. You’re scared, and you can’t
    express that because you’re a teenager, and nothing scares you, so
    to speak. And I wanted to just have somebody say, I know why you’re
    angry. I needed some understanding. There was a complication on top
    of that is that a few days or a week or two before my father died, I
    was caught reading a dirty book, “Catcher in the Rye,” and —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, my goodness.

  - amy tan  
    — a banned book. So the youth minister came to counsel me, and he
    sexually molested me. He threw me down on my bed and sexually
    molested me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Amy.

  - amy tan  
    So that day, it was — before the miracle busted up, exploded in our
    faces, that was already gone. The whole idea that religion and
    people and praying together and community, that was gone too. I came
    out of that room a different person.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Amy.

  - amy tan  
    And ultimately — no, no — ultimately, I’m glad because what it
    taught me is that I have to ask my own questions. I have to say,
    what is it that I really feel? What’s hypocritical? What’s truly not
    kindness and being a good person?
    
    And so I ask those questions myself. It doesn’t get dictated to me
    in the way that it used to because the spokespeople for what is good
    and evil are not necessarily coming from the best sources. So I
    learned that. You don’t take dictation, you find the truth.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, and you have to be awake to it. I think we share that
    experience too. I’ve been sexually abused. And I think that, for me,
    the most meaningful act probably in my life has been that move that
    you just described. Where you take an awful thing that happened to
    you, the death of an essential person in your life who you love or a
    sexual violation, you take that really, really ugly thing and make
    it, in some ways, beautiful. You make it not disempower you, but be
    the place, the source of your power. Adrienne Rich talks about our
    wounds being the source of our greatest power. I really believe
    that.

  - amy tan  
    I want to just interject something here. I was talking to a friend,
    a psychiatrist, about people who go through terrible things and they
    have that with them the rest of their lives, and it makes them a
    little dysfunctional or greatly dysfunctional. And I wouldn’t want
    people to feel guilty that they weren’t able to find their strength
    when a terrible thing happened to them or a series of terrible
    things. So I just say that because there are a lot of people going
    through terrible stuff right now, and maybe they’re not going to be
    able to come out and say, I’m resilient. Maybe they’re just going to
    fall apart. And I just want to say, that’s good, lift your hand and
    ask for help.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And I think, too, one of the things about resilience that I’ve
    observed in my own life and so many people who I admire is that
    resilience doesn’t necessarily happen the next day, right? Sometimes
    you have to wander around in the darkness for a decade, for two
    decades. I mean, anyone who’s ever recovered from a long addiction
    or changed their lives in these radically essential ways knows this
    to be true. So it’s also never too late to —

  - amy tan  
    Exactly, yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — find that strength.

  - amy tan  
    Mm-hm. It’s there, it’s rooted, and it can come out, and you know,
    it can surprise you. I wonder about so many people and how they’re
    going to deal with this, and that becomes part of the thing that
    makes me anxious, that what’s going to happen to this world? Because
    I’m going to come out OK. My life now is not a lot different from
    what it has been as a writer. But what about these people in these
    tiny places who are going to lose those tiny places? What’s going to
    happen to them? So I think part of it is to feel you can’t do
    anything, but I think it’s important to feel compassion, to
    empathize as much as you can, which is what I think we do as fiction
    writers. It’s our practice to do that. Imagination I think, is the
    closest thing we have to compassion.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, yeah. You wrote something really beautiful that I wrote down in
    my notebook in your memoir, “Where the Past Begins.” You said that
    Jane Eyre taught you that loneliness had more to do with being
    misunderstood than being alone. And I think it’s a wonderful example
    of what you’re saying, that as memoirists, fiction writers, as
    writers, it’s not about delivering the message to everyone that
    would be the one wise thing, but making people feel seen and
    recognized. I’m curious, I asked you to read something to me, and
    can I ask you to share the poem?

  - amy tan  
    Now, the poem that I’ve chosen has to do with the fact that as
    writers, I think that, for many of us, what draws us to writing is
    to come up with a way to express the exact feeling at the exact
    moment, and that when somebody reads that, they say, that’s how it
    is for me. And that’s what this poem is about. This poem was written
    by my editor, who’s also my publisher and is also a renowned poet,
    Dan Halpern. He wrote this five years ago. He didn’t remember
    writing it, but he knew that he must’ve written it because it was
    published in Poetry about five years ago.

  - cheryl strayed  
    He doesn’t remember writing it?

  - amy tan  
    He doesn’t remember, and it is so prescient.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s funny. So, yeah, it’s prescient. It’s called
    “Pandemania,” right?

  - amy tan  
    “Pandemania.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    By Daniel Halpern.

  - amy tan  
    Daniel Halpern. Here it is.
    
    “There are fewer introductions in plague years, hands held back,
    jocularity no longer bellicose, even among men. Breathing’s
    generally wary, labored, as they say, when the end is at hand. But
    this is the everyday intake of the imperceptible life force willed
    now, slow. Well, just cautious in inhabited air. As for ongoing
    dialogue, no longer an exuberant plosive to make a point, but a new
    squirreling of airspace, a new sense of boundary.
    
    “Genghis Khan said the hand is the first thing one man gives to
    another. Not in this war. A gesture of limited distance now
    suffices, a nod, a minor smile or a hand slightly raised, not in
    search of its counterpart, just a warning within the acknowledgment
    to stand back. Each beautiful stranger a barbarian breathing on the
    other side of the gate.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    Amy, what a perfect poem for this moment.

  - amy tan  
    I know.

  - cheryl strayed  
    This is honestly my life. I walk around Northeast Portland and I
    greet people with a seeming sense of pleasantry from a distance, but
    I think, barbarian, stay on the other side of that gate.

  - amy tan  
    You’re infected. Are you infected? Or, why aren’t you wearing a
    mask? Or why are you too close to me?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Do you walk around your neighborhood? Are you having this same
    experience?

  - amy tan  
    I’ve done it twice. But we see people running by, no masks, too
    close, coming by too close to us, and I think it’s impolite. I think
    it’s hostile. So there’s a new separateness that has come up among
    strangers.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And that actually scares me, that dynamic, because I sense in
    myself sometimes that building sense of not just fear, but almost
    this — Daniel in this poem, he even says, he mentions this term war.
    It’s you against me, and you stay in your breath space and I’ll stay
    in mine. And I can’t help but fear what’s already gone on so much
    over the last many years and probably through all of history, but
    especially in the last few years this anti-immigrant sentiment —

  - amy tan  
    Oh my God, yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    — the attacks against many Asian-Americans in the U.S.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah, especially now. Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And, right, even our president calling it the Chinese virus. And I’m
    afraid about that dynamic of this.

  - amy tan  
    And I just want to say this thing about Chinese virus. Some people
    say, well, we called it Ebola. Ebola River is where Ebola was.
    Ebolese, they’re not people. You’re not saying the “Ebolese.”
    Chinese is a race. Chinese is not a location. Chinese live
    throughout the world, including the United States, people who were
    born in this country. And he has made it a race card, and that’s
    what angers me so much in how they have renamed this virus. They
    have made it race, not location. So the thing about with people who
    go running by without a mask, it’s not ignorance because I have read
    online the hostile remarks. It’s like, you don’t tell us what to do,
    we don’t have to wear that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. Yeah, I’ve seen it. I just try to assume — my nature is just
    to assume goodwill. I don’t, I never believe that the barbarians are
    at the gate, and maybe that’s just because I’m an idiot. But I
    always want to assume the good in people, so —

  - amy tan  
    Well, the barbarians are within. I mean —

  - cheryl strayed  
    We are the barbarians at the gate.

  - amy tan  
    — we are barbarians, all of us are barbarians.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, one runner without a mask to screw it all up. Yeah, no, I’m
    with you, sister.

  - amy tan  
    Just temporarily.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m with you.

  - amy tan  
    Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So, Amy, what an absolute pleasure it has been to talk to you.

  - amy tan  
    Oh, really nice talking to you too. It’s such a pleasure to talk
    about these things that we’re feeling, that we’re sharing, just to
    have the companionship of feeling. We’re not together, but we are.
    They’re thoughts or feelings that have been in me, but when somebody
    gives you a vehicle for letting it come out, it’s always a wonderful
    outlet, a purge.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. Thank you, my dear.

  - amy tan  
    OK.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Lovely talking to you.

  - amy tan  
    All right.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye, bye.

  - amy tan  
    Bye, bye.
