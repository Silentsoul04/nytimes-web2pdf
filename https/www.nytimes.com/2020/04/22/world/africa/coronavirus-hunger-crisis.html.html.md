# ‘Instead of Coronavirus, the Hunger Will Kill Us.’ A Global Food Crisis Looms.

The world has never faced a hunger emergency like this, experts say. It
could double the number of people facing acute hunger to 265 million by
the end of this year.

NAIROBI, Kenya — In the largest slum in Kenya’s capital, people
desperate to eat set off a stampede during a recent giveaway of flour
and cooking oil, leaving scores injured and two people dead.

In India, thousands of workers are lining up twice a day for bread and
fried vegetables to keep
[hunger](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/us/politics/coronavirus-hunger-food-stamps.html)
at bay.

And across Colombia, poor households are hanging red clothing and flags
from their windows and balconies as a sign that they are hungry.

“We don’t have any money, and now we need to survive,” said Pauline
Karushi, who lost her job at a jewelry business in Nairobi, and lives in
two rooms with her child and four other relatives. “That means not
eating much.”

The coronavirus has sometimes been called an equalizer because it has
sickened both rich and poor, but when it comes to food, the commonality
ends. It is poor people, including large segments of poorer nations, who
are now going hungry and facing the prospect of starving.

“The coronavirus has been anything but a great equalizer,” said Asha
Jaffar, a volunteer who brought food to families in the Nairobi slum of
Kibera after the fatal stampede. “It’s been the great revealer, pulling
the curtain back on the class divide and exposing how deeply unequal
this country is.”

Already, 135 million people [had been facing acute food
shortages](https://www.fsinplatform.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/GRFC_2020_ONLINE_200420.pdf),
but now with the pandemic, 130 million more could go hungry in 2020,
said Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Program, a United
Nations agency. Altogether, an estimated 265 million people could be
pushed to the brink of starvation by year’s end.

“We’ve never seen anything like this before,” Mr. Husain said. “It

unprecedented and uncharted
territory.”

The world has experienced severe hunger crises before, but those were
regional and caused by one factor or another — extreme weather, economic
downturns, wars or political
instability.

This hunger crisis, experts say, is global and caused by a multitude of
factors linked to the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing interruption
of the economic order: the sudden loss in income for countless millions
who were already living hand-to-mouth; the collapse in oil prices;
widespread shortages of hard currency from tourism drying up; overseas
workers not having earnings to send home; and ongoing problems like
climate change, violence, population dislocations and humanitarian
disasters.

Already, from Honduras to South Africa to India, protests and
[looting](https://twitter.com/IOL/status/1252255761951895552?s=20) have
broken out amid frustrations from lockdowns and worries about hunger.
With classes shut down, over 368 million children [have
lost](https://cdn.wfp.org/2020/school-feeding-map/index.html) the
nutritious meals and snacks they normally receive in school.

There is no shortage of food globally, or mass starvation from the
pandemic — yet. But logistical problems in planting, harvesting and
transporting food will leave poor countries exposed in the coming
months, especially those reliant on imports, said Johan Swinnen,
director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute in
Washington.

While the system of food distribution and retailing in rich nations is
organized and automated, he said, systems in developing countries are
“labor intensive,” making “these supply chains much more vulnerable to
Covid-19 and social distancing regulations.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet even if there is no major surge in food prices, the food security
situation for poor people is likely to deteriorate significantly
worldwide. This is especially true for economies like Sudan and Zimbabwe
that were struggling before the outbreak, or those like Iran that have
increasingly used oil revenues to finance critical goods like food and
medicine.

In Venezuela, the pandemic could deal a devastating blow to millions
already living in [the world’s largest economic collapse outside
wartime](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/venezuela-economy.html).

In the sprawling Petare slum on the outskirts of the capital, Caracas, a
nationwide lockdown has left Freddy Bastardo and five others in his
household without jobs. Their government-supplied rations, which had
arrived only once every two months before the crisis, have long run out.

“We are already thinking of selling things that we don’t use in the
house to be able to eat,” said Mr. Bastardo, 25, a security guard. “I
have neighbors who don’t have food, and I’m worried that if protests
start, we wouldn’t be able to get out of here.”

Uncertainty over food is also building in India, where daily-wage
workers with little or no social safety net face a future where [hunger
is a more immediate threat than the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/asia/coronavirus-india-lockdown.html).

As wages have dried up, half a million people are estimated to have left
cities to walk home, setting off the nation’s “largest mass migration
since independence,” said Amitabh Behar, the chief executive of Oxfam
India.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On a recent evening, hundreds of migrant workers, who have been stuck in
New Delhi after a lockdown was imposed in March with little warning, sat
under the shade of a bridge waiting for food to arrive. The Delhi
government has set up soup kitchens, yet workers like Nihal Singh go
hungry as the throngs at these centers have increased in recent days.

“Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us,” said Mr. Singh, who
was hoping to eat his first meal in a day. Migrants waiting in food
lines have fought each other over a plate of rice and lentils. Mr. Singh
said he was ashamed to beg for food but had no other
option.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Refugees and people living in conflict zones are likely to be hit the
hardest.

The curfews and restrictions on movement are already devastating the
meager incomes of displaced people in Uganda and Ethiopia, the delivery
of seeds and farming tools in South Sudan and the distribution of food
aid in the Central African Republic. Containment measures in Niger,
which hosts almost 60,000 refugees fleeing conflict in Mali, have led to
surges in the pricing of food, according to the International Rescue
Committee.

The effects of the restrictions “may cause more suffering than the
disease itself,” said Kurt Tjossem, regional vice president for East
Africa at the International Rescue Committee.

Ahmad Bayoush, a construction worker who had been displaced to Idlib
Province in northern Syria, said he and many others had signed up to
receive food from aid groups, but that it had yet to arrive.

“I am expecting real hunger if it continues like this in the north,” he
said.

The pandemic is also slowing efforts to deal with [the historic locust
plague](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/africa/locusts-kenya-east-africa.html)
that has been ravaging the East and Horn of Africa. The outbreak is the
worst the region has seen in decades and comes on the heels of a year
marked by extreme droughts and floods. But the arrival of billions of
[new swarms](http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html)
could further deepen food insecurity, said Cyril Ferrand, head of the
Food and Agriculture Organization’s resilience team in eastern Africa.

Travel bans and airport closures, Mr. Ferrand said, are interrupting the
supply of pesticides that could help limit the locust population and
save pastureland and
crops.

As many go hungry, there is concern in a number of countries that food
shortages will lead to social discord. In Colombia, residents of the
coastal state of La Guajira have begun blocking roads to call attention
to their need for food. In South Africa, rioters have broken into
neighborhood food kiosks and [faced off with the
police](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/southern-africa-government-intervention-required-as-millions-face-hunger-under-covid19-lockdown-regimes/).

And even charitable food giveaways can expose people to the virus when
throngs appear, as happened in Nairobi’s shantytown of Kibera earlier
this month.

“People called each other and came rushing,” said Valentine Akinyi, who
works at the district government office where the food was distributed.
“People have lost jobs. It showed you how hungry they are.”

To assuage the impact of this crisis, some governments are [fixing
prices on food
items](https://twitter.com/RwandaTrade/status/1241672944461451264),
delivering free food and putting in place [plans to send money
transfers](https://www.president.go.ke/2020/03/25/presidential-address-on-the-state-interventions-to-cushion-kenyans-against-economic-effects-of-covid-19-pandemic-on-25th-march-2020/)
to the poorest households.

Yet communities across the world are also taking matters into their own
hands. Some are [raising
money](https://secure.changa.co.ke/myweb/share/39216) through
crowdfunding platforms, while others have begun programs to[buy
meals](https://www.rappi.com.co/tienda/menu-solidario) for needy
families.

On a recent afternoon, Ms. Jaffar and a group of volunteers made their
way through Kibera, bringing items like sugar, flour, rice and sanitary
pads to dozens of families. A native of the area herself, Ms. Jaffar
said she started the food drive after hearing so many stories from
families who said they and their children were going to sleep hungry.

The food drive has so far reached 500 families. But with all the calls
for assistance she’s getting, she said, “that’s a drop in the ocean.”
