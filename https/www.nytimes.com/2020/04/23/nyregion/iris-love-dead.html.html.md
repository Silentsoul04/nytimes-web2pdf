*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

She was Indiana Jones in a miniskirt, a celebrity archaeologist hatched
out of old New York aristocracy. Iris Love, art historian, champion dog
breeder and the longtime romantic partner of the gossip columnist [Liz
Smith](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/arts/liz-smith-dead.html), was
just as comfortable in the ancient world as in the society pages.

Ms. Love died of the novel coronavirus on April 17 at
NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, a
friend, Carri Lyon, said. She was 86.

Sunburned, leggy and with a mop of cropped blonde hair, Ms. Love was
catnip to the press. When, in 1971, [The New York Times wrote about
her](https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/07/archives/an-archeological-find-named-iris-love-archeological-find.html)for
the third time, she was 38 and several years into what would become an
11-year dig at Knidos, an ancient Greek city that is now part of Turkey.
There she discovered a temple to Aphrodite on the same summer day in
1969 that Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“A previous reporter from a woman’s magazine has been disappointed to
learn that Miss Love can’t wear skin creams at Knidos because the dust
would cling to her face,” the Times reporter wrote on a visit to her
Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan. “A grocery carton bulging with
the week’s fan mail occupies the center of the carpet like an icon.”

Ms. Love had already made headlines when she was a graduate student at
the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, for outing as forgeries
a prized group of Etruscan warriors at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
She made headlines again when, on a visit to the British Museum’s
collection of antiquities, she identified a crumbling marble head
stashed in its basement as being a remnant of Praxiteles’ lost statue of
Aphrodite.

Neither storied institution was pleased. Chalk it up perhaps to the
sexism of the time, and the parochialism of her field. Also, though she
had completed the course work for a doctorate, Ms. Love never wrote a
thesis, and as The New Yorker [noted in a profile of her
in 1978](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1978/07/17/the-dig-at-cnidus),
her degree-less status further irritated jealous peers, who had derided
her for her skill at fund-raising, not to mention her gender.

“Amazons,” one archaeologist scoffed, referring to Ms. Love’s mostly
female crew at Knidos. “Beautiful girls in bikinis,” said another.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Love’s Turkish workers, however, called her Mister Director.

“She had a formidable energy and enthusiasm that separated her from the
more cautious of her peers,” said Maxwell Anderson, a past curator of
the department of Greek and Roman Art at the Met. “Archaeology relies on
facts, and Iris was given to informed and colorful speculation, which
added coloratura to the discipline. She was a public intellectual in a
way that was not typical of archaeology.”

Iris Cornelia Love was born on Aug. 1, 1933, in New York City. Her
father, [Cornelius Ruxton Love
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/07/archives/c-ruxton-love-jr-of-stock-exchange.html),
was a diplomat, an investment banker employed by his father-in-law, a
collector and a descendant of Alexander Hamilton. Her mother, [Audrey B.
(Josephthal)
Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/nyregion/audrey-b-love-100-a-patron-of-the-arts.html),
was an heiress and arts patron, the daughter of Edyth Guggenheim and
Louis Josephthal, an admiral and the founder of a brokerage firm.

Her parents were remote figures, as was the custom of the time for her
demographic, but luckily she had a British governess, Katie Wray, who
happened to be a classicist. Iris learned Latin before first grade and
would grow up to be a polylinguist. She spoke Greek, French, German,
Italian and Turkish and could make her way in Mandarin, Russian and
Arabic. At her death she was studying Portuguese.

She was famously loquacious in English, too. Ms. Smith used to chastise
Ms. Love, as she noted in her memoir, “Natural Blonde” (2000): “Don’t
begin the story back when they invented language. Get to the bottom
line.”

Ms. Love attended the Brearley School in Manhattan and the Madeira
School in Virginia, where classmates taunted her for being Jewish, a
lineage she had not understood was hers until then.

She graduated from Smith College in 1955; Sylvia Plath was a classmate.
She earned a master’s degree from N.Y.U.’s Institute of Fine Arts and
had finished Ph.D. classes there, but not her thesis, because as she
often said, she was too busy with Knidos, overseeing the dig each summer
and fund-raising most winters, to write it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“She brought archaeology and ancient art to a whole new strata of
society,” Carlos Picon, an antiquities expert who was curator of Greek
and Roman art at the Met for 28 years, said in a phone interview. “She
popularized it and warmed it up, and it seemed like everybody knew her
name. You could go to the middle of the most faraway city and they would
have heard of Iris. There are enough Ph.D.s, and whether we gained
another book or not doesn’t matter in the long run. More than once Iris
helped me secure objects and funding for the
museum.”

In her memoir, Ms. Smith recalled falling for Ms. Love — “a
Givenchy-clad scientist with a name like a movie star” — at a dinner
party in 1977. She said she had been taken by Ms. Love’s guilelessness
and energy, her complete lack of interest in pop culture, her intellect
and her love of a good party.

They traveled the world together, and Ms. Love and her many dachshunds
moved into Ms. Smith’s apartment. By the late 1980s, she had begun to
breed dogs in earnest from her property in Vermont, including a number
of Westminster Kennel Club champions. She liked to name the dogs for
figures in Greek mythology, like Achilles and Tyche.

Ms. Smith was proud of her companion’s new métier, though it came with
complications. Ms. Love, always peripatetic, spent months in Italy,
often with another longtime partner, Bice Brichetto, an Italian
baroness, artist and costume designer, leaving Ms. Smith, as she wrote,
to take care of “Iris business” and the dogs. After 15 years, Ms. Smith
had had enough, she wrote, though they remained friends until Ms.
Smith’s death in 2017. Ms. Love left no immediate survivors.

“I had lovely times with Iris, who might have been a headache, but
literally never was a bore to me,” Ms. Smith wrote.

Their annual Westminster dog party at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan,
with a guest list typically exceeding 500 people, was [a canine
extravaganza](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/style/in-westminster-show-season-dogs-are-party-animals.html).
There were pate molds shaped like dachshunds, ice sculptures shaped like
fire hydrants and everyone, including the dogs, in costume. Ms. Love
appeared, variously, as Alexander Hamilton, Cleopatra and a Viking.

“She rose every morning convinced she could move the world if only she
had a lever,” Ms. Smith wrote of her
friend.
