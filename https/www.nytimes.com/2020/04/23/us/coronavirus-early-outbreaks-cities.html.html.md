By the time New York City confirmed its first case of the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html)
on March 1, thousands of
[infections](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/health/talking-coronavirus-infect.html)
were already silently spreading through the city, a hidden explosion of
a disease that many still viewed as a remote threat as the city awaited
the first signs of spring.

Hidden outbreaks were also spreading almost completely undetected in
Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle, long before testing showed
that each city had a major problem, according to a model of the
[spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html)
of the disease by researchers at Northeastern University who shared
their results with The New York Times.

Even in early February — while the world focused on China — the virus
was not only likely to be spreading in multiple American cities, but
also seeding blooms of infection elsewhere in the United States, the
researchers
found.

As political leaders grappled in February with the question of whether
the outbreak would become serious enough to order measures like school
closures and remote work, little or no systematic testing for the virus
was taking place.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Meanwhile, in the background, you have this silent chain of
transmission of thousands of people,” said Alessandro Vespignani,
director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in
Boston, who led the research team.

Modeling the spread of a disease is inherently inexact, involving
estimates of how often people come in contact and transmit the virus as
they travel, work and socialize. The model estimates all infections,
including those in people who may experience mild or no
[symptoms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/well/live/coronavirus-days-5-through-10.html)
and those that are never detected in testing.

Other disease researchers said the findings of Dr. Vespignani’s team
were broadly in line with their own analyses. The research offers the
first clear accounting of how far behind the United States was in
detecting the virus. And the findings provide a warning of what can
recur, the researchers say, if social distancing restrictions are lifted
too quickly.

Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, said last week that American health officials had been
successful in tracking the first known cases and their contacts in the
United States before the outbreak got out of control.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Through Feb. 27, this country only had 14 cases,” he said during a
briefing. “We did that isolation and that contact tracing, and it was
very successful. But then, when the virus more exploded, it got beyond
the public health capacity.”

But the new estimates of coronavirus infections are vastly higher than
those official counts.

By late February, as the world’s attention shifted to a dire outbreak in
Italy, those 14 known American cases were a tiny fraction of the
thousands of undetected infections that the researchers estimated were
spreading from person to person across this country.

And more cases may have been arriving in the United States by the day.

“Knowing the number of flights coming into New York from Italy, it was
like watching a horrible train wreck in slow motion,” said Adriana
Heguy, director of the Genome Technology Center at New York University’s
Grossman School of
Medicine.

Dr. Heguy’s team and another at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai have found through genetic analysis that the seeds of most
infections in New York came from multiple locations in Europe, rather
than directly from China.

“We weren’t testing, and if you’re not testing you don’t know,” Dr.
Heguy said. The new estimates suggesting that thousands of infections
were spreading silently in the first months of the year “don’t seem
surprising at all,” she said.

There are other signs that the outbreak was worse at an earlier point
than previously known. This week, health officials in Santa Clara
County, Calif., announced a [newly discovered coronavirus-linked
death](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/santa-clara-county-coronavirus-death.html)
on Feb. 6, weeks earlier than what had been previously thought to be the
first death caused by the virus in the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some scientists cautioned that the new report’s estimates of an
enormous, unseen wave of infections could be too high — even though
testing surveillance lagged at the time.

“Even with these corrections, it’s still on the high side — this is
higher than I would have expected,” said Dr. Donald Burke, a professor
of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of
Public Health.

Others said that the findings were in line with the fragmentary evidence
that had been available until now. Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of
biology and statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, said that
her own risk estimates and [most recent
projections](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/) reveal a
grim stealthiness of early coronavirus spread.

“By the time you see a few cases, it’s pretty certain that you already
have an outbreak underway,” Dr. Meyers said.

Dr. Vespignani’s approach models the outbreak over time based on what is
known about the virus and where it has been detected. It estimates the
spread of the disease by simulating the movements of individual people
based on where people fly, how they move around, when they go to school
and other data. By running the model under various conditions — when
schools are closed, say — his team estimates where the virus may have
spread undetected.

Unseen carriers of the disease, many of them with mild symptoms or none
at all, can still spread the virus. For that reason, by the time leaders
in many cities and states took action, it was already too late to slow
the initial
spread.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

A few cities with early outbreaks, notably Seattle, are believed to have
avoided enormous growth later by heeding the models available at the
time and taking action well ahead of the rest of the country.

“We knew the numbers we saw were just the tip of the iceberg, and that
there were much greater numbers below the surface,” Jenny A. Durkan, the
mayor of Seattle, said in an interview. “We had to
act.”

[City and state officials in New York acted more
slowly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-response-delays.html),
waiting until known cases were at a higher level to shut down schools
and issue a stay-at-home order. [Mayor Bill de Blasio was reluctant to
embrace
shutdowns](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/coronavirus-bill-de-blasio.html)
until mid-March, citing the impact they would have on vulnerable New
Yorkers.

“Even while we learn new things about this virus almost daily, one thing
remains consistent: New Yorkers were put at risk by the federal
government’s total failure to provide us with adequate testing
capability,” said the mayor’s press secretary, Freddi Goldstein.

In mid-February, a month before New York City schools were closed, New
York City and San Francisco already had more than 600 people with
unidentified infections, and Seattle, Chicago and Boston already had
more than 100 people, the findings estimate. By March 1, as New York
confirmed its first case, the numbers there may already have surpassed
10,000.

From these primary travel hubs and a few other cities, the model shows,
the disease was then spread to other locations in the United States.

Dr. Vespignani said he and his research team warned officials of the
silent spread, posting some of their early projections in mid-February.
“We were talking to officials here, and it was the same reaction we
got in Italy, in the U.K., in Spain,” Dr. Vespignani said. “They told
me, ‘OK, that’s happening on your computer, not in reality.’ Look,” he
added, “No one’s going to shut down a country based on a model.”

The virus moved under the radar swiftly in February and March, doctors
and researchers said, because few cities or states had adequate
surveillance systems in place. And testing, if it was being done at all,
was haphazard. Emergency rooms were busy preparing for the predicted
onslaught and likely missed some early virus-related deaths, and did not
have the time or tools to verify infections on the fly, experts said.

It was mid-March before teams at N.Y.U. and Mount Sinai began taking
samples for testing in New York. On Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo
announced results from antibody testing of grocery store shoppers— which
researchers warned were preliminary and could change — that suggests
[one of every
five](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html)
New Yorkers may have been infected.

The new findings from the model produce a range of possible outcomes for
when the virus may have infected 10 people in each city. In New York,
for example, the model shows that the first 10 infected people could
have been walking the streets of the city as early as the last week in
January, or as late as the middle of February. From there, the
infections in the centers of the outbreak grew exponentially.

Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle, said it
became clear in late February that “community transmission” — an
infectious outbreak — was probably silently underway in Washington after
a single test result came back positive for someone who had no symptoms.

Whatever the precise scale of the initial outbreak, that same dynamic
will accelerate once measures to mitigate the spread are relaxed without
other public health measures in place, Dr. Burke said. “When you take
away social distancing, everything will go right through the roof,” he
said.
