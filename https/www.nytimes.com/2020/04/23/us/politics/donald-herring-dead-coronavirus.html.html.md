Donald Reed Herring, the oldest brother of Senator Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts, died of Covid-19 on Tuesday in Norman, Okla. He was 86.

Ms. Warren confirmed the death on Twitter on Thursday,

“What made him extra special was his smile — quick and crooked, it
always seemed to generate its own light, one that lit up everyone around
him,” Ms. Warren wrote. “I’m grateful to the nurses and front-line staff
who took care of him, but it’s hard to know that there was no family to
hold his hand or to say ‘I love you’ one more time — and no funeral for
those of us who loved him to hold each other close.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Herring was born on June 11, 1933, to Donald and Pauline (Reed)
Herring. He was a career officer in the Air Force, reaching the rank of
lieutenant colonel, and flew combat missions in Vietnam before retiring
from the military in 1973 and starting an auto-detailing business.

In addition to Ms. Warren, he is survived by his wife, Judith Anne Hart;
two sons, John and Jeffrey; and two brothers, David and John Herring.
His first wife, Nancy, died of cancer.

Ms. Warren spoke about her brothers frequently during her presidential
campaign — often noting their military service and that two of the three
were Republicans — and they appeared prominently in one of her campaign
ads.
