# Trump’s Disinfectant Remark Raises a Question About the ‘Very Stable Genius’

President Trump’s self-assessment has been consistent.

“I’m, like, a very smart person,” he assured voters in 2016.

“A very stable genius,” he ruled two years later.

“I’m not a doctor,” he allowed on Thursday, pointing to his skull inside
the White House briefing room, “but I’m, like, a person that has a good
you-know-what.”

Mr. Trump’s performance that evening, when he [suggested that injections
of
disinfectants](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
into the human body could help combat the coronavirus, did not sound
like the work of a doctor, a genius, or a person with a good
you-know-what.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even by the turbulent standards of this president, his musings on virus
remedies have landed with uncommon force, drawing widespread
condemnation as dangerous to the health of Americans and inspiring a
near-universal alarm that many of his past remarks — whether offensive
or fear-mongering or simply untrue — did not.

## 260,000 Words, Full of Self-Praise, From Trump on the Virus

Three journalists from The New York Times reviewed more than 260,000
words spoken by President Trump during the pandemic. Here’s what we
learned.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s typical name-calling can be recast to receptive audiences as
mere “counterpunching.” His impeachment was explained away as the
dastardly opus of overreaching Democrats. It is more difficult to insist
that the man floating disinfectant injection knows what he’s doing.

The reaction has so rattled the president’s allies and advisers that he
was compelled over the weekend to [remove himself from the pandemic
briefings](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-news.html)
entirely, at least temporarily accepting two fates he loathes: giving in
to advice (from Republicans who said the appearances [did far more harm
than
good](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/politics/trump-election-briefings.html)
to his political standing) and surrendering the mass viewership he
relishes.

Some at the White House have expressed frustration that the issue has
lingered. “It bothers me that this is still in the news cycle,” Dr.
Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, told CNN on Sunday,
adding, “I worry that we don’t get the information to the American
people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was
from Thursday night.”

Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican who has been willing to speak
skeptically about Mr. Trump’s virus leadership, said on ABC’s “This
Week” on Sunday that it “does send a wrong message” when
misinformation spreads from a public official or “you just say something
that pops in your head.” Asked to explain the president’s words, Mr.
Hogan said, “You know, I can’t really explain it.”

No modern American politician can match Mr. Trump’s record of
[false](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/fact-checks) or
[illogical](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html)
statements, which has invited questions about his intelligence.
Insinuations and gaffes have trailed former President George W. Bush,
former Vice President Dan Quayle and [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
now the presumptive Democratic nominee, among many others. But Mr.
Trump’s stark pronouncement — on live television, amid a grave public
health crisis, and leaving little room for interpretation — was at once
in a class of its own and wholly consistent with a reputation for
carelessness in speech.

Still, for weeks, the president’s political team has been strikingly
explicit about its intended messaging against Mr. Biden: presenting him
as a doddering 77-year-old not up to the rigors of the office — and
setting off on the kind of whisper campaign that does not bother with
whispers.

A Trump campaign Twitter account on Saturday celebrated the anniversary
of Mr. Biden’s 2020 bid by highlighting all that he had “forgotten” as a
candidate, with corresponding video clips of momentary flubs and verbal
stumbles: “Joe Biden forgot the name of the coronavirus.” “Joe Biden
forgot the G7 was not the G8.” “Joe Biden forgot Super Tuesday was on a
Tuesday.”

On Sunday, the Trump campaign made clear that the disinfectant affair
would not disrupt its plans. “Joe Biden is often lost,” said Tim
Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, “losing his train of thought
during friendly interviews, even when he relies on written notes in
front of him.”

T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman, called this approach “a distraction
tactic — as if anything could erase the memory of the president
suggesting people drink disinfectant on national television.”

Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former Florida congressman who clashed at
times with Mr. Trump and did not vote for him, said the president’s
comments on disinfectants were likely to resonate precisely because he
was running a race premised largely on Mr. Biden’s mental capacity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Given Joe Biden’s gaffes and mistakes, I think the Trump campaign had a
strong narrative there,” he said. “At the very least, that advantage was
completely erased.”

Mr. Curbelo said a friend had suggested recently that Mr. Trump’s toxic
virus idea was “the craziest thing he ever said.”

“I said, ‘I don’t know,’” Mr. Curbelo recalled. “‘Maybe. I’d have to
look back and check.’”

This history, of course, is the argument for Democratic caution. The
list of episodes that were supposed to end Mr. Trump — the “Access
Hollywood” tape, the “very fine people” on both sides of a white
supremacist rally, insulting John McCain’s service as a prisoner of war
— is longer than most voters’ memories.

The president can register as more
[time-bending](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/us/politics/trump-news-overload.html)
than Teflon. Plenty sticks to him; it just tends to be buried quickly
enough by the next stack of outrages, limiting the exposure of any
single one.

But if most Trump admirers have long since made up their minds about
him, recent polling on his handling of the crisis does suggest some
measure of electoral risk. Governors and public health officials like
Dr. Anthony Fauci are viewed as far more trustworthy on the pandemic,
according to surveys.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

For Mr. Trump, such mockery tends to singe. Since long before his 2016
campaign, few subjects have been as meaningful to him as appraisals of
his intellect.

It is a source of perpetual obsession and manifest insecurity, former
aides say, so much so that Mr. Trump has felt the need to allude to his
brainpower regularly: tales of his academic credentials at the
University of Pennsylvania; his “natural ability” in complicated
disciplines; his connection to a “super genius” uncle, [an
engineer](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/26/us/john-trump-dies-engineer-was-78.html)
who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When Rex Tillerson, the president’s first secretary of state, was
[reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/tillerson-s-fury-trump-required-intervention-pence-n806451)
to have called Mr. Trump a “moron” in private — one of several former
senior administration officials said to have rendered equivalent
verdicts — Mr. Trump challenged him to “compare I.Q. tests.” A favorite
Trump insult on Twitter, [reserved for Mr.
Biden](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107631297076305920)
among others, is “low I.Q. individual.”

“He doesn’t want to feel like anybody is better than he is,” said
Barbara A. Res, a former executive vice president of the Trump
Organization, who recalled Mr. Trump bragging about his college grades.
“He can’t deal with that. I can see it now with the doctors, and
that’s why he dismisses them. He used to be intimidated by lawyers.
Anyone who knows more than he does makes him feel less than he is.”

Steve Schmidt, a former Republican strategist and prominent Trump
critic, said the president’s meditation on disinfectants stood apart
from a trope that Mr. Schmidt came to recognize as an adviser to
conservatives like Mr. Bush: “that the conservative candidate in the
race was also always portrayed as the dumb candidate.”

“But a caricature is distinct from a narrative,” Mr. Schmidt said. And
Mr. Trump’s reckless medical fare, he reasoned, had given adversaries a
narrative by confirming a caricature.

The president’s own [attempts at damage
control](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
have been scattershot. First, his new press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany,
accused the news media of taking Mr. Trump out of context. Shortly
afterward, he undercut her case by saying his comments had in fact been
a sarcastic prank on reporters, an explanation even some supporters
found implausible.

He left his Friday briefing on the coronavirus without taking questions.
By Saturday, when Mr. Trump tweeted that the events were “[not worth the
time &
effort](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-news.html),”
his opponents conceded this much:

The president had probably done something smart.
