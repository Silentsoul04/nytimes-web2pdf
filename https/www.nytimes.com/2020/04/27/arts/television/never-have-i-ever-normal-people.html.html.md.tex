Ever'}\label{watch-this-never-have-i-ever}}

The new Netflix series was cocreated by Mindy Kaling. Or watch another,
albeit darker, new coming-of-age story on Hulu, ``Normal People.''

\textbf{`Never Have I Ever'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Now, on
\href{https://www.netflix.com/title/80179190}{Netflix}.

This coming-of-age dramedy, created by Lang Fisher and Mindy Kaling,
centers on Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), a high schooler trying to turn
over a new leaf. Last year, her father died and she had a bout of
psychosomatic paralysis. This year, she is determined to expand her
horizons, specifically in the romance department. ``Never'' moves like a
teen comedy and has a sort of ``Mean Girls'' gloss on high school in
terms of its anthropology of teendom and its school aesthetic. But it's
rooted in a ``My So-Called Life'' realm of sincerity and candor --- in
that adolescent inability to triage, where everything is the most
important thing and being alive is humiliating.

But instead of Devi narrating à la Angela Chase, the voice over is from
the tennis player John McEnroe --- whom Devi relates to because she,
too, struggles to control her anger.

``Never'' is funny, it's distinctive, it can play ``Frasier''-style
sitcom farce or ``Jane the Virgin''-style intergenerational weeping. I
watched all 10 half-hour episodes in a sitting, and it was certainly the
best quarantine night I've had --- and the best TV night over all since
I watched Season 2 of ``Fleabag'' the night before I went on a beach
vacation with my best friend. It's a knockout. If you like ambitious
comedies and amazing vibes, watch this.

\textbf{`Normal People'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Starting Wednesday, on
\href{https://www.hulu.com/series/normal-people-57048262-2ca5-41ee-9b57-53bb9b9e1596}{Hulu}.

If you prefer your coming-of-age stories much more grounded and gray,
watch this fantastic adaptation of Sally Rooney's 2018 novel. Marianne
(Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal) are in high school in
Ireland when they meet, and they fall into a tortured romance that winds
through their college years in Dublin. They love each other terribly ---
as in a lot, but also as in they're extremely bad it --- and heartbreak
and self-recrimination abound. The show can be so austere that it feels
as if it needs your own breath to fill its lungs, which creates an
almost jarring sense of intimacy; you understand why Marianne and
Connell cling so intensely to their
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/arts/television/normal-people-hulu.html}{robust
sexual compatibility}. It's the most alive either of them ever seems.

There are 12 half-hour episodes, and they're quite intense and heavy. I
encourage you to break them up over multiple days of viewing, and if you
are feeling very wistful about a young love, maybe break it down over
even more days of viewing.
