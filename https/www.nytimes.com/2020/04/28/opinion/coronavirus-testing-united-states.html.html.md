More than 20,000 people [have
died](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) from the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/europe/germany-merkel-coronavirus-reopening.html)
in each of these European countries: France, Italy, Spain and the United
Kingdom. More than 17,000 have died in New York City.

But in
[Germany](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/europe/germany-merkel-coronavirus-reopening.html)
— which is home to more people than any one of those other European
countries and 10 times as many as New York — only about 6,000 have died.

How could that be? There are multiple reasons, but the biggest is
probably the country’s approach to testing.

As [Katrin
Bennhold](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html)
of The Times has written:

> By the time Germany recorded its first case of Covid-19 in February,
> laboratories across the country had built up a stock of test kits …
> Early and widespread testing has allowed the authorities to slow the
> spread of the pandemic by isolating known cases while they are
> infectious. It has also enabled lifesaving treatment to be
> administered in a more timely way.

Testing is the key to every effective strategy for fighting the virus.
It allows the sick to be treated effectively. It enables government
officials and hospitals to focus their resources on the areas that need
it most. And it makes sure that people who have the virus without
symptoms — and can unknowingly spread it to others — can be isolated.

The troubled response to the virus in the United States began with
testing failures, and there are still not nearly enough tests being
conducted. As [Michael Osterholm and Mark
Olshaker](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/opinion/coronavirus-testing.html)
write in a new Op-Ed: “Far too few tests are available in the United
States. Some are shoddy. Even the ones that are precise aren’t designed
to produce the kind of definitive yes-no results that people expect.”

The testing problem will need to be solved before states can return to
normal — as some are now taking early steps toward — without sparking
new outbreaks.

**For more** …

  - Scott Gottlieb, of the American Enterprise Institute: “If we can
    develop a point of care, swabable stick that gives a readable result
    in the doctor’s office it can dramatically increase screening.”

  - Shan Soe-Lin and Robert Hecht, Yale University: **** “What’s needed
    is widespread testing of people with no known symptoms … We need to
    aggressively search for asymptomatic carriers, particularly among
    people who have frequent contact with the public and among
    vulnerable populations. This includes those who are infectious but
    will never develop symptoms and those who will develop them days
    after the test.”

  - And [more
    from](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/opinion/coronavirus-testing.html)
    Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, and Olshaker, a writer:
    “Governments throughout the world and the research, medical-supply
    and clinical-lab industries must unite to vastly increase global
    production of reagents and sampling equipment. Achieving this will
    take months and require building new capacity, presumably with
    public subsidies. The time and costs involved will be considerable,
    but such an effort is the only way to test large populations for
    this infection (and for others in the future).”
