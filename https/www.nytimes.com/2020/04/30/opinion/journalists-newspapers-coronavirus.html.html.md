Local journalism was in deep trouble before the coronavirus.

The internet has taken away the main source of revenue for newspapers —
print advertisements — leading to a rapid shrinking of the industry.
Nationwide, the number of people employed in newsrooms [fell about 25
percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/20/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-dropped-by-a-quarter-since-2008/)
between 2008 and 2019, and it’s probably down more than 50 percent from
its peak.

If local papers were being replaced by digital publications covering
local news, this trend wouldn’t be a problem. But that’s not happening.
Instead, many Americans lack basic information about their communities —
like what their mayor, school board, local employers and more are doing.

The disappearance of this information has big effects. [Academic
research has
found](https://medium.com/office-of-citizen/how-we-know-journalism-is-good-for-democracy-9125e5c995fb)
that voter turnout and civic engagement tend to decline when newspapers
shrink or close. Fewer people run for office. Political corruption and
polarization rise.

“Local newspapers are basically little machines that spit out healthier
democracies,” [Joshua
Benton](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/04/when-local-newspapers-shrink-fewer-people-bother-to-run-for-mayor/),
director of the Nieman Journalism Lab, has written.

Now the virus is taking this crisis to a new level.

The rapid shrinking of the economy — at the fastest pace [since the
Great
Depression](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-recession-depression.html)
— has led to a further decline in advertising. Some newspapers that were
on the brink may not survive. And many more journalists [have been laid
off](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/business/media/news-media-coronavirus-jobs.html).
As The Washington Post’s [Margaret
Sullivan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/local-journalism-needs-a-coronavirus-stimulus-plan-too/2020/03/25/08358062-6ec6-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html)
has noted, “it’s happening around the world,” with newspapers in
Australia and Britain announcing that “they were going out of business
or suspending print publication.”

What’s the solution? In the short term, Sullivan and some media
observers have called for government stimulus money to be directed at
local news outlets, as is happening for many other industries.

Writing in The Atlantic, [Steven Waldman and Charles
Sennott](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-killing-local-news/608695/)
of Report for America offer an intriguing idea:

> The federal government can do something quite concrete right now: As
> part of its stimulus plans, it should funnel $500 million in spending
> for public-health ads through local media. The government already
> spends about $1 billion on public-service ads that promote initiatives
> such as military recruitment and census participation. The stimulus
> should add another $1 billion to support the communication of accurate
> health-related information. Some of those ads should go to
> social-media platforms and national news networks, but half should go
> to local news organizations. This is not a bailout; the government
> will be buying an effective way of getting health messages to the
> public, and could even customize the notices to specific audiences.

Long term, however, stimulus isn’t the answer. Local journalism needs a
new business model. (National journalism, by the way, [is doing
OK](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/02/the-wall-street-journal-joins-the-new-york-times-in-the-2-million-digital-subscriber-club/),
thanks in part to the growth of subscription-based journalism, at The
New York Times and elsewhere.)

My hope is that somebody will eventually find a way to make money
providing useful local information. Until then, the answer will almost
certainly need to involve philanthropy, much as philanthropy has long
supported public radio.

You’ve heard me [say this
before](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/opinion/local-journalism-news-media.html),
and it’s never been more true: If you have a local source of news that
you trust, I hope you can find a way to support it financially.

That source may still be a traditional local newspaper, which sells
subscriptions. But I know many people now live in communities where
companies like Alden Global Capital have taken over newspapers and are
bleeding them for some final profits. (See [Vanity Fair’s Joe
Pompeo](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/hedge-fund-vampire-alden-global-capital-that-bleeds-newspapers-dry-has-chicago-tribune-by-the-throat)
for more on this.)

In that case, see if your community now has a nonprofit start-up as
well, [in the mold of the Texas
Tribune](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/opinion/local-news.html).

And if you have no good local options, you may even want to think about
starting a movement to change that.

    Laslo](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-revealing-why-local-news-so-important-it-s-also-ncna1186261),
    NBC News Think:

  - Politico’s [Jack
    Shafer](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/20/dont-waste-stimulus-money-on-newspapers-197015)
    argues against stimulus for newspapers:

> It might make sense for the government to assist otherwise healthy
> companies — such as the airlines — that need a couple of months of
> breathing space from the viral shock to recover and are in a
> theoretical position to repay government loans sometime soon. But it’s
> quite another thing to fling a life buoy to a drowning swimmer who
> doesn’t have the strength to hold on. Newspapers are such a drowning
> industry. Readers have abandoned them in the tens of millions.
> Advertisers have largely abandoned them. For the most part, the virus
> isn’t causing them to sink. They’re already sunk.
> 
> In the triage of rescuing flailing firms, some sectors must be left
> dead unless we want to make permanent welfare cases out of them — and
> that’s a much different argument than a bailout. It would also be a
> grievous error to bail out papers controlled by the Alden Global
> Capital hedge fund — and other firms like them — that have made a
> practice of squeezing high profits while simultaneously cutting staff
> and escalating subscription prices.
