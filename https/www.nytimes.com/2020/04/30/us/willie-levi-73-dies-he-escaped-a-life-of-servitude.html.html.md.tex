He was one of a group of men with disabilities who worked for
substandard wages at a turkey plant but found justice. He succumbed to
the new coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

If Willie Levi had enjoyed choice in life, he would have gone back to
Texas --- back to the small city of Orange, where he had played the
spoons, sung the blues and lived in a shotgun house crowded with
cousins.

But Mr. Levi never had much choice. He was sent first to an institution
and then to Iowa, where he and other men with intellectual disabilities
worked in virtual servitude at a turkey-processing plant for decades. He
never made it back to Orange.

Mr. Levi --- a claimant in a successful lawsuit by the
\href{https://www.eeoc.gov/}{Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}
that championed proper pay and working conditions for people with
disabilities --- died on April 23 at his home in Waterloo, Iowa, after
contracting the novel coronavirus, according to Paula Passe, one of his
court-appointed guardians. He was 73.

``He was a great advocate for himself and for the men he called
`brothers,' who shared the same pain,'' said Robert A. Canino, the
E.E.O.C. lawyer who tried the case. ``Like many of the men, he was not
as indignant as he was happily determined, as though he saw the coming
of justice.''

Mr. Levi was born in Orange on Aug. 19, 1946, to Ernest and Rosalie
Levi. His father was a mill worker, his mother a hotel housekeeper. He
lived with cousins until he was 19, when he was taken to a Texas state
school in Mexia, more than 200 miles away.

He won gold medals at statewide track meets for special schools, sang
with a traveling gospel choir and knew how to summon music with a comb
or a couple of spoons.

In 1974, Mr. Levi was sent to work for Henry's Turkey Service, which
then dispatched him and other men with disabilities 1,000 miles north to
Muscatine County, Iowa, where the company had a contract with a
turkey-processing plant.

Mr. Levi specialized in soothing the creatures that he sent swinging on
shackles toward the kill room. ``I pat 'em on the belly when I get 'em
on the shackle,'' he once recalled. ``I say, `OK, OK, Tom, quieten
down.'''

As recounted in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/us/from-schoolhouse-to-symbol-of-servitude-to-dust.html}{The
New York Times}and in an
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/us/the-men-of-atalissa.html}{online
Times documentary}, the men were paid the same \$65 a month for decades,
in a perversion of a labor law that allowed people with disabilities to
be paid less than what a nondisabled person was paid for the same job.
Never given options about employment or housing, the men were forced to
live in an old school converted into a bunkhouse.

In 2009, after years of inaction, government agencies evacuated the
bunkhouse, which had devolved into a fetid firetrap of neglect. Mr. Levi
had a broken kneecap, among other health problems, including a
depression so deep that he sometimes screamed at night.

In 2013, the E.E.O.C won its federal lawsuit against Henry's Turkey
Service. By then the Muscatine County officials serving as his guardians
had arranged for Mr. Levi to live with three bunkhouse brothers in a
supervised setting in Waterloo.

In retirement, Mr. Levi became active in a local church, took vacations
and enjoyed dine-and-dance dates with his girlfriend. He often wore
Mardi Gras beads and kept spoons tucked in a sock, in case of a sudden
need for music.

Mr. Levi talked often of returning to Orange, but his family members had
either died or could not be found. After his death, though, Mr. Canino
and The Times located a few relatives.

``They took him away so long ago,'' Claudette Owens, a distant cousin,
said. ``Nobody even knew that he existed.''

But Laura Owens, a first cousin in a nursing home near Orange,
remembered Mr. Levi living with her family in that shotgun house.

``Playing the comb,'' she said. ``And singing a lot.''

Mr. Levi was to be buried in the same historic African-American cemetery
that holds the remains of his mother. Back home in Orange.
