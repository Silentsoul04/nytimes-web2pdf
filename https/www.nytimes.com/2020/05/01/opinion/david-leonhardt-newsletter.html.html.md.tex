\emph{This article originally ran as part of David Leonhardt's
newsletter, which will be named Opinion Today starting May 4. You can}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opinion-todaynl}{\emph{sign up
here}} \emph{to receive it each weekday.}

Four years ago, James Bennet --- who had recently become my boss, as The
Times's new editorial page editor --- came to me with an idea. Each
weekday, The Times sent out an email with links to each Opinion article.
Many people opened the email, but James thought it seemed like a missed
opportunity, because we didn't add any extra material to the links. The
email was derivative rather than distinctive.

So James asked if I wanted to write a short introduction each day. He
said that I'd only need to do it for a couple of months, until the 2016
presidential election, and then he would figure out what to do with the
newsletter.

But I got hooked, because people read email newsletters. I heard from so
many of you, via email and sometimes in person. I heard when you
disagreed with me and I heard when you had ideas to add. Perhaps above
all, you told me how much you appreciated getting links to non-Times
articles, too.

Almost four years later, I'm still writing this newsletter. Today,
however, will be my last day --- for a good reason, one that I think
will give you even more ways to understand the news. (I've also stopped
writing my Monday Op-Ed column but will continue to write for Sunday
Review.)

First, my own future: Starting next week, I'll be writing The Times's
main morning newsletter, covering the day's biggest news and cultural
developments.

If you have enjoyed this newsletter, I hope you'll continue to read my
work in your inboxes each weekday.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing}{You can sign
up here} if you don't already subscribe. We'll be shortening the name of
the newsletter, which is now called The Morning Briefing, to simply The
Morning.

I'm really excited about
\href{https://www.nytco.com/press/new-role-for-david-leonhardt/}{this
project}. My colleagues and I are setting out to create a new kind of
daily publication --- more succinct than the full New York Times but
with the same sensibility. Our overriding goals are clarity,
explanation, context and, ideally, delight.

As for \emph{this} email newsletter: It isn't going anywhere. Instead,
the person who had the original good idea to turn it into something more
substantial --- James Bennet --- will be taking it over. James will be
offering his own thoughts at the top most days, and other editors in the
Opinion section will also do so.

This newsletter, as it always has, will continue providing you with
links to every Opinion article published by The Times. And the
newsletter will go back to its original name: Opinion Today. You don't
need to do anything to continue receiving it (and you can unsubscribe by
clicking a link at the bottom).

I want to end by thanking all of you who have spent time reading this
newsletter over the last few years. Your feedback and critiques have
made me a better journalist. And your engagement has made me understand
the enormous potential of newsletters.

James feels the same way, and that's why we have both decided to devote
more time to them. As always, you can let me know what you think, at
\href{mailto:leonhardt@nytimes.com}{\nolinkurl{leonhardt@nytimes.com}}.

With gratitude,

David
