*Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread
of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read*[*The New York Times’s
Covid-19 coverage

### **Dear Tripped Up,**

In September 2019 B.C. — “before coronavirus” — my family and I booked a
round-trip flight from Tampa, Fla., to London with British Airways,
scheduled to depart in March. Then the coronavirus hit and our flight
was canceled by the airline. We contacted British Airways to request a
refund, but they have refused, stating they will only provide a voucher
for future use. Philip

### Dear Philip,

By now, you’ve probably read a number of coronavirus-related stories
about refunds for canceled travel plans — I’ve written a handful myself.
But there’s a reason we’re deliberately pounding the topic into the
ground: It’s a big deal and there’s lots of confusion and contradictory
information out there.

To begin, airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel
(or significantly delay) flights because of the [coronavirus
pandemic.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/coronavirus-updates.html)
That applies to domestic airlines as well as international airlines for
canceled flights to, within or from the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As you know, [travel restrictions and closed
borders](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html)
have asphyxiated commercial aviation; airlines have slashed [routes and
schedules.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/travel/international-airlines-service-cuts-coronavirus.html)
As of last month, airlines [still owed passengers $35
billion](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/ceoblog/passenger-tickets-refunds/)
for flights that could not or cannot take place, according to the
International Air Transport Association, an industry group.

In an emailed statement, a British Airways spokeswoman said that you
are, in fact, entitled to a refund; the airline’s customer service team
has reached out to you to resolve the issue. “If a customer’s flight has
been canceled, they should call us to discuss their options. They can
rebook, refund or choose to take a voucher to fly at a later date,” she
said.

The fact that you called and were initially told the exact opposite
tracks with scores of other readers who feel that refunds have been
turned into an all-out game of
Frogger.

“At best, airlines are just hiding the fact that customers are owed
refunds if they want one,” said Scott Keyes, an aviation industry expert
and the founder of the website [Scott’s Cheap
Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/). “At worst, they’re actively
not giving those refunds even when they’re asked. The thinking is: Right
now we are in such a cash crunch that we want to maintain as much cash
as possible —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>we can deal with
the reputation ramifications and legal ramifications down the road.”

Micky, another reader, got an email from Delta Air Lines with the
subject line: “Your Trip Has Been Canceled.” The body of the message
stated that a canceled plane ticket had been turned into an eCredit;
there were zero mentions of refunds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I reached out to Delta (which just posted its first quarterly loss in
five years) and was able to get Micky a refund. I also got the direct
link to the refund form ([here it
is](https://www.delta.com/refunds/refundsHomeAction.action)), which is
otherwise buried in the FAQs on Delta’s [coronavirus landing
page.](https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-update-center/overview)

“To save customers time, we proactively issued eCredits so they could
easily reschedule without having to wait further. That said, customers
whose flights have been canceled or significantly delayed by Delta are
absolutely eligible for refunds upon request, in keeping with our
longstanding policy. We’ll evaluate opportunities to clarify this in
future correspondence,” said a company spokeswoman.

Last month, fueled by a surge in passenger complaints, the United States
Department of Transportation issued a statement reminding airlines of
their duty to issue refunds for canceled flights. But enforcement has
been less than straightforward.

Class-action lawsuits against several major airlines, including Delta,
Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, are certain to crank up the
pressure. In the meantime, there are three concrete things one can try
that don’t involve hiring a lawyer.

First, send the airline a direct message on social media. It may sound
sophomoric, but several industry players have told me (anecdotally) that
this can be a consistently reliable tactic. One reader also shared her
luck with this
approach.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“Delta did not notify us, but I saw online that the flights were
canceled,” Linda wrote. “No emails. No phone calls. Nothing got a refund
confirmation. Well, until I sent a private instant message through
Facebook. Almost immediate reply. Asked for our names and confirmation
number. Bingo. Refund confirmation received.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The second course of action is to [file a
complaint](https://airconsumer.dot.gov/escomplaint/ConsumerForm.cfm)
with the transportation department. The federal agency tracks complaints
by airline and releases them monthly; March complaints will be released
in May and April complaints will be released in June. That data will be
used by the department’s Aviation Enforcement Office to monitor
airlines’ compliance with the refund policy, according to an agency
spokeswoman.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last tip: If you do manage to get an airline representative on the
phone, do everything you can to get yourself passed around to another
agent if the initial point of contact is unwilling to budge. That may
mean asking to speak with a manager or asking to be transferred to a
different department (then asking to be transferred back). Be patient;
you’ll need a good chunk of time in order to let your options play out.

Or, as Mr. Keyes recently [put it on
Twitter:](https://twitter.com/scottsflights/status/1253023249744588800)
“When a parent says ‘no’ what’s the \#1 thing every kid knows to do?
Go ask the other parent.”
