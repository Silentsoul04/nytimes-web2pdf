# Capitol Lacks Tests for Returning Senators While White House Tests Many in Trump’s Circle

</div>

As senators prepare to return on Monday, Congress’s doctor warned that
he does not have the capacity to test all 100 for coronavirus. At the
White House, the president and many of his aides are tested repeatedly.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the tight-lipped doctor who attends
to Congress, sent up on Thursday what some have construed as a warning:
His office, he told senior Republican officials on a private conference
call, cannot screen all 100 senators for the coronavirus when they
return to work on Monday.

Two miles down Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House, the story is very
different. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are tested
frequently, aides who come into close contact with them are tested
weekly and the list of people who need to be tested daily keeps
expanding, according to officials familiar with the process.

The stark contrast between the testing haves at the White House and the
have-nots on Capitol Hill, [first reported in
Politico,](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/30/capitol-physician-senators-coronavirus-testing-226980)
makes clear that Mr. Trump’s pronouncement that [“anybody that wants a
test can get a
test,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndojafDR2fI&feature=youtu.be&t=5389)
as he said on March 6 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, is far from true. Although the rich and powerful are clearly
favored, not even all the powerful have equal access.

And beyond whether people can be tested, there are questions about the
tests available. At the White House, the medical unit is using a
rapid-testing kit developed by Abbott, which yields results in about
five minutes. But Dr. Monahan told the Republican aides on Thursday that
he lacked such equipment, and that it would take at least two days to
get test results.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The disparity highlights the fundamental tension between the natural
impulse to protect a president’s health and the desire by most
politicians to project that they are not receiving any special
treatment, Robert Dallek, the presidential historian, said in an
interview Friday.

By flaunting his own access to tests and making false claims about the
availability of testing, Mr. Trump, he said, was only hurting his own
credibility with voters.

“When you add it to the fact that people on Capitol Hill, who after all
form an essential part of the government as well, cannot get testing as
readily, it just underscores the feeling that this man is principally
self-serving,” Mr. Dallek said. “It is not a good impression for the
White House to convey.”

The White House appears to agree. Shortly after 11 p.m. Friday, Mr.
Trump’s health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, [made an announcement on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SecAzar/status/1256420542971875330?s=20):
“Good news: as the Senate reconvenes to do important work for the
American people during this public health crisis, we have now received
an initial request and are sending 3 Abbott point of care testing
machines and 1,000 tests for their use.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whether that will lead to the testing of asymptomatic senators is
unclear. Dr. Monahan, a [strait-laced Navy rear
admiral](https://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=514) who
has been the attending physician of the Capitol since 2009, has turned
down dozens of requests for tests from House members and senators who
have not exhibited symptoms, according to a congressional official with
knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss
it.

His attitude is by the book: no symptoms, no test, which is in keeping
with the C.D.C.’s guidelines for testing. In detailed guidance issued to
lawmakers on Friday, Dr. Monahan advised that members of Congress wear
masks or facial coverings when they cannot stand six feet apart from one
another.

At the White House, Mr. Trump’s new press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany,
reinforced the impression that administration officials were getting
preferential treatment when she delivered her first news briefing on
Friday — without a mask. She is among the group of senior officials
tested weekly, as all assistants and deputy assistants to the president
are, an official said on Friday. Aides who are lower in rank are tested
based on how often they are in proximity to Mr. Trump.

The White House medical unit, for its part, is keeping track of test
schedules and results for each office in the complex. Both Mr. Trump and
Mr. Pence have avoided masks in public in favor of stressing how many
times they have tested negative for the virus. Visitors to the White
House are also tested before they are allowed to be close to the
president, including groups of business leaders and governors this week
like John Bel Edwards of Louisiana.

“The governor and Alex Billioux, who is our assistant secretary of
public health, both were tested for Covid-19 when they arrived and
before they could go into the White House,” Christina Stephens, a
spokeswoman for Mr. Edwards, said on Friday. “They also had their
temperatures checked several times before entering the Oval Office.”

Reporters who have been traveling with Mr. Pence have undergone
coronavirus testing and journalists traveling with Mr. Trump to Arizona
next week have been advised that they will be tested before boarding Air
Force One.

On Capitol Hill, even the party leaders are not getting that treatment.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California had not been tested as of Friday.
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican,
has, but at the White House, where Mr. McCarthy attended an event with
the president last
week.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, has not been
tested; he takes his temperature several times a day and advises those
he talks to do the same. Aides for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
the majority leader, would not say whether he had been tested or not.

There are efforts to conserve at the White House. With so many aides
reporting to work — and undergoing regular testing — the White House
Management Office requests regularly that officials who are able to stay
home should to adhere to social-distancing guidelines and to curb the
number of tests being administered. Secret Service agents do not
typically wear masks, but cleaning crew members do.

On Capitol Hill, the decisions have been left largely to Dr. Monahan,
who has played a critical behind-the-scenes role throughout the pandemic
in advising officials on how to stay safe. Under rules posted on his
internal website and shared with The New York Times, lawmakers must
exhibit symptoms, “have no alternative explanation for illness” and must
have “a nexus to risk” to receive a test.

The tests are then sent off site to an unnamed “multistate national
testing organization” for analysis — a multiday process.

Ms. Pelosi has said repeatedly that Dr. Monahan guides her decisions.
This week, after Dr. Monahan warned Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the
Democratic leader, that it might be risky for them to come back on
Monday as scheduled, Ms. Pelosi [abandoned
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/house-return-coronavirus.html)
to do so. The House will now return May
11.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“If the Capitol physician recommends that we not come back, then we have
to take that guidance,” she said.

Mr. McConnell chose a very different course. He is bringing the Senate
back into session on Monday amid a rising coronavirus caseload in the
region. Mr. McConnell’s staff would not say whether the leader has
spoken directly with Dr. Monahan.

On Friday afternoon, though, Mr. McConnell issued detailed guidelines to
his colleagues based on Dr. Monahan’s recommendations, and thanked the
doctor, along with other Senate officials, for working “hard to develop
solutions so that the United States Senate can smartly and safely begin
resuming our critical in-person work on Monday.”

In a memo Dr. Monahan circulated on Thursday, he offered advice for
attending committee meetings. Wearing masks or face coverings was
“strongly recommended” in situations where keeping six feet apart was
not possible, he said, and he urged lawmakers to “use provided hand
sanitizer” and “remain seated until the conclusion of the meeting, to
the extent possible.”

“The face covering is likely to be most useful in preventing viral
spread while a person is speaking,” the memo read.

Dr. Monahan, 60, is a quiet presence in the Capitol, where he oversees
an office that functions as a full-service in-house medical clinic for
those working in the Capitol complex, including in the Supreme Court.
Dr. Monahan often accompanies House or Senate leaders on official
delegation trips overseas, as the White House physician does with the
president.

“He seems to be ubiquitous on Capitol Hill,” said Senator Chris Van
Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, who lives down the street from Dr. Monahan
in Kensington, Md., a suburb of Washington. “He really is everywhere and
for us, he is always on duty. He’s
24/7.”

When Ms. Pelosi’s aides needed to figure out how to keep lawmakers safe
while they passed a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package in March, Dr.
Monahan worked with the sergeant-at-arms to come up with a plan for a
“visual quorum,” a senior House Democratic aide said, in which
lawmakers spaced themselves around the chamber and in the galleries
above it.

Last week, when House members returned to the Capitol [to approve a $484
billion aid
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/house-passes-relief-for-small-businesses-and-aid-for-hospitals-and-testing.html),
Dr. Monahan advised that they vote in chunks of 60 people at a time, and
recommended that they wear masks on the House floor. Most of the
Democrats and many of the Republicans did. (Mr. McConnell has begun
wearing a mask when he leaves and enters the Capitol, but not in the
Senate chamber.)

Now, with senators about to come back to Washington, some are sounding
nervous. Without sufficient diagnostic testing, they fear the Capitol —
where senators are supported not only by their own aides but also a vast
support staff of food service workers, custodians and other personnel —
would become a mini hot spot for the virus.

In a letter to Mr. McConnell this week urging him to reconsider his
decision to bring back the Senate, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of
California, who at 86 is the oldest senator, cited Dr. Monahan.

“The attending physician of Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan, advised House
leadership that he recommends against resuming their session,” she
wrote. “Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer did the right thing by
heeding this public health advice and are setting the right example for
the country.”
