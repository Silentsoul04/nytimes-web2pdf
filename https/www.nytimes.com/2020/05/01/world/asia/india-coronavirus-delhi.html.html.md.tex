locked down by the coronavirus, almost no one is heeding their call.

NEW DELHI --- The first thing that disappeared was the annoying sound of
a power drill up the street, from a house under construction.

Then the newspapers.

Then the fruit sellers, the taxis, the rickshaws, and chicken.

Day by day,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/asia/india-lockdown-coronavirus.html}{life
under coronavirus lockdown in India} took away something else, usually
something good. And nearly six weeks into it, much of this country is
still frozen.

In many cities like New Delhi, practically nothing is moving on the
roads. People stay indoors, as instructed, emerging only to collect the
basic necessities. One friend who gets his food delivered told me he
hasn't left his house for a month.

All the airlines are grounded. Schools and offices are closed. The only
businesses that I've seen operating are food shops, pharmacies and
banks. The banks have lines running out the door and down the sidewalk
where red circles have been spray-painted for people to stand in, six
feet apart, like little islands.

The other day, I drove to Delhi's outskirts. India is a place rightly
known for teeming crowds and riotous traffic. There seems to be a
national aversion to sticking to your lane, so I felt almost guilty
blazing down an empty highway, past miles of shuttered shops, with no
one to cut me off.

Whenever we turned off the highway, every village, no matter how small,
was barricaded --- some with oil drums, others with rope. Behind the
barricades stood villagers carrying sticks to keep strangers out and
wearing frayed bandannas over their faces, the virus vigilantes.

Even the sky above us is different these days. New Delhi is usually one
of the world's most polluted cities; its ceiling is invariably smudge
gray. But now with so few cars and factories running, the air here is
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/asia/india-pollution-coronavirus.html}{cleaner
than it has been in decades}.

The weather that first weekend under lockdown, in late March, was
especially lovely: mid-80s, breezy, clear skies. So on the following
Monday when I saw The Times's driver, Jag Singh, one of the few Indians
I now see on a regular basis because of our isolation, I asked if he had
managed to get outside.

``No.'' Did his neighbors? Again, ``no.''

Having seen the photos of some Americans rushing to beaches as soon as
they were allowed, I asked why he thought Indians felt so constrained.

His answer came quickly: ``Everyone's scared. People are saying if they
get sick, where will they go?''

That explained a lot. It explained why I wasn't seeing anyone in my
neighborhood venturing into the parks or strolling under the banyan
trees. It explained why few people in India were testing the lockdown
limits.

It's not that they are automatically more willing to follow the rules
than say, California's sun lovers who were not nearly social distancing.
It's that in this case, Indians are more scared.

They're scared of catching a highly contagious disease, and they don't
trust that a beleaguered health care system will save them. Or they're
scared about how they'll pay for it, even if they get the care they
need.

India has a lot of great doctors but the ratio of doctors or hospital
beds per person is much lower than in the West. And many people here
survive on a few dollars a day.

India seems to be doing better than many richer countries in containing
the virus, at least so far. With reported infections relatively low,
around 35,000,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html}{the
government is trying to loosen the national tourniquet} and reopen some
industries, such as agriculture and select manufacturing.

But many Indians don't want to take the tourniquet off, even if it is
stanching the economy's flow.

A good chunk of the population has decided that the best way to protect
themselves is not only to stick to the lockdown rules, but to go above
and beyond them, like the volunteer virus squads who sealed off entire
villages. Even people in my Delhi neighborhood have become lockdown
enthusiasts.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

A few weeks ago when I biked with my two sons to the neighborhood milk
depot --- perfectly permissible under lockdown rules --- someone leaned
out a window and boomed: ``Go home!''

My kids' eyes widened. I pedaled away shaken. Did he mean back to our
apartment? Or to America? Many people here have blamed foreigners for
bringing India the coronavirus.

So my family now does what everyone does: we stay inside, looking out
the windows at one beautiful day passing after another. We used to sit
around the table and share upcoming plans. Now we don't have any.

We are marooned in the present tense. We couldn't leave New Delhi even
if we wanted to. I crave sitting in the open night air in a Rajasthani
village, listening to tabla music. Or simply standing in a freshly
turned field that smells of earth and shaking a farmer's hand.

Lockdown is a blow to what I do and why I've dragged my family into
this. Foreign correspondents relocate themselves and their families to
soak up new experiences and transmit as much of that as possible to
readers back home --- not just the news but also the feel of a place,
the humanity. We wither doing Zoom calls from our couches.

But there is so much suffering around me, I'm not focusing on that right
now.

I get out a couple of times a week with my journalist pass, and just a
few days ago I met a mother and her 9-year-old daughter moving from
spray-painted circle to spray-painted circle down a sidewalk in a food
line. The mother was a maid who had lost her job because of the
lockdown. The daughter told me coronavirus came from stones that fell
from the sky.

They had zero money and I could tell from how listlessly they accepted
their two pieces of fried bread and two lumps of potato curry that they
hated taking handouts.

Behind them, in the bright sun, were hundreds of people just like them,
marching slowly forward.
