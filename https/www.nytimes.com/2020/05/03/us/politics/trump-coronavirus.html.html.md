WASHINGTON — [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-death-toll.html)
predicted on Sunday night that [the death toll from the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
ravaging the country may reach as high as 100,000 in the United States,
twice as many as he had forecast just two weeks ago, even as he pressed
states to reopen the shuttered economy.

Mr. Trump, who last month forecast that fatalities from the outbreak
could be kept “[substantially below
the 100,000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-24/)”
mark and even as low as 50,000, acknowledged that the
[virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-death-toll.html)
has proved more devastating than expected. But nonetheless, he said that
parks, beaches and some businesses should begin reopening now and that
schools should resume classes in person by this fall.

“We’re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people,” the
president said in a virtual “town hall” meeting at the Lincoln Memorial
[hosted by Fox
News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-virtual-town-hall-america-together-returning-to-work-coronavirus-lincoln-memorial).
“That’s a horrible thing. We shouldn’t lose one person over this.” But
he credited himself with preventing the toll from being worse. “If we
didn’t do it, the minimum we would have lost was a million two, a
million four, a million five, that’s the minimum. We would have lost
probably higher, it’s possible higher than 2.2” million.

The death toll passed 67,000 on Sunday, more than the total American
deaths in the Vietnam War and already higher than the president’s
earlier prediction. More than 1,000 additional deaths have been
announced every day since April 2 and while the rate appears to have
peaked, it has not begun to fall in a significant, sustained way. The
model embraced by the White House a month ago had assumed the death rate
would begin to fall substantially by mid-April.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite that, Mr. Trump indicated again that he favored lifting
stay-at-home orders and other restrictions that have cratered the
economy and put [more than 30 million people out of
work](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html),
arguing that the government had armed itself enough against the virus to
be prepared to curb any additional outbreak even after people begin
emerging from their homes to re-enter workplaces and other public
spaces.

“At some point we have to open our country,” the president said. “And
people are going to be safe. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned about
the tremendous contagion. But we have no choice. We can’t stay closed as
a country. We’re not going to have a country left.”

Mr. Trump asserted again that the virus would eventually fade. “This
virus will pass,” he said. “It will go. Will it come back? It might. It
could. Some people say yes. But it will pass.” While he has previously
expressed doubt about a second wave in the fall anticipated by public
health experts, he conceded that it could happen. “We may have to put
out a fire,” he
said.

The president’s appearance on Fox, in which he sat at a distance from
the hosts at the foot of the Abraham Lincoln statue and took questions
sent by video from around the country, came in the middle of a furious
debate in the United States about how and when the states should begin
restoring a semblance of everyday life. The program was titled “America
Together: Returning to Work.”

As of Friday, [more than a dozen states had begun to
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
their economies and public life while many others had set plans to do so
under certain conditions and with certain precautions, in some cases
over the warnings of public health specialists who feared that moving
too quickly would reignite a wave of infections.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump predicted that [a vaccine would be developed by the end
of 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/politics/vaccines-coronavirus-research.html),
which would be sooner than some public health experts anticipate and
[much faster than any other
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html)
for such a major virus. “We are very confident that we’re going to have
a vaccine at the end of the year, by the end of the year,” he said. Even
if it is developed that soon, though, he did not say whether it could be
approved and produced in sufficient quantities for widespread use by
then.

The president confirmed that he was warned about the virus, [which
originated in
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/world/europe/backlash-china-coronavirus.html),
in an intelligence briefing in January, but asserted that it was
characterized as if “it was not a big deal.” He said intelligence
agencies would release information about his briefings as early as
Monday.

“On Jan. 23, I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was
of no real import,” Mr. Trump said. “In other words, it wasn’t, ‘Oh,
we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to do something.’ It was a brief
conversation and it was only on Jan. 23. Shortly thereafter, I closed
the country to China. We had 23 people in the room and I was the only
one in the room who wanted to close it down.”

Mr. Trump was referring to his decision on Jan. 30 to [block entry by
most foreign nationals coming from
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html),
a move that in fact was supported by a number of his advisers and came
only after major American airlines had already canceled flights. Some
public health advisers have said that the travel limits helped slow the
spread to the United States but that the Trump administration did not
use the extra time to adequately prepare by ramping up testing and
producing medical equipment.

Mr. Trump said his travel limit, which did not apply to Americans or
legal residents, was not driven by the Jan. 23 warning. “I didn’t do it
because of what they said,” he said. “They said it very matter of
factly. It was not a big deal.”

In forecasting the toll of the virus, the White House had relied on
models by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the
University of Washington, which last month had predicted 60,415 deaths
by the first week of August. Last week, the institute [increased its
estimate
to 72,433](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) by
early August. But now the toll looks likely to pass that number within a
week.

“It looks like we’re headed to a number substantially below the
100,000,” Mr. Trump had said on April 10. “That would be the low mark.
And I hope that bears out.” He said a lower number would amount to a
victory for him. “Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 — you could
never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and
thinking.” As late as April 20, he said “we’re going toward 50 or 60,000
people.”

Vice President Mike Pence and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared
with Mr. Trump on Sunday’s broadcast. Mr. Pence acknowledged making a
mistake by [not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo
Clinic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-pence-mask.html)
last week despite the medical center’s policy.

Because masks are meant to protect other people and he has been tested
regularly, Mr. Pence said, he was in keeping with federal guidelines. “I
didn’t think it was necessary,” he said. “But I should have wore the
mask at the Mayo
Clinic.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The Fox town hall came on a day when Mr. Trump lashed out at former
President [George W.
Bush](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/george-w-bush), who called
for national unity in a three-minute video message posted on Saturday.

“Let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this
shared threat,” [Mr. Bush said in the
video](https://twitter.com/TheBushCenter/status/1256607729151619073),
which was set against music and photographs of medical workers helping
victims of the virus and of ordinary Americans wearing masks. “In the
final analysis, we are not partisan combatants. We are human beings,
equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God. We rise or
fall together, and we are determined to rise.”

While Mr. Bush never mentioned Mr. Trump’s name, the sitting president
clearly took the message as an implicit rebuke. In a Twitter message,
Mr. Trump paraphrased a Fox News personality saying, “Oh bye the way, I
appreciate the message from former President Bush, but where was he
during Impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside.”

Mr. Trump then added in his own voice: “He was nowhere to be found in
speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history\!”

Hours later, Mr. Trump went after another predecessor, reposting a tweet
from a pro-Trump website accusing former President Barack Obama of
plotting against him. “Evidence has surfaced that indicates Barack Obama
was the one running the Russian hoax,” said the original message
retweeted by the president.

Mr. Bush’s video message was part of a series of videos aired online as
part of a 24-hour live-streamed project, “[The Call to
Unite](https://unite.us/),” that also featured Oprah Winfrey, Tim
Shriver, Julia Roberts, Martin Luther King III, Sean Combs, Quincy
Jones, Naomi Judd, Andrew Yang and others.

Mr. Bush’s office said he had no response to Mr. Trump’s message. “The
video was a part of an event called ‘A Call to Unite,’” said Freddy
Ford, the former president’s chief of staff. “I hope those covering it
will resist the temptation to use it as a call to divide.” Mr. Obama’s
office had no comment.
