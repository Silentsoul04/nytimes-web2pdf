Chinese tech giant Huawei. President Trump

[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-china-economy.html)

Even before the virus, Beijing displayed a fierce approach to public
relations, an aggressive style called “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy, named
after two ultrapatriotic Chinese films featuring the evil plots and
fiery demise of American-led foreign mercenaries.

With clear encouragement from President Xi Jinping and the powerful
Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, a younger
generation of Chinese diplomats have been proving their loyalty with
defiantly nationalist and sometimes threatening messages in the
countries where they are
based.

“You have a new brand of Chinese diplomats who seem to compete with each

they happen to be posted,” said François Godement, a senior adviser for

— have been summoned by their hosts to answer accusations ranging from

Just last week,
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/world/asia/beijing-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
threatened to withhold medical aid from the Netherlands for changing the
name of its representative office in Taiwan to include the word Taipei.
And before that, the Chinese Embassy in Berlin sparred publicly with the
German newspaper Bild after the tabloid demanded $160 billion in
compensation from China for damages to Germany from the virus.

Mr. Trump said last week that his administration was conducting “serious
investigations” into Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

He has pressed American intelligence agencies to find the source of the
virus, suggesting [it might have emerged accidentally from a Wuhan
weapons
lab](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html),
although most intelligence agencies remain skeptical. And he has
expressed interest in trying to sue Beijing for damages, with the United
States seeking $10 million for every American death.

Republicans in the United States have moved to support Mr. Trump’s
attacks on China. Missouri’s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, filed a
lawsuit in federal court seeking to hold Beijing responsible for the
outbreak.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, called the suit
“frivolous,” adding that it had “no factual and legal basis’’ and
“only invites
ridicule.”

The suit seems to aim less at securing victory in court, which is
unlikely, than at prodding Congress to pass legislation to make it
easier for U.S. citizens to sue foreign states for damages.

“From Beijing’s point of view, this contemporary call is a historic echo
of the reparations paid after the Boxer Rebellion,” said Theresa Fallon,
director of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies, referring to the
anti-imperialist, anti-Christian and ultranationalist uprising around
1899-1901 in China that ended in defeat, with huge reparations for eight
nations over the next decades. “The party’s cultivation of the
humiliation narrative makes it politically impossible for Xi to ever
agree to pay any reparations.”

Instead, it has been imperative for Mr. Xi to turn the narrative around,
steering it from a story of incompetence and failure — including the
suppression of early warnings about the virus — into one of victory over
the illness, a victory achieved through the unity of the party.

In the latest iteration of the new Chinese narrative, the enemy — the
virus — did not even come from China, [but from the U.S.
military](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html),
an unsubstantiated accusation made by China’s combative Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Zhao Lijian.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Chinese diplomats are encouraged to be combative by Beijing, said Susan
Shirk, a China scholar and director of the 21st Century China Center at
the University of California, San Diego. The promotion of Mr. Zhao to
spokesman and his statement about the U.S. Army “signals to everyone in
China that this is the official line, so you get this megaphone effect,”
she said, adding that it makes any negotiations more difficult.

But in the longer run, China is seeding mistrust and damaging its own
interests, said Ms. Shirk, who is working on a book called “Overreach,”
about how China’s domestic politics have derailed its ambitions for a
peaceful rise as a global
superpower.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“As China started getting control over the virus and started this health
diplomacy, it could have been the opportunity for China to emphasize its
compassionate side and rebuild trust and its reputation as a responsible
global power,” she said. “But that diplomatic effort got hijacked by the
Propaganda Department of the party, with a much more assertive effort to
leverage their assistance to get praise for China as a country and a
system and its performance in stopping the spread of the virus.”

In recent days, Chinese state media has run numerous inflammatory
statements, saying that Australia, after announcing its desire for an
inquiry into the virus, was “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe.”
Beijing warned that Australia risked long-term damage to its trading
partnership with China, which takes a third of Australia’s exports.

“Maybe the ordinary people will say, ‘Why should we drink Australian
wine? Eat Australian beef?’” China’s ambassador, Cheng Jingye, told The
Australian Financial Review. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne,
dismissed China’s attempt as “economic
coercion.”

Even in European countries like
Germany,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“the mistrust of China
has accelerated so quickly with the virus that no ministry knows how to
deal with it,” said Angela Stanzel, a China expert with the German
Institute for International and Security Affairs.

In Germany, as in Britain, in addition to new questions about the
advisability of using Huawei for new 5G systems, worries have also grown
about dependency on China for vital materials and pharmaceuticals.

France, which traditionally has good relations with Beijing, has also
been angered by critical statements by Chinese diplomats, including a
charge that the French had deliberately left their older residents to
die in nursing homes. That prompted a rebuke from France’s foreign
minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and anger from legislators, despite an
early reciprocal exchange of medical aid like masks.

Recently, the German government complained that Chinese diplomats were
soliciting letters of support and gratitude for Beijing’s aid and
efforts against the virus from government officials and the heads of
major German companies.

The same has been true in Poland, said the U.S. ambassador to Warsaw,
Georgette Mosbacher, in an interview, describing Chinese pressure on
President Andrzej Duda to call Mr. Xi and thank him for aid, a call the
[Chinese
heralded](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1761096.shtml)
at home.

“Poland wasn’t going to get this stuff unless the phone call was made,
so they could use that phone call” for propaganda, Ms. Mosbacher said.

There is some unhappiness in China with the current diplomatic rhetoric.
In [a recent
essay](http://chinaheritage.net/journal/1900-2020-an-old-anxiety-in-a-new-era/),
Zi Zhongyun, now 89, a longtime expert on America at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, sees parallels in the harsh nationalist and
xenophobic rhetoric of the Wolf Warriors of today with the period around
the Boxer Rebellion against Western influence in China.

Ms. Zi said such reactions risked getting out of hand.

“I can say without a doubt,” she concluded, “that as long as Boxer-like
activities are given the official stamp of approval as being
‘patriotic,’” and as long as “generation after generation of our
fellow Chinese are educated and inculcated with a Boxer-like mentality,
it will be impossible for China to take its place among the modern
civilized nations of the world.”
