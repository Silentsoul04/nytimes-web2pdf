# F.D.A. Orders Companies to Submit Antibody Test Data

The agency had come under fire from members of Congress and other groups

The F[ood and Drug
Administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html)
announced on Monday that companies selling coronavirus antibody tests
must submit data proving accuracy within the next 10 days or face
removal from the market.

The antibody tests are an effort to detect whether a person had been
infected with the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html),
but results have been widely varied. Since mid-March, the agency has
permitted dozens of manufacturers to sell the tests without providing
evidence that they are accurate.

The
[F.D.A.’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html)
action follows [a
report](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html?searchResultPosition=7)
by more than 50 scientists, which found that only three out of 14
antibody tests gave consistently reliable results, and even the best had
flaws. An evaluation by the National Institutes of Health, working with
other federal health agencies, has also found “a concerning number” of
commercial tests that are performing poorly, the F.D.A. said.

The agency has also been under fire from several members of Congress,
with numerous lawmakers raising questions about the validity of some of
the tests.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So far, little is known about whether those who became ill will develop
immunity and, if so, for how long, and that leaves the value of antibody
tests still uncertain. Around the globe, government and health officials
have hoped that antibody tests would be a critical tool to help
determine when it would be safe to lift stay-at-home restrictions and
reopen businesses. The tests might also be used to identify potential
donors of “convalescent plasma,” an approach in which blood plasma
containing antibodies from a recovered individual is used to treat a
Covid-19 patient, the F.D.A.
said.

The highly infectious disease has now killed nearly 70,000 **** people
and sickened more than 1.1 million in the United States alone.

While 12 companies have been given F.D.A. clearance to sell the antibody
tests, many other products do not have agency authorization. The result
has been a confusing landscape in which tests by established companies
such as Abbott Laboratories, Cellex and most recently, Roche
Diagnostics, are competing with unapproved tests made by unknown
companies and sold by U.S. distributors with spotty track records. The
F.D.A. has blocked imports of some antibody tests at the U.S. border,
and has ordered some distributors to revise claims about what
individuals can learn from them, or halt sales.

House Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Illinois, and Rosa DeLauro, of
Connecticut, have both criticized the agency for its handling of the
matter as has Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.

“The administration’s original serology testing policy, which allowed
tests on the market with no F.D.A. review, felt like an overreaction to
the criticism they faced for their slow rollout of molecular tests,” Mr.
Krishnamoorthi said. “But F.D.A. went too far, completely abrogating
regulatory responsibility.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Overseeing development of coronavirus tests has been rocky from the
start, with President Trump and others urging the agency to relax rules
for commercial tests. [Beginning in late February, the
agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/fda-coronavirus-testing.html)
came under fire for taking too long to allow private companies to get
diagnostic tests for the coronavirus onto the market. Now, the F.D.A.
faces additional scrutiny for permitting manufacturers to distribute the
antibody tests too quickly without proof of efficacy.

“Every step this agency has taken in response to Covid-19 has been a
balance of risk and benefits,” said Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A.
commissioner, in a telephone call with reporters on Monday.

In a statement on Monday, Dr. Anand Shah, the F.D.A. deputy commissioner
for medical and scientific affairs, and Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, defended the agency’s
initial policy, saying the tests were never intended to be used as the
sole basis for determining whether anyone had been infected.

“We unfortunately see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits
and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans’
anxiety,” they said in the statement. “Some test developers have falsely
claimed their serology tests are F.D.A. approved or authorized. Others
have falsely claimed that their tests can diagnose Covid-19 or that they
are for at-home
testing.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Dr. Shah and Dr. Shuren also pointed to the N.I.H. evaluation that
showed a number of tests producing faulty results. The F.D.A. declined
to provide details on the number of tests that were studied, or how many
did not work. They also said that the F.D.A. is reviewing more than 200
antibody tests to determine whether they work well enough to get the
agency’s go-ahead.

Scott Becker, the chief executive of the Association of Public Health
Laboratories, was pleased by the F.D.A.’s announcement, which he said
would improve the quality of antibody tests. He also said the crackdown
comes six weeks too late.

“The Food and Drug Administration made the right decision by walking
back its policy on serology testing for Covid-19,” Mr. Becker said.
“We’ve long been concerned that allowing tests on the market that
have not been approved and authorized for use is a recipe for disaster.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition, as states and cities look for ways to reopen businesses,
Dr. Hahn said on Monday: “Whether a test should be a ticket for someone
to go back to work as the sole item, my opinion on that would be no,
because there are a lot of unanswered questions.”
