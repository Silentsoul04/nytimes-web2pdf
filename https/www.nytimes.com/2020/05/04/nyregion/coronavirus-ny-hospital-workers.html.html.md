Priscilla Carrow held some of the most vital jobs at [Elmhurst Hospital

As the

gloves and other protective gear inside [Elmhurst, a public hospital at
the
center](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html)
of the city’s outbreak. They ordered the inventory, replenished the
stockroom and handed out supplies, keeping a close count as [the number
of available masks began to
dwindle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/coronavirus-masks-shortage.html).

By April 12, they were all

The victims included the security guards watching over emergency rooms.
They were the chefs who cooked food for patients and other hospital
workers. They assigned hospital beds and checked patients’ medical
records. They greeted visitors and answered phones. They mopped the
hallways and took out the garbage.

“[You know how people clap for health workers at 7
o’clock](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/10/nyregion/nyc-7pm-cheer-thank-you-coronavirus.html)?
It’s mainly for the nurses and doctors. I get it. But people are not
seeing the other parts of the hospital,” said Eneida Becote, whose
husband died last month after working for two decades as a patient
transporter. “I feel like those other employees are not focused upon as
much.”

Her husband, Edward Becote, made about $45,000 a year moving patients
around the Brooklyn Hospital Center on stretchers and wheelchairs. He
was among at least 32 nonmedical hospital workers in New York City who
have died during the pandemic, according to an analysis by The New York
Times.

These workers make some of the lowest wages in hospitals, and they are
more likely [than medical staff members to be black or
Latino](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html).
In New York City’s public hospitals, 79 percent of the workers who
assist doctors and nurses are black or Hispanic, compared with 44
percent of the medical staff, according to the most recent city data.

In the early weeks of the pandemic, [when even emergency room nurses had
to reuse N95 masks for days at a
time](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/hospitals-coronavirus-ppe-shortage.html),
nonmedical workers were often given less protective gear than their
colleagues who treated patients — or none at all — according to union
leaders and hospital
employees.

“If you work in a hospital, you are exposed to the same kind of virus as
the doctors and nurses,” said Carmen Charles, president of the union
that represents 8,500 nonmedical staff members at New York City
hospitals. “I understand management wanting to ration the supplies, but
at what cost?”

Ms. Charles, who leads Local 420, part of the umbrella union for city
workers, said some of her members had been denied the N95 masks that
were reserved for doctors and nurses. At least 11 members have died, she
said.

A spokesman for Health and Hospitals, the city’s public hospital system,
acknowledged that it saved N95 masks for clinical employees who treated
Covid-19 patients and other employees in “hot zones,” such as the
emergency department. Early in the pandemic, the spokesman said, most
government guidance on masks focused on clinical employees. He said the
agency offered surgical masks to its nonclinical workers.

Elmhurst did not require every employee to wear at least a surgical mask
until April 15, the same day Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced an order
mandating New Yorkers to wear face coverings in public, according to
emails viewed by The Times.

In March, Ms. Carrow, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Braswell handed out supplies
in the materials management department, in the hospital’s subbasement.
Their deaths have shaken other nonclinical employees at Elmhurst who
hoped that their distance from patients offered some protection against
contracting the
virus.

“As you start mending your heart for one, then the next one came,” said
Gary Johnson, who previously worked in their department and discovered

Hospitals generally have not released the names of employees who have
died, leading workers to collect the names through word of mouth and
organize their own memorials. The Times compiled its list through
obituaries and interviews with hospital employees and relatives.

[At the Brooklyn Hospital
Center](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/coronavirus-brooklyn-hospital.html)
in Fort Greene, at least five employees have died in recent weeks,
according to interviews.

Rafael Cargill handled medical records at the hospital, including
sometimes retrieving them from floors with virus patients, said his
sister, Lillian Cargill. She said that he was concerned about a
colleague who showed up to work despite testing positive for the virus,
and that he had not received any protective gear when he developed a dry
cough in late
March.

Mr. Cargill, 60, died at home on March 30.

“We ran over there and had to stand outside,” his sister said. The
paramedics “wouldn’t allow us to go in. They came out and said they
couldn’t save him.”

Kim C. Flodin, a spokeswoman for [the Brooklyn Hospital
Center](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/nyregion/coronavirus-births-mothers.html),
said the hospital was following state and federal protocols to “protect
our staff, clinical and nonclinical, from the transmission of this
virus.”

It is difficult to pinpoint how any hospital employee contracted the
virus; many commute by public transit and live with family members who
are also unable to work from home. But anyone working in hospitals
inundated with patients was potentially exposed.

In a lawsuit filed on April 20, the largest nurses’ union in New York
accused the state’s Department of Health of enacting policies that
turned hospitals into “petri dishes where the virus can fester and then
spread to other health care
workers.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Nurses and other health care workers were denied testing even though
they exhibited symptoms, the lawsuit said.

In response, a Health Department spokesman said the state was taking
every step to ensure health workers have the support and supplies they
need.

That support may have come too late for Adiel Montgomery, who worked as
a security guard in the emergency department of Kingsbrook Jewish
Medical Center in Brooklyn.

He spoke out in March about lacking the protective suits that he saw
doctors wearing around Covid-19 patients, according to a colleague who
spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. After
Mr. Montgomery and other security guards complained, the colleague said,
more protective gear
arrived.

In late March, Mr. Montgomery lost his sense of taste and smell and
experienced flulike symptoms, according to his brother.

Mr. Montgomery, 39, was hospitalized at Kingsbrook a week later with
chest pains. While waiting hours for the results of his blood work, he
began coughing up blood.

He died on April 5. The hospital told his family that he died of a heart
attack, but his family believes he had the virus.

“I just feel that being an employee of the same hospital, he was
neglected,” his mother, Griselda Bubb-Johnson, said. “I feel they should
have done more.”

After the deaths of at least five Kingsbrook employees, nurses there
[protested outside the hospital about the shortage of protective
gear](https://gothamist.com/news/we-will-all-die-kingsbrook-hospital-nurses-demand-protective-gear-after-their-colleagues-succumb-covid-19).
A spokeswoman for Kingsbrook did not respond to multiple requests for
comment.

Many hospital employees worked as long as they could after they felt
sick, driven by financial necessity and a desire to help their
overstretched colleagues.

The last day Gary Washington reported to work at NewYork-Presbyterian
Allen Hospital in northern Manhattan was March 29. His body was aching,
and a colleague saw him lying down in the cafeteria.

Rosalyn Washington, his wife, thought he was growing too old to keep
working as a housekeeping employee there. He cleaned the rooms of virus
patients after they were discharged, and his brother thought he should
stop going to work, she said.

So many housekeepers called out sick that the hospital began bringing in
temporary workers, one of his colleagues said. But Mr. Washington was
the family’s primary breadwinner.

“He was not going to quit his job and not take care of his family,” Mrs.
Washington
said.

Mr. Washington, 56, died from the virus on April 8, the day before his
wedding anniversary.

Before his death, he texted his wife from his hospital bed: “I can’t
explain how much I truly love you. I didn’t want to tell you how I cried
like a baby thinking about how good you’ve been to me.”

His wife had his urn engraved with Boop P Doop, the pet name they called
each other.

“I had 25 years with this man. I’m so empty. Now I’m getting calls about
widows’ benefits,” she said, her voice breaking. “He’s trying to take
care of me still.”
