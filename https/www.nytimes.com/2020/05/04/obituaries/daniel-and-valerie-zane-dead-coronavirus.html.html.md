*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Daniel Zane fought in World War II. In a way, it helped prepare him for
the painful time in mid-April when his wife of 71 years, Valerie Zane,
was dying.

“He used to say, ‘I survived the Battle of the Bulge; I can survive
anything,’” his son-in-law, Greg Hettwer, recalled.

But he could not survive the novel coronavirus; he died of it on April
17 at 94. Just two days before, his wife, who had been in declining
health for seven years with Parkinson’s disease and dementia, died at
91. She had not been tested for the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The two were in a senior living facility in Haverford, Pa., outside
Philadelphia. When the pandemic forced restrictions, Mr. Zane was no
longer allowed to walk from his independent living unit to visit his
wife in the skilled nursing unit. So he moved into a small apartment in
the nursing unit to care for her.

He then tested positive for the virus and could not see her, which left
him distraught. She was dying, and he knew he couldn’t save her, a
terrible blow for a man who had always been so capable.

While in the Army, where he proved to be quick on his feet and a natural
leader, he did reconnaissance work behind enemy lines and then helped
liberate concentration camps.

After the war he went to Fordham Law School and practiced law in
Manhattan. He married Valerie Zuckerman, whom he had met on a blind
date, in 1949. They moved to White Plains, N.Y., where they raised their
two daughters, Robin Zane, who is married to Mr. Hettwer, and Nancie
Zane. Mrs. Zane worked as a medical administrator and was a master
bridge player.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They moved to Pennsylvania last year to be near their daughter Nancie.

As Mrs. Zane’s health deteriorated, Mr. Zane stayed by her side. “She
was very clear that she didn’t want him to leave her, and he didn’t,”
Nancie Zane said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But when he came down with the virus, he knew that she would die alone
and expected that he would, too.

“He said that the end of Val’s life was like being in the foxhole at the
Battle of the Bulge, but even that was easier,” Mr. Hettwer said. “He
said that at least in war, you have all your soldiers around you. You
have the camaraderie.”

Mr. Zane had always seemed to be a survivor. “We thought he would have
more time with us,” Robin Zane said. “In the end, it was almost as if
she had said, ‘I’m not going alone,’ and as if he had said, ‘You’re not
going
alone.’”
