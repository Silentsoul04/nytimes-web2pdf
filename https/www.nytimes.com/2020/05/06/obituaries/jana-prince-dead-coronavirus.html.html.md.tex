She had cerebral palsy, but her interest was in helping others with
their problems. She died of the novel coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

As someone with cerebral palsy, Jana Marie Prince had plenty of her own
problems, but friends and family members say she was most interested in
helping other people with theirs.

``The illness affected the entire left side of her body,'' her brother
Paul Anthony Prince Jr. said in a phone interview. ``I can remember when
we were small she was teased about it. She never let that stop her from
reaching her goals. She dedicated her life to social services. She
wanted to give back and touch lives.''

Ms. Prince, who was 43 and lived in Marrero, La., a New Orleans suburb,
\href{https://obits.nola.com/obituaries/nola/obituary.aspx?n=jana-marie-prince\&pid=196003992\&fhid=25202}{died}
of the new coronavirus at a hospital in Gretna, La., on April 6. But
that was just the beginning of a terrible month of April for the Prince
family.

Ms. Prince, a New Orleans native, was born on Dec. 10, 1976, to Barbara
and Paul Prince. She graduated from Xavier University Preparatory School
and Southern University at New Orleans, where she received a bachelor's
degree in social welfare. In the ensuing years she held social work
positions with the Metropolitan Human Services District, the Archdiocese
of New Orleans, Covenant House and, most recently, the Salvation Army.

Her brother said he, Ms. Prince and their brother Delvin enjoyed a
stable upbringing, something his sister knew was not true for many
children in the New Orleans area.

``New Orleans is a rough city if you don't have the right household,''
he said. ``My sister just wanted to reach people who didn't have the
advantages here, in her home city, that she had. On weekends she would
meet with kids, talk to kids, try to guide them through life.''

Ms. Prince had a guide of her own: her mother, Barbara Ann Davis Prince.

``If you'd see one you saw the other,'' Mr. Prince said. ``They always
were together.''

On April 9, at a hospital in Slidell, La., Barbara Prince, too,
\href{https://obits.nola.com/obituaries/nola/obituary.aspx?n=barbara-ann-davis-prince\&pid=196004113\&fhid=25202}{succumbed
to the virus}, at age 65. She was born on April 16, 1954, in New
Orleans, graduated from L.W. Higgins High School and had been a customer
service representative at a bank. Her husband
\href{https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/paul-prince-obituary?pid=131655841}{died
in 2009}.

Helping Jana, Paul Prince Jr. said, had been her passion.

``My mom was very protective of her,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, she
couldn't protect her from this.''

The virus was not done with Mr. Prince's family: On April 28 his uncle
William Davis, 74, a Vietnam veteran who had retired from the Avondale
Shipyard, died of it. Mr. Prince said he might have weathered a case of
it himself, though he had not been able to get tested. Others in the
extended family, a close-knit group, had also shown symptoms.

``We have faith,'' Mr. Prince said, ``and we're holding on to that.''
