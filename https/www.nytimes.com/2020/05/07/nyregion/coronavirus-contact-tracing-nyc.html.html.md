# De Blasio Strips Control of Virus Tracing From Health Department

Leading health officials expressed serious concerns over the transfer of
contact tracing to the agency that runs public hospitals, a departure
from current and past practice.

New York City will soon assemble an army of more than 1,000 disease
detectives to trace the contacts of every person who tests positive for
the coronavirus, an approach seen as crucial to quelling the outbreak
and paving the way to reopen the hobbled city.

But that effort will not be led by the city’s renowned Health
Department, which for decades has conducted [contact
tracing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/nyregion/nyc-contact-tracing.html)
for diseases such as tuberculosis, H.I.V. and Ebola.

Instead, in a sharp departure from current and past practice, the city
is going to put the vast new public health apparatus in the hands of its
public hospital system, Health and Hospitals, city officials
acknowledged on Thursday night after being approached by The New York
Times about the changes.

The decision, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at his daily briefing
on Friday, puzzled current and former health officials, who questioned
the wisdom of changing what has worked before, especially during a
pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The department conducted tracing of coronavirus cases at the start of
the outbreak, and had been doing so again recently, in preparation for
the city’s expansion.

Dr. Mary T. Bassett, a [former city health
commissioner](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/nyregion/nyc-health-mary-bassett-resignation.html)
under Mr. de Blasio and now the director of the FXB Center for Health
and Human Rights at Harvard University, said that the three key elements
of handling the coronavirus — testing, tracing and quarantine — have
long been performed by the Health Department.

“These are core functions of public health agencies around the world,
including New York City, which has decades of experience,” Dr. Bassett
said in an email. “To confront Covid-19, it makes sense to build on this
expertise.”

The move also angered some within the ranks of the Health Department,
which has been at odds with Mr. de Blasio since the early days of the
outbreak, when top officials in the department clashed with City Hall
over the timing of school closures and public health messaging.

In announcing the move Friday morning, the mayor said, “Everything at
Health and Hospitals has been based on speed and intensity and
precision, and they’ve done an amazing job.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of Health and Hospitals, said that the move
was made because his agency, a public benefit corporation rather than a
city department, could more quickly hire contact tracers and enter into
contracts for testing and other needed services.

His agency, he said, would also oversee the hotels for housing people
who could not quarantine at home, as well as some coronavirus testing.

But he said the tracing itself would be supervised by a team of roughly
50 Health Department experts who will be detailed to Health and
Hospitals to run the operation.

“So we’ll be able to have the best of both worlds,” he said. “We’ll be
able to have the people who are used to supervising this kind of work
still doing the supervision of it. But we’ll be able to hire as quickly
as possible and get as many tests done” as possible.

The city’s public hospital system struggled with budgetary shortfalls
even before the coronavirus outbreak sent thousands of sick and dying
patients into its 11 hospitals. Their emergency rooms have been the
front lines of the crisis, as doctors and nurses faced a wave of
patients at facilities including [Elmhurst Hospital in
Queens](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html)
and [Woodhull Hospital in
Brooklyn](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-woodhull-madhvi-aya-dead.html).
Staff members died, even some who [did not work directly with
patients](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-hospital-workers.html).

A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio declined to comment about any
dissatisfaction expressed by Health Department officials and declined to
make the city health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, available to
discuss the matter.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Contact tracing is one part of an accepted strategy for responding to
disease outbreaks, and it is now at the center of a national discussion
of how and when to begin allowing economic activity to restart. State
officials included the number of contact tracers working in a region as
one key metric for determining when businesses in that region would able
to reopen.

Mr. de Blasio, in recent days, has talked repeatedly about the large new
public health system that will be needed to contain the virus as the
number of new cases recedes. Officials have said the efforts are
essential to reviving the city’s economic
life.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

“You’re talking about tens of thousands of people who will be tested
daily,” the mayor said in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday. “You’re
talking about a tracing apparatus that, anyone who is tested positive,
we ask them, we interview them: who they’ve been close with in recent
days, who they’ve come in contact with.”

Before the shift, hiring was being conducted by the nonprofit Fund for
Public Health in New York City in partnership with the Health
Department; salaries for contact tracers [started at $57,000 a
year](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428080921/https://1w20ju1nsz1k2xqrjx3ccsd1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/76/2020/04/CT-I.pdf).
Thousands had already applied.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and former New York City health commissioner,
said that the city’s Health Department is the “greatest in the world”
and that “if any health department can excel at contact tracing, New
York City can.”

David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD
Directors, a membership organization of health officials who deal with
contact tracing to limit the spread of sexually transmitted diseases,
said that while there was a “role for the health care delivery system to
coordinate with the health department,” the group was concerned that the
mayor’s decision might slow the implementation of contract tracing in
the city.

“New York is leading the nation as the epicenter of this epidemic and
it is a leader of the nation,” Mr. Harvey added. “We are worried about
anything that delays the rollout of an expanded contact tracing
program.”

The Health Department has the authority to issue quarantine orders in
New York City. Such orders are likely to be an important part of the
program, which would not only involve getting in touch with people who
have had close contact with an infected person, but also getting those
contacts to quarantine themselves, either at home or, possibly, in a
city-funded hotel.

[During the Ebola outbreak early in Mr. de Blasio’s first
term](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/tracing-patients-possible-contacts-creates-host-of-challenges-for-the-city.html),
the Health Department created a telephone center to track potential
contacts.

As the rapid spread of infections overwhelmed the system in late March
and April, the city largely stopped doing contact tracing on confirmed
Covid-19 cases. In recent weeks, health workers have been doing a few
case investigations to prepare to ramp up the system, and they plan to
restart tracing on a broad scale once hundreds of new people have been
hired.

Yet the city has never tried to trace a disease as commonplace in the
population as Covid-19, Dr. Shama Ahuja, who oversees tuberculosis
contact tracing for the Health Department, said in an interview last
week.

“It is like tracing the flu,” she said. “The level of this effort is
unprecedented.”
