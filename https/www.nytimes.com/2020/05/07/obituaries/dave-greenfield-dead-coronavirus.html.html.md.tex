scene.

the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Dave Greenfield, the keyboardist of the Stranglers, a band that rose to
prominence in Britain's 1970s punk rock scene while sparring, and
sometimes brawling, with several of its leading figures, died on Sunday.
He was 71.

Mr. Greenfield, who had been hospitalized because of heart problems,
tested positive for the novel coronavirus a week before he died, the
band said in a
\href{http://www.thestranglers.co.uk/?p=16131}{statement}.

``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qca9ByvLhBA}{Golden Brown},''
the band's best-known song, largely sprang from a riff written by Mr.
Greenfield and featured his dreamlike harpsichord playing, part of a
sound that often diverged from the punk archetype. The song was
frequently played on BBC radio despite a lyric partly about heroin,
reached No. 2 on the British charts and

named} the most performed work of 1982 at Britain's Ivor Novello Awards
for songwriting and composing.

David Paul Greenfield was born on March 29, 1949, in Brighton, England.
He studied music theory and taught himself how to play the piano, he
said in an
\href{https://books.google.gr/books?id=iI77AwAAQBAJ\&pg=PA150\&lpg=PA150\&dq=dave+greenfield+ray+manzarek\&source=bl\&ots=te-FM0K1Fb\&sig=ACfU3U2FsTjf9nAmIR-IYqC-60KKkOWkiw\&hl=en\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwiD4YS6gZ_pAhVhxoUKHTqWDBw4ChDoATABegQICRAB\#v=onepage\&q=dave\%20greenfield\%20ray\%20manzarek\&f=false}{interview}
in 2004. He joined the Stranglers in 1975, less than a year after the
group formed in Guildford, England.

With a thick mustache, fringed, medium-length hair and a Hammond organ
style that prompted comparisons to the Doors, Mr. Greenfield seemed an
unlikely punk. He and his bandmates were older and more musically
experienced than many of those who became famous around them, though
they rapidly developed a rough-edged reputation.

``In those days it was always the Stranglers against everybody else,''
the group's bassist, Jean-Jacques Burnel,
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/10/artsfeatures}{told
The Guardian in 2001}, reminiscing about a brawl after a 1976 gig in
which he said he, Mr. Greenfield and the other Stranglers faced off
against members of the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash.

The group fought rivals, critics and audiences alike, and boasted of
having gaffer-taped a French music journalist, Philippe Manoeuvre, to
the Eiffel Tower. Mr. Greenfield also joined his bandmates in trying
heroin, although according to Mr. Burnel he
``\href{https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/12/stranglers-40-years-fights-drugs-ufos}{was
sensible and quit the next day}.''

He said that before joining the Stranglers his main influences had been
Jon Lord of Deep Purple and Rick Wakeman of the progressive rock band
Yes.

``He was the difference between the Stranglers and every other punk
band,'' Hugh Cornwell, the group's founding singer,
\href{https://twitter.com/HughCornwell/status/1257349295742779392?s=20}{said}
on Twitter.

Mr. Greenfield, who was also a pilot, is survived by his wife, Pam.
