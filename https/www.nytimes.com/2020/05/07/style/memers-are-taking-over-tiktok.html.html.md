# Memers are Taking Over TikTok

</div>

Bombarding a platform known for dance crazes and skits is strategic, and
potentially very lucrative.

Since launching in the U.S. in 2018, TikTok has cemented itself in viral
culture. It has given birth to [dance
crazes](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F02%2F13%2Fstyle%2Fthe-original-renegade.html),
[popular
catchphrases](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F10%2F29%2Fstyle%2Fok-boomer.html)
and [food
trends](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fthe-goods%2F2020%2F5%2F5%2F21246914%2Fpancake-cereal-tiktok).
It also jump-started the careers of a generation of young influencers.

Now, TikTok is being embraced by a new group of internet wizards:
memers.

Multi-platform meme brands like
@[Daquan](https://www.tiktok.com/@daquan),
@[Betch](https://www.tiktok.com/@betch?) and
@[Memezar](https://www.tiktok.com/@memezar) have begun investing heavily
in TikTok in recent months. They’ve already amassed millions of
followers, surpassing many influencers. Midlevel independent Instagram
memers, many who create memes in specific genres such as gaming, are
also pivoting toward TikTok. And more teens are using the platform to
build meme brands from the ground up.

“I can’t overstate just how much TikTok has taken hold in the meme
space,” said Don Caldwell, the editor in chief of Know Your Meme, a
website that documents memes. “A lot of people associate TikTok with
[Charli
D’Amelio](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html)
and these dance trends. It’s actually a platform where all kinds of
viral content can proliferate and thrive.”

Memers act as small media companies that reshare trending videos,
images, and jokes in order to amass large audiences on social platforms,
which they then monetize by selling products or posting ads.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“TikTok was very individual-focused for so long, but people are finding
other ways to aggregate and grow now,” said Samir Mezrahi, the founder
of @[KaleSalad](https://www.tiktok.com/@kalesalad), a meme media brand.
“The amount of growth you get on TikTok from one viral video is so
much compared to other platforms, it compels more people to start these
meme accounts.”

Growing fast can involve shady behavior. Meme pages have been notorious
for their scrappy nature and dubious growth hacks on Instagram and
YouTube, and many have begun replicating that on TikTok.

Meme accounts can be found in the comment sections of popular TikTok
stars’ videos posting things like “follow for follow” or “follow for a
big reveal.” Many also grow by starting off as joke pages, designed to
troll users who ask for the handles of women featured in videos.

“Let’s say there’s a TikTok account that posted a video of a girl
dancing, everyone in the comments is like, ‘she’s so hot, what’s her
@?’” said Graham Heavenrich, founder of Cowbelly Studios, a meme
publishing company. “People will be like, ‘oh it’s this,’ and tag one of
those meme pages. Then they click it and it’s like it’s like, ‘psych.’”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There is a point in every social media platform’s life when it is forced
to grapple with the community of memers bending the limits of the
platform to go viral. Most platforms have responded by banning them.

Twitter [deactivated a slew of high-profile meme
accounts](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/twitter-suspends-the-dory-girlposts-common-white-girl.html)
in 2018. YouTube regularly issues copyright strikes to accounts that
repost videos they don’t own. Instagram, after [deactivating several
waves of meme
accounts](https://www.insider.com/instagram-meme-page-purge-suspends-accounts-2019-7),
attempted to repair its fraught relationship with the meme community
earlier this year by hiring its first partnerships manager to [work
specifically with
memers.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/08/instagram-hiring-meme-liaison/595552/)

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

TikTok, however, has shown a willingness to work with the community. “I
have a rep at TikTok already who helps me with things,” said Sal Patel,
a meme account administrator. “They helped me get the username @Betch,
they helped me attach my YouTube channel. The support at Instagram isn’t
as good.”

While memers are notorious for failing to give credit, many large meme
brands on TikTok say they work with licensing companies or reach out to
creators to ensure they have the right to reshare content to the app.

They’re also using the platform’s design to their advantage. While most
meme pages simply post viral videos and mash ups, some intersperse
YouTube style commentary or feature innovative formats. A current trend
in the teenage TikTok meme world is to use the app’s profile layout to
create [a giant image out of several
videos.](https://www.tiktok.com/@kyliee90)

“People are recognizing they can use the layout of how TikTok shows
content to make these giant photos and people are getting super-creative
with it,” Mr. Heavenrich said. Some TikTok users are even creating
[giant memes across their grids](https://www.tiktok.com/@kaneyeast).

Joey Ruben, 17, ran several Instagram meme accounts, but since
quarantine began, he has refocused all of his energy on TikTok. He
currently runs @[Funny](https://www.tiktok.com/@funny), with 1.1 million
followers and @[Gods](https://www.tiktok.com/@gods), with 530,000
followers.

“I find videos off YouTube, Insta and Twitter. I usually download the
video to my camera roll and repost it with credit,” he said. “In the
beginning of 2020, that’s when I started to see meme content rise on the
app. Now, I’ve noticed everyone is posting memes. Half of my For You
page is reposted content as opposed to people making their own content.”

A viral media brand called
@[PizzaSlime](https://www.tiktok.com/@pizzaslime) has amassed more than
712,000 followers on TikTok posting the way they feel many users do:
sharing a mix of funny videos, images, and sometimes their own
creations.

“I don’t necessarily know if it will or won’t work, but it reminds me of
the early days of Instagram where everyone is just figuring it out,”
said Nicholas Santiago, a co-founder of PizzaSlime who is known online
as Stove. “I don’t think in the beginning of Instagram we knew that the
influencer was going to be what it’s going to be today, and that’s what
excites us about TikTok. Right now it’s just very free and open.”

Mr. Caldwell of Know Your Meme said that the [dancing Ghanaian
pallbearers
meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/coffin-dance-dancing-pallbearers)
that went viral on TikTok in April is a good example of how the platform
is evolving.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>TikTok users began
appending clips of the dapper pallbearers to create “fail” videos. For
instance, a video of a girl sending a text message and getting no
response cuts to the pallbearers. “That meme had much of its early
spread on TikTok by smaller meme accounts that dedicate themselves to
posting remix and joke videos,” said Mr. Caldwell. “This is something
the platform has proved to be good at.”

Most meme accounts on TikTok aren’t monetizing yet. But as they continue
to share a deluge of messy, reposted and remixed content, they are
slowly changing the nature of the platform. Especially for younger
users, TikTok is no longer synonymous with dance challenges and skits,
it’s where they go to consume [news,
commentary,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/style/tiktok-politics-bernie-trump.html)
and the most viral videos on the internet. And teenagers hope to
dominate this new landscape.

“There’s a new generation of people who see TikTok as an opportunity to
get their start,” Mr. Ruben said. He considers himself part of that
class and has already started his own company, [Bull
Media](https://bullmediagroup.co/).

“My goal is to build a large media company across all platforms,” Mr.
Ruben said. “We’ll not only have our own brand partnership deals, but
we’ll work with a bunch of influencers. On TikTok, there’s so many
influencers with no idea how to run ads. I want to help young kids
profit. I want them to make money off their platform.”
