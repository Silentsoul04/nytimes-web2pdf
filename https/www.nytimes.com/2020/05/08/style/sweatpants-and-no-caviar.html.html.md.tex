\emph{With the New York party scene on hiatus, here is how some patrons
and society figures are spending their time and resources during the
coronavirus crisis.}

\subsection{Dennis Basso}\label{dennis-basso}}

\textbf{Age:} 66 (``but thinking I'm 40'')

\textbf{Occupation:} fashion designer and retailer

\textbf{Favorite charities:}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?}

At my house in Water Mill, N.Y.

\textbf{What is your version of sheltering at home?}

We have been in Water Mill since March 13. I packed a couple of cashmere
blazers for the stay, but we've been here so long that the seasons have
changed. I'm in my studio right now, looking through the French doors at
a wraparound porch and a beautiful katsura tree. I'm here with my
husband, Michael Cominotto. It's been quiet.

\textbf{And stress free?}

Michael and I have never been together day and night for 50-plus days.
There have been a few tight moments, but we're in a house with a big
garden. I don't know if I could have done this in our Manhattan
apartment.

\textbf{How do you keep up with work?}

I'm on Zoom and working with my QVC team. For QVC we do an entire
collection. My clients are buying outerwear. It lifts me up that gals
have hope that one day this is going to end. The dining room is where I
film for QVC. The library has become the design studio for our Madison
Avenue store. We're waiting to find out what fashion week will be.

\textbf{What do you think that will look like?}

Maybe we'll all be showing in our studio. Maybe the presentations will
be more like the old collections in Paris, shown to a few people at a
time.

\textbf{Does anything make you nostalgic?}

We've had dinners in Water Mill for 60 or 70 people. That's something
I'm missing more than restaurants right now. I have a large collection
of china, silver, crystal --- that's my passion. Every day I say, ``I
promise you, girls, I'll be back.''

\subsection{Agnes Hsu-Tang}\label{agnes-hsu-tang}}

\textbf{Age:} 48

\textbf{Occupation}: archaeologist and art historian

\textbf{Favorite Charities}: \href{https://asiasociety.org/museum}{Asia
Society Museum}; \href{https://www.nyhistory.org}{New-York Historical
Society}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?}

At my ski house in Vail.

\textbf{You're a New Yorker. What took you to Vail?}

I was with my husband {[}Oscar Tang, the philanthropist and business
leader{]}, hoping to get in some skiing. We were there for one day
before they shut down all the slopes. It became a ghost town overnight.
But we would go on hikes and see a baby moose walking around. She was
here for a week, sometimes on our front grass.

\textbf{What's been the downside of this crisis for you?}

I've always loved traveling. I miss that now. And since we've been
quarantined, I've felt so helpless reading about what was happening in
New York.

\textbf{How have you coped?}

I've been working with Louise Mirrer of the New-York Historical Society
to get medical supplies to hospitals in Queens and Brooklyn --- those
public hospitals where the nurses were wearing trash bags and doctors
were calling us begging for masks. In Vail I drove around to every
hardware store and every market buying up masks and gloves to send to
New York. We own several boutique hotels around the world and have
gotten them to send supplies, too.

\textbf{Have you found other ways of giving back?}

I'm executive chair of the Asia Society Museum Triennial, so I've been
focused on that. Our work on the event, which has been moved to October
and will run through the following June, is especially vital at a time
when racism against Asians and Asian-Americans has resurged. We will
have an exhibition addressing that. It keeps me working 12-hour days.

\textbf{How do you imagine your life post-Covid}?

This is going to sound totally nerdy, but once upon a time I studied to
be an opera singer. I've had this fantasy since I was a child of singing
an opera that I composed.

\textbf{Age:} 45

\textbf{Occupation:} entertaining and interior design influencer and
author

\textbf{Favorite Charities:}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?}

At my house in Amagansett, N.Y.

\textbf{What's that been like?}

My husband, teenage son and puppy came out here the Friday about six
weeks ago. New York sounded pretty apocalyptic at the time, so we're
grateful just to have nature.

\textbf{You have a home in Brooklyn. Has country living altered your
routines?}

Most of the content that I create and share is within my home, so in a
sense my day-to-day hasn't changed. But what I communicate has vastly
changed. Instead of just offering recipes, for example, I'm trying to
share ideas about how to buy ingredients that can last.

\textbf{Has self-seclusion taken an emotional toll?}

I'm not feeling as productive as I'd like to be. I keep starting things
and not finishing them. Maybe I need structure, or maybe I'm just
adapting to a new normal. Most days I make sure to get out of my
sweatpants and brush my teeth. But some days it's 4 o'clock and I
haven't done either.

\textbf{Have other habits suffered?}

I've been eating crunchy cheese doodles, Frosted Flakes. I'm supposed to
be this healthy seasonal eater, but I want the comfort of childhood
right now.

\textbf{What's been the upside for you?}

In Brooklyn our son, Jivan, is in his room all the time. For us, this
has been a great time to play board games, laugh and reconnect.
Thankfully, we're not at each other's throats.

\textbf{Have you found ways to focus outside home?}

My dad is in the hospital. I'm using my own sadness to act on things
related to our struggle. I've donated to Invisible Hands, a group
created by four college kids to get food to people who need it, and to
Meals on Wheels. We can all do without caviar right now.
