It.}\label{coronavirus-ravaged-a-choir-but-isolation-helped-contain-it}}

One sick singer attended choir practice, infecting 52 others, two of
whom died. A study released by the C.D.C. shows that self-isolation and
tracing efforts helped contain the outbreak.

It was a chilly evening in Mount Vernon, Wash., on March 10, when a
group of singers met for choir practice at a church, just as they did
most Tuesday nights.

The full choir consists of 122 singers, but only 61 made it that night,
including one who had been fighting cold-like symptoms for a few days.

That person later tested positive for the coronavirus, and within two
days of the practice, six more members of the choir had developed a
fever. Ultimately, 53 members of the choir became ill with Covid-19, the
disease caused by the virus, and two of them died.

The event, which was reported in March by
\href{https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-29/coronavirus-choir-outbreak}{various}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa-03-26}{news}\href{https://www.goskagit.com/entertainment/local-choir-suffers-devastating-losses/article_18fcf658-f59d-5d4a-a64f-b00d026b3ba7.html}{organizations},
demonstrated how contagious and dangerous the coronavirus is, especially
among older populations. The median age for those attending the practice
that night was 69.

A study since then has showed that swift action by the members of the
choir, including voluntary isolation, along with contact tracing by the
Skagit County health department, helped contain the spread and prevent
what could have been a much larger outbreak in that community, about an
hour's drive north of Seattle.

Although the virus spread quickly and thoroughly within the choir, it
did not result in a significant increase in the infection rate of the
community at large.

``If they hadn't initiated their own isolation and quarantine before we
got involved, you can conceive of a situation where every one of those
people would have infected another three people each,'' said Dr. Howard
Leibrand, the Skagit County health officer. ``You would have had a huge
change in our viral curve based on this one episode.''

As communities around the world begin to look at ways to ease
restrictions on movement and gathering, as well as reopen their
businesses and houses of worship, reports like this one raise clear
warnings about the dangers posed when a large number of people gather
indoors during an outbreak. That is especially the case for activities
like singing that can spur transmission.

Dr. Leibrand and Lea Hamner, a communicable disease and epidemiology
supervisor in Skagit County, conducted the investigation into the choir
outbreak and were the authors of the report, which the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention released on Tuesday.

They labeled the choir practice a point-source exposure and said very
few such events had been so clearly isolated as this one, making it a
helpful study of how the virus spreads.

``It's rare to have a group with a single common exposure,'' Ms. Hamner
said. ``Here, we have a defined group, and they all had a similar
exposure for a similar amount of time, so we are able to really
understand transmission a little bit better with that kind of event.''

What made the choir practice so fertile for transmission was most likely
the very act of singing, in which people projecting their voices at loud
volume are prone to emit tiny droplets known as aerosols that can carry
the virus. It is a phenomenon familiar to anyone who has sat close to
the stage during a play or a musical performance.

``When you project your voice, you can project more virus,'' Dr.
Leibrand said. ``So it seems like this would be a pretty good indicator
we shouldn't be going back to large groups singing in an enclosed space,
i.e., church, because that would be the same sort of situation as
this.''

Some people in the Skagit County choir may even have been what the
report calls super-emitters --- people who release more particles than
others during speech.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the total number of cases in Skagit County was
406, according to the Washington Department of Public Health.

Pia MacDonald, an infectious disease epidemiologist for RTI
International, who was not part of the study, said it was remarkable
that the outbreak in the choir did not lead to more infections in the
community at large, especially considering the cases were not confirmed
until six days after the practice.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

``You still have a number of days there where people could have been
walking around in close contact with other people,'' she said.

The practice took place from 6:30 to 9 p.m., and for much of it the
choir members sat in a large room in assigned seats, correlating to how
they would sit during a performance. The seats were packed together, six
to 10 inches apart, far closer than the minimum six-foot recommendation
by the C.D.C. during the pandemic.

Because only about half the members of the choir were present, many sat
next to empty seats. But later they broke off into separate groups, and
cookies and oranges were served during a break in the back of the room.

When the practice was over, several members helped to put the chairs
away, and this contact with surfaces may also have contributed to
transmission.

Weeks earlier, Washington reported its first coronavirus case, connected
to a traveler from Wuhan, China, where the disease outbreak began, but
awareness of the coronavirus in many parts of Washington and the United
States was still in its early stages on March 10.

Ms.. Hamner and Dr. Leibrand said that on March 15, the choir director
sent an email to everyone in the choir reporting that six people had
become ill. They said that from that point forward, the members of the
choir were diligent about remaining isolated.

Three days later, they began working with the Skagit County health
department, which initiated its investigation and began doing contact
tracing. The doctors said the choir members were forthcoming and
extremely helpful, not only with maintaining self-quarantine, but also
with providing useful information that aided the investigation.

``They were the ideal group to do disease investigation with,'' Ms.
Hamner said. ``I've done disease investigations for five years now, and
that was a really nice relationship.''
