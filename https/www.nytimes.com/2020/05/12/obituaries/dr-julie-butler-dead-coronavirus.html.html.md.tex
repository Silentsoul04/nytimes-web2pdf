She owned and operated the 145th Street Animal Hospital and lived by the
principle that ``if you have it to give, you give,'' caring for animals
and opening her home to friends in need.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Not too long after she earned a doctorate from Cornell University
College of Veterinary Medicine, where she was the only African-American
graduate in her class, Dr. Julie R. Butler took over the 145th Street
Animal Hospital, for many years the only full-service vet clinic in
Harlem. Her first day was April 1, 1989.

It was tough going in the neighborhood in those years. Next door to the
hospital was a crack house. Dr. Butler's receptionist sat behind
protective glass, and her first patients were pit bulls and Rottweilers
--- big dogs owned as either protection from criminals or by the
criminals themselves.

But Dr. Butler was deeply committed to caring for animals --- she knew
she wanted to be a vet as a little girl growing up in New Rochelle, N.Y.
She loved doing surgeries, loved the complex science of it. And she
wanted to serve her African-American community. She hired and mentored
aspiring veterinarians and technicians and co-founded a nonprofit,
\href{https://www.nysave.org/}{NY Save Animals in Veterinary Emergency},
to provide funds to the owners of pets in need of emergency care.

``I rarely saw my mother turn anyone away,'' Zora Howard, Dr. Butler's
daughter, said. ``She had something built into the fabric of who she
was, that she passed down to my brother and I: If you have the means to
give, you give. If you have the roof to shelter, you shelter.''

Dr. Butler died on April 4 at her home in Harlem. She was 62. The cause
was complications of the novel coronavirus, Ms. Howard said.

Even after 30 years, her practice was a high-wire act. As a sole
practitioner, Dr. Butler worked long hours, often getting home well past
midnight. Overhead, equipment and staffing were all increasingly costly.
She had clients who owed her money and she was never going to see that
money.

``She was never really focused on the business side,'' Dr. Butler's
husband, Claude Howard, said. ``She was interested in the animals. There
were people that swore by her because she saved their animals' lives.''

Julie Renee Butler was born on June 11, 1957, in Washington, D.C., the
oldest of five children. Her father, Leroy Butler, was an electronics
technician; her mother, Naomi (Bryant) Butler, was a teacher at New
Rochelle High School. The family moved to the town when Julie was 4.

In addition to her husband and daughter, Dr. Butler is survived by her
son, Alex Howard, and four siblings, two of whom became physicians.

After practicing for a few years at the ASPCA clinic in Brooklyn, Dr.
Butler and her husband settled in Harlem, where at first they lived in a
one-room apartment above the animal hospital. Later, they bought and
restored a historic Beaux-Arts limestone townhouse five blocks away.

The house was always filled with people --- extended family, someone Dr.
Butler knew through church who needed a place to stay, her children's
friends who appreciated her larger-than-life personality, her artistic
side (she sang in a choir and made clothes) and her home-cooked meals.

``In the wake of my mother passing, we've had people from the depths of
time reaching out, saying, `I don't know where I'd be if not for your
mother,''' Ms. Howard said. ``How she reverberated beyond these five
blocks, beyond this family, has become ever more apparent.''
