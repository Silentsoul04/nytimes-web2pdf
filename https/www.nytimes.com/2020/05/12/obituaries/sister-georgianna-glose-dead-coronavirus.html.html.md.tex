Sister Glose, who died from complications of the novel coronavirus, ran
a nonprofit in Brooklyn and was a whistle-blower in a sex abuse scandal.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

If you passed Georgianna Glose on the streets of Fort Greene, Brooklyn,
you might have known her as that renegade nun, the one who left her
convent to live among the poor and then blew a whistle on sexual abuse
in the Catholic Church.

She was a sister with movie-star looks who roller-skated to work, having
shed the nun's habit in 1972 for the curler-coiffed hairdo then in vogue
(a look she stubbornly kept).

But if you were homeless, you probably knew her as Dr. Glose, the nun
with a doctorate who, until last month, ran a nonprofit on Myrtle
Avenue. It was there, for 24 years, that the downtrodden found an anchor
in a gentrifying neighborhood.

Mothers on welfare, fathers on parole, grandparents struggling to raise
their children's children --- they all had a haven with Sister Glose,
taking her computer literacy classes, joining her support groups,
feasting on her Thanksgiving turkey.

``She was able to live in both worlds: the world of making a difference
for individual families and the world of making policy changes,'' said
Steven Banks, the city's commissioner of social services.

Sister Glose died on April 28 at Brooklyn Hospital Center from
complications of the new coronavirus, said her sister, Kathrine Dawson.
She was 73.

Authority neither impressed nor deterred her. ``If someone was
misbehaving, especially a man in a position of power, she would say
calmly and completely accurately, `That man is a horse's ass,''' said
Teresa Theophano, a social worker who interned with Sister Glose at her
nonprofit, \href{http://www.fortgreenesnap.org/}{Fort Greene Strategic
Neighborhood Action Partnership}.

For years, Sister Glose documented the gruesome conditions at Auburn
Family Residence, a city-run shelter nearby, and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/nyregion/new-york-is-removing-over-400-children-from-2-homeless-shelters.html}{pushed
for reforms}.

``She would never give in,'' said Sister Sally Butler, who lived with
Sister Glose for 51 years, serving in the same Roman Catholic order, the
Sisters of St. Dominic of Amityville, N.Y.

Georgianna Inez Glose was born on Dec. 1, 1946, to Helen and Rudolph
Glose, the descendants of Slovak immigrants who lived in Astoria,
Queens, and worked as superintendents of an apartment building. The
second of four siblings, Sister Glose contracted polio at 5. She had to
learn how to walk again, which made her ``determined to never let her
physical ailments hold her back,'' Sister Butler said.

After high school, Sister Glose joined the Dominican order and majored
in philosophy at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, N.Y., not far from
her first ministry assignment teaching fifth grade.

That was the traditional route, a nun in habit instructing Catholic
school children. But when a shortage of American priests met with the
women's liberation movement, a new door opened for Sister Glose: she
could take on pastoral duties formerly reserved for men.

Thus began what Sister Glose once described as ``the experiment.'' She
left her convent in 1969 for Fort Greene, joining Sister Butler and a
third nun to serve with the priests of St. Michaels-St. Edward Church.

She earned a master's degree at Hunter College and a doctorate in social
welfare at City University of New York, writing her dissertation on the
institutional racism experienced by African-American Catholic nuns.

Her stature rose. She became the chair of the Human Services Department,
where she focused on social work, at the New York City College of
Technology and the president of a national human services consortium.

One of her darkest moments came in 1993, when she and Sister Butler
heard that the priests in their parish had sexually abused children.
They reported this to the Brooklyn Diocese, and eventually
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/15/nyregion/bitterness-in-brooklyn-diocese-over-abuse-case.html}{went
public with the case}, driving a lasting wedge between the nuns and the
church hierarchy.

Along with her sister, she is survived by her brother, Michael.

True to form, Sister Glose kept her nonprofit in Fort Greene open when
the pandemic hit. After landing in the hospital, she called one of her
best friends, Victor Ayala, to say goodbye. She wasted no time cutting
to the chase: Would Mr. Ayala, a colleague, please take over her
classes?

``She's about to go under a respirator and she's calling to tell me what
to do with the students,'' Mr. Ayala said. ``It's classic Georgianna.
Her humanity was just so alive.''
