# Fearing a Second Wave, Cal State Will Keep Classes Online in the Fall

</div>

The move by the nation’s largest four-year public university system
comes as many other schools insist they will find a way to bring
students back to campus despite the coronavirus.

SACRAMENTO — In the most sweeping sign yet of the long-term impact of
the coronavirus on American higher education, California State
University, the nation’s largest four-year public university system,
said on Tuesday that classes at its 23 campuses would be canceled for
the fall semester, with instruction taking place almost exclusively
online.

The system is the first large American university to tell students they
will not be returning to campus in the fall. Most of the nation’s
colleges and universities have gone out of their way to say they intend
to reopen, but they are also making backup plans for online classes.

The pandemic has had a [devastating impact on the
finances](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-colleges-universities-admissions.html)
of colleges and universities, a large number of which were already
struggling before virus-related closures. Many are concerned about
growing signs that a large number of students [will choose to sit
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/coronavirus-college-enrollment.html)
the fall semester if classes remain virtual, or demand hefty cuts in
tuition.

A [$14 billion federal
bailout](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/colleges-universities-coronavirus.html)
passed by Congress this spring will not be enough to save some
universities if enrollment drops significantly, experts said, and for
many students, the in-person experience is a significant part of higher
education’s draw.

But the chancellor of the California State University system, Timothy P.
White, [told the board of
trustees](https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/board-of-trustees/livestream/Pages/livestream.aspx)
on Tuesday that the risks were too great for the more than 480,000
undergraduates enrolled at the Cal States, as they are known, to return
to campus in the fall. Classes will continue virtually, as they have
since March.

“Our university, when open without restrictions and fully in person, as
is the traditional norm of the past, is a place where over 500,000
people come together in close and vibrant proximity with each other on a
daily basis,” he said. “That approach, sadly, just isn’t in the cards
now.”

McGill University in Montreal, one of Canada’s most prestigious

saying it will offer most of its courses online in September.

Mr. White allowed for the possibility of exceptions. If health and
safety precautions permit, clinical classes in the nursing program could
be held in person, he said, as could certain science labs and other
essential instruction.

Experts said Cal State’s decision could have a significant impact.

“Cal State is an extraordinarily large and important university system
and an awful lot of other institutions will watch this development
carefully,” said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American
Council on Education, a trade association of college presidents.

The Chronicle of Higher Education has been [keeping a running
tally](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626)
of what American colleges are planning to do for the fall. Only a
handful of schools, mostly small ones, have said they are leaning toward
online-only classes, including Wayne State University in Detroit, a
virus hot spot, and Sierra College outside Sacramento. A few say they
are planning a hybrid model. But the vast majority say they are planning
for in-person classes.

Brown University’s president, Christina Paxson, [said in a New York
Times
Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/opinion/coronavirus-colleges-universities.html)
late last month that reopening campuses this fall “should be a national
priority.”

Size, location and population density could play a big role in what
universities decide, Mr. Hartle said.

On Monday, Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., population 111,000,
announced its “commitment to resume on-campus classes” for about 5,000
students in the fall, saying, “The midsize of Bradley and the small-city
setting of Peoria make it easier for students to maintain safe distances
and avoid unnecessary exposure to potentially dangerous germs.”

California’s other four-year university system, the University of
California, with nearly 300,000 students on 10 campuses, has not
announced whether its fall classes will be held online, in-person or a
mix. But faculty members there say plans are being drawn up for all
three contingencies. The Board of Regents is expected to discuss
systemwide plans at a meeting next week.

Cal State’s announcement came as Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top
infectious disease expert, [told a Senate
panel](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/us/politics/fauci-cdc-coronavirus-senate-testimony.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)
on Tuesday that needless “suffering and death” could result if states
move too quickly to reopen schools and businesses.

Mr. White, the Cal State chancellor, noted that academic researchers and
public health experts were predicting a “second, smaller wave” of the
coronavirus this summer, “followed by a very significant wave” in the
fall and another wave in the first quarter of next year.

With no vaccine on the immediate horizon, Mr. White told the system’s
trustees that “it would be irresponsible” to postpone a decision on
in-person classes until summer, only to be forced to retreat hastily to
remote learning in the fall.

Better, he said, to plan for the worst and hope for the best in
September.

“This,” he said, “is our new and expensive reality.”
