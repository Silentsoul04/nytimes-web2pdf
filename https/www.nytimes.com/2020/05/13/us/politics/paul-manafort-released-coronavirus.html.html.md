WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman,
was released from prison on Wednesday and granted confinement in his
home in Northern Virginia because of the coronavirus pandemic, said one
of his lawyers, Todd Blanche.

Mr. Manafort had been in a minimum-security prison in Loretto, Pa.,
serving a [sentence of seven and a half
years](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing.html)
for financial and lobbying violations related to his work for a corrupt
Ukrainian politician.

[Prisons and jails across the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-prisons-jails.html)
have been hot spots for the spread of the virus, though there were no
recorded cases among inmates or staff at the facility where Mr. Manafort
was held.

Attorney General William P. Barr [ordered the Bureau of
Prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/barr-coronavirus-prisons-release.html)
in April to determine which federal inmates could be safely released to
home confinement. He directed the bureau to “give priority in
implementing these new standards to the most vulnerable inmates and the
most affected facilities.” More than 2,500 inmates have been released to
home confinement because of the virus since late March, according to
Bureau of Prisons data.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In mid-April, [Mr. Manafort’s lawyers asked the
bureau](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000171-76cd-d6b1-a3f1-f6dd06590000)
to release their client to home confinement. The lawyers said he was at
high risk of contracting the virus because of his age, 71, and
pre-existing health conditions. Also, he was hospitalized in February
after contracting the flu and
bronchitis.

A person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak
publicly about it said the Bureau of Prisons decided to release Mr.
Manafort to home confinement because of his underlying health
conditions, even though he did not meet a time-served threshold. The
person said the bureau had the discretion to make these decisions.

The charges against Mr. Manafort [stemmed from the investigation by the
special
counsel](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/manafort-trump-campaign-data-kilimnik.html),
Robert S. Mueller III, into possible ties between Russia and the 2016
Trump campaign, but the cases did not involve his five months of
political work for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, [Michael D.
Cohen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/nyregion/michael-cohen-release-prison-otisville-virus.html),
had also been told last month that he would be released to home
confinement because of virus concerns. He had been expected to be home
by May 1, but he remains in quarantine in a medium-security prison in
Otisville, N.Y., said a person familiar with his situation. Another
person familiar with Mr. Cohen’s incarceration said he would be eligible
to be released to home confinement when he has served half of his
sentence, which will be this month.

Mr. Cohen has been serving three years for violating campaign finance
laws in part related to a scheme to pay hush money to two women who said
they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the affairs
and publicly criticized Mr. Cohen, who once said he would [take a bullet
for Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen.html).

Some inmates and staff at the Otisville prison have tested positive for
the coronavirus and have since recovered, but it has not been as
widespread there as it has been at other detention
centers.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Mr. Trump has publicly praised Mr. Manafort. After Mr. Manafort was
convicted, the president said his former campaign chairman [“refused to
‘break’”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032256443985084417)
under pressure from prosecutors, unlike Mr. Cohen.

“I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family,” Mr.
Trump said at the time. “Such respect for a brave man\!”

Last June, Mr. Manafort was to be transferred to the Rikers Island jail
complex in New York City to await [state mortgage fraud
charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/nyregion/manafort-indictment.html),
as is typically done with most federal inmates in that position. But the
Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons,
[intervened](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/nyregion/manafort-rikers.html?searchResultPosition=6)to
ensure that Mr. Manafort would not be moved from the low-security
facility in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Manafort was indicted in New York as part of an effort by the
Manhattan district attorney to ensure he would face time in prison, even
if Mr. Trump pardoned him for his federal crimes. [In December, a judge
dismissed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/nyregion/paul-manafort-ny-fraud-charges.html)
the state charges.

Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie
Haberman and William K. Rashbaum from New York.
