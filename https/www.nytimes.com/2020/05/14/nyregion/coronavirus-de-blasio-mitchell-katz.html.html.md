As Mayor Bill de Blasio was resisting calls in March to cancel large
gatherings and slow the spread of the coronavirus in New York City, he
found behind-the-scenes support from a trusted voice: the head of his
public hospital system, Dr. Mitchell Katz.

There was “no proof that closures will help stop the spread,” Dr. Katz
wrote in an email to the mayor’s closest aides. He believed that banning
large events would hurt the economy and sow fear. “If it is not safe to
go to a conference, why is it safe to go to the hospital or ride in the
subway?” he wrote. And, he said, many New Yorkers were going to get
infected anyway.

“We have to accept that unless a vaccine is rapidly developed, large
numbers of people will get infected,” he wrote. “The good thing is
greater than 99 percent will recover without harm. Once people recover
they will have immunity. The immunity will protect the herd.”

For Mr. de Blasio, the arguments in Dr. Katz’s March 10 email, obtained
by The New York Times, appeared to hold sway over the calls for greater
restrictions on daily life from top Health Department officials, who
were alarmed by public health surveillance data pointing toward a
looming outbreak.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mayor did not order major closures, including of schools and
restaurants, until almost a week after the email — [a delay that
epidemiologists say allowed the virus to
spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-response-delays.html).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, as the crisis in New York City enters the next stage, Mr. de
Blasio, Dr. Katz and Health Department officials are once again
navigating a nasty public fissure.

Health experts fear that their rift may threaten the city’s ability to
limit the spread of the disease once the city — which has seen more than
20,000 people die of the virus — begins to reopen.

The mayor last week shocked the Health Department by taking away its
authority to oversee contact tracing, [giving the
job](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/nyregion/coronavirus-contact-tracing-nyc.html)
to Health and Hospitals, the agency overseen by Dr. Katz. It is a
monumental task: The city must build and run an army of some 2,500
people to track and trace the close contacts of every infected person.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mayor’s decision to shift the responsibility to the public hospital
system illustrated how Mr. de Blasio’s faith in Dr. Katz’s leadership
abilities took precedence over the experience and knowledge of his
public health officials, who have clashed with the mayor over a variety
of issues.

Epidemiologists, former public health officials and the city comptroller
criticized the move, pointing out that the Health Department has for
decades expertly performed contact tracing for diseases like
tuberculosis and H.I.V., and had been preparing for two weeks to run the
expanded tracing operation for Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus.

On Tuesday, the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, requested documents
from City Hall as part of a formal investigation into the city’s
response to the pandemic, including its handling of public health
recommendations. On Friday, the City Council will hold a hearing on the
mayor’s decision to give Health and Hospitals control of the contact
tracing effort.

Even the person who ran the city’s hospital system before Dr. Katz
thought the move was a mistake.

“It is a head-scratcher. I can’t figure out the rationale, and I don’t
think it’s worth the risks,” said Stanley Brezenoff, [who was
chosen](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/nyregion/chief-of-new-yorks-struggling-public-hospital-system-is-resigning.html)
by Mr. de Blasio in 2016 to temporarily lead Health and Hospitals. “Just
because they both have ‘health’ in the name doesn’t mean they’re in the
same
business.”

“I’m second to none in my admiration for Mitch’s clinical prowess,” Mr.
Brezenoff added, “but this is a job for the Health Department.”

Dr. Katz, who is well regarded in the hospitals field, declined to
comment for this article. His defenders said it was important to view
his March 10 email about keeping the city open within the context of
that time. Public health experts were wrestling with a highly unusual
series of factors, and there was a wide range of opinions about how to
respond.

The mayor’s press secretary, Freddi Goldstein, when asked about the
March 10 email, said that the mayor had sought advice from many experts,
and that a range of individuals including Dr. Katz and the health
commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, “gave the best advice based on what
they knew at that time.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Goldstein said the decision to place its new contact tracing corps
under the control of Health and Hospitals was rooted in the need for a
“single, streamlined entity” to manage the program, along with the
city’s diagnostic testing efforts and oversight of care for infected
patients isolated in hotels.

“While the academic and expert knowledge that the Health Department
brings are essential pieces,” Ms. Goldstein said in an email, “the
ability to rely on the organizational infrastructure that H+H brings is
also essential.”

The mayor, she said, wanted the city to “capitalize on both.”

Mr. de Blasio, Dr. Katz and senior city officials have insisted that
Health and Hospitals — a quasi-private organization controlled by the
government — was chosen largely for practical reasons. Because of its
structure, it could hire people and award contracts more quickly than
the Health Department, a city agency that generally must follow city
procurement policies.

But during the coronavirus crisis, the hiring and contracts had already
been taken over by a foundation, the Fund for Public Health in New York,
which works with the Health Department; the city has also streamlined
Covid-19-related spending by suspending typical procurement
requirements.

Ms. Goldstein contended that Health and Hospitals had built-in
advantages, including access to supply chains, clinical surge staffing
contracts, telemedicine and reference lab contracts. It made sense to
give the tracing program to the hospitals, she added, so that the major
components of the city’s future efforts to control the virus — testing,
tracing, isolation — could be run under one roof.

An effective contact tracing program must be up and running before New
Yorkers can begin to safely emerge from their lockdown, public health
officials said. Getting such a system ready is a daunting challenge —
even without any stumbles or political
infighting.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But since taking office in 2014, Mr. de Blasio has found himself
routinely at odds with his own public health officials, differing on
issues including a proposed ban on horse carriages in Central Park and
an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in the Bronx.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Current and former administration officials said the conflict stemmed
from Mr. de Blasio’s apparent distrust of experts and his
dissatisfaction with public health recommendations, which are often
based on scientific analysis of imperfect and at times incomplete
information.

The mayor prizes certainty, decisiveness and directness, aides and
former officials said. Dr. Katz, who came to New York after holding top
public health positions in San Francisco and Los Angeles, often
presented Mr. de Blasio with information in the way the mayor favored.

“He understands the importance of making clear, definitive decisions for
the top elected official he’s working for,” Eric Phillips, the mayor’s
former press secretary who now works in crisis management for the public
relations firm Edelman, said of Dr. Katz. “That’s why the mayor trusts
his judgment. Dr. Katz is not afraid to take a complicated subject, give
his opinion and make a recommendation.”

That dynamic emerged again in the early days of the coronavirus
outbreak. By the second week of March, the city’s public health warning
system — known as [the syndromic surveillance
system](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&PopulationSource=Syndromic)
— began strongly signaling the spread of a flulike illness, officials
said.

City Hall wanted to see firm numbers of positive test results before
ordering closures. Publicly, as well as in guidance to other agencies as
late as March 9, the Health Department was not recommending the closure
of events, like the city’s half marathon, according to an email shared
with The Times.

But inside the department, staff members were deeply concerned that
their warnings were not getting through. Some were ready to walk out in
protest; others were threatening to quit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In his March 10 email to top city officials, Dr. Katz made the case that
keeping the city open was the best approach at the time.

“Canceling large gatherings gives people the wrong impression of this
illness,” he wrote. “Many of the events are being canceled anyway, and
fewer people are going out. However, it is very different when the
government starts telling people to do this.”

He wrote that Italy “is having a terrible problem that I do not believe
we will have,” and ended the message by arguing that shutting down
events could create fear among some with mental health issues.

“If even a few people with serious mental illness become more isolated
or fearful due to messaging, we could have more permanent harm than we
currently have with Covid-19,” he wrote in the email, which was sent to
three deputy mayors, top health officials and the budget director.

Ms. Goldstein said Dr. Katz stood by his concern over the harm caused by
isolation to those with mental illness and by his comments on herd
immunity.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

She added that if there was anything to be second-guessed, it would be
the shifting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control. “The C.D.C.
repeatedly misled us and greatly hampered our ability to catch and
respond to this disease,” she said.

Part of Dr. Katz’s reasoning in March for opposing closures,
particularly of city schools, was that it would lead to health care
workers not showing up to work — a concern shared by leaders of New
York’s private hospitals. Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the
Greater New York Hospital Association, said large gatherings were a
“corollary issue” to the question of closing schools.

Michael Dowling, the chief executive of Northwell Health, the state’s
largest health care provider, said, “Mitch was asking questions that a
lot of people were asking at that point.”

But Mr. Dowling also recalled that on March 10, the day that Dr. Katz
sent the email, Northwell decided to cancel all of its in-person
executive meetings, after a top hospital leader involved in the pandemic
response tested positive for Covid-19.

That same day, Dr. Katz appeared with the mayor at a news conference at
Bellevue Hospital, one of 11 public hospitals in the city’s system. In
spite of signs that the virus’s presence was growing, Dr. Katz gave an
optimistic report, saying the system was ready to handle a surge in
patients.

His confidence — and his arguments in favor of keeping the city open —
increased his stature with the mayor, said two people with knowledge of
City Hall discussions.

His influence grew further during that period in March, as the mayor
sought an expansion of testing and the city began opening testing sites
at public hospitals. The Health Department objected at the time, saying
that outpatient testing sites would draw those with the disease into
contact with those who were not yet infected.

Mr. de Blasio’s decision to take the contact tracing program away from
Health Department leadership may have been the most public example of
their fractured relationship, but their conflicts stretch back to the
mayor’s first term.

Aides to the mayor, looking to help him deliver a campaign promise to
ban horse-drawn carriages from Central Park, sought assistance from the
Health Department, said Daniel Kass, a former deputy health
commissioner.

“City Hall tried to enlist the Health Department to support the argument
that the stables were unfit, and that horses were injured at a high rate
on the streets in New York,” Mr. Kass said. “The Health Department had
no data to support those arguments.”

The rift widened during the Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in 2015 in
the Bronx that killed 12 people. The Health Department had identified
five buildings in the Bronx as the source of the disease, but Mr. de
Blasio wanted the department to test cooling towers broadly across the
city.

That struck officials as illogical, but Mr. de Blasio was insistent. In
one gathering of roughly 50 people at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, the
mayor appeared eager for other city agencies to step in, and he looked
to his buildings commissioner for possible assistance.

“Do you need helicopters?” Mr. de Blasio asked, according to a person
who was present at the meeting. The dumbfounded buildings commissioner
said he did not. Mr. de Blasio upbraided him, and then stormed out of
the meeting.

“The mayor was elected to protect and advocate for New Yorkers — that’s
what he did,” Ms. Goldstein said of the Legionnaires’ episode.

Another flare-up emerged during the coronavirus outbreak, when the mayor
interceded in an argument in late March between Dr. Barbot and Terence
Monahan, the highest-ranking uniformed member of the Police Department.
Chief Monahan had demanded that the Health Department relinquish
hundreds of thousands of protective masks for the police force to use.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mayor sided with Chief Monahan; the roughly seven-week-old
confrontation, [reported by The New York
Post](https://nypost.com/2020/05/13/nyc-health-commissioner-wouldnt-supply-nypd-with-masks/)
late Wednesday, led Dr. Barbot to apologize, according to her spokesman.

An official at the Health Department said Dr. Barbot’s remarks came
after Police Department officials had shown up at a secure Health
Department warehouse and tried to commandeer 500,000 N-95 masks that
were earmarked for hospitals. Chief Monahan said in an interview that
the city’s Office of Emergency Management had given the go-ahead to pick
up 250,000 masks; when police showed up to the warehouse, they were told
they were to receive only 50,000 masks.

During the confrontation, Dr. Barbot told Chief Monahan that she did not
“give two rats’ asses about your cops,” according to The Post. The
alleged remark drew vitriolic criticism from police unions, including
the Sergeants Benevolent Association, [which
referred](https://twitter.com/SBANYPD/status/1260730557190848512) to Dr.
Barbot as a “bitch” who had “blood on her hands” in a tweet.

After the mayor’s office intervened, the police were given 250,000
masks.

Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that he was not previously aware of the
heated argument, and that he planned to discuss it with Dr. Barbot. “If
what was reported was accurate, the commissioner needs to apologize to
the men and women of the N.Y.P.D.,” he said.

The episode was emblematic of the growing rift between City Hall and the
Health Department, a state of affairs that Denis Nash, a professor at
the C.U.N.Y. School of Public Health who served as director of
H.I.V./AIDS surveillance at the Health Department, said was “incredibly
tragic.”

“It seems to be getting worse when we’re in the middle of a public
health crisis,” he said. “I worry that a rift like that could cost many
lives in New York.”
