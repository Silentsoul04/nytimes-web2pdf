\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

They were men without a country, flying combat missions against the same
Nazi war machine that had overwhelmed their native Poland in the
Blitzkrieg. Their uncommon valor during World War II made the Polish
pilots fighting for the Allies into an example of determination in the
face of adversity.

Jerzy Glowczewski, 97, flew 100 missions for the No. 308 ``City of
Krakow'' Polish fighter squadron, according to Poland's Institute of
National Remembrance. He was widely believed to have been the last
surviving member of the valiant brotherhood of exiles who fought with
the Royal Air Force when he died on April 13 of Covid-19 in a nursing
home in Manhattan.

On New Year's Day in 1945, Mr. Glowczewski helped turn back the final
major offensive on the Western front by the German Luftwaffe, shooting
down a Focke-Wulf 190 over Belgium from his Spitfire fighter plane. ``As
I looked over my shoulder, the Focke-Wulf was a crumbling crucifix
against the bright, morning sky. Another explosion, it tumbled down,''
he wrote in his memoirs.

``It was probably one of the last classic dogfights in which survival
depended on the acrobatic skill and lightning reflexes of the pilot,''
he added.

Jerzy Eligiusz Glowczewski was born on Nov. 19, 1922, in Warsaw. His
father owned a lithographic printing company and died in a car accident
when Jerzy was 6; his mother, Jozefa, took over the business. A
rebellious child, he was sent to a strict Jesuit-run school for what he
called ``problem boys.''

He was 16 when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939 and his life turned into
something out of the pages of
an\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/books/review/alan-fursts-a-hero-of-france.html}{Alan
Furst}World War II-era spy novel. He escaped Warsaw with his stepfather
and was nearly killed in a strafing run by a German plane as they tried
to join the remnants of the Polish army. As refugees they lived in
Bucharest and then in Tel Aviv.

Mr. Glowczewski served with the Allies in the Independent Carpathian
Rifle Brigade in Egypt and on the front lines in Libya before traveling
to Britain to train as a pilot.

He returned to war-shattered Poland after the German surrender and
enrolled at the Warsaw University of Technology's faculty of
architecture, graduating in 1952. As an architect, he worked on the
reconstruction of the Polish capital's badly damaged old town and
designed several industrial projects around the country. He married
Irena (known as Lenta) Henisz and they had a daughter, Klara
Glowczewska.

In 1961 he visited the United States on a Ford Foundation grant, which
led to a teaching position at North Carolina State University. He lived
in Egypt for two years starting in 1965 when he directed the project for
the redevelopment of Aswan, under the aegis of the Ford Foundation, as
the Soviets were building the massive Aswan High Dam. In Cairo he struck
up a friendship with a local professor,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/boutros-boutros-ghali-death.html}{Boutros
Boutros-Ghali}, who later became secretary-general of the United
Nations.

Mr. Glowczewski had to flee Egypt in 1967 as the war with Israel broke
out, leaving with his wife, daughter and their dachshund, Romulus. In
his later years he taught at the Pratt Institute in New York and wrote
his memoirs, which were published in three volumes in Polish and
translated and released in English in a single volume, ``The Accidental
Immigrant'' (2007).

Along with his daughter, he is survived by two grandchildren. Ms.
Glowczewska said that her father thought of himself first and foremost
as an architect and was surprised by the attention his wartime service
received late in life.

In his memoir, Mr. Glowczewski wrote about a stopover in Istanbul after
fleeing the Gestapo in Bucharest. ``We sometimes pondered how
serendipitous our lives as refugees have been since we have left home,''
he wrote. ``We neither dwelled on the past nor anticipated the future.''
