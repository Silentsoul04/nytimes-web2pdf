\section{TikTok Broke Privacy Promises, Children's Groups
Say}\label{tiktok-broke-privacy-promises-childrens-groups-say}}

Twenty consumer groups said the video app had failed to make some
changes it agreed to carry out last year to settle federal charges.

TikTok, the popular app for making and sharing short videos, has flouted
an
\href{https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/musical.ly_proposed_order_ecf_2-27-19.pdf}{agreement}
it made with the Federal Trade Commission to protect the privacy of
children on the service, a coalition of 20 children's and consumer
groups said on Thursday.

Last year, TikTok
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/ftc-tiktok-child-privacy-fine.html}{agreed
to make major changes} to settle charges that one of its predecessor
companies, Musical.ly, had violated the federal
\href{https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children\%27s-privacy}{children's
online privacy law}. The alleged violations included collecting names,
email addresses, videos and other personal information from users under
the age of 13 without a parent's consent.

\href{https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/video-social-networking-app-musically-agrees-settle-ftc}{Federal
regulators said} at the time that the app had made users' information
public by default, which meant that a child's user name, picture and
videos could seen by others. The agency also said adults had used the
video-sharing app to try to message children.

As part of the settlement, the video-sharing app agreed to obtain a
parent's permission before collecting their child's personal
information. It also agreed to delete personal information, including
videos, of any children identified as younger than 13 and to remove
videos and other personal details of users whose ages were unknown.

But the consumer groups, led by the
\href{https://commercialfreechildhood.org/}{Campaign for a Commercial
Free Childhood} and the \href{https://www.democraticmedia.org/}{Center
for Digital Democracy}, said in a complaint to the F.T.C. that TikTok
had failed to abide by its commitments. Among other things, the
complaint identified a number of videos posted by children under 13 in
2016 that TikTok had not deleted and that remain on the app.

The groups also identified problems with age verification for younger
users. Last year, the app set up a service for children under 13, TikTok
for Younger Users, which prevents them from posting videos and does not
collect their personal data. But the complaint said a child who
initially registered for a TikTok account for younger users could
instantly delete it and sign up for an over-13 account on the same
mobile device simply by using a fake birth date.

(A reporter who tested this on Tuesday was able to set up an account for
a user older than 13 after deleting a children's account she had
registered.)

``For years, TikTok has ignored'' the children's privacy law, ``thereby
ensnaring perhaps millions of underage children in its marketing
apparatus, and putting children at risk of sexual predation,'' said Josh
Golin, the executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free
Childhood. ``Now, even after being caught red-handed by the F.T.C.,
TikTok continues to flout the law.''

In an emailed statement, a TikTok spokesperson said: ``We take privacy
seriously and are committed to helping ensure that TikTok continues to
be a safe and entertaining community for our users.''

TikTok's popularity is soaring among Americans sheltering at home during
the pandemic. The app was downloaded about 11 million times by new users
in the United States in March, nearly twice the total in December,
according to Sensor Tower, a company that tracks app usage data.

Members of Congress have raised
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html}{national
security concerns} about TikTok's growing influence and about the risk
that the app may share user data with its parent company, ByteDance, a
Chinese conglomerate. ByteDance
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/business/dealbook/musically-sold-app-video.html}{bought
Musical.ly for \$1 billion} in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, an app it
already owned.
