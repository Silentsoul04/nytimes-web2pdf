\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Antonio González Pacheco, a Spanish police officer who was accused of
torturing opponents of Gen. Francisco Franco's regime, died on May 7 at
a hospital in Madrid. He was 73.

Local media reports said the cause was Covid-19, but officials at the
hospital, San Francisco de Asís, declined to comment.

Spain's deputy prime minister, Pablo Iglesias, said on Twitter that it
was shameful ``for democracy and also for us as a government'' that Mr.
González Pacheco died without ever standing trial for the crimes he was
accused of during the Franco dictatorship. The government announced
earlier this year that it would strip him of the police decorations he
had received.

Mr. González Pacheco was born on Oct. 10, 1946, in Aldea del Cano, a
town in Spain's western region of Extremadura.

After joining the police in the 1960s, he climbed the ranks to become,
in 1971, an inspector in a special brigade charged with investigating
and detaining political opponents of Franco's dictatorship. Many of them
were underground members of the Communist Party, which had been declared
illegal.

He had a habit of twirling his pistol in front of detainees, earning him
the nickname ``Billy the Kid.'' People who later accused him of torture
said he would beat detainees on the soles of their feet, hit them while
they were handcuffed to a radiator or left hanging from a bar, or force
their heads under water.

After Franco's death in 1975, Mr. González Pacheco switched to a new
brigade, assigned to investigate terrorism activities at a time when
Spain was trying to consolidate its return to democracy. He was
decorated in 1977 after helping to liberate Antonio María de Oriol y
Urquijo, a politician who had been taken hostage by the First of October
Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups, a Marxist-Leninist terrorist
organization known in Spain by its acronym, Grapo.

He retired in the early 1980s, then worked in corporate security.

Several relatives of Franco's victims sought his prosecution but failed
to make headway in Spain's criminal justice system. They then took the
case to Argentina, after a judge in Buenos Aires began investigating a
series of Franco-era crimes under the doctrine of universal
jurisdiction.

In 2013, the Argentine judge, María Servini de Cubría, issued an
international arrest warrant for Mr. González Pacheco on 13 counts of
torture as part of the broader investigation.

Mr. González Pacheco denied any wrongdoing. A year later, the national
court of Spain rejected Argentina's extradition request on the grounds
that the statute of limitations on the charges had expired. Mr. González
Pacheco's lawyers argued that the charges, in any case, concerned events
covered by an amnesty law approved in 1977.

Information on survivors was not immediately available.
