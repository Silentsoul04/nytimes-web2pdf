# DeVos Funnels Coronavirus Relief Funds to Favored Private and Religious Schools

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, using discretion written into the
coronavirus stabilization law, is using millions of dollars to pursue
long-sought policy goals that Congress has blocked.

WASHINGTON — Education Secretary [Betsy
DeVos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-betsy-devos-student-debt-forgiveness.html)
is using the $2 trillion coronavirus stabilization law to throw a
lifeline to education sectors she has long championed, directing
millions of federal dollars intended primarily for public schools and
colleges to private and religious schools.

[The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security
Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html),
signed in late March, included $30 billion for education institutions
turned upside down by the pandemic shutdowns, about $14 billion for
higher education, $13.5 billion to elementary and secondary schools, and
the rest for state governments.

Ms. DeVos has used $180 million of those dollars to encourage states to
create “microgrants” that parents of elementary and secondary school
students can use to pay for educational services, including private
school tuition. She has directed school districts to share millions of
dollars designated for low-income students with wealthy private schools.

And she has nearly depleted the 2.5 percent of higher education funding,
about $350 million, set aside for struggling colleges to bolster small
colleges — many of them private, religious or on the margins of higher
education — regardless of need. The Wright Graduate University for the
Realization of Human Potential, a private college in Wisconsin that has
a [website debunking claims that it is a
cult](http://www.wrightinstitutecult.com), was allocated about $495,000.
All of the colleges could apply for the funds or reject them, and Wright
officials said the school did not claim the funds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bergin University of Canine Studies in California said its $472,850
allocation was a “godsend.”

“I think we are one of the most important educational institutions out
there right now,” said its founder, Bonnie Bergin, who is credited with
inventing the service dog.

On the Senate floor this week, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New
York and the minority leader, accused Ms. DeVos of “exploiting
congressional relief efforts.” He said she had been “using a portion of
that funding not to help states or localities cope with the crisis, but
to augment her push for voucherlike programs, a prior initiative that
has nothing to do with Covid-19.”

House Democrats included language in [a stimulus bill set for a vote on
Friday](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200511/BILLS-116hr6800ih.pdf)
that would limit Ms. DeVos’s ability to use about $58 billion in
additional education relief for K-12 school districts for private
schools. Congress has largely rejected Ms. DeVos’s proposals to create
programs that resemble private school vouchers, and public education
groups say Ms. DeVos is abusing discretion granted to her under the
emergency legislation to achieve a long-held agenda.

“And it only took a pandemic,” said Sasha Pudelski, the advocacy
director at the AASA, the School Superintendents Association.

The Education Department called the accusation “absurd.” But in a
statement, the department said that every student and teacher had been
affected by the pandemic. “The current disruption to our education
system has reaffirmed what Secretary DeVos has been saying for years: We
need to rethink education for all students, of every age, no matter the
type of school setting,” it said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. DeVos has long held that taxpayer funds should be available for
private school tuition, giving parents the chance to escape failing
public schools and public education competition to drive
improvement.

A spokesman for Republican members of the House Education Committee
defended Ms. DeVos’s actions: “While there are likely multiple ways the
secretary could have interpreted this broadly written law, the language
the appropriators wrote gave her the flexibility to implement it as she
has done.”

The most contentious move is [guidance that directs school districts to
increase the share of
dollars](https://www.chalkbeat.org/2020/5/5/21248179/equitable-services-coronavirus-private-schools)
they spend on students in private schools. Under federal education law,
school districts are required to use funding they receive for their
poorest students to provide “equitable services,” such as tutoring and
transportation for low-income students attending private schools in
their districts. But the department said districts should use their
emergency funding, which was doled out based on student poverty rates,
to support all students attending private schools in their districts,
regardless of income.

Her guidance comes as elementary and secondary education groups lobby
Congress for billions of additional dollars to lift students out of the
educational crisis caused by the pandemic. In big cities, which serve
the most vulnerable students, district leaders are projecting [budget
shortfalls of up to 25
percent](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/05/12/carranza-city-is-facing-most-horrific-budget-this-school-system-has-ever-seen-1283528)
because of collapsing tax revenues, said the Council of the Great City
Schools, which represents 76 of the nation’s large urban districts. Its
member districts said they could be forced to lay off 275,000 teachers.

In New York City, Chancellor Richard A. Carranza [told City Council
members on
Tuesday](https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/5/12/21256562/nyc-education-department-state-budget-cuts)
that the school district was facing “the most horrific budget” it had
ever seen.

The federal Education Department said if school districts were to count
only poor students, “they would be placing nonpublic school students and
teachers at a disadvantage that Congress did not intend.”

“It’s sad, but unsurprising, that some would put their own financial
interests ahead of the needs of all students and teachers,” the
department said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Educators are pleading with the department to revise or rescind the
guidance. In Montana, school officials estimate that compliance would
shift more than $1.5 million to private and home schools, up from about
$206,469 that the schools are due under current law. In Louisiana,
private schools would receive at least 267 percent more funding, and at
least 77 percent of the relief allocation for Orleans Parish would be
redirected, according to [a letter state that education
chiefs](https://ccsso.org/sites/default/files/2020-05/DeVosESLetter050520.pdf)
sent to Ms. DeVos. The Newark Public Schools in New Jersey [would lose
$800,000 in federal relief
funds](https://edlawcenter.org/assets/files/pdfs/School%20Funding/ELC_Letter_to_Governor_Murphy_re.pdf)
to private schools, David G. Sciarra, the executive director of the
Education Law Center, said in a letter to the governor of New Jersey
asking him to reject the guidance.

Pennsylvania’s education secretary, Pedro A. Rivera, protested to the
department that under the guidance, 53 percent more money would flow
“from most disadvantaged to more advantaged students” in urban
districts like Philadelphia, while rural districts like Northeast
Bradford would see a 932 percent increase.

“School districts can — and should — ignore this guidance, which flouts
what Congress intended to do with the CARES Act: support students who
need it the most,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American
Federation of Teachers, and Daniel A. Domenech, the executive director
of AASA.

Indiana has announced it would not enforce the guidance. [In a
memo](https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/grants/final-language-equitable-share-cares-51220.pdf),
its superintendent of public instruction, Jennifer McCormick, a
Republican, said the state “ensures that the funds are distributed
according to congressional intent and a plain reading of the law.”

“I will not play political agenda games with COVID relief funds,” she
said on Twitter.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Sister Dale McDonald, the director of public policy and educational
research at the National Catholic Educational Association, said many of
its schools would need to be cleaned, and their staffing would need to
be shored up. At least 100 member schools are at risk for not reopening
at all.

“In an emergency, kids shouldn’t have to prove they’re poor to get what
they need to continue their education,” Sister McDonald said.

A competition announced by Ms. DeVos in which states can vie for tens of
millions of dollars either to create statewide virtual schools or offer
“microgrants” is also drawing fire for mirroring voucher programs that
help parents pay for services outside the public school system. The
program also stands to [benefit virtual education
companies](https://www.the74million.org/article/betsy-devos-trumps-edsec-pick-promoted-virtual-schools-despite-dismal-results/)
that Ms. DeVos has personally invested in.

Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the House
education committee, said the competition’s point system was weighted in
favor of rural areas and voucher-friendly states, rather than those most
affected by the coronavirus.

“This program design is indistinguishable from a standard voucher scheme
and is the latest attempt by this department to promote privatization
initiatives against both the wishes of the American people, and the
intent of Congress,” he wrote to Ms. DeVos.

The microgrant program has been cheered by champions of school choice.

“They are smart to take advantage of the lag and lack of disciplined
delivery of education,” said Jeanne Allen, the chief executive of the
Center for Education Reform. “We don’t have any choice but to make
parents and families the unit of education right now.”

Trish Stevens, who has a special-needs daughter, said a program in
Arizona that was much like the microgrant proposal had been “life
changing” for her child, who is supposed to have $150-an-hour speech
therapy and $250-an-hour tutors.

“It’s like the Wild West of education right now,” she said, “and we’re
all just trying to figure it out.”

Ms. DeVos is also under fire from college educators [for disbursing
millions](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/07/small-colleges-get-millions-while-other-colleges-struggle#.XrQZ_cKvTlA.twitter)of
dollars to hundreds of small colleges that may not need it. The
coronavirus relief law set aside about $350 million for schools that
demonstrated “significant unmet needs related to expenses associated
with coronavirus.” The department was supposed to prioritize schools
that did not receive at least $500,000 from other categories of higher
education funding. Instead, Ms. DeVos used the money to ensure that
small schools received $500,000 each.

That meant outsize per-pupil allocations at [several private schools and
religious
institutions](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/allocationsfipse.pdf)
with as few as 50 students while some public community colleges received
as little as $500 a student.

Ben Miller, the vice president for postsecondary education at the
liberal Center for American Progress, said the allocations came as large
public colleges were “rationing,” and community colleges “starve.”

Aaron D. Profitt, the vice president for academic affairs at God’s Bible
School and College in Ohio, said the school did not plan to claim its
allocation because it was getting by on small donations. Ms. DeVos had
criticized elite colleges that received stimulus funding they did not
apply for and had urged schools to reject money they did not need.

“Of course, when you get a letter from the Department of Education
giving you money, you start thinking about all the good things you can
do,” Mr. Profitt said. “But when I read the CARES Act, the intention was
not to do all the good things you could do but try to meet needs. We are
trying to cooperate with the law as written.”
