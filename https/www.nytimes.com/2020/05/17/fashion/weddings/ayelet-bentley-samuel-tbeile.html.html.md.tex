Ayelet Meryl Bentley and Samuel Joshua Tbeile are to be married May 17.
Rabbi Meyer Laniado is to officiate at the Wadsworth Mansion in
Middletown, Conn.

The couple had planned to be married before 250 guests, but had to
disinvite almost all of them because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The bride, 23, will take her husband's name. She graduated from Barnard
College, and recently completed her second year of law school at
Columbia. Over the summer, she will be a legal intern with the
Organization for the Resolution of Agunot, a nonprofit group based in
Manhattan that works to eliminate abuse in the Jewish divorce process.

She is a daughter of Virginia Stallard Bentley and Rick O. Bentley of
New Preston, Conn. Her parents retired as the owners of Bentley Cedar
Furniture, which is in Sequim, Wash., and specializes in making
Adirondack-style chairs.

The groom, 23, works in Manhattan as a systems administrator for the
operations team at OkCupid, the online dating site. He graduated from
Columbia, from which he also received a master's degree in computer
security.

He is a son of Melissa Solomon Tbeile and Dr. Isaac Tbeile of Brooklyn.
His father is a dentist in solo practice in West Brighton, Staten
Island.

The couple met in 2017 at Columbia through the school's Hillel
organization; they began dating while on a Birthright Israel trip more
than a year later.
