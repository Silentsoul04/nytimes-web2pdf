At 60, she moved to New York to care for her dying son. Instead of

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

One day in 1987, Nita Pippins received a call from her only child, Nick,
a 33-year-old actor in Manhattan who was dying of AIDS. “Mom, I’m in
bed. I can’t get out of bed,” her son told her. “It’s time.”

Ms. Pippins, a retired nurse living in Pensacola, Fla., put her
belongings in a friend’s house, took what she could and moved to New
York to care for her son. At age 60, she began an improbable and
remarkable second act.

Devastated and ashamed by her son’s AIDS diagnosis, and troubled that he
was gay, Ms. Pippins initially kept the illness a secret from her family
and friends. And she felt out of place in the big city. On breaks while
caring for her son, with whom she had moved in, she would sit inside the
Nathan’s Famous restaurant then in Times Square and repeat, “I hate New
York. I hate New York. I hate New York.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Ms. Pippins nursed her son for three years as AIDS ravaged his body
and he went in and out of the hospital. She saw members of the theater
group he had founded and residents of their midtown building,[Manhattan
Plaza](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/08/nyregion/on-the-block-where-aids-hits-hardest-residents-rally.html),
falling sick also. And by the time her son [died,
in 1990](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/29/obituaries/nick-pippin-35-dies-founded-aids-group.html),
Ms. Pippins had been transformed.

She became close with her son’s gay friends, and decided to stay in New
York. She dedicated herself to AIDS causes. She became a tireless
volunteer for [Miracle
House](https://www.edgemedianetwork.com/news/local/162240), a charity
that provided out-of-town families of AIDS patients with housing and
support.

For mothers working through anger, guilt and sadness, Ms. Pippins served
as a parent who had been there. For men estranged from their families,
she became a replacement mother, sometimes holding their hands as they
died.

“She didn’t come here to be an activist,” said Irwin Kroot, who met Ms.
Pippins through her son’s partner, Dennis Daniel, and interviewed her
for a possible memoir. “She was filling a void. She was usually with
young men who were dying and was, at their request, a go-between for
them and their families.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Pippins died on May 10 at Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. She
was 93. The cause was complications of the novel coronavirus, Mr. Kroot
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At a time when AIDS was widely misunderstood and gay men who suffered
from the disease were treated like pariahs, Ms. Pippins called on
countless families across the country to come visit their children.
Often, those parents had little sense of their sons’ lives in the city
or how sick they were.

Ms. Pippins would tell them to set aside differences and be present for
their child. Some took her advice, some didn’t. Ms. Pippins would meet
wary out-of-towners at the Port Authority Bus Terminal or airport, and
take them to breakfast at a midtown diner.

As a nurse, Ms. Pippins could answer their medical questions. As a
mother, and someone from a conservative Southern upbringing, she could
relate to their fears and concerns of being ostracized back home.

“At that time, you were shunned if your son died of AIDS, or you had
AIDS in your family,” Ms. Pippins [told
NY1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkzVku0hr3A) in 2010. “And I wanted
to get together and let them know there was other people having the same
problem.”

For Ms. Pippins, her work with AIDS patients was redemptive. “I needed
to give back,” she told Mr. Kroot. “I needed to have something to do
that made me feel better about me.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jessie Juanita Pippins was born on Feb. 2, 1927, in Dothan, Ala., to
Alto Lee and Junie Roberts. Her father was a cotton farmer and wanted
his daughter to stay on the farm, Ms. Pippins told Mr. Kroot.

She was not interested. She pestered her father to let her study nursing
at Florida State University until he relented. She became a registered
nurse, and later director of nursing at a hospital in Pensacola. She
retired in 1981.

She and her first husband, Joseph Pippins, divorced. A second marriage,
in effect arranged by her son so she wouldn’t be alone after he died,
was short-lived. Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Kelley Pippins
Hays, and three step-grandchildren.

In her second life as a New Yorker, Ms. Pippins attended Broadway shows
and dined out with friends like Mr. Kroot and his husband, Anthony
Catanzaro. Other friends from her son’s circle took her on vacation with
them to London. The group remained bonded for decades.

Ms. Pippins, who was present at the end of life for so many during the
AIDS crisis, died alone on Mother’s
Day.
