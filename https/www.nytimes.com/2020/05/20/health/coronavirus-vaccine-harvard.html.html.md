A prototype
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html)
has protected monkeys from the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html),
researchers reported on Wednesday, a finding that offers new hope for
effective human vaccines.

Scientists are already testing [coronavirus
vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-moderna.html)
in people, but the initial trials are designed to determine safety, not
how well a vaccine works. The research published Wednesday offers
insight into what a vaccine must do to be effective and how to measure
that.

“To me, this is convincing that a vaccine is possible,” said Dr. Nelson
Michael, the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Scientists are engaged in a worldwide scramble to create a vaccine
against the new coronavirus. Over a hundred research projects have been
launched; early safety trials in humans have been started or completed
in nine of them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Next to come are larger trials to determine whether these candidate
vaccines are not just safe, but effective. But those results won’t
arrive for months.

In the meantime, Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston, and his colleagues have started a series of
experiments on monkeys to get a broader look at how coronaviruses affect
monkeys — and whether vaccines might fight the pathogens. Their report
was published in Science.

Dr. Barouch is working in a partnership with Johnson & Johnson, which is
developing a coronavirus vaccine that uses a specially modified virus,
called Ad26, that he developed.

The new research in monkeys “lays the scientific foundations” for those
efforts, Dr. Barouch said. In March, the federal government awarded $450
million to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson, to
develop a coronavirus vaccine.

The scientists started by studying whether the monkeys become immune to
the virus after getting sick. The team infected nine unvaccinated rhesus
macaques with the new coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The monkeys developed symptoms that resembled a moderate case of
Covid-19, including inflammation in their lungs that led to pneumonia.
The monkeys recovered after a few days, and Dr. Barouch and his
colleagues found that the animals had begun making antibodies to the
coronavirus.

Some of them turned out to be so-called neutralizing antibodies, meaning
that they stopped the virus from entering cells and reproducing.

Thirty-five days after inoculating the monkeys, the researchers carried
out a “re-challenge,” spraying a second dose of the coronavirus into the
noses of the animals.

The monkeys [produced a surge of protective neutralizing
antibodies](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/19/science.abc4776).
The coronavirus briefly managed to establish a small infection in the
monkey’s noses but was soon wiped out.

These results don’t necessarily mean that humans also develop strong
immunity to the coronavirus. Still, Dr. Barouch and others found the
research encouraging.

“If we did the re-challenge study and it didn’t work, the implication
would be that the entire vaccine effort would fail,” he said. “That
would have been really, really bad news for seven billion people.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a separate experiment, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues tested
prototype vaccines on rhesus macaques. Each monkey received pieces of
DNA, which their cells turned into viral proteins designed to train the
immune system to recognize the virus.

Both macaques and humans make neutralizing antibodies against
coronaviruses that target one part in particular: a protein that covers
the virus’s surface, called the spike protein.

Most coronavirus vaccines are intended to coax the immune system to make
antibodies that latch onto the spike protein and destroy the virus. Dr.
Barouch and his colleagues tried out six variations.

The researchers gave each vaccine to four or five monkeys. They let the
monkeys develop an immune response for three weeks, and then sprayed
viruses in their noses.

Some of the vaccines provided only partial protection. The virus wasn’t
entirely eliminated from the animals’ lungs or noses, although levels
were lower than in unvaccinated monkeys.

But other vaccines worked better. The one that worked best trained the
immune system to recognize and attack the entire spike protein of the
coronavirus. In eight monkeys, the researchers couldn’t detect the virus
at all.

“I think that overall this will be seen as very good news for the
vaccine effort,” said Dr. Barouch. “This increases our optimism that a
vaccine for Covid-19 will be possible.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai in New York who was not involved in the study, said that the
levels of antibodies seen in the monkeys were promising.

“This is something that would protect you from disease,” he said. “It’s
not perfect, but you certainly see
protection.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Two vaccine teams — one at the University of Oxford and one at the
China-based company Sinovac — have tested vaccines on rhesus macaques.
This month they reported that their vaccines also offered the animals
protection.

The new study provides a deeper look at how vaccines protect monkeys,
and perhaps one day humans.

Along with neutralizing antibodies, the immune system has a huge arsenal
of weapons it can deploy against pathogens. Some immune cells can
recognize infected cells and destroy them, for example.

Dr. Barouch and his colleagues found a strong connection between
neutralizing antibodies and how well a vaccine worked: The vaccines that
gave monkeys stronger protection produced more neutralizing antibodies.

Pamela Bjorkman, a structural biologist at Caltech who was not involved
in the study, said that this correlation gave her more confidence in Dr.
Barouch’s findings. “I think that’s really reassuring,” she said.

Dr. Michael said that link could help scientists running safety trials
in humans. They may be able to get some early clues about whether the
vaccines are effective.

When a new vaccine goes into testing, the first round of trials are
designed to see if it’s safe. Only then do researchers move forward with
bigger trials to determine if the vaccine actually protects against a
disease.

Vaccine designers often try different doses in a safety trial, looking
for the lowest dose that provides the greatest protection. Dr. Barouch’s
study suggests that measuring neutralizing antibodies can give an
indication if a dose will be potent enough to give protection.

Malcolm Martin, a virologist at the National Institutes of Health who
was not involved in the study, cautioned that monkeys are different from
humans in important ways.

The unvaccinated monkeys in this study didn’t develop any of the severe
symptoms that some people get following a coronavirus infection. “It
looks like they got a cold,” Dr. Martin said.

Lisa Tostanoski, a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Barouch and
co-author of the new study, noted that the study only offers a glimpse
at how the vaccine works three weeks after injection.

It’s possible that the vaccines may defend the monkeys for many years to
come, she noted — or the protection may fade much sooner.

How long immunity to the coronavirus lasts may determine whether people
will need just one shot of a vaccine or more. People may need boosters
from time to time to rev up their defenses again and keep the pandemic
at bay.

“Every three years is thinkable,” Dr. Krammer said. “That doesn’t mean a
vaccine doesn’t work.”
