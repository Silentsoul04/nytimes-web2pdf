[Michael D.
Cohen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-book.html),
President Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, was released from a
federal prison on Thursday on furlough and returned to his home in
Manhattan, one of his lawyers said. He had asked to be released over
health concerns tied to the coronavirus.

Mr. Cohen, 53, who [pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance
violations and other
crimes](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F08%2F21%2Fnyregion%2Fmichael-cohen-guilty-plea-trump-takeaways.html),
had been serving his sentence at a minimum-security camp next to a
medium-security federal prison and detention center in Otisville, about
75 miles northwest of New York City.

Mr. Cohen’s projected release date was November 2021, according to the
bureau’s website, but he had sought to be released sooner because of
[medical issues and the risk that they would be exacerbated by the
virus’s spread at the
prison](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fnyregion%2Fmichael-cohen-release-prison-otisville-virus.html).

He was recorded by television news cameras in the late morning as he
entered his doorman building on Park Avenue in New York City, wearing a
cap, black suit jacket, jeans and a surgical mask. He nodded to
reporters and photographers as he buttoned his jacket.

Mr. Cohen later issued a [statement over
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/1263500906609496064)
“I am so glad to be home and back with my family,” it read. “There is so
much I want to say and intend to say. But now is not the right time.
Soon. Thank you to all my friends and supporters.”

One of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Jeffrey K. Levine, who handled the
administrative process with the Bureau of Prisons that resulted in his
release, said Mr. Cohen’s son picked him up at the prison shortly before
9 a.m. and drove him to the city.

Mr. Cohen had been held in solitary quarantine for 35 days, more than
double the required 14-day period for prisoners to be isolated before
being furloughed because of the virus, Mr. Levine said.

“He’s glad to be home in a safer and healthier environment,” the lawyer
said, adding, “It’s still his prison until his sentence is over.”

One law enforcement official briefed on the matter said it was expected
that Mr. Cohen would serve the balance of his sentence under home
confinement, but it was unclear on Wednesday whether a final decision
had been made with regard to that. It is possible the prison system
might end his furlough and require him to return to Otisville.

[Prisons and jails across the
country](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F03%2F30%2Fus%2Fcoronavirus-prisons-jails.html)
have been hot spots for the spread of the virus. In April, Attorney
General William P. Barr [ordered the prisons
bureau](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F04%2F03%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fbarr-coronavirus-prisons-release.html),
which is part of the Justice Department, to determine which federal
inmates could be safely released to home confinement. As of May 13, more
than 2,500 inmates had been, according to bureau data.

The federal crimes that Mr. Cohen admitted to were part of a scheme to
pay hush money to two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump
before he was president, which Mr. Trump has denied.

In March, the judge who sentenced Mr. Cohen rejected his request for
release. One of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Roger B. Adler, had said in court
papers that his client “has had two hospitalizations, and a pre-existing
condition of pulmonary issues.”

The Bureau of Prisons decision to release Mr. Cohen on Thursday was
reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, which prosecuted Mr.
Cohen, had no comment.

Mr. Cohen’s release came a week after [Paul
Manafort](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F05%2F13%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fpaul-manafort-released-coronavirus.html),
Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, was released into home
confinement in Northern Virginia because of underlying health conditions
and concerns about the virus. He had been serving a federal prison
sentence of seven and a half years.
