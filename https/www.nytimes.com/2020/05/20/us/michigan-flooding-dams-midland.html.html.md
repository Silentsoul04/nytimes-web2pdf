MIDLAND, Mich. — Along Main Street in the central Michigan city of
Midland, residents crowded the sidewalk on Wednesday, [watching the
rising waters of the Tittabawassee
River](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/michigan-dams.html) in
stunned despair.
[Floodwaters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/world/asia/china-floods-rain.html)
lapped less than a block away, and a row of businesses, their
electricity cut off, stood dark and quiet.

For many, including Jeff De Vaney, the owner of Amazing Deli, the sight
was pain on top of pain. Mr. De Vaney was hoping to fully reopen his
sandwich shop soon and begin to recoup the revenue he has lost during
the coronavirus crisis. He had just brought in portable coolers to store
all the extra stock he expected to need.

Then came the flood.

“We can’t seem to catch a break,” Mr. De Vaney said.

Michigan, one of the states [hardest hit by the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/michigan-coronavirus-cases.html),
was left reeling again on Wednesday after days of torrential rainfall
[breached two privately owned
dams](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/us/michigan-dam-breach.html)
the night before. Thousands of residents were forced to flee their
homes, and much of Midland, [the home of Dow Chemical and some of its
plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/climate/michigan-dam-dow-chemical-superfund.html),
was submerged in murky floodwaters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has clashed with Republicans over
the state’s response to the coronavirus, found herself in an ever more
complicated position: urging residents to flee their homes to avoid the
rising waters while maintaining social distancing to avoid the spreading
virus. Midland County has had 76 known cases, a relatively small number
[in a battered
state](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-detroit.html).

“It’s hard to believe that we’re in the middle of a 100-year crisis, a
global pandemic, and we’re also dealing with a flooding event that looks
to be the worst in 500 years,” Ms. Whitmer said.

For years, federal regulators had warned that a dam in nearby Edenville
Township could rupture. They had chided its corporate owner, Boyce Hydro
Power, for failing to make required structural changes to the dam,
revoked the company’s license and declared that Boyce Hydro had
displayed “a pattern of delay and indifference to addressing dam safety
requirements.”

On Tuesday night, the dam gave way, sending a torrent of water gushing
into streets, houses and businesses, and threatening Dow Chemical, the
producer of plastics that sits along the Tittabawassee River. Ten miles
south of the Edenville dam, water was spilling over a second dam, a
structure feared to be on the verge of collapse on
Wednesday.

By then, floodwaters had crept high enough that red stop signs were
barely peeking out in downtown Midland, a city of 42,000 residents about
130 miles northwest of Detroit. Evacuees, carrying suitcases and wearing
face masks, arrived at local schools that had been repurposed as
emergency shelters.

Officials said there were no known injuries or deaths tied to the

Ms. Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Midland County and said
she would appeal for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. By Wednesday, 130 soldiers from the Michigan National Guard were
dispatched to help state police evacuate residents.

In balmy spring temperatures on Wednesday morning, a pair of jet skiers
roared down the swollen river, which was expected to rise nearly 10 feet
above its flood level.

The site of the city’s farmers’ market along the banks of the river was
swamped, while floodwaters were beginning to lap at the bottom of a
pedestrian bridge crossing the river.

“It’s disastrous,” said Sue Baranski, who had evacuated her home in
nearby Sanford as the floodwaters rose. “Between the devastation from
the flooding and the virus and the small-business owners trying to make
their way through that, it’s just too
much.”

Dow Chemical said that floodwaters had reached containment ponds near
its plants, but that there was no environmental damage or threat to
residents.

“Dow’s local emergency operations center is fully activated and is
implementing its flood preparedness plan,” the company said in a
statement. “All operating units on site have been safely shut down,
except for facilities needed for safely managing chemical containment,
and all railcars are secured.”

One of the largest chemical companies in the world, with $43 billion of
revenue in 2019, Dow employs more than 4,000 people at its headquarters
and manufacturing sites in Midland.

The company’s influence is apparent everywhere in town, which houses
Midland Center for the Arts, Dow Gardens and H.H. Dow High School. Dow
helped pay for a rebuilt downtown, transforming it into a wide
pedestrian thoroughfare filled with benches, Adirondack chairs, fire
pits and blooming
trees.

A short drive from downtown, at least 140 people evacuated from the
flooding to Midland High School, a makeshift shelter. About 100 people
spent the night on Tuesday; another 40 opted to sleep in their cars
instead because of worries about the coronavirus.

Dot Costello, 101, had slept on a cot in the school after buses picked

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with

Brad Kaye, the Midland city manager, said that damage had been
extensive, with the first floor of the Grace A. Dow Memorial Library
swamped and four of the city’s 42 sewage pumping stations underwater and
not functioning. All the while, public health concerns remained.

“We’ve still got Covid-19, and it didn’t go away miraculously because we
had a flood,” he
said.

Many in Midland expressed anger and frustration over the breaches of the
dams, where failures were expected to require a costly and extensive
cleanup.

According to a database kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the
two dams were rated in the highest risk category, along with about 300
other dams in the state. Both dams were last inspected in 2018.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoked the license of the
Edenville dam in 2018, citing the failure of Boyce Hydro to put in place
safety measures that would help prevent a flood. That year, a state
agency assumed regulatory authority of the dam.

According to federal documents, Boyce Hydro insisted there was little
chance that a catastrophic flood could happen.

“Boyce Hydro states that the probability of such a flood occurring in
the next 5 to 10 years ranges from 5 to 10 in one million,” [one report
said](https://ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2018/021518/H-3.pdf).

Late Wednesday, Boyce Hydro issued a statement expressing distress over
what had transpired. It said the company’s operators had made efforts to
lower water levels and prepare for the incoming rain, but that a
combination of rainfall and high winds reached extraordinary levels.

“We sympathize with those who have lost property and been forced to
relocate due to the resulting flooding in Gladwin and Midland Counties,”
the statement said.

Nick Assendelft, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environment,
Great Lakes, and Energy, said that inspectors in October 2018 found that
the dam was in fair structural condition, but had concerns about its
spillway capacity.

A lack of investment and maintenance combined with excessive rainfall
were factors in its failure, he said in an email.

Kathleen Gray reported from Midland, and Julie Bosman from Chicago. Neal
E. Boudette contributed reporting from Ann Arbor, Mich., and Ivan Penn
from Burbank, Calif.
