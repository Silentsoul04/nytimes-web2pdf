\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Sally Jane Rowley's birth name was Sara, but she preferred Sally. She
found it more fitting for her free-spirited approach to life, which
involved fighting for civil rights, living as a street artist and
learning how to fly.

``My grandmother was a one-of-a-kind person,'' said Anika Pasilis, 20, a
journalism student at the University of Arizona. ``She despised
injustice and cherished freedom, for herself and for others.''

Ms. Rowley died of Covid-19 on May 14 after the virus spread into the
Tucson, Ariz., nursing home where she lived, Ms. Pasilis said. She was
88. Her family said their goodbyes through a window at the facility.

Ms. Rowley was born on Oct. 20, 1931, in Trenton, N.J., to Emos and Sara
Rowley. Her father had a paint company, her mother was a homemaker. She
could have followed the rules, stayed on the East Coast and quietly
raised a family.

Instead, Ms. Rowley, an admirer of the aviator Amelia Earhart, went to
Stephens College in Missouri, where she learned how to fly small planes.
Her first job out of college was working as a flight attendant for
American Airlines.

While working as a secretary in New York in the early 1960s, Ms. Rowley
joined the freedom riders, the civil rights activists who rode
interstate buses into the South to challenge segregationist policies.
She was

in Jackson, Miss., in 1961 and served time in the Mississippi State
Penitentiary.

After that experience, Ms. Rowley went to an art opening in New York and
asked to meet Felix Pasilis, the painter whose work was featured in the
gallery. He was broke so she gave him \$10 to take her out, said Ms.
Pasilis, their granddaughter.

They never married on paper but lived as partners in Mexico, where Ms.
Rowley learned fluent Spanish, and in Hawaii. After moving to Northern
California, she made jewelry, selling her wares on the streets of San
Francisco.

Mr. Pasilis died in 2018 at 95. Ms. Rowley is survived by two children,
Sofie Pasilis and Oliver Pasilis, a stepdaughter, Beatrice Figueroa, and
six grandchildren.
