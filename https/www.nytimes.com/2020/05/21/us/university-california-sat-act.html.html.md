SACRAMENTO — The University of California on Thursday voted to phase out
the
[SAT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/at-home-sat-coronavirus.html)
and ACT as requirements to apply to its system of 10 schools, which
include some of the nation’s most popular campuses, in a decision with
major implications for the use of standardized tests in college
admissions.

Given the size and influence of the California system, whose marquee
schools include the University of California, Los Angeles, and the
University of California, Berkeley, the move is expected to accelerate
the momentum of American colleges away from the tests, amid charges that
they are unfair to poor, black and Hispanic students.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The school system’s action, which follows many small liberal arts
colleges, comes as the ACT and the College Board, a nonprofit
organization that administers the SAT, are suffering financially from
the [cancellation of test
dates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/sat-act-test-coronavirus.html)
during the coronavirus pandemic. One critic of the industry estimated
that the College Board had lost $45 million in revenue this spring.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although many students will likely continue to take the exams as long as
they are required by highly competitive schools like Stanford and those
in the Ivy League, California’s decision will clearly be a blow to the
image of the tests, and experts said it could tip the balance for other
schools in deciding whether to eliminate them.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The University of California is one of the best institutions in the
world, so whatever decision they make will be extraordinarily
influential,” said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president at the
American Council on Education, a trade group. “Whatever U.C. does will
have ripple effects across American higher education, particularly at
leading public universities.”

Like many colleges nationwide, University of California schools had
already [made the SAT and ACT
optional](https://www.nytimes.com/article/sat-act-test-optional-colleges-coronavirus.html)
for this year’s applicants, after testing dates were disrupted by the
pandemic. Both companies have announced that they will introduce an
online testing option for the first time in the fall.

On Thursday, the California system’s governing board voted unanimously
to extend that optional period for another year, and then not consider
scores for two years when determining whether to accept in-state
applicants, using standardized tests only to award scholarships,
determine course placement and assess out-of-state students.

“These tests are extremely flawed and very unfair,” said Lt. Gov. Eleni
Kounalakis, a member of the board who supported the decision, adding,
“Enough is enough.”

In the meantime, the university will do a study on the feasibility of
creating its own admissions test, perhaps in collaboration with other
California schools.

In a statement after the vote, the College Board predicted that the
governing board’s decision would add to the burden of high school
students applying for college if the system creates its own exam, saying
that many students will still take the SAT or ACT to apply to other
institutions.

“Having to take multiple tests will likely cause many of these students
to limit their college options much earlier in the college search
process,” the organization said.

Some 300,000 students attend University of California schools, and [six
of its campuses top the
list](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/colleges-that-received-the-most-applications)
of American schools with the most applicants, with U.C.L.A. consistently
the most sought after. Four-fifths of applicants to the system’s schools
take the SAT, providing the [largest source of
customers](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-11/napolitano-says-suspend-the-sat-test-for-uc-admissions)
for the College Board, which brings in more than $1 billion a year in
revenue.

In addition to the SAT, the organization also administers Advanced
Placement tests for high school students and other testing programs.
Experts said that despite actions like the California system’s, the
testing industry is likely to survive in some form.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Standardized testing has been declining as an element in the college
admissions process for some time,” Mr. Hartle said. “But the College
Board is a large and financially stable organization, and they’ve been
around for a long time.”

The move to do away with testing only deepened after last year’s
[college admissions
scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html).
More than 1,230 colleges and universities have made the SAT and ACT
optional for admission, according to FairTest, a group that has pushed
to end testing requirements — most of them small liberal arts colleges
such as Smith, Pitzer and Sarah Lawrence.

Another 70 or so colleges and universities suspended the testing
requirement for the fall application cycle because of the coronavirus.

In California, the board acted Thursday on a
[proposal](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4.pdf)from
the university system’s president, Janet Napolitano, which came after
several years of pressure. A [lawsuit filed last
year](http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1250.pdf) by a
largely black school district in Compton, Calif., and a coalition of
students and advocacy groups argues that the time-honored tests
discriminate based on race and income.

The decision, however, ran counter to a recommendation from the system’s
faculty senate, which voted in April to keep the SAT and ACT. A faculty
task force commissioned to study the impact of standardized tests found
that they predict college success within the University of California
system more effectively than high school grades or other
measures.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In fact, the task force found that in many cases the tests gave a leg up
to black, Latino and low-income students by offering an additional
metric for admissions officers who might have rejected them because
their grades did not meet the university’s threshold.

Robert May, a philosophy professor at the University of California,
Davis, who appointed the faculty panel, said the regents’ decision would
add confusion and significant costs to the admissions process at the
mammoth system, and make admissions determinations even more subjective
in the short-term.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Marten Roorda, the chief executive of the ACT, told the regents in a
letter before the vote that dropping the testing requirements would
“further the uncertainty and anxiety of students and their families at
a time when they need all the reassurances and resources we can
provide.”

Supporters of standardized tests have argued that they provide an
important yardstick to assess students across disparate school districts
and states. And the College Board and ACT say any inequities in their
results reflect existing gaps in the American educational system, and
are not a fault of the tests themselves.

In response to criticism, the College Board proposed a new SAT grading
system last year that came to be known as the “adversity score,” which
would put each test taker’s results into the context of that student’s
school or neighborhood. But the company [withdrew that
proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/sat-adversity-score-college-board.html)
after being criticized for trying to distill complex factors into a
single score.

Testing opponents marked a major victory two years ago when the highly
ranked University of Chicago went test optional. The school reported
last year that the entering freshman class had nearly a quarter more
first-generation and low-income students and 56 percent more rural
students than the prior year, with about 10 percent opting against
submitting test scores.

In the University of California system, standardized test scores are
just one component of a complex admissions formula, which includes more
than a dozen metrics, including high school grade point averages. The
state guarantees acceptance to the top 12.5 percent of California high
school students.

But as California has struggled to maintain campus diversity since
voters passed a 1996 ban on affirmative action, pressure has grown for
the school system to take action. Its top campuses have become almost as
difficult to get into as some Ivy League schools and are demographically
dominated by white and Asian students.

For the last 20 years, black enrollment at University of California
schools has scarcely broken 4 percent, though African-Americans
represent 6.5 percent of the state’s population. Nearly 40 percent of
the state is Hispanic, California’s largest ethnic group, but only 22
percent of students in the school system are.

Carol Christ, now the Berkeley chancellor, was one of the first
university administrators to eliminate the SAT requirement nearly two
decades ago when she became president of Smith College. On Thursday, she
told the regents that she viewed standardized testing as “a biased
instrument” that would only become more skewed in the wake of the
pandemic.
