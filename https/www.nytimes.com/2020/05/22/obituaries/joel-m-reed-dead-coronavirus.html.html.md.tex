\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Joel M. Reed loved gore and sex, and his fans loved him for it.

Mr. Reed, the director of one of the most notorious exploitation films,
``Blood Sucking Freaks'' (1976), died of the novel coronavirus on April
14 in a hospital in Queens, his brother Elliott Reed said. He was 86 and
had lived in Manhattan.

John Bloom, a writer who uses the pseudonym Joe Bob Briggs as a
self-styled ``Drive-In Movie Critic,''
\href{https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/joe-bob-briggs-rides-again/}{eulogized
Mr. Reed last month on the podcast ``The Movies That Made Me''} as ``one
of the strangest filmmakers, who made some of the most disturbing films
in history.''

``Blood Sucking Freaks,'' the most disturbing of them all, became a cult
hit.

The film came out under that title in 1976 but had previously been
released as ``Sardu: Master of the Screaming Virgins'' and ``The
Incredible Torture Show.'' The movie tells the story, such as it is, of
Master Sardu, who runs a theater in which the performers are subjected
to realistic-seeming scenes of torture. What the theatergoers are not
aware of, however, is that the actors are actually kidnapping victims,
and that their torments are real.

The film, which has been referred to as a horror comedy, shows nudity,
sexual mutilation and more: A skull is crushed in a vise. There are
amputations. Brains are sucked through a straw.

The low-budget horror movie studio and distributor
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/20/movies/troma-the-film-studio-that-says-low-is-good-and-bad-may-be-better.html}{Troma
Entertainment} bought the film, re-edited it to restore footage that Mr.
Reed had cut to get it an R rating, and changed the name to ``Blood
Sucking Freaks.'' (It's sometimes referred to as ``Bloodsucking
Freaks.'')

Troma's co-founder, Lloyd Kaufman,
\href{https://www.dvdtalk.com/horror/blog/bloodsucking_freaks_not_about.html}{would
later say}, ``I may have possibly secured my place in hell by just
watching it.''

In an interview, Mr. Kaufman said the movie ``was, on a certain level,
hilarious, in the context of Grand Guignol.'' But ``it's very
misogynistic,'' he added. ``Today, we would not have anything to do with
it.''

The film was picketed by the group ``Women Against Pornography,''
according to the book ``A Companion to the Horror Film,'' edited by
Harry M. Benshoff.
\href{https://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=2540\&reviewer=248}{A
reviewer on the website Efilmcritic.com wrote}, ``There is absolutely
nothing that is remotely defensible about `Bloodsucking Freaks.'''
However, the reviewer added, ``There is something oddly intoxicating
about a film that is so dedicated to being as offensive as possible to
as wide a demographic as possible.''

Joel Melvin Reed was born on Dec. 29, 1933, in Brooklyn to Albert and
Gertrude (Harris) Reed. His father was a record salesman. In addition to
his brother Elliott, Mr. Reed's survivors include another brother,
Michael.

Mr. Reed graduated from high school and served in the Army in Korea.
After his military service he worked in public relations, but found
himself drawn to filmmaking. His early work included soft-core
pornography and a movie called ``Blood Bath,'' which Mr. Reed
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/news-of-the-screen-greece-is-subject-of-a-new-dassin-shooting.html}{described}
as ``a contemporary, episodic occult‐horror adventure.'' He also acted
in a number of films, including ``Dead Eye'' (2011).

His brother Elliott recalled that at the time ``Blood Sucking Freaks''
came out, their mother had already died, but he recalled that their
father ``got a kick out of this, of his being successful in this
avant-garde way.''
