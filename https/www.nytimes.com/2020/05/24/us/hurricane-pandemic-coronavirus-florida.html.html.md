# What Happens if a Hurricane Hits During the Pandemic?

Florida is trying to figure out the daunting prospect of asking
residents to evacuate for their safety during a storm after asking them
to stay at home for the coronavirus.

MIAMI — It’s deep into the summer and a massive
[hurricane](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/hurricane-douglas-hawaii.html)
looms off the Florida coast, threatening enormous destruction and
widespread power blackouts. In normal times, in such a scenario, the
orders would come down for millions of coastal residents: Evacuate.

But in the middle of a pandemic, the most consequential of disaster
decisions become complicated by fears of contagion.

Temporarily moving in with a relative might expose older family members
to the coronavirus. Friends might be wary of letting in evacuees from
outside their quarantine bubble. People who might otherwise book a
flight out of town worry about getting infected on a plane. And the more
than 1.5 million [Floridians who are out of
work](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/florida-coronavirus-unemployment.html)
might be unable to afford gas or a motel room.

Gulp.

This is the planning dilemma now facing emergency managers across the
Southeast ahead of June 1, the official start of a
[hurricane](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/25/us/hurricane-hanna-tracker-map.html)
season that meteorologists expect to be quite active. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [has
forecast](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/climate/hurricane-season-2020-noaa.html)
as many as six storms rated Category 3 or higher. A named system,
[Tropical Storm
Arthur](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/us/tropical-storm-arthur-2020-path.html),
already formed in May.

If a big storm comes this summer, people in harm’s way may hear advice
from the authorities that is somewhat contradictory and perhaps
confusing: Stay at home and remain socially distant from others to avoid
contracting the coronavirus. But leave home — even if that means coming
into closer contact with other people — to be safe during a dangerous
hurricane.

“We’re going to need to get people out, because that is the emergent
threat,” said Jared Moskowitz, director of Florida’s division of
emergency management. “We will undoubtedly have to balance the risks.”

Some people in India and Bangladesh resisted evacuations when [a
powerful cyclone
struck](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/world/asia/cyclone-amphan-india-bangladesh.html)
last week. Communities in Michigan, [after a river flooded and two dams

and in Arkansas, [after a

recently struggled with how to safely shelter large numbers of people.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There is plenty of hurricane fatigue in Florida, which has endured hits
or brushes with at least five hurricanes over the past four years,
including [Hurricane
Irma](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/us/irmas-fearsome-winds-reach-florida-shores-with-full-strike-yet-to-come.html)
in 2017, [Hurricane
Michael](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/us/hurricane-michael-florida.html)
in 2018 and [Hurricane
Dorian](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/us/hurricane-dorian-updates.html)
in 2019. The prospect of [another busy storm
season](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/tropical-storm-cristobal-louisiana.html)
felt exhausting even before the arrival of Covid-19, which has led to
50,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths since the beginning of March.

A mild storm might not require many evacuations. People with newer homes
built to withstand strong winds could be safer sheltering in place than
leaving their homes, Mr. Moskowitz said, as long as they do not live in
a low-lying area prone to storm surge.

But experts always prepare for the worst case: a behemoth storm riding
up the entirety of the peninsula, or hitting a big city like Miami or
Tampa directly. During Irma, which made landfall in the Florida Keys and
moved north, some 350,000 people sought refuge in shelters.

In new storm guidelines, the [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Guidance-for-Gen-Pop-Disaster-Shelters-a-Pandemic_cleared_JIC_ADS_final.pdf)
recommended small shelters of fewer than 50 people. But the [Federal
Emergency Management
Agency](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1589997234798-adb5ce5cb98a7a89e3e1800becf0eb65/2020_Hurricane_Pandemic_Plan.pdf)
acknowledged that big shelters “will still be necessary.”

To find alternatives where evacuees might be more spread out, Mr.
Moskowitz’s team created a map of hotels — along with their wind rating
and whether they have a power generator — that might be commandeered as
shelters. The division of emergency management also developed an app
that counties could use to assign evacuees to those hotels.

Traditional school shelters will be unavoidable, at least in densely
populated areas, said Frank K. Rollason, the emergency management
director for Miami-Dade County. Only 20 hotels in Miami-Dade are outside
of a storm evacuation zone, he said, and many might be booked with
guests evacuated from coastal hotels or with crews deployed in advance
to restore electricity or phone service after the storm.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re looking at those, but this is the 11th hour,” Mr. Rollason said.
“It’s a long shot.”

He has focused instead on how the county’s 81 shelters, the largest of
which can usually accommodate up to 1,500 people, might adapt to prevent
virus spread: Set aside 36 square feet per person, up from the usual 20
square feet. Stagger meal times. Empty classrooms of furniture so they
could be used for large families, groups of symptomatic people or those
who have tested positive for the virus. It may be possible to designate
a specific shelter for those evacuees.

Mr. Rollason is not counting on rapid testing to become widely available
to reliably determine which evacuees are sick. Those entering shelters
will have their temperatures taken and be asked questions about symptoms
and exposure when they arrive, he said — preferably indoors in some sort
of anteroom so that they do not have to stand in line outside being
pelted by rain.

“But they will come in,” Mr. Rollason said. “We’re not going to turn
anyone away.”

Volunteers to work in the shelters alongside county employees [would be
difficult to come
by](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/climate/fema-volunteer-disaster-response.html).
The state may assign its own workers or temporarily hire unemployed
people, Mr. Moskowitz said. Florida has set aside 10 million masks for
use during hurricanes, he
added.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

To send evacuees to other counties — out of the vulnerable Keys, for
example — emergency managers might have to rent more buses so passengers
can sit at a safe distance from each other. Mr. Moskowitz said the state
is in talks with Uber to possibly provide individual rides if needed.

Florida ordered all nursing homes and assisted living facilities to
install generators for cooling systems after as many as 12 people [died
from the sweltering
heat](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/24/us/4-charged-holywood-hills-deaths-hurricane-irma-florida.html)
in a Broward County nursing home during Hurricane Irma. Some homes with
temporary generators were granted variances as they work toward
installing permanent ones, but almost all are in at least basic
compliance, said Mary C. Mayhew, who runs the Agency for Health Care
Administration, which oversees long-term care facilities.

But nursing homes in evacuation zones [might have to send residents to
facilities](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/us/hurricane-dorian-florida-evacuation.html)
out of the storm’s path that have extra beds, she said, or to one of the
various sites that have been set up recently to relieve overcrowded
hospitals in the event of a Covid-19 surge.

After a storm, a host of other concerns would emerge. Amid the economic
crisis, more people could need meals, perhaps for a week or more. And
electricity would likely take longer to restore because utility crews
would be working under unusual
conditions.

Duke Energy Florida sent crews to help restore power in South Carolina
after a severe storm last month and found that the special fireproof
face masks needed for virus protection in areas with fire hazards made
workers hot and required them to take more water breaks, said Jason
Cutliffe, the company’s storm director.

Then there is the question of accommodations for storm workers. Gone
would be the usual large tent cities for up to 2,000 workers with
centralized cafeterias, showers and laundry. Instead, crews would have
to stay in smaller staging areas that allow for social distancing but
also result in less efficient replenishing of equipment.

That slows workers down, said Eric Silagy, chief executive of Florida
Power & Light, the state’s largest utility.

“The things that we’re going to have to do to keep folks safe from a
virus will lead to inefficiencies in our ability to respond normally,”
he said.

As it happens, the company dusted off its old pandemic plan last year
after the human resources department suggested an update.

“But even our pandemic plan didn’t have a global pandemic component to
it: interrupted supply chains globally and everybody sheltering in place
and grounding the airlines,” he said. “I’m glad that we have it in
place, but you have to adapt.”
