# Why China’s Move to Rein In Hong Kong Is Just the Start

Xi Jinping’s China, emboldened by its handling of the coronavirus
pandemic, no longer seems constrained by the threat of international
rebuke.

China’s move to [strip away another layer of Hong Kong’s
autonomy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/asia/hong-kong-china.html)
was not a rash impulse. It was a deliberate act, months in the making.
It took into account the risks of international umbrage and reached the
reasonable assumption that there would not be a significant geopolitical
price to pay.

As a provocative move, it is just the latest.

With the world [distracted by the pandemic’s devastating
toll](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/china-hong-kong-national-security.html),
China has [taken a series of aggressive
actions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-china-hong-kong.html)
in recent weeks to flex its economic, diplomatic and military muscle
across the region.

China’s Coast Guard rammed and sank a fishing boat in disputed waters
off Vietnam, and its ships [swarmed an offshore
oil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/world/asia/coronavirus-south-china-sea-warships.html)
rig operated by Malaysia. Beijing denounced the [second inauguration of
Taiwan’s president, Tsai
Ing-wen](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/world/asia/taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen.html),
and pointedly dropped the word peaceful from its annual call for
unification with the island democracy.

Chinese troops squared off again last week with India’s along their
contentious border in the Himalayas.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All are longstanding tensions, but the decision to impose new national
security laws on Hong Kong, bypassing the semiautonomous territory’s own
legislative process, shows what can happen with an unbridled China, no
longer restrained by the fear of international rebuke.

“There was this idea before about China being cautious and trying to
cultivate its soft power around the world,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a
professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and the author of “China
Tomorrow: Democracy or Dictatorship?” “Those times are gone with Xi
Jinping.”

Mr. Xi, who in seven years in power has pursued a “great rejuvenation”
of the Chinese state, has [emerged from the pandemic newly
emboldened](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/world/asia/coronavirus-china-xi-jinping.html),
seizing on nationalistic themes to deflect from the government’s early
failures in stopping the coronavirus’s spread.

He still faces enormous economic and diplomatic challenges. New
[protests erupted in Hong Kong on
Sunday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-coronavirus-china.html),
and resistance to greater control by Beijing could threaten the
territory’s role as a financial center.

Officials and state media outlets have [lashed
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/asia/china-hong-kong-propaganda.html)
at the United States and other countries, accusing them of supporting
“separatists” and “terrorists” in an effort to weaken the power of the
Communist Party.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On the defensive over their handling of the virus, President Trump and
his aides have sought to blame China for the pandemic’s toll in the
United States. The criticism, by all appearances, has done little to
moderate Mr. Xi’s actions. It may even have emboldened them, as Chinese
officials point to the failures in the United States and other countries
as evidence of the Communist Party’s better model of governance.

The Trump administration has, in turn, intensified its actions against
China, imposing restrictions on trade and technology, praising Ms.
Tsai’s inauguration and even marking the 25th anniversary of the
disappearance of the 11th Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in
Tibetan Buddhism.

“The United States, in fact, is pouring oil on the fire, barrel by
barrel,” Tian Feilong, a professor of law at Beihang University in
Beijing, said in a telephone interview. “The central government is
therefore actually just safeguarding its own most basic national
security interests.”

China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Sunday that the two countries
could still work together to promote global peace and stability, but he
denounced those in the United States who seek American hegemony.

“It’s time for the United States to give up its wishful thinking of
changing China,” Mr. Wang said, accusing American officials of having a
Cold War mentality.

Mr. Xi’s move against Hong Kong has nonviolent echoes of President
Vladimir V. Putin’s forceful seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014,
which was a violation of international law and of Russia’s [previous
diplomatic
commitments](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/world/europe/britain-europe-ukraine-house-of-lords-report.html).
The annexation made Mr. Putin an international pariah for a while, but
Russia still remains firmly in control of Crimea.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While Mr. Xi is using legislation rather than military force in a
territory already under Chinese rule, it is nonetheless a brash move by
an autocratic leader willing to risk international condemnation to
resist what he views as foreign encroachment on his country’s security.

“The Communist Party doesn’t care anymore about the reactions, because
it’s about survival, the stability of the one-party system, avoiding the
fate of the Soviet Union,” Mr. Cabestan said. “Hong Kong is being
perceived more and more as a base of surveillance, as a factor in the
destabilization of the Chinese
state.”

The challenges facing Mr. Xi come at a time when China’s major rivals,
the United States above all, are in disarray, giving Mr. Xi more room to
maneuver.

Britain, which is a signatory to the 1984 treaty that promised Hong Kong
— its former colony — basic freedoms until 2047, issued [a
statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-from-the-uk-australia-and-canada-on-hong-kong)
with Australia and Canada saying that they were “deeply concerned.”
[Senior Trump administration officials also denounced Mr. Xi’s
gambit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/world/asia/trump-pompeo-china-hong-kong.html),
warning that they could [reconsider the territory’s special trade
privileges](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/business/hong-kong-special-status-explained.html)
or impose other sanctions. President Trump, whose few comments about
Hong Kong have been inconsistent, said little.

For those who support [Hong Kong’s unique status as Asia’s commercial
and cultural
crossroads](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/asia/hong-kong-china.html),
warnings no longer suffice in the face of determined pressure from
Beijing.

Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and
author of a book on the 2014 Hong Kong protests known as [the Umbrella
Movement](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/world/asia/hong-kong-umbrella-movement.html),
said the international community had often spoken out against China’s
steady accretion of power over the territory but had exacted no real
punishment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That has been the case for the most egregious violations of basic rights
in Hong Kong in recent years, including extrajudicial kidnappings,
excessive use of force by the police last year and the arrests of
[leading democratic
leaders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/world/asia/hong-kong-arrests.html)
a month ago.

“The international pushback has been so weak,” Ms. Hui said. “Beijing is
daring foreign governments to continue to issue words but take no
actions.”

China’s tactics under Mr. Xi today contrast those of his immediate
predecessors, who prioritized China’s reforms and opening over
confrontation with its neighbors or the broader world. “Hide our
strength, bide our time” was Deng Xiaoping’s adage a generation ago.

When Taiwan was moving to hold its first presidential elections in 1996,
China conducted intimidating missile tests in the Taiwan Strait. It was
forced to back down when President Bill Clinton ordered American
aircraft carriers to the waters in a show of military support for the
island’s defense.

Mr. Xi has steadily built up China’s air and naval power, making a
similar move by the United States today much riskier. Chinese forces
routinely menace the island, as its first operational aircraft carrier
did last month, forcing Taiwan’s military to scramble jets and ships.
[The seventh similar
incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUj-vrQTT84) this year, it
signaled China’s determination to block Taiwan from formally
establishing its
independence.

For Beijing’s leaders, China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong is as
emotionally charged.

Under the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that governs the territory,
Hong Kong is obliged to adopt rules “to prohibit any act of treason,
secession, sedition and subversion” against the Chinese government. When
the city’s legislature tried to do so in 2003, Beijing retreated in the
face of huge street protests.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“China was in a very different place globally,” said Rana Mitter, the
director of the University of Oxford China Center. “China’s economy was
growing in 2003, but it wasn’t the second biggest economy in the world
and quite the economic behemoth it is today.”

There is also a more subtle difference that the pandemic has
accentuated. Beijing spent years deflecting criticism of its system by
saying that China was not yet ready for more democratic freedoms,
effectively leaving open the possibility for greater liberalization of
the political system, as many inside and outside the country hoped.

China, Mr. Mitter said, is now a “state which no longer apologizes for
being authoritarian.”

On Friday, Mr. Xi told delegates at [the annual session of the
legislature, the National People’s
Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-china-economy.html),
that the country’s system was the “the broadest, most genuine, and most
effective democracy to safeguard the fundamental interests of the
people.”

Such confidence has allowed Mr. Xi to brush aside international concerns
about China’s behavior at home and abroad: the absence of government
transparency and accountability, the countless arrests of those who
express dissent, the [mass detention of more than one million Uighurs
and other
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)
in the western province of Xinjiang.

It has also emboldened China in ways that create the possibility of
armed conflict.

On the remote border with India, Chinese forces have twice in the last
month clashed with Indian troops, prompting both sides to send in
re-enforcements. India has accused China of blocking patrols on its side
on the Line of Control, the unofficial border.

China has also stepped up its efforts to dominate the South China Sea
despite the territorial claims of countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and
the
Philippines.

“Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical,” Alice G. Wells, an

Washington last week.

“So whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border
with India,” she said, “we continue to see provocations and disturbing
behavior by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its
growing power.”
