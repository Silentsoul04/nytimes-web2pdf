How Adrienne Arsht, Tonya Lewis Lee and Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger are
hunkering down.

\emph{With the New York gala scene on hiatus, here is how some patrons
and society figures are spending their time and resources during the
coronavirus crisis.}

\hypertarget{adrienne-arsht}{%
\subsection{Adrienne Arsht}\label{adrienne-arsht}}

\textbf{Age:} 78

\textbf{Occupation:} lawyer, philanthropist, chairwoman emerita of
TotalBank.

\textbf{Favorite charities:}
\href{https://arshtcannonfund.org}{Arsht-Cannon Fund},
\href{https://www.kennedy-center.org/account/login/}{John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts,}the
\href{https://www.onebillionresilient.org}{Adrienne Arsht Center for the
Performing Arts, the Adrienne Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience
Center}.

\textbf{Where are you sheltering?}

At my house in Washington, D.C.

\textbf{Has self-seclusion altered your routine?}

I'm up earlier. By 6:30 I've I picked up my newspaper. I read more or
less till 9. I'm still doing full hair and makeup every morning. I
believe you always dress as if you're going to meet the queen of
England. That's just you.

\textbf{Do you have a favorite at-home retreat?}

It's my office. My desk is piled with the same papers as before the
pandemic. There is a basket where I keep my knitting and a ball of yarn.
I'm on my fourth afghan right now. I collect pillows. I have a new one
with a motto that reads: ``You don't have to be productive during a
pandemic.'' Take that, Marie Kondo!

\textbf{Which causes are urgent to you now?}

If you're being abused, sheltering at home is like lighting a match to a
tinderbox. You have nowhere to go. I'm supporting the
\href{https://www.dcvlp.org}{D.C. Volunteer Lawyer Project,}which
represents women who are victims of domestic violence.

\textbf{How do you keep up your spirits?}

I adore change. I say, just deal with it. I had a younger sister who
committed suicide at 29. I've wondered, what was it that made her feel
that death was easier to bear than life? My focus is on resilience, the
ability to survive, adapt and construct a new way of life. You could
almost say this pandemic is the equivalent of the meteor that crashed to
earth and destroyed the dinosaurs. We'll see what comes out of the
rubble.

\textbf{How does your day go?}

I get up, exercise and make breakfast. I clean --- that's on me. Then I
go into my office to work. During the first several weeks of this
quarantine I found working difficult. It was really hard to focus. My
pace slowed significantly. I feel like now I'm moving into a better
pattern.

\textbf{Have your domestic habits changed?}

We used to order out a lot. Now I cook. We eat a lot of fish. I did a
delicious Thai soup last night. I've been thinking about growing my own
food and what that would look like. I hope this is the new normal for
us. We are healthier for it.

\textbf{What do you do with your downtime?}

Drawing and painting are a release. I run a couple of days a week along
the East River. On a good day the river is so beautiful, it's almost
like not being in the city at all.

\textbf{Which causes are most vital to you now?}

I'm on the board of March of Dimes, focusing on issues of maternal
mortality in the United States, especially as they relate to black
women. Corona just makes these problems more apparent and dire.

\textbf{What can we learn from this crisis?}

I hope we come out with a better of understanding of what is an
essential worker. Who is the store clerk, the sanitation worker,
delivery person? Will you remember to thank the person who rings up your
groceries? Without these people, what would we do?

\textbf{Parting thoughts?}

Eat well. Exercise. Don't drink too much. Give yourself a break.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?}

At our beach house in Mustique, in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

\textbf{What took you to Mustique?}

Tommy, my husband, has had a home here for almost 30 years. We left in
March for our son's spring break. I packed for a two-week trip and we've
been here since. I'm looking out at the ocean as we speak. Our stay
wasn't planned, but I'm grateful it worked out this way.

\textbf{How have you kept up your giving?}

We are co-chairs of the \href{https://www.bcrf.org}{B.C.R.F. Virtual Hot
Pink Evening} in support of cancer research. It was a Zoom situation, a
new frontier for me. We expect to raise substantial funds. {[}The May 20
virtual gala brought in \$5.2 million{]}. I'm also on the board of
Glam4Good, founded by my friend Alice Stephenson. We provide clothes for
women in shelters.

\textbf{Are there positive aspects to life in seclusion?}

I'm loving that I'm able to spend time with two of my six children: my
stepdaughter Kathleen, who is 24, and my son Sebastian --- he's 10.
Having this time to engage with him, that's been a blessing for sure.
We're doing home schooling, Lego projects, swimming and playing silly
games like hide and seek.

\textbf{What are some other distractions?}

We spend a lot of time playing backgammon and chess. I've seen every
episode of ``Ozark.'' And I'm hiking around the island with Tommy every
morning. Those routines have been a necessity for everybody's sanity.

\textbf{Have there been challenges?}

I've had my cries. They come from a pent-up frustration at feeling so
helpless. Ordinarily we have everything planned out months in advance:
school, travel, evenings out. Now there are so many unknowns. I don't
know when I'm coming home.

\emph{Interviews have been edited.}
