### **Dear Tripped Up,**

My trip to Egypt with [Overseas Adventure
Travel](https://www.oattravel.com/) was scheduled to depart in late
March. O.A.T. canceled the tour because of Covid-19, which was a relief.
The company notified me of the cancellation and offered either a credit
for rebooking or a full refund that would have included airfare. The
next week, I learned via email that I had been rebooked on the same trip
next year. Unbeknown to me, the stated policy had changed: O.A.T. was no
longer offering refunds. I told them that I had a medical condition and
did not know when — or if — I would be able to travel, and asked whether
they were just going to keep my $17,500 if I couldn’t travel by the end
of 2021. Answer: Yes.

I feel I am being held hostage by O.A.T. How are they allowed to keep my
money? Roz

### Hi Roz,

They’re not. But, if the extraordinary number of reader complaints I
have received — more than a dozen and counting — are any indication,
they have been doing so anyway.

Overseas Adventure Travel is part of Grand Circle Corporation, a family
of travel companies based in Boston. The small-group and cruising
company has been [recognized
nationally.](https://www.oattravel.com/oat-difference/awards)

But Massachusetts happens to be one of only a handful of states with
specific laws that guarantee consumers protection against [travel
sellers](https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-15-the-sale-of-travel-services/download),
including requiring that tour operators offer the option of cash refunds
(in addition to vouchers or credits for rebooking) when they fail to
provide agreed-upon, paid-for services. According to [the
law,](https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-15-the-sale-of-travel-services/download)
the cash refund must be “an amount equal to the fair market retail value
of any undelivered, purchased travel service.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Translation: When they cancel your trip, they are legally required to
offer you the money back.

But even when individual consumers know their rights, they have few
options at their immediate disposal when a customer-service
representative — usually the only public-facing proxy for a company’s
official or unofficial policies — refuses to relent on
refunds.

As [Adam Anolik,](https://travellaw.com/) a San Francisco- based
travel-industry lawyer, explained over email, that’s why oversight —
forcing a company to comply with state laws — can feel like an uphill
battle. “The outcome can often turn on who cancels, which is why a lot
of suppliers and travelers are playing chicken right now. In reality,
many of these statutes are seldom enforced. This pandemic could cause
some of them to be dusted off,” said Mr. Anolik.

This is the third [Tripped
Up](https://www.nytimes.com/column/tripped-up) column in a row that
addresses the issue of refunds. Although travel has stopped and is only
starting up again — slowly and in only a few destinations — the
aftershocks of that screeching halt, brought on by the coronavirus,
continue to reverberate.

As travel companies now suffer a cash crunch, they are facing off with
travelers over [credits and
refunds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/travel/refunds-or-credits-travelers-and-businesses-face-off.html).
Airlines are
[sidestepping](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/travel/trip-refund-airlines.html)
refund regulations established by the United States Transportation
Department and the European Union, betting that negative press (and even
class-action lawsuits) are still preferable to negative-balance bank
accounts.

It’s not hard to surmise, just by reading your email, what happened at
O.A.T.: the realization that issuing refunds en masse would bleed the
company dry. Tweaking the immortal words of Biggie: no money, mo’
problems.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To determine if my hunch was correct, I reached out to O.A.T. While they
didn’t answer my question directly, I was able to recoup more than
$100,000, collectively, for you and 10 other readers. Some got total
refunds, while others (including you) received partial refunds or
continue to wait for certain fees and sums to clear.

In an emailed statement, an O.A.T. spokeswoman said the company is
“working to improve our processes and to better address the needs of
each traveler whose trip was canceled or postponed due to the pandemic.
We are either rebooking travelers on another trip or providing a
refund.” Since mid-March, she said, O.A.T. has refunded more than
5,000 travelers — amounting to more than $12 million.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TripAdvisor, ConsumerAffairs and other review sites show lingering
frustrations about the company’s coronavirus policies, but several Times
readers, according to emails I’ve received, have made headway by filing
parallel complaints with the [Better Business
Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/) and the [Massachusetts Attorney General’s
office](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-a-consumer-complaint). That
agency said that it has received about 275 consumer complaints so far
about canceled O.A.T. trips and has been pressuring the company to
comply with the state’s travel-seller laws.

Other travelers looking for refunds may have a better chance if they’re
dealing with companies headquartered within Hawaii, Washington state,
Illinois or California. In Hawaii, consumers have the right to a cash
refund (minus previously disclosed cancellation fees) within two weeks
of requesting one. Washington requires travel companies to issue cash
refunds within 14 days (or 30 days when the funds are already paid to a
vendor, as might be the case for a tour operator) when they cancel a
service. In Illinois, the Travel Promotion Consumer Protection Act was
created in the 1980s to safeguard against travel scams that promise
too-good-to-be-true deals. California, with some of the strongest
consumer protections in the country, requires cash refunds for
undelivered services within 30 days from whichever date is earliest: the
scheduled departure date, the date the refund is requested or the date
the service was canceled by the travel company. (Mr. Anolik has a
detailed breakdown of other state-by-state travel laws on [his firm’s
website.](https://www.travellaw.com/page/travel-law-faq))

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Back to O. A. T.: In a follow-up note a few weeks ago, you said that you
feel the company provides a “good travel service.” But, you wrote,
“pushing all the risk of uncertainty onto the client by refusing a
refund makes me fearful to ever do business with O.A.T. again.”

You raise an important point. Even though people can’t travel right now,
many of us are continuing to dream about our next trip — and that means
