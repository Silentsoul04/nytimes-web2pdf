### **Dear Tripped Up,**

My trip to Egypt with [Overseas Adventure
Travel](https://www.oattravel.com/) was scheduled to depart in late
March. O.A.T. canceled the tour because of Covid-19, which was a relief.
The company notified me of the cancellation and offered either a credit
for rebooking or a full refund that would have included airfare. The
next week, I learned via email that I had been rebooked on the same trip
next year. Unbeknown to me, the stated policy had changed: O.A.T. was no
longer offering refunds. I told them that I had a medical condition and
did not know when — or if — I would be able to travel, and asked whether
they were just going to keep my $17,500 if I couldn’t travel by the end
of 2021. Answer: Yes.

I feel I am being held hostage by O.A.T. How are they allowed to keep my
money? Roz

### Hi Roz,

They’re not. But, if the extraordinary number of reader complaints I
have received — more than a dozen and counting — are any indication,
they have been doing so anyway.

Overseas Adventure Travel is part of Grand Circle Corporation, a family
of travel companies based in Boston. The small-group and cruising
company has been [recognized
nationally.](https://www.oattravel.com/oat-difference/awards)

But Massachusetts happens to be one of only a handful of states with
specific laws that guarantee consumers protection against [travel
sellers](https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-15-the-sale-of-travel-services/download),
including requiring that tour operators offer the option of cash refunds
(in addition to vouchers or credits for rebooking) when they fail to
provide agreed-upon, paid-for services. According to [the
law,](https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-15-the-sale-of-travel-services/download)
the cash refund must be “an amount equal to the fair market retail value
of any undelivered, purchased travel service.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Translation: When they cancel your trip, they are legally required to
offer you the money back.

But even when individual consumers know their rights, they have few
options at their immediate disposal when a customer-service
representative — usually the only public-facing proxy for a company’s
official or unofficial policies — refuses to relent on
refunds.

As [Adam Anolik,](https://travellaw.com/) a San Francisco- based
travel-industry lawyer, explained over email, that’s why oversight —
forcing a company to comply with state laws — can feel like an uphill
battle. “The outcome can often turn on who cancels, which is why a lot
of suppliers and travelers are playing chicken right now. In reality,
many of these statutes are seldom enforced. This pandemic could cause
some of them to be dusted off,” said Mr. Anolik.

This is the third [Tripped
Up](https://www.nytimes.com/column/tripped-up) column in a row that
addresses the issue of refunds. Although travel has stopped and is only
starting up again — slowly and in only a few destinations — the
aftershocks of that screeching halt, brought on by the coronavirus,
continue to reverberate.

As travel companies now suffer a cash crunch, they are facing off with
travelers over [credits and
refunds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/travel/refunds-or-credits-travelers-and-businesses-face-off.html).
Airlines are
[sidestepping](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/travel/trip-refund-airlines.html)
refund regulations established by the United States Transportation
Department and the European Union, betting that negative press (and even
class-action lawsuits) are still preferable to negative-balance bank
accounts.

It’s not hard to surmise, just by reading your email, what happened at
O.A.T.: the realization that issuing refunds en masse would bleed the
company dry. Tweaking the immortal words of Biggie: no money, mo’
problems.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To determine if my hunch was correct, I reached out to O.A.T. While they
didn’t answer my question directly, I was able to recoup more than
$100,000, collectively, for you and 10 other readers. Some got total
refunds, while others (including you) received partial refunds or
continue to wait for certain fees and sums to clear.

In an emailed statement, an O.A.T. spokeswoman said the company is
“working to improve our processes and to better address the needs of
each traveler whose trip was canceled or postponed due to the pandemic.
We are either rebooking travelers on another trip or providing a
refund.” Since mid-March, she said, O.A.T. has refunded more than
5,000 travelers — amounting to more than $12 million.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TripAdvisor, ConsumerAffairs and other review sites show lingering
frustrations about the company’s coronavirus policies, but several Times
readers, according to emails I’ve received, have made headway by filing
parallel complaints with the [Better Business
Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/) and the [Massachusetts Attorney General’s
office](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-a-consumer-complaint). That
agency said that it has received about 275 consumer complaints so far
about canceled O.A.T. trips and has been pressuring the company to
comply with the state’s travel-seller laws.

Other travelers looking for refunds may have a better chance if they’re
dealing with companies headquartered within Hawaii, Washington state,
Illinois or California. In Hawaii, consumers have the right to a cash
refund (minus previously disclosed cancellation fees) within two weeks
of requesting one. Washington requires travel companies to issue cash
refunds within 14 days (or 30 days when the funds are already paid to a
vendor, as might be the case for a tour operator) when they cancel a
service. In Illinois, the Travel Promotion Consumer Protection Act was
created in the 1980s to safeguard against travel scams that promise
too-good-to-be-true deals. California, with some of the strongest
consumer protections in the country, requires cash refunds for
undelivered services within 30 days from whichever date is earliest: the
scheduled departure date, the date the refund is requested or the date
the service was canceled by the travel company. (Mr. Anolik has a
detailed breakdown of other state-by-state travel laws on [his firm’s
website.](https://www.travellaw.com/page/travel-law-faq))

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Back to O. A. T.: In a follow-up note a few weeks ago, you said that you
feel the company provides a “good travel service.” But, you wrote,
“pushing all the risk of uncertainty onto the client by refusing a
refund makes me fearful to ever do business with O.A.T. again.”

You raise an important point. Even though people can’t travel right now,
many of us are continuing to dream about our next trip — and that means
making conscious and subconscious decisions about which companies to
spend money with once the pandemic has passed.
