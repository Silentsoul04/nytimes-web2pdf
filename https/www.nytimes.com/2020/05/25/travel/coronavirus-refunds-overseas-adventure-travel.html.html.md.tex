Overseas Adventure Travel.

My trip to Egypt with \href{https://www.oattravel.com/}{Overseas
Adventure Travel} was scheduled to depart in late March. O.A.T. canceled
the tour because of Covid-19, which was a relief. The company notified
me of the cancellation and offered either a credit for rebooking or a
full refund that would have included airfare. The next week, I learned
via email that I had been rebooked on the same trip next year. Unbeknown
to me, the stated policy had changed: O.A.T. was no longer offering
refunds. I told them that I had a medical condition and did not know
when --- or if --- I would be able to travel, and asked whether they
were just going to keep my \$17,500 if I couldn't travel by the end of
2021. Answer: Yes.

I feel I am being held hostage by O.A.T. How are they allowed to keep my
money? Roz

\hypertarget{hi-roz}{%

They're not. But, if the extraordinary number of reader complaints I
have received --- more than a dozen and counting --- are any indication,
they have been doing so anyway.

Overseas Adventure Travel is part of Grand Circle Corporation, a family
of travel companies based in Boston. The small-group and cruising
company has been
\href{https://www.oattravel.com/oat-difference/awards}{recognized
nationally.}

But Massachusetts happens to be one of only a handful of states with
specific laws that guarantee consumers protection against
\href{https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-15-the-sale-of-travel-services/download}{travel
sellers}, including requiring that tour operators offer the option of
cash refunds (in addition to vouchers or credits for rebooking) when
they fail to provide agreed-upon, paid-for services. According to
\href{https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-15-the-sale-of-travel-services/download}{the
law,} the cash refund must be ``an amount equal to the fair market
retail value of any undelivered, purchased travel service.''

Translation: When they cancel your trip, they are legally required to
offer you the money back.

But even when individual consumers know their rights, they have few
options at their immediate disposal when a customer-service
representative --- usually the only public-facing proxy for a company's
official or unofficial policies --- refuses to relent on refunds.

As \href{https://travellaw.com/}{Adam Anolik,} a San Francisco- based
travel-industry lawyer, explained over email, that's why oversight ---
forcing a company to comply with state laws --- can feel like an uphill
battle. ``The outcome can often turn on who cancels, which is why a lot
of suppliers and travelers are playing chicken right now. In reality,
many of these statutes are seldom enforced. This pandemic could cause
some of them to be dusted off,'' said Mr. Anolik.

This is the third
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/column/tripped-up}{Tripped Up} column in a
row that addresses the issue of refunds. Although travel has stopped and
is only starting up again --- slowly and in only a few destinations ---
the aftershocks of that screeching halt, brought on by the coronavirus,
continue to reverberate.

As travel companies now suffer a cash crunch, they are facing off with
travelers over
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/travel/refunds-or-credits-travelers-and-businesses-face-off.html}{credits
and refunds}. Airlines are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/travel/trip-refund-airlines.html}{sidestepping}
refund regulations established by the United States Transportation
Department and the European Union, betting that negative press (and even
class-action lawsuits) are still preferable to negative-balance bank
accounts.

It's not hard to surmise, just by reading your email, what happened at
O.A.T.: the realization that issuing refunds en masse would bleed the
company dry. Tweaking the immortal words of Biggie: no money, mo'
problems.

To determine if my hunch was correct, I reached out to O.A.T. While they
didn't answer my question directly, I was able to recoup more than
\$100,000, collectively, for you and 10 other readers. Some got total
refunds, while others (including you) received partial refunds or
continue to wait for certain fees and sums to clear.

In an emailed statement, an O.A.T. spokeswoman said the company is
``working to improve our processes and to better address the needs of
each traveler whose trip was canceled or postponed due to the pandemic.
We are either rebooking travelers on another trip or providing a
refund.'' Since mid-March, she said, O.A.T. has refunded more than 5,000
travelers --- amounting to more than \$12 million.

TripAdvisor, ConsumerAffairs and other review sites show lingering
frustrations about the company's coronavirus policies, but several Times
readers, according to emails I've received, have made headway by filing
parallel complaints with the \href{https://www.bbb.org/}{Better Business
Bureau} and the
\href{https://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-a-consumer-complaint}{Massachusetts
Attorney General's office}. That agency said that it has received about
275 consumer complaints so far about canceled O.A.T. trips and has been
pressuring the company to comply with the state's travel-seller laws.

Other travelers looking for refunds may have a better chance if they're
dealing with companies headquartered within Hawaii, Washington state,
Illinois or California. In Hawaii, consumers have the right to a cash
refund (minus previously disclosed cancellation fees) within two weeks
of requesting one. Washington requires travel companies to issue cash
refunds within 14 days (or 30 days when the funds are already paid to a
vendor, as might be the case for a tour operator) when they cancel a
service. In Illinois, the Travel Promotion Consumer Protection Act was
created in the 1980s to safeguard against travel scams that promise
too-good-to-be-true deals. California, with some of the strongest
consumer protections in the country, requires cash refunds for
undelivered services within 30 days from whichever date is earliest: the
scheduled departure date, the date the refund is requested or the date
the service was canceled by the travel company. (Mr. Anolik has a
detailed breakdown of other state-by-state travel laws on
\href{https://www.travellaw.com/page/travel-law-faq}{his firm's
website.})

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

Back to O. A. T.: In a follow-up note a few weeks ago, you said that you
feel the company provides a ``good travel service.'' But, you wrote,
``pushing all the risk of uncertainty onto the client by refusing a
refund makes me fearful to ever do business with O.A.T. again.''

You raise an important point. Even though people can't travel right now,
many of us are continuing to dream about our next trip --- and that
means making conscious and subconscious decisions about which companies
to spend money with once the pandemic has passed.
