*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Anthony Bailey’s mother packed her seven-year-old son off in 1940 for
safekeeping to an American foster home, far from the German bombers
pulverizing their dockside hometown Portsmouth, England.

Two weeks later, Mr. Bailey found himself in the Dayton, Ohio, mansion
of [Otto
Spaeth](https://www.nytimes.com/1966/10/09/archives/otto-spaeth-dies-art-collector-69-former-whitney-executive-was.html),
a wealthy factory owner, philanthropist and art collector who owned
paintings by Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Edward Hopper
and Paul Gauguin.

“It was imprinted on him, art, from that moment forward,” his daughter
Annie Bailey said in an interview.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bailey would go on to a prolific career as a staff writer for The
New Yorker and as the author of 23 books on topics that spanned multiple
continents and genres.

But those four years of enlightenment and dislocation inspired Mr.
Bailey’s best-remembered projects — two memoirs of childhood chronicling
his “divided loyalty” to both countries and biographies of artists,
including Rembrandt, John Constable, J.M.W. Turner and “Vermeer: A View
of Delft,” which shortlisted for the Whitbread biography prize in 2001.

Mr. Bailey died in Harwich, Essex, England on May 13 of the novel
coronavirus, contracted in a recovery area following surgery to repair a
broken hip, his daughter said. He was 87. He had been living on Mersea
Island, near Colchester, at the time he suffered his fall, with his wife
Margot, an artist.

Mr. Bailey was born on Jan. 5, 1933, to Cowper Goldsmith Bailey, a bank
manager, and Phyllis Molony, a homemaker, in Portsmouth.

He read history at Merton College, Oxford, served a tour in the West
African Frontier Force in modern-day Ghana and bounced around in
bookseller’s shops around London, before heading back to the United
States, under Mr. Spaeth’s sponsorship, to embark on a writing career.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the mid-1950s, after failing to find a job at a newspaper, Mr. Bailey
sent a story about Ivan Illich, a young priest ministering to the poor
in Harlem, to the New Yorker ** editor William Shawn. Mr. Shawn
responded with an offer to work on the Talk of the Town section, and an
office next to a young John Updike, who would become one of his closest
friends. He would remain on staff until 1992.

He wrote a book about his banged-up sailing yacht and, in the 1960s, a
candid portrait of his then-hometown of Stonington, Conn. (“In the
Village,” 1971). In the 1970s, he moved back to seaside England and,
later, wrote accounts of walkabouts through Wales and the Outer Banks.
He also wrote a novel based on the life of John Andre, a co-conspirator
of Benedict Arnold. Over the last three decades, he focused on his
artist biographies.

Mr. Bailey was, his friends recalled, a patient listener happily
afflicted with a kind of literary restless-leg syndrome. He became
known, even as a young writer, for taking long walks that often yielded
friendships and story ideas. His writing style matched his gait,
unhurried but purposeful.

“Tony was a very peripatetic guy,” said the writer Paul Brodeur, who
began his New Yorker ** career with Mr. Bailey. “He loved to walk and to
meet people along the way. He had a wonderfully imaginative, descriptive
style.”

A memorable 1980 interview in The New Yorker with the Irish poet Seamus
Heaney about the conflict in Northern Ireland took place on a stroll
along the River Boyne. It began with a trip to the boot shop where Mr.
Heaney made an unlikely purchase: a pair of bright white Dr. Martens.

“They would look all right, he thought, after he had stepped in a few
cowpats,” Mr. Bailey
wrote.
