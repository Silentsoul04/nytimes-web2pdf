If you thought the volume on the Trump-Twitter-Fox noise distraction
machine was turned up extra loud in the past few weeks, it was not only
to deflect attention from the nearly 100,000 Americans who’ve died from
Covid-19, but also from the confirmation that on President Trump’s watch
our country suffered the *first deadly terrorist attack on U.S. soil
since 9/11 that was planned abroad.*

You read that right. Last week, Attorney General William Barr and the
F.B.I. said that data from cellphones of a Saudi Air Force trainee who
killed three U.S. sailors and wounded eight others at a Navy air base in
Pensacola, Fla., on Dec. 6 confirmed that it was an act of
foreign-planned “terrorism.”

The phone data [“definitively
establishes”](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-and-fbi-director-christopher-wray-announce-significant)
that the trainee, Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, had “significant ties to Al
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula — not only before the attack, but before
he even arrived in the United States” in August 2017. He had actually
joined the Saudi military to carry out a “special operation.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That Alshamrani was able to kill three sailors at an American base was a
massive failure of U.S. and Saudi intelligence. I mean, who should be
getting more scrutinized before they come train in the U.S. on an air
base than Saudi pilots?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump administration clearly had no idea what was happening under
its nose.

As [The Washington Post
noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/fbi-links-al-qaeda-to-saudi-gunman-who-killed-three-us-sailors-in-pensacola-last-year/2020/05/18/b34e3f7a-990f-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html):
After the attack, investigators found evidence that 17 fellow Saudi
students “had shared Islamist militant or anti-American material on
social media, and others had possessed or shared child pornography. As a
result, 21 cadets from Saudi Arabia were disenrolled from the training
program and sent home.”

That sort of intelligence failure — *the first foreign-planned terrorist
attack on U.S. shores since 9/11* — is something you’d expect Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo to be particularly upset about. After all, it was
Pompeo, when he was in Congress, who spearheaded the investigations into
then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s supposed responsibility for
the death of four U.S. diplomats in a terrorist attack on the U.S.
Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.

Oh, you forgot about Congressman Pompeo’s endless campaign to nail
Hillary with Benghazi? Well, let me jog your memory. Here is how The
Guardian [described the
conclusion](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/28/house-benghazi-report-clinton-attack-military)
of the 800-page, House select committee investigation on Benghazi, led
by a Republican representative, Trey Gowdy, and issued on July 28, 2016:

It “found no new evidence to conclude that Hillary Clinton, secretary of
state at the time, was culpable in the deaths.” A few hours later, the
Obama White House “noted tersely that this was the eighth congressional
committee to investigate the attacks and went on longer than the 9/11
commission and the committees designated to look at Pearl Harbor, the
assassination of President John F Kennedy, the Iran-contra affair and
Watergate.”

So, let’s do some math here: Then-Congressman Pompeo led the utterly
contrived campaign to blame Hillary for the Benghazi deaths — a charge
that a *Republican-led committee* found to be without merit. But Pompeo
used his crusade to gain the attention, via Fox News, of Trump and was
named Trump’s C.I.A. director. And now we learn that while Pompeo was
C.I.A. director, the first foreign-planned terrorist attack on U.S. soil
since 9/11 was being organized here and abroad, and while he was
secretary of state it was carried out.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now that’s something worth investigating.

I don’t know much about Pompeo’s time as head of the C.I.A., except that
he was notorious for spending long hours at the White House sucking up
to Trump. But I do know he has been the worst secretary of state in
American history, without a single diplomatic achievement.

I know you thought that Rex Tillerson had retired that title. Tillerson
was ineffective, but Tillerson had integrity and ethics. Pompeo has
none. American taxpayers deserve a refund from him for his education at
West Point.

Pompeo’s two most notable accomplishments as secretary of state are,
metaphorically speaking, shooting two of his senior State Department
officials in the back.

One was the distinguished U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch,
whom Pompeo removed on the orders of Trump and Trump’s nut-job lawyer
Rudy Giuliani. The other was the department’s inspector general, Steve
Linick, whom Pompeo got Trump to fire, reportedly because he was
investigating — wait for it now — Pompeo’s own efforts to [evade a
congressional ban on arms
sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/arms-deals-raytheon-yemen.html)
*to Saudi Arabia* and for improperly [asking a State Department employee
to run
errands](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html)
for him and his wife.

Hell, if that were me — if the first foreign-planned terrorist attack on
American soil since 9/11 developed on my watch and if I had just gotten
rid of the State Department inspector general without explanation — I’d
also be trying to distract attention.

I mean, if it were me, I might even claim that China concocted the
coronavirus in a lab in Wuhan. Wait — that’s what Pompeo did\!

“There is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that
laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo [told ABC News’s “This
Week”](https://www.state.gov/secretary-michael-r-pompeo-with-martha-raddatz-of-abcs-this-week-with-george-stephanopoulos/)
on May 3. “The best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have
no reason to disbelieve that at this point.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Pompeo has a well-earned reputation for pushing conspiracy theories. I
certainly think it is possible that a coronavirus from bats being
studied in the Wuhan lab might have escaped by accident. But the “best”
expert virologists — and U.S. intelligence agencies — say there’s no
proof it was man-made, which would leave DNA tracks.

When Martha Raddatz, the ABC interviewer, told Pompeo that U.S.
intelligence has said no such thing, he just reversed course and said:
“I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason
to believe that they’ve got it wrong.”

What? The secretary of state first accuses China of manufacturing a
virus that has killed over 340,000 people worldwide and then, when
reminded that our intelligence agencies have concluded no such thing, he
backs off with no explanation. Can you be any more unprofessional?

But that’s not the only slimeball story that Pompeo wants to distract
attention from. On May 19, [NBC News
revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/pompeo-s-elite-taxpayer-funded-dinners-raise-new-concerns-n1210746)
that since 2018 he and his wife, Susan, had held some two dozen
“elaborate, unpublicized” dinners “in the historic Diplomatic
Reception Rooms on the government’s dime. State Department officials
involved in the dinners said they had raised concerns internally that
the events were essentially using federal resources to cultivate a donor
and supporter base for Pompeo’s political ambitions.”

Pompeo and his wife are widely rumored to harbor White House dreams. And
it showed. NBC said “the records show that about 29 percent of the
invitees came from the corporate world, while about a quarter of them
hailed from the media or entertainment industries, with conservative
media members heavily represented. About 30 percent work in politics or
government, and just 14 percent were diplomats or foreign officials.
Every single member of the House or the Senate who has been invited is a
Republican.”

With a president, a Senate majority and Fox News always at the ready to
defend him, Pompeo couldn’t care less about any of these stories. He
just smirks and marches on. But every American should care. The morale
and effectiveness of our State Department — and our standing in the
world — are both the worse for him.
