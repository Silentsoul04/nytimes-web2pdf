As a makeup artist, Keita Moore has become an observer of faces. Months
ago, in the early stages of the pandemic, he saw very little makeup when
he ran out on the occasional errand. Lately, though, he has noticed that
the faces are changing, slowly. Masks are plentiful, as are filled-in
brows and lashes coated in mascara.

**“**So many people are doing this,” Mr. Moore said. “It’s fun to get
dressed and get cute, even if it’s just to get groceries.”

Dismissing makeup as frivolity would be easier than ever now. Our
professional and social lives are scaled down, and we’ve withdrawn
inside. Collectively we’ve gone back to basics, and makeup is plainly
nonessential. But it is also a cultural artifact, reflecting the
aesthetics and ethos of the era. What will our faces show as we live
through months or years of the pandemic?

Nick Barose, a makeup artist, looked back and found makeup’s future. At
the beginning of his lockdown in March, he organized his Brooklyn
apartment “to make it more homey, since I’d actually be home,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That’s when he discovered reference materials — books, images, magazine
tear sheets — he had used as he learned to do makeup. He was drawn to
avant-garde beauty editorials of the 1980s, with images of Old Hollywood
stars like Marilyn Monroe. The nostalgia boosted his mood.

“You can listen to ’80s music, put on ’80s makeup and fantasize about a
life that’s not yours,” Mr. Barose said.

Makeup, he predicts, will take two distinct courses as the pandemic
plays out. The first will be practical and edited, emphasizing long-wear
products and natural brows and lashes. But for some, makeup will be an
escape.

“Our reality is so uncertain that I can see people getting
experimental,” he said. “It’s a scary time, so it’s a time when you
want to dream more,
too.”

**Make Foundation Transfer-Proof**

Because much of the face is covered, foundation should be used
sparingly, if at all. Instead, blend concealer under the eyes and on any
uneven spots above the nose. If you use foundation, a light application
on the exposed areas is all you need.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Most women choose foundation for the look,” said Keanda Snagg, a makeup
artist, meaning that they’re going for color match and finish and are
usually not as concerned about performance. Now is the time to consider
a formula’s staying power, too. Ms. Snagg suggests [Fenty Pro Filt’r
Hydrating Longwear
Foundation](https://www.fentybeauty.com/pro-filtr-hydrating-longwear-foundation/FB30020.html),
$35.

Mr. Moore swears by [Premiere Products Blue Marble Selr
Spray,](https://www.ppipremiereproducts.com/products/blue-marble-selr)
$14, a cult favorite setting spray, to keep makeup in place. “A lot of
drag queens use it when they perform onstage,” he said. “It makes your
makeup absolutely transfer-proof. You could lie down on a pillow and
there’d be no foundation on it after you got up.”

Erin Parsons, another makeup artist, predicts that foundation formulas
will evolve to focus on skin care. “Masks will shift how we think about
foundation,” Ms. Parsons said. “When you take them off, your skin is
irritated and red. I keep thinking the next generation of foundation
will be soothing and protecting.”

**Emphasize Brows and Lashes**

The new basic face is filled-in brows and amplified lashes. “If there’s
one thing we should learn now, it’s how to properly fill in your brows,”
Mr. Moore said. Eyebrow pencils give users more control of color density
(and most people go too dark on brows), so he prefers them to powders,
which can be blotchy.

“People tend to fill in too much at the inner part of the brows,” he
said. “Focus on the tail because that’s where most brows are sparse.
Brush your brows up and outward and fill in only where you need more
hair.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Pick a pencil with an angled flat tip, like[the Lip Bar Hi-Brow Gel +
Pencil](https://www.thelipbar.com/products/hi-brow), $14. This shape
helps you mimic the look and direction of hair growth.

The [Lashify at-home lash extension kit](https://lashify.com/), $145,
creates a lash look that’s a step up from a coat of mascara. The system
contains individual lashes, so your result is customizable. “You can
just add a couple lashes to the outer end of your lashes for more
drama,” Mr. Moore said.

**Introduce Color With Eyeliner**

As our time in masks wears on, makeup artists expect we’ll transition to
eye makeup that’s simple yet expressive. Eyeliner is the best tool for
these times because it’s uncomplicated. A bright color is interesting
and fun without requiring the layering and dimension of eye
shadow.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“My favorite is winged eyeliner in any bright color — pink, blue,
burgundy — anything that’s not black,” Ms. Snagg said. She likes [NYX
Epic Wear Liquid
Liner](https://www.nyxcosmetics.com/eyes/eyeliner/epic-wear-liquid-liner/NYX_806.html),
$10, a waterproof formula. (“You could jump in a pool and it wouldn’t
budge,” she said.)

An eyeliner newbie can start with a simple line along the lashes and,
with practice, work up to a wing. Ms. Snagg’s winged liner technique:
Draw a triangle at the outer corner of the eye. Then, using gentle
strokes, create a line that connects that triangle to the inner corner
of your eye.
