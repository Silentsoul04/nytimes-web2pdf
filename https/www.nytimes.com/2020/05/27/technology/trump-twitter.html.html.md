# Twitter Comes Under Attack From Trump’s Supporters

</div>

After the social media company labeled two of the president’s tweets as
inaccurate on Tuesday, his adherents pounced.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Not long after
[Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-order-social-media.html)
added a warning label to two of [President
Trump’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-order-social-media.html)
tweets on Tuesday, his supporters swung into action.

On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s adherents targeted one of the company’s
executives for old tweets in which he had criticized the president and
other Republicans. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers including Senator Marco
Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of
Missouri, said they would move to regulate
[Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter.html).

In right-wing media, pundits such as Trish Regan and websites like the
Gateway Pundit decried the decision and accused Twitter of bias. The
furor quickly spread through dozens of Facebook groups, Reddit forums
and YouTube videos.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The activity was payback for Twitter, Mr. Trump’s favorite social media
platform, after the company took action on the president’s tweets for
the first time. While for years
[Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter.html)
had been hands-off on Mr. Trump’s posts, which have often included
falsehoods and threats, it added fact-checking labels to two of the
president’s messages related to mail-in ballots on Tuesday to signal
that they were inaccurate.

That sparked a vitriolic reaction from Mr. Trump, who said on Twitter
that the company was interfering with the presidential election and
stifling free speech. His supporters — a mixture of mainstream
Republicans, far-right personalities and online acolytes — then quickly
turned to a well-worn playbook of vilifying those whom they saw as
slighting him.

In recent months, the [targets of their ire have included Dr. Anthony
Fauci](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/technology/coronavirus-fauci-trump-conspiracy-target.html),
the infectious disease expert who has [corrected overly
rosy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-fauci.html)
pronouncements about [the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html),
and [Bill Gates, the tech
billionaire-turned-philanthropist](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/technology/bill-gates-virus-conspiracy-theories.html)
who has indirectly criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the
pandemic.

But this time, the right-wing machinery training its sights on a
publicly traded company — Twitter — and its roughly 5,000 employees,
took on an added menace, disinformation researchers said.

The tactics are something that Mr. [Trump’s
supporters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/trump-rally-supporters.html)
“return to again and again,” said Melissa Ryan, chief executive of Card
Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation. “Where it
gets worrisome for the tech companies is, of course, the Trump
administration has the power to make their life very difficult.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump continued his tirade. In two tweets, he accused
social media companies of working to “totally silence conservatives
voices.” He added, “We will strongly regulate, or close them down,
before we can ever allow this to happen.”

The right-wing backlash against Twitter built even as some researchers
questioned how effective the labels on Mr. Trump’s tweets would be. Some
said they were unlikely to sway public opinion about the reliability of
Mr. Trump’s statements; others criticized the “get the facts” language
that Twitter had added to the posts as vague. Several pointed out that
Twitter had not gone as far as removing the posts.

Studies have found that fact-checking false claims on social media can
help readers, but that [specific labels like “disputed” or “rated
false”](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-solutions.pdf) were
more effective in raising public understanding.

Even labeling a claim “false” on social media reduced its perceived
accuracy by only about 13 percentage points, said Katie Clayton, a
researcher who worked on a 2019 study at Dartmouth College that examined
fact-check labels on news headlines on Facebook.

Still, she said, Twitter’s actions were “a step in the right direction.”

A Twitter spokesman said the online harassment that one of its
executives was experiencing was “disappointing.” The San Francisco
company, whose employees curated its fact-checks, added that it would
continue labeling tweets that contained misinformation about elections
or coronavirus. It said it might expand those policies to include labels
for misinformation about additional topics.

In total, the backlash against Twitter has spread to more than 100
Facebook group and pages, thousands of tweets and several Reddit forums
in which Mr. Trump’s followers have claimed that Twitter suppresses
conservative speech, according to a New York Times analysis. In those
online threads, Trump supporters said Twitter employees were biased
liberals and urged Mr. Trump to fast-track regulations to limit the
company.

“I wonder if Jack Dorsey grew up dreaming: ‘one day I will connect the
world with an easy to use app, giving every individual a voice, then I
will censor, throttle, and ban the people with whom I disagree,’” wrote
one Twitter user, referring to the social network’s chief executive.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fans of Mr. Trump also rapidly turned on Yoel Roth, a Twitter executive
who combats bots, election interference and fake accounts. The campaign
against Mr. Roth started late Tuesday when Liz Wheeler, a TV host on One
America News Network, a cable network that has championed the Trump
administration’s agenda, [unearthed and reposted
tweets](https://twitter.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1265463081997484032) in
which Mr. Roth had referred to Mr. Trump as a “racist tangerine.” Others
added a tweet from Mr. Roth that called Senate majority leader Mitch
McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, a “bag of farts.”

Far-right media outlets like
[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/26/twitter-fact-checker-claimed-trump-actual-nazis-mocked-flyover-states/)
and [The Gateway
Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/05/report-twitters-head-site-integrity-responsible-election-security-misinformation-says-nazis-white-house/)
immediately seized on the messages as proof that Twitter was biased
against conservatives. By Wednesday morning, Mr. Roth’s old tweets had
reached the White House. On Fox News, Kellyanne Conway referenced him by
name and called on supporters to “wake him up.”

“I think I want to raise the name of somebody at Twitter,” Ms. Conway
said in the interview, spelling out Mr. Roth’s Twitter handle so that
viewers could find his social media profile. “Somebody in San Francisco,
go wake him up and tell him he’s about to get a lot more followers.”

Mentions of Mr. Roth on Twitter spiked to 180 mentions in a five-minute
span on Tuesday evening, and to 478 mentions on Wednesday morning,
according to The Times analysis. Mr. Roth declined to comment.

The decision to fact-check Mr. Trump was not Mr. Roth’s, a Twitter
spokesman said. It was instead made by executives focused on legal and
policy issues after Mr. Trump’s tweets were reported to the company
through a portal used by election-related nonprofits and those who
administer elections in states.

In Washington, the confrontation between Mr. Trump and Twitter
reinvigorated calls among Republican lawmakers to change
[Section 230](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/technology/section-230-lobby.html)
of the Communications Decency Act, which protects technology companies
from most liability for content posted by their users.

“The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they
are considered forums not publishers,” Mr. Rubio
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1265442093641732096)on
Tuesday. “But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role
like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &
treated as publishers under the law.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a letter on Wednesday to Mr. Dorsey, Mr. Hawley said Twitter enjoyed
a “[special immunity worth
billions](https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1265444047365312515)” and
called on lawmakers to put an end to the “sweetheart deal.”

Ms. Ryan, the disinformation researcher, said Twitter is in “uncharted
territory.”

“You can predict pretty easily how Trump is going to respond,” she said.
But with Twitter, “once the company enforces a policy, is it going to
succumb to the blowback? Or is it going to stay the course? I think
that’s the important thing to watch moving forward.”

Kate Conger reported from Oakland, Calif., and Davey Alba from New York.
