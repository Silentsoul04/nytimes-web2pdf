\section{`Overtaken by Aliens': India Faces Another Plague as Locusts
Swarm}\label{overtaken-by-aliens-india-faces-another-plague-as-locusts-swarm}}

Blizzards of bugs are descending on India at an already tough time.
Scientists say climate change is making the infestation worse.

NEW DELHI --- Magan Doodi, a groundskeeper at a golf course in Jaipur,
was making his rounds earlier this week when he saw the sky suddenly
turn a weird pink.

It wasn't some quirk of the weather. It was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/india-new-delhi-locusts.html}{locusts}
--- millions of them, ``like a spreading bedsheet,'' he said.

``The locusts have attacked the golf course!'' Mr. Doodi yelled into his
cellphone during the battle Monday morning. ``It's man versus locusts!''

As if
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/world/asia/india-monsoon-lightning-rainstorms.html}{India}
needed more challenges, with coronavirus infections steadily increasing,
\href{https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/heatwave-intensifies-across-india-delhi-records-hottest-day-since-2002-120052700142_1.html}{a

problem:
\href{https://twitter.com/_i_am_aj/status/1265073844211134465?s=21}{a
locust invasion}.

Scientists say it's the worst attack in 25 years and these locusts are
different.

``This time the attack is by very young locusts who fly for longer
distances, at faster speeds, unlike adults in the past who were sluggish
and not so fast,'' said K.L. Gurjar, the deputy director of India's
Locust Warning Organization.

The locusts were flying in from Iran and Pakistan, blanketing half a
dozen states in western and central India. Because most of the crops
were recently harvested, the hungry swarms have buzzed into urban areas,
eager to devour bushes and trees, carpeting whatever surface they land
on.

On Monday, Jaipur, a sprawling city of 4 million and the biggest in the
state of Rajasthan, was besieged.
\href{https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1264898868740669441?s=21}{A
blizzard of bugs flew over concrete buildings} and the wealthier
neighborhoods, swooping in on trees and plants, crossing graveyards and
jewelry markets, attracted to the manicured golf course in the heart of
the city.

After he saw what was happening, Mr. Doodi, the groundskeeper, yelled
out to the caddies and other key personnel, urging them to make whatever
loud noise they could to drive the bugs away. Some grabbed firecrackers.
Others steel plates to bang on. Another person ran up to the roof of a
maintenance building and started thumping on empty plastic containers,
like drums.

Residents clamored to protect themselves and their flora, spilling onto
the streets banging plates with spoons and jumping into parked cars to
honk horns.

``I got out of my room and came out on my terrace at around 10 a.m. and
saw a long shadow on the ground,'' recalled Nikhil Misra, a lawyer in
Jaipur. ``I just stood still. It was something I had never seen in my
lifetime.''

``I looked up and saw a cloud, not the cloud that gives you rainfall,
but a cloud of locusts, thousands and thousands of them hovering over my
head,'' he said. ``It was a silent attack. It was a strange kind of
fear, as if being overtaken by aliens.''

Scientists say that this outbreak, similar to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/africa/locusts-kenya-east-africa.html}{recent
outbreaks in East Africa}, is driven by the same factors: unusually warm
weather and more rain. They blame climate change.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

``All this started in late 2019, when there were warm waters in the
western Indian oceans,'' said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at
the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. ``These waters
triggered lot of rains over the East African regions and the Arabian
Peninsula. This seems to have triggered an ideal condition for breeding
of locusts.''

The movement of the swarms depends on the winds, which are blowing west
to east and a little south right now. That could put the swarms in
India's bushy center very soon.

Already, they have
\href{https://twitter.com/sudharamenifs/status/1264799205413072897?s=21}{overrun
one of India's renowned tiger} reserves, Panna National Park, covering
the trees in straight lines of countless insects, like a twitching bark.

The Indian government wants to tackle this regionally and has offered to
set aside some of its differences with Pakistan to provide the
neighboring country with pesticide to spray on its side of the border.
India has made the same offer to Iran, which responded positively,
Indian officials said.

Indian scientists said that in a single day, a modest locust swarm can
travel 200 kilometers and eat as much food as about 35,000 people.
