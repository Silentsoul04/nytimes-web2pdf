\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Eddie Gancayco spent three decades working in food service at some of
New York's most prestigious institutions, including Mount Sinai Medical
Center in Manhattan. As manager of the cafeteria and catering there the
last half-dozen years, he helped feed the hospital's doctors and nurses.

Some of the same doctors and nurses treated him during his six-week
battle with the new
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/world/asia/coronavirus-philippines-priest.html}{coronavirus}.
He died of complications of the infection on May 6 at 62.

Mr. Gancayco was one of the growing number
of\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-hospital-workers.html}{nonmedical
workers} who kept hospitals clean and safe and their staff members
nourished before succumbing to the virus themselves.

He was admitted to Mount Sinai on April 3 and received his diagnosis
after being sick at home for about two weeks, his daughter, Amanda
Gancayco Travers, said. Many of the doctors and nurses who called to
provide daily updates on her father's condition knew Mr. Gancayco from
the cafeteria, she said.

``He is one of us, and we're taking care of him as best we can,'' she
said a doctor in the intensive care unit had told her.

When the virus took hold in New York, and Mount Sinai began experiencing
a surge in patients, Ms. Travers had urged her father to consider taking
time off to protect himself, she said.

He declined, citing the people who relied on him. ``He was more thinking
about how we are going to serve the doctors and nurses who need food and
service under the new parameters,'' Ms. Travers said. ``He was always
thinking about other people, and how he could help them.''

Eduardo Luis Gancayco was born on Oct. 27, 1957, in Manila. He was one
of nine children of Miguel Gancayco, who owned a construction company,
and Mary Gancayco, a homemaker.

Mr. Gancayco and his wife, Teresa, left the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/world/asia/coronavirus-philippines-priest.html}{Philippines}
for the United States in the early 1980s and settled in the Elmhurst
neighborhood of Queens. He came to feel at home in the city, embracing
its diversity and energy, and becoming an avid Knicks fan, his daughter
said.

Instilled with a love of cooking during his years in the Philippines,
Mr. Gancayco worked at restaurants. He eventually took a job as a
barista at a cafe run by the food services company Restaurant
Associates.

Mr. Gancayco worked his way up, holding jobs in cafeterias at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, a law firm and a bank before moving into
management.

In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, his mother and
seven siblings.

Mr. Gancayco took his love of hospitality home with him, coordinating
and making elaborate spreads for all manner of family gatherings,
including holiday dinners, bridal showers and Sunday brunches, Ms.
Travers said.

``He was the consummate host, and could never sit down and enjoy,'' she
said. Even at her wedding in June 2018 at the Central Park Boathouse,
she recalled, her father flitted about, greeting guests, asking them if
they needed anything.

``I had to remind him: `Dad this is your event, you are not managing it.
You should enjoy it,''' she said. He appeared to take her advice. As he
delivered a toast, he smiled broadly, then downed two glasses of bubbly
and implored his guests to have a good time.
