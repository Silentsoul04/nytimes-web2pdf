\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Gladys Cortes, who had always been there for others, was all by herself
when she died on April 9 in a Long Island hospital at 48.

``To me, that was the most heartbreaking part of it,'' her sister Miriam
Cortes said.

Yet she remains in the minds of her family and friends, of her
co-workers and customers.

Some remember her as a struggling single mother of a 13-year-old
daughter, Adryanna, or the caretaker for her 85-year-old mother,
Narcisa. Others remember her for readying prepared food behind the
counter in her job at a supermarket in Islip, N.Y., or ministering to
relatives, close colleagues and even mere acquaintances when they were
bedbound with illness.

``She was always there,'' Miriam Cortes said. ``Anyone needed help, she
was always there.''

Gladys Cortes was born on March 12, 1972, in Mayagüez, P.R., to Ceferino
and Narcisa Cortes. She came to New York with her parents as a toddler.
The family moved to Long Island, and she graduated from North Babylon
High School with a Regents diploma and attended the State University of
New York at Farmingdale, dreaming of becoming an artist.

She was discouraged by less than rave reviews of her work in college and
by slim job prospects. To help support her family, she took a factory
job while making displays for stores and other clients; at least they
had an artistic element to them, her sister said. The supermarket hired
her about a year ago.

Ms. Cortes, who lived in Brentwood, N.Y., began feeling ill on March 28.
She was admitted to Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, also on Long
Island, on April 2 and died a week later of complications of Covid-19.

In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother and daughter
and five other siblings. Her partner left when their daughter was born.

Gladys Cortes had been born prematurely, barely one pound, 10 ounces.
``A miracle baby,'' Miriam Cortes said.

``And, I think knowing that,'' her sister said, ``she felt that every
time somebody needed a friend to listen to, or a family member needed
someone to co-sign a loan on their house, or someone else was sick in
the hospital, she was there.''
