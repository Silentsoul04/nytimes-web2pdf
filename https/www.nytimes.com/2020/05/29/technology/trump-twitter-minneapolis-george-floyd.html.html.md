# Twitter Adds Warnings to Trump and White House Tweets, Fueling Tensions

</div>

Twitter said the tweets, which implied that protesters in Minneapolis
could be shot, glorified violence — the first time it had applied such
warnings to any public figure’s posts.

Twitter escalated its confrontation with President Trump on Friday,
adding warning labels to two [tweets by Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-twitter-fact-check.html)
and the official White House Twitter account that implied that
[protesters in
Minneapolis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/george-floyd-minneapolis.html)
could be shot.

</div>

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Amid the unrest in Minnesota, Mr. Trump
[posted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704)a
message on Twitter early Friday saying that “when the looting starts,
the shooting starts.” Twitter quickly prevented users from viewing the
tweet without reading a brief notice that the post glorified violence,
the first time it had applied such a warning on any public figure’s
tweets. The [official White House account then
reposted](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266342941649506304) Mr.
Trump’s message; Twitter responded by adding the same notice.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Twitter’s actions came a day after Mr. Trump [signed an executive
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html)
to limit its legal protections under a statute that shields social media
companies from liability for the content posted on their platforms.
Twitter [publicly opposed the executive
order](https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1266170586197262337), calling
it “a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,” ramping
up a conflict with Mr. Trump that has exploded this week.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The decision to add the new warning labels was approved by Jack Dorsey,
Twitter’s chief executive, after a late-night debate among company
officials, said a person with knowledge of the deliberations. Twitter
further tightened restrictions on the messages from Mr. Trump and the
White House by blocking users from liking or replying to them, though
people could still retweet the messages if they added a comment of their
own.

But Twitter did not go as far as taking the posts down, saying it was in
the public’s interest that the messages remain
accessible.

The back-and-forth between [Mr. Trump and
Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-twitter-fact-check.html)
on Friday punctuated a week of conflict between the two.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The tussle began after Mr. Trump tweeted a hurtful and unsubstantiated
conspiracy theory
[this](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1257258214615367680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1257258214615367680%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F05%2F26%2Fbusiness%2Fletter-to-twitter-ceo.html)

to attack the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, which [caused critics to call
on Twitter to remove the
messages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/trump-scarborough-twitter.html).
While Twitter did not take those posts down, [it added fact-checking
labels for the first
time](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html)
to two of the president’s election-related posts on Tuesday. The labels
stood out because Twitter for years did little to moderate Mr. Trump’s
often inaccurate and threatening posts.

That immediately ignited Mr. Trump’s ire. He accused Twitter of stifling
free speech and said he would not allow the social media companies to
operate unfettered. And in an apparent act of retaliation, he [signed
the executive
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html)
on Thursday taking aim at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,
which provides the liability shield to the tech companies.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Twitter and Mr. Trump are now in a standoff. The company has said it
will continue putting warning labels and restrictions on tweets that
incite violence or spread false information about elections and the
coronavirus. And Mr. Trump, who once tweeted up to 108 times a day this
month, shows no signs of stopping his usage of the service, lashing out
on Friday on Twitter about Twitter itself.

“Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put
out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party,” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266326065833824257).
“They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the
United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it
will be regulated\!”

He posted several other tweets citing similar views by his favorite Fox
News hosts. And as if daring Twitter, he posted another message about
looting leading to shooting on Friday afternoon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In its separate Twitter account, the White House [jabbed directly at Mr.
Dorsey](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266373803870806023): “The
President did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it. @Jack and
Twitter’s biased, bad-faith ‘fact-checkers’ have made it clear: Twitter
is a publisher, not a platform.”

And Dan Scavino, the president’s deputy chief of staff, said Twitter
should be targeting the protesters in Minneapolis. “Twitter is targeting
the President of the United States 24/7, while turning their heads to
protest organizers who are planning, plotting, and communicating their
next moves daily on this very platform,” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/Scavino45/status/1266343153466060803). He
added that Twitter was full of it and “more and more people are
beginning to get it.”

[Twitter
said](https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1266267446979129345) it
had decided to restrict Mr. Trump’s tweet about the protests in
Minnesota “based on the historical context of the last line, its
connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions
today.” It had applied a warning label [on a
tweet](https://twitter.com/OsmarTerra/status/1246474430676643842) from
the Brazilian minister of citizenship, Osmar Terra, last month, but the
label was not for glorifying violence.

Mr. Dorsey also
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1266390510278569984) on Friday
morning that social networks’ fact-checking process should use
open-source technology — software that is created and shared for general
use — and be verifiable by everyone. He did not respond to a request for
comment.

The conflict has thrown Twitter into chaos, with employees racing to
take action on Mr. Trump’s tweets while also scrambling to protect
themselves from harassment. [After Mr. Trump and his allies lashed
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/technology/trump-twitter.html)
at one Twitter employee who had publicly criticized Mr. Trump and other
Republican leaders, other employees removed their company affiliation
from their social media profiles or locked their accounts from public
view.

First Amendment scholars said Friday that Mr. Trump and his allies had
it backward and that he was the one trying to stifle speech that clashed
with his own views.

“Fundamentally this dispute is about whether Twitter has the right to
disagree with, criticize, and respond to the president,” said Jameel
Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at
Columbia University. “Obviously, it does. It is remarkable and truly
chilling that the president and his advisers seem to believe otherwise.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Revoking Section 230 protections would expose Twitter and other online
platforms to expansive potential legal vulnerability that could
undermine the fundamentals of their businesses. But it would also remove
the very legal standard that has allowed Mr. Trump to use Twitter so
effectively to communicate with his more than 80 million followers — no
matter how incendiary, false and even defamatory his messages may be.

Without a liability shield, Twitter and online companies would be forced
to [police accounts like Mr. Trump’s even more
closely](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html)
to guard themselves against legal action.

Twitter has for years [faced
criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/technology/trump-twitter-account.html)
over Mr. Trump’s posts on the platform. The company has said repeatedly
that the president did not violate its terms of service, however much he
appeared to skirt the line. It has also said that [blocking world
leaders](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/world-leaders-and-twitter.html)
from the service or removing their tweets would hinder public debate.

Twitter did [announce last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/twitter-politicans-labels-abuse.html),
however, that it would in certain cases place warning labels on posts
from political figures that broke its rules, the feature it used with
Mr. Trump’s tweet about Minneapolis.

Mr. Trump’s message implying that the Minneapolis protesters could be
shot was also [posted on his official Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10164767134275725),
where it appears without any warning labels. Mark Zuckerberg, the
company’s chief executive, [told Fox
News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-twitter-fact-checking-trump)
this week that he was uncomfortable with Facebook’s being “the arbiter
of truth of everything that people say online.”

Protests have raged in Minneapolis this week over the death on Monday of
George Floyd, a black man who had been pinned down by a white police
officer who pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck.

Frederike Kaltheuner, a tech policy fellow at the Mozilla Foundation,
said Twitter’s confrontation with Mr. Trump raised questions about how
the platform would treat other world leaders. In March, the company
deleted posts by the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela that contained
unproven information about Covid-19 treatments.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I doubt that Twitter has the resources to consistently apply rules to
all heads of states that use their platform in all sorts of languages,”
Ms. Kaltheuner said. “From all we know about the many inconsistent ways
in which other policies are being enforced, my guess is that places that
rarely make U.S. news will likely be overlooked.”

In Mr. Trump’s tweets about Minneapolis on Friday, he also criticized
the response by Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat. Mr. Trump said Mr. Frey
must “get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will
send in the National Guard & get the job done right.”

Mr. Frey did not know about Mr. Trump’s tweets until a reporter read
them aloud during a news conference early on Friday. The mayor shook his
head and slammed a podium for emphasis.

“Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions,” he
said. “Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time
of crisis.”

He added, “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of
Minneapolis.”
