Target is temporarily closing or shortening the hours of about 200
stores in the United States as protests and looting spread across
country in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd.

The Target store on Lake Street in Minneapolis, the location nearest to
where Mr. Floyd died, was engulfed by unrest, badly damaged and looted
last week. Images of the battered store have featured prominently in
news coverage of the unrest in Minneapolis, where Target has its
headquarters.

In [a statement on its
website](https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2020/05/an-update-on-temporary-target-store-closures-due-t)
Saturday night, Target said: “We are heartbroken by the death of George
Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country. At this
time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores.”

The site initially listed more than 170 affected stores — 70 in
Minnesota and 104 in other states, including New York, California,
Texas, Illinois, Georgia, Colorado, Oregon, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an interview on Sunday morning, Joshua Thomas, a Target spokesman,
said the number of stores had grown to about 200. He said that total was
a mix of temporary closings at some stores and shortened hours at
others, though he did not supply a breakdown.

Mr. Thomas said the number was changing daily. On Sunday, the website
had changed, dropping the detailed list of closings and no longer
suggesting that all the stores listed were closings.

Target has nearly 1,900 stores in the United States. The decisions to
temporarily shutter or shorten store hours at roughly 200 locations, Mr.
Thomas said, were being made “out of an abundance of caution” to ensure
“the safety of our teams.”

Target will continue to pay workers for 14 days of their regular pay at
the affected stores, including a $2-an-hour Covid-19 premium. And
workers at the shuttered stores will be able to work at nearby Target
locations.

Six Target stores across the country have been closed because of damage.
Nearly all of them should be ready to reopen soon, needing modest
repairs, Mr. Thomas said. The exception is the Lake Street store in
Minneapolis, which Target hopes to reopen by the end of the year.

In [an open
letter](https://corporate.target.com/article/2020/05/supporting-communities-minnesota-beyond),
Brian Cornell, Target’s chief executive, said the company remained
committed to investing there and to “preserving jobs and economic
opportunity by rebuilding and bringing back the store that has served as
a community resource since 1976.”

Protests and violent unrest began last week in Minneapolis and spread to
other cities. Mr. Floyd died last Monday after a police officer pressed
his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes during an
arrest.

As unrest spread and some cities announced curfews, Amazon also made
some changes. The company adjusted driver routes on Saturday and scaled
back deliveries in a handful of cities. The company said some operations
were still being affected, and it was monitoring the situation closely.

In Seattle, where Amazon is based, protesters smashed the windows of the
cashierless Amazon Go Grocery store in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on
Friday night, though it has since reopened.
