In his [first Inaugural
Address](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-resurrects-dark-definition-of-america-first-vision.html),
and hopefully his last, [Donald
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-police-chokeholds.html)
talked about American carnage. He got it this week. What we couldn’t
have known in January 2017 is that he wasn’t here to save us from this
carnage, but to perpetuate it; that incitement wasn’t just a feature of
his campaign, but of his governance. When historians look back at the
Trump era, they may very well say his presidency was encapsulated by
this moment, when a sadistic cop knelt on the neck of an
African-American man for almost nine minutes in plain view and the
streets exploded in rage.

Derek Chauvin was by no means the first cop to gratuitously brutalize
and lynch an African-American. But he embodied something essential about
Trumpism: It’s us versus them. That’s the poison ethos at the heart of
[police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-police-chokeholds.html)
brutality, and it’s the septic core of our 45th president’s philosophy.
Neither a toxic cop nor Donald Trump sees himself as a servant of *all*
the people they’ve sworn to protect. They are solely servants of their
own. Everyone else is the enemy.

From the beginning, the police have received a lot of perverse messages
from Trump, encouraging them to embrace the bitter angels of their
nature. Three summers ago, he gave a speech on Long Island, disparaging
officers who cradled the heads of suspects as they tucked them into
their squad cars: “[You can take the hand
away,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/28/trump-tells-police-not-to-worry-about-injuring-suspects-during-arrests/)
OK?” (A bank of police officers, seated behind him, started to laugh and
cheer.)

One of Trump’s most revealing tweets since the rioting began was a boast
about the prowess of the Secret Service — and to threaten to sic “[the
most vicious dogs, and most ominous
weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/politics/trump-threatens-protesters-dogs-weapons.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes)”
on the crowds outside the White House if things intensified. He’s Bull
Connor with a comb-over. Or Walter E. Headley, Miami’s former police
chief, who in 1967 said, “[When the looting starts, the shooting
starts,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/looting-starts-shooting-starts.html)”
a phrase that reappeared in a Trump tweet on Friday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And this is the point, is it not? Trump, who made his political bones by
peddling apocrypha about our first African-American president’s country
of origin, thrives on racial divisions. Us-them. Conflict zones are his
comfort zone, perfect for firing up his base.

But the pressures of this historic moment proved to be too much. We
can’t see the African-Americans who are dying in disproportionate
numbers inside our hospitals, but [we can see George
Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61QNgIVj9mI&bpctr=1590953361), an
African-American, cruelly singled out for asphyxiation in the street.
His death in police custody is a potent symbol of the obscene inequality
and racial hostility of this moment, with the police officer as Trump’s
smirking and pitiless proxy. African-Americans — and many whites too —
were so enraged that they poured out into the streets to protest, even
in the midst of a pandemic, even though African-Americans are *most at
risk* in this pandemic.

A month from now, it’s quite likely many will end up in hospitals, once
again in disproportionate numbers. It’s too awful to contemplate.

And once again, there’s a leadership vacuum in response to the chaos,
just as there is with Covid-19. It’s every state for itself, with Trump
trolling the most liberal leaders for their supposed failures to contain
the unrest.

How these protests devolved into violence across the country will be the
subject of analysis for years to come. For now, what has riveted me is
that somehow, in spite of the dystopian horror unfolding in front of us,
in spite of execrable responses from some of the largest police forces
in the country ([including New York
City’s](https://twitter.com/samdolnick/status/1266893561481568263)),
we’re nonetheless hearing talk of America as a perfectible place — of
the arc still bending. It’s been more than three years since we’ve heard
that tune.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet there was Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, issuing a [wee-hours
statement](https://deadline.com/2020/05/george-floyd-protests-joe-biden-statement-violence-curfews-donald-trump-silent-1202947533/)
that asked Americans not to ignore their pain, but to use it “to compel
our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of
progress, inclusion, and opportunity.” There was [Killer
Mike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rapfJYfPU38), the rapper from
Atlanta, reminding his fellow citizens, “Atlanta’s not perfect, but
we’re a lot better than we ever were, and a lot better than cities
are.”

Conservatives will focus on the pleas for law and order in their
messages. But what I hear is a repudiation of Trumpian nihilism — a
rejection of the tyranny of the perpetual “anxious present” that Masha
Gessen describes in her forthcoming book “[Surviving
Autocracy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/28/how-fight-back-against-trumpism-with-moral-aspiration/).”
They’re instead speaking with what Gessen calls “moral ambition,”
inviting fellow citizens to build a more expansive country, rather than
an us-versus-them one. Their messages weren’t, “Don’t destroy your
community,” so much as, “There’s still a community left for you to join.
Come and make it better.”

And so, along with terrifying imagery of fire and fury, we also saw
images over the weekend of police officers and protesters in solidarity.
The bonds were sometimes fragile, only to later disappear. But they
happened. [In Flint,
Mich](https://twitter.com/Goodable/status/1266933266545881088). In
[Camden,
N.J.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-praised-joining-front-line-floyd-protests-70983707)
In [Coral Gables,
Fla](https://cbs12.com/news/local/police-take-a-knee-in-solidarity-prayer-with-protesters-in-coral-gables).
In [Santa Cruz,
Calif.](https://twitter.com/hknightsf/status/1266850494527365120) In
[Ferguson,
Mo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/05/31/in-some-cities-police-officers-joined-protesters-marching-against-brutality/#76c983145edb).
In Kansas City, Mo., where two cops, one white, held aloft a sign saying
“[End Police
Brutality](https://twitter.com/JasonKander/status/1266735093500051457/photo/1).”

Or listen to the chief of police in Atlanta, Erika Shields, tell an
anxious protester, “[I hear
you.](https://twitter.com/search?q=chief%20of%20police%20atlanta%20&src=typed_query)”
When Trump met with those who’d lost loved ones in the Parkland
shooting, he needed an empathy cheat sheet that contained those very
words; [it was item
No. 5](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/politics/trump-talking-points.html).
For her, they simply spilled out, as naturally as rain.
