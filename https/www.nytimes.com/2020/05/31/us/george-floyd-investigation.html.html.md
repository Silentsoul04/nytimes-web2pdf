On May 25, [Minneapolis
police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/umbrella-man-identified-minneapolis.html)
officers arrested [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/umbrella-man-identified-minneapolis.html),
a 46-year-old black man, after a convenience store employee called 911
and told the police that Mr. Floyd had bought cigarettes with a
counterfeit $20 bill. Seventeen minutes after the first squad car
arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three
police officers, showing no signs of life.

By combining videos from bystanders and security cameras, reviewing
official documents and consulting experts, The New York Times
reconstructed in detail the minutes leading to Mr. Floyd’s death. Our
video shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the
policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving
Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for
help.

The day after Mr. Floyd’s death, the Police Department fired all four of
the officers involved in the episode. On May 29, the Hennepin County
attorney, Mike Freeman, announced third-degree murder and second-degree
manslaughter charges against [Derek
Chauvin](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/derek-chauvin-tax-fraud.html),
the officer seen most clearly in [witness
videos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/politics/george-floyd-witness-maurice-lester-hall.html)
pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his
knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds,
according to a Times analysis of timestamped video. Our video
investigation shows that Mr. Chauvin did not remove his knee even after
Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after
paramedics arrived at the scene.

On June 3, Hennepin County prosecutors added a more serious
second-degree murder charge against Mr. Chauvin and also charged each of
the three other former officers — Thomas Lane, [J. Alexander
Kueng](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/us/minneapolis-police-officer-kueng.html)
and Tou Thao — with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On June 18, [the Hennepin County attorney’s office
said](https://m.startribune.com/7-minutes-46-seconds-county-says-error-in-timeline-of-floyd-s-killing-won-t-affect-charges/571322872/)
that its criminal complaint misstated the amount of time Mr. Chauvin
kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck. The complaint originally said that
Mr. Chauvin had done so for eight minutes and 46 seconds, a length of
time that [became a symbol and rallying cry for
protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/george-floyd-timing.html).
Responding to inquiries from journalists who noted a discrepancy with
the durations listed in the complaint, the office said the actual time
was seven minutes and 46 seconds. But The Times’s own analysis of the
video shows that [this revised time is also
incorrect](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/george-floyd-timing.html).

“It makes no difference,” said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families
of crime victims in Minneapolis. “The bottom line is, it was long enough
to kill him, long enough to execute him.”

Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.
