Many of us are entering a new stage of pandemic grief: adaptation. We
are asking ourselves: How do we live with this new reality?

For many Americans, part of the solution has been to buy an electric
bike. The battery-powered two-wheelers have become a compelling
alternative for [commuters who are being
discouraged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/health/cdc-coronavirus-offices.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
from taking public transportation and Ubers. For others, the bikes
provide much-needed fresh air after months of confinement.

So it’s no surprise that e-bikes are now as difficult to buy as a bottle
of hand sanitizer was a few weeks ago. In March, [sales of e-bikes
jumped 85
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/bike-shortage-coronavirus.html)
from a year earlier, according to the NPD Group, a research firm.
Amazon, Walmart and Specialized are sold out of most models. Even
smaller brands like Ride1Up and VanMoof have waiting lists.

That’s a remarkable shift. For many years, e-bikes carried the stigma of
being vehicles for lazy pedalers and seniors. The bikes draw power from
a battery and motor to make pedaling significantly easier. You can also
accelerate with the press of a button, transforming cycling from a
strenuous exercise into a joy ride.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I was convinced that e-bikes would completely change cities all over
the world in the next 10 years, but it seems like because of this
crisis, suddenly it’s all happening in the next three or four months,”
said Taco Carlier, the chief executive of VanMoof, which is based in
Amsterdam.

If you are contemplating an e-bike purchase, there are trade-offs to
consider. For one, the battery packs and motors add bulk. For another,
these ostentatious bikes may lure thieves.

To find out what you get for your money, I tested two different e-bikes
on the streets and steep hills of San Francisco over the last two weeks.
Both can be ordered online: [VanMoof’s $1,998
S3](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US), an internet-connected smart bike,
and [Ride1Up’s $1,495 700
Series](https://ride1up.com/product/700-series/), which is more like a
normal bicycle with a battery and motor.

After the tests, I’m totally sold. E-bikes, I concluded, are for people
who want to get around quickly with minimal effort — and that’s a large
portion of the population. Here’s what you need to know.

E-bikes come in many forms and with various features. They also range
widely in price: Some cost a few hundred dollars, while others cost tens
of thousands of dollars. In general, though, e-bikes fall into two
camps:

  - **E-bikes with pedal assistance.** These use a motor system and
    sensors to detect how fast or hard you are pedaling and determine
    how much power to provide. So if you are pedaling hard or slow up a
    hill, the motor will use more power to assist you. Well-known brands
    include [Trek](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/ebike_faq/),
    [Specialized](https://www.specialized.com/nz/en/stories/turbo-faq)
    and [Fuji](https://www.fujibikes.com/usa/bikes/electric/).

  - **E-bikes with a throttle.** These work like the twist throttle on
    motorcycles and mo-peds. To accelerate, you press a trigger or twist
    a handlebar. Many modern e-bikes with a throttle also have pedal
    assist. Brands include [Rad
    Power](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radwagon-electric-cargo-bike?variant=32100542283872#specs),
    [Luna Cycle](https://lunacycle.com/) and
    [Aventon](https://www.aventon.com/products/aventon-pace-500-complete-bike).

VanMoof’s S3, which was released in late April, is a pedal-assist
e-bike. Instead of a throttle, it has a Turbo Boost button on the right
handlebar, which immediately gives a jolt of power. It has a top speed
of about 20 miles per hour and can travel about 90 miles on a full
charge.

VanMoof e-bikes are known for their antitheft security. Kicking a button
on the rear brake activates an electronic lock, which makes the rear
wheel unmovable. Trying to pick up the locked bike triggers a loud
alarm. In addition, the bike includes a cellular connection to help you
find it if it’s stolen, using VanMoof’s smartphone app.

Ride1Up’s 700 series has both a throttle and pedal assistance. On the
left handlebar is a small screen with buttons to let you select the
pedal-assist level; on the right handle bar is a gear shifter. With a
larger, faster motor than the VanMoof, the Ride1Up has a top speed of 28
m.p.h. and can travel about 50 miles on a full
charge.

## Testing, testing.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For two weeks, I alternated between riding the VanMoof and the Ride1Up.
I found you get what you pay for: While $1,500 buys you a nice e-bike
that takes time to get used to, like the Ride1Up, an additional $500
secures you a VanMoof, a smarter bike that is extremely simple to use.

The VanMoof’s motor system made pedaling feel more natural and smooth,
like riding a normal bicycle but with a bit of oomph. The motor was also
very quiet, and at points I forgot I was riding an e-bike. In areas
where pedaling was more challenging, like hills, a press of the Turbo
Boost button provided an extra push.

The Ride1Up bike was less intuitive. The control panel on the handlebar
lets you choose from nine pedal-assist levels. Level 3 felt sufficient
for getting me around the streets, but Level 5 felt better for getting
up hills. Sometimes, when trying to pedal from a stop, I forgot to lower
the pedal assist from Level 5, which caused the bike to jerk forward.
That was a bit scary.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ride1Up offers a [YouTube tutorial on advanced
settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ifbdLegvw) for people to
adjust the power of each pedal-assist level. Eventually, I reduced the
power output for Levels 4 and 5, which made pedaling smoother.

As for the Ride1Up’s throttle, which is a trigger on the left handlebar,
it was nice to have the option to accelerate without pedaling when I was
getting exhausted. It did feel like cheating,
though.

## The downsides.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Testing the two e-bikes underlined some of their trade-offs.

  - **E-bikes are heavy.** The VanMoof weighs about 41 pounds and the
    Ride1Up about 55 pounds — more than double the average road bike,
    which weighs about 20 pounds. You probably won’t want an e-bike if
    you’d have to regularly carry it up many flights of stairs.

  - **Maintenance may be tricky.** VanMoof and Ride1Up said their bikes
    were designed to be user-serviceable, and any local bike mechanic
    should also be able to service minor parts, like brake pads.
    
    But with e-bikes in general, you may need to seek help from the
    maker if something major goes wrong with proprietary electronic
    components. It’s a safer bet to buy your e-bike from a local store
    that can service it.

  - **They may attract burglars.** Parking the VanMoof made me anxious.
    Whenever I was locking it up, it got lots of attention from
    passers-by — it looks like an elegantly designed tech product.
    
    A VanMoof spokesman said that up to 20 of its bikes are reported
    stolen each month worldwide, and that 70 percent are found within
    two weeks. So make sure to have renters or home insurance that
    covers the theft of e-bikes. (VanMoof offers its own three-year
    insurance for $340.)

  - **Batteries are expensive.** Like smartphones, e-bikes use
    consumable batteries that eventually need to be replaced. With
    regular riding, the batteries for the VanMoof and the Ride1Up may
    deplete in three to five years. Replacements cost roughly $350.

## But the pros outweigh the cons.

Despite some misgivings, my experience with e-bikes made me realize the
benefits are far greater than the downsides.

Most important, e-bikes kept me out of my car. Whenever I had a reason
to go outside — like making a trip to the grocery store or dropping off
baked goods at a friend’s — I preferred riding an e-bike.

This will become increasingly important in the coming months. As
businesses reopen, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
advised commuters to drive in cars
alone](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/health/cdc-coronavirus-offices.html).
An e-bike may become crucial for squeezing through nightmare traffic.

There’s another benefit, which is important in hard times: E-bikes bring
joy. I’m no fan of cycling in San Francisco, but on an e-bike, I saw
more of the outdoors than I normally would, while keeping a safe
distance from people. That beat bingeing on Netflix.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So I’ll probably buy an e-bike soon, even if it means getting on a
waiting list. I figure we could all use a little more joy.
