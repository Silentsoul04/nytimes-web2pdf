# Obama Voices Support for George Floyd Protesters and Calls for Police Reform

</div>

Mr. Obama, offering a starkly more upbeat assessment of peaceful
protesters and their motives than President Trump has, urged people to
“remember that this country was founded on protest — it is called the
American Revolution.”

WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama threw his support behind the
efforts of peaceful protesters demanding police reforms during his first
on-camera remarks since [a wave of protests over the killing of George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/live-george-floyd-protests-today.html)
convulsed the country and upended the 2020 election.

Mr. Obama, offering a strikingly more upbeat assessment of the
protesters than [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
and White House officials, said he believed only a “tiny” percentage had
acted violently.

“For those who have been talking about protest, just remember that this
country was founded on protest — it is called the American Revolution,”
Mr. Obama said from his home in Washington. He made the comments during
an online round-table event with his former attorney general Eric H.
Holder Jr. and activists from Minneapolis sponsored by My Brother’s
Keeper Alliance, a nonprofit group Mr. Obama founded.

“Every step of progress in this country, every expansion of freedom,
every expression of our deepest ideals have been won through efforts
that made the status quo uncomfortable,” said Mr.
Obama,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>who adopted a
conciliatory tone that contrasted sharply with Mr. Trump’s tweets and
public remarks. “And we should all be thankful for folks who are
willing, in a peaceful, disciplined way, to be out there making a
difference.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Obama called on every mayor in the United States to review
use-of-force policies and to aggressively pursue an eight-point slate of
police reforms that include mandatory de-escalation of conflicts, a ban
on shooting at moving vehicles, timely reporting of violent incidents,
and prohibitions on some forms of restraint used by the police.

“Chokeholds and strangleholds, that’s not what we do,” Mr. Obama said as
he sat, tieless in blue shirt sleeves, in front of a bookcase.

He said officials in New York City and Chicago had already agreed to
adopt the measures. Other localities, including Atlanta, quickly
followed suit.

Mr. Obama also said that the “vast majority” of police officers, in his
view, were not violent, and predicted many would ultimately support
reforms despite the opposition of some unions.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Reflecting on the larger meaning of the protests, Mr. Obama said the
unrest after Mr. Floyd’s death was “unlike anything I have seen in my
lifetime” and expressed hope that Americans would be “reawakened” to
unite around racial justice.

“In a lot of ways, what has happened in the last several weeks is that
challenges and structural problems here in the United States have been
thrown into high relief,” he said. “They are the outcome of not just an
immediate moment in time, but as the result of a long host of things —
slavery, Jim Crow, redlining and institutional racism.”

With the exception of his support for protesters, Mr. Obama confined his
remarks to the issues of policing and racial disparities in health care
during the coronavirus pandemic that have led to higher rates of
infection and death in nonwhite communities.

Mr. Obama, as he often does, tried to avoid a one-on-one battle with his
successor, a fight he thinks will energize the president’s conservative
base and overshadow his friend [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
the Democrats’ presumptive nominee.

Mr. Obama did not directly address Mr. Trump’s bellicose comments or the
president’s demand that the authorities “dominate” protesters, although
people close to the former president said he was outraged by [the use of
chemical spray on
protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
before Mr. Trump walked to a fire-damaged church near the White House
and brandished a Bible.

Instead, Mr. Obama expressed optimism that the reform effort could
transcend political divisions. He said that he was heartened by polls
showing broad support for their grievances, and that this made the
current situation more heartening than the protests in the late 1960s.

Mr. Obama’s remarks tracked closely with two essays he posted online
over the last week in which he implored young protesters to channel
their rage into political action by turning out for Mr. Biden in
November and to embrace local reforms to hold police officers
accountable for abuses of power.

“We should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a
Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that
actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our
society and want to do something about it,” [he wrote in a post on
Medium on
Monday](https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067).

In recent appearances, Mr. Obama has become more forceful in his
criticism of the White House, [hammering Mr. Trump’s actions without
invoking his successor’s
name](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politics/obama-flynn-coronavirus-trump.html).
Mr. Obama rebuked the current administration’s response to the
coronavirus pandemic as “chaotic” and questioned Mr. Trump’s commitment
to the “rule of law” in a call with former members of his White House
team last month.

For all his outward calm, Mr. Obama’s passions are running high, and the
former president is finding it harder to stay on script, friends said.
Over the last few days, he has been working the phones with close
associates, including Mr. Holder, and strategizing about the best way to
address the issues without inflaming the crisis.

On Tuesday, [a Minneapolis radio station
reported](https://www.kvrr.com/2020/06/02/twin-cities-law-enforcement-briefed-on-possible-obama-pence-visits-this-week/)
that Secret Service officials were making preliminary preparations for a
high-level visitor, perhaps Mr. Obama. But people close to the former
president said he had no intention of traveling there this week —
although they did not rule out Mr. Obama’s participation in related
events in the future.

Shortly before Mr. Obama spoke on Wednesday, former President Jimmy
Carter issued a statement calling for peaceful protest and systemic
change. “As a white male of the South, I know all too well the impact of
segregation and injustice to African-Americans,” the 95-year-old former
president
[wrote](https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2020/statement-060320.html).
“We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than
this.”

Those comments came a day after another former president also presented
an alternative vision of the protests to Mr. Trump. In a [lengthy
statement](https://www.bushcenter.org/about-the-center/newsroom/press-releases/2020/06/statement-by-president-george-w-bush.html),
former President George W. Bush expressed solidarity with the
demonstrators in the streets and, without naming the incumbent
president, warned against trying to suppress the protests.

“It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law
enforcement, march for a better future,” Mr. Bush said on Tuesday. “This
tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue
question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to
see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who
are hurting and grieving.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bush, the only living Republican former president — and one who
refused to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 — made no direct reference to the
current president. But Mr. Bush spoke after Mr. Trump’s photo op havoc,
and the former president’s comments read like a rebuke.

“Those who set out to silence those voices,” Mr. Bush said, “do not
understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place.”

Mr. Obama struck a similar tone Wednesday, saying the overall message of
the protests was simple, admirable and unifying:

“See me, I’m human,” he said.
