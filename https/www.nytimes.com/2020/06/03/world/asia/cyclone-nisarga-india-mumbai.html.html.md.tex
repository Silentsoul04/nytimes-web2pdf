Coronavirus}\label{powerful-cyclone-lashes-mumbai-as-city-grapples-with-coronavirus}}

The Indian city of 20 million had not been threatened by a storm as
strong as Cyclone Nisarga in 70 years.

NEW DELHI --- A powerful cyclone slammed into
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/world/asia/india-monsoon-lightning-rainstorms.html}{India}'s
coast Wednesday afternoon, striking the commercial hub of Mumbai,
lashing beach towns with heavy rain and strong winds, and pushing
thousands of people into emergency shelters.

Cyclone Nisarga
\href{https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-closes-in-215km-from-mumbai-imd/story-tv1tkoMNdTPFluAGXy39oM.html}{made
landfall with unusual force} in the state of Maharashtra, home to
Mumbai, a city of about 20 million. The region rarely experiences
cyclones, and the last storm to threaten Mumbai with such intensity was
more than 70 years ago.

Uprooted trees crashed into parked cars, and local television news
reports showed cargo ships struggling to navigate choppy waters. But as
the cyclone moved inland, passing over Mumbai in the afternoon, the
authorities said the city may have averted the worst. There have been no
immediate reports of casualties.

Efforts to blunt the cyclone's destruction were threatened by the
coronavirus outbreak. Mumbai, which sits on a narrow peninsula, is
struggling to contain a rising number of infections, and more than 100
Covid-19 patients had been evacuated from a makeshift hospital to higher
ground.

The city is densely populated and low-lying, making it particularly
vulnerable, and a lockdown to contain the virus is still in effect. The
cyclone is ``more tragic news,'' said Anil Parab, a minister with
Maharashtra's governing Shiv Sena party.

South Asia has considerable experience preparing for cyclones, which are
referred to as hurricanes in the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific.
Last month, about three million people were evacuated when another
storm, Cyclone Amphan,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/world/asia/cyclone-amphan-india-bangladesh.html}{struck
eastern India and Bangladesh}, killing more than 80 people.

As Cyclone Nisarga moved closer to India Wednesday morning, **** Uddhav
Thackeray, the chief minister of Maharashtra, ordered Mumbai's residents
to stay home for two days and the city's airport was closed. Officials
said they
\href{https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-65-000-people-living-close-to-coast-of-maharashtra-evacuated/story-tJ4iXT8Fi8MJ5gxmExTioO.html}{had
evacuated up to 65,000 people} from several coastal districts in the
state.

In the neighboring state of Gujarat, which was also in the storm's path,
the authorities said they had evacuated tens of thousands of people from
coastal areas and provided them with shelter.

The storm, powered by unusually warm water in the Arabian Sea, made
landfall around 1 p.m. near the town of Alibag, about 30 miles south of
Mumbai, with top wind speeds as high as 75 miles an hour.

In recent years, India has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/world/asia/india-cyclone.html}{significantly
improved its disaster response capabilities}, drafting meticulous
evacuation plans and building thousands of emergency shelters.

But many storm facilities have recently been converted into Covid-19
quarantine centers, stretching state resources thin, particularly in
Maharashtra and Gujarat, the Indian states hit hardest by the
coronavirus.

When Sunil Deshpande, a fisherman in the Raigad district of Maharashtra,
arrived at a shelter on Tuesday, government officials told people to
maintain social distancing, but the building was so crowded that doing
so was ``nearly impossible,'' he said.

``When we left home it was already raining,'' he said. ``The sea looked
rough and angry.''
