# Macron Beat Back the Coronavirus. France Is Not Impressed.

</div>

President Emmanuel Macron has gotten little credit for his country’s
relative success in battling the contagion. Instead, he remains
unpopular and subject to the usual dose of resentments.

PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron’s government has beaten back the
coronavirus, prevented mass layoffs, propped up the salaries of the
unemployed, staved off long food lines, and achieved a lower death rate
than its neighbors, Germany excepted.

Mr. Macron ordered a strict lockdown that lasted nearly two months, and
when it was over the virus was barely circulating. But while the early
response could be faulted for some sluggishness and a shortage of masks,
and more than 29,000 people died, France has fared better than many in
the pandemic, especially when compared with the United States, Italy,
Spain and especially Britain.

Just don’t tell that to the French, who resent Mr. Macron for it more
than ever.

The French expect much of their leaders, and almost always find them
wanting. [Mr. Macron is no
exception.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/europe/macron-france-pensions.html?searchResultPosition=13)
In fact, the better the results, the less willing, it seems, the French
are to applaud their president. That pattern has held virtually since
Mr. Macron took office in 2017, casting a shadow over a term expiring in
two years.

Mr. Macron reduced unemployment and created more jobs, but the French
resented him for<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>loosening
labor protections. He evened out the country’s helter-skelter pension
system, and there were [months of
strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/world/europe/france-strike-macron.html?searchResultPosition=33)
by aggrieved unions and citizens distrustful of his intentions.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even as the French celebrated their provisional release from lockdown
this week with the much-anticipated partial [reopening of cafes and
restaurants](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/world/europe/coronavirus-paris-cafe-reopen-france.html),
the coronavirus has only reinforced the paradox of the president’s
uneasy relationship with his own citizens.

“Deconfinement is going pretty well,” said Olivier Galland, a
sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research. “But the
French don’t seem satisfied. But I don’t think they can ever be
satisfied.”

On Friday the head of the government’s scientific council, the
immunologist Jean-François Delfraissy, declared the epidemic “under
control” in France, in an interview on French radio. Still, the French,
far more than their European neighbors, have judged the government’s
performance in response to the health crisis harshly.

“Distrust is a structural element of French society, stable and
well-established,” Mr. Galland wrote in a recent paper on “The Great
Depression of the French” for Telos*,* a widely followed political
science website.

On average, over half of Europe’s citizens, outside of France, view
their government’s performance in response to the virus favorably, even
in countries with far worse records. In France, 66 percent have an
unfavorable view, according to a recent Figaro poll.

Mr. Macron stiffened and looked impatient when he was asked recently on
French television about his unpopularity.

“Look, I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself,” he said. “I’m
looking ahead.’’

“For decades this country has known doubt and division,’’ Mr. Macron
added. ‘‘I don’t believe in miracles. This distrustful France exists. It
hasn’t changed.”

Whatever credit France’s government gets from its success in dealing
with the virus has gone instead to Mr. Macron’s understated prime
minister, Édouard Philippe.

“The news is pretty good,” Mr. Philippe said simply last week, after
looking at the post-lockdown results. Over 60 percent found him
convincing in a poll by the independent Odoxa polling firm for Le Figaro
and France-Info.

In a sign of his political ascendancy, Mr. Philippe was on the cover of
this week’s L’Obs*,* a popular weekly newsmagazine, with the headline,
“The Tough Guy.”

“Can Macron do without Édouard Philippe?” the magazine asked, alighting
on speculation that Mr. Macron would jettison a prime minister who has
stolen the spotlight once the crisis ended.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet the government’s measures — a tightly enforced lockdown,
mobilization of French technology like high-speed trains to save
patients, and closely followed counsel from scientists — were Mr.
Macron’s. That is the French way: the president decides, and the
nation follows.

But that means Mr. Macron takes the blame, too, for the early shortage
of masks, which the government did not initially admit to and a
spokeswoman minimized. The affair riled the French media for several
weeks, but has since largely dropped from view. On the streets some wear
masks but many do not.

“What’s most problematic is that we’re actually being lied to,” said
Marie Balaril, 27, a social-sciences instructor at a Paris university,
as she recalled the government’s refusal to acknowledge that the country
had faced a mask shortage.

The president has vigorously defended his record. “Let’s be honest,’’
Mr. Macron said in the recent television interview. ‘‘At the beginning
of March nobody was talking about masks.”

“When I look around, nobody was ready,’’ he said. ‘‘Nobody. Nobody.’’

The per capita death rate in France is higher than the United States,
with more than 100,000 deaths. But France has a population density — a
key variable in the epidemic — more than three times greater. France’s
[hospitalization and death curves have been in sharp
decline](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/world/europe/virus-paris-reopening.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
since about the second week of April.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,

        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

‘‘Now, they seem logical. But at the time they were anything but
neutral,” Mr. Chiche said, pointing to the moves to prop up salaries,
ban religious ceremonies, and impose the lockdown. “I think they made
choices that were optimal.”

Still, he joined 13 other members of parliament who deserted the French
president’s party in May, depriving it of its majority — a symbolic blow
widely interpreted in the French media as an ominous sign for Mr.
Macron’s future.

Mr. Chiche, an ex-Socialist, has been one of the president’s critics on
the left, a group judging him too favorable to business and urging him
to “define a new horizon,” as Mr. Chiche put it.

Frederic Keck, an anthropologist and biosecurity expert, also at the
National Center for Scientific Research, called Mr. Macron’s handling of
the pandemic ‘‘pretty good.’’

“Very centralized management around the president. Very French, but also
relatively efficient,” he said.

“This dissatisfaction is the reflection of an excessive demand for
security,’’ Mr. Keck added. But he, too, noted that Mr. Macron was not
getting much credit.

Over half the French approve of the government’s reopening plan. But
they don’t approve of Mr. Macron: Just 30 to 40 percent judged him up to
dealing with the epidemic. In another Figaro poll, 62 percent of
respondents found Mr. Macron’s manner ‘‘arrogant’’ and
‘‘authoritarian.’’

In some ways Mr. Macron is his own worst enemy, with a style that can
come off as imperious. His speeches during the crisis were lengthy and
literary, both trademarks. He first reproached the French for lacking “a
sense of responsibilities,” then later praised them for their
discipline.

“He likes these lyrical effusions, and people just aren’t keen on that,”
Mr. Galland said.

In the recent television appearance, Mr. Macron was shown meeting a
group of unhappy top chefs by videoconference from the Élysée Palace.

The chefs — some of the most famous names in French cuisine, including
Alain Ducasse — didn’t conceal their frustration at being forced to stay
closed during the lockdown.

“We’re not optimistic about the survival of about half of our
restaurants,” Mr. Ducasse said.

Mr. Macron was not impressed. He smiled slightly at the grumbling, then
administered a lesson to the complaining chefs.

“Look, I like liberty as much as you,’’ Mr. Macron said. ‘‘But what
you’ve got to remember is that it’s good to exercise this liberty in a
country like France. It’s good to live in a country where the state is
strong.”

He added, pointedly, “There are other countries where the state is
letting people fail.”
