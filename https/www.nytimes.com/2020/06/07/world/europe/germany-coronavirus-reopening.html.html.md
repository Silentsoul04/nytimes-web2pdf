# Giving Your Number to Strangers? It’s Not Flirting; It’s a Rule

As Berlin emerges from its lockdown, residents are getting used to
social distancing in bars and swimming pools — and to handing out their
phone number several times a day to help in contact tracing.

BERLIN — I’ve given my phone number to a lot of strangers over the past
week.

I scribbled it down for the charming barista who made my latte the other
morning. I handed it to the waiter who took my first restaurant booking
in more than two months. I gave it to a hairdresser, to an ice cream
vendor, even to the guy behind plexiglass at the open-air swimming pool
that just reopened.

“That mask looks great on you,” he said and winked at me over his own
mask in one of those I-can’t-believe-I’m-having-this-conversation
moments we have every day now.

I swear I wasn’t flirting. I was just trying to have a swim.

Berlin has been emerging from its coronavirus lockdown in full force,
and the cost of freedom, the price of having a snippet of our pre-corona
lives — date night with your husband, a hair cut (a hair cut\!) — is
handing over contact details.

Call them corona logs: A registry of who was where when and for how long
has become mandatory so the detectives of the German health authority
can trace the contacts of a newly infected person.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is one way in which
[Germany](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-reopening.html)’s
new normal looks anything but normal. In a country where privacy is
something of a national religion, Germans now casually hand over their
private address at every turn of daily life.

At the [Refinery](http://refinerycoffee.de/en/), a trendy coffee shop
near the river Spree in central Berlin, Sabine Baum, a graphic designer,
was adding her details to the dog-eared handwritten list on the counter
as she waited for her porridge one recent morning.

“Somehow it feels OK because it’s just on paper and not online,” she
said.

The longing for normality is a powerful incentive to put up with things
that in early March — a lifetime ago — would have seemed either
unacceptable or totally absurd to many Germans. Like wearing something
in a sauna (face masks might become mandatory when saunas reopen next
month).

But then streets and parks were never that busy to start with. Less
densely populated than Manhattan, London and many Asian cities, Berlin
is a mellow metropolis. Long before the virus hit, social distancing was
the norm at prominent sights like the Brandenburg Gate (even if we
didn’t call it that).

There are moments when Germany feels — almost — normal again. Children
walking to school in the mornings. Restaurants buzzing at night. A
wedding in a public park. There is even a hint of rush hour as more
people trade their home office for their real one.

But one swimming pool now has a traffic light outside its shower area to
regulate the number of people inside. Vending machines that used to sell
candy and condoms now sell disinfectant and masks. A theater has removed
500 of its 700 seats to allow for distancing during performances.

There are the drive-in church services and drive-in coronavirus test
centers. There are the masks — and the people waving doctor’s notes
exempting them from wearing
masks.

In the Tiergarten, Berlin’s equivalent of Central Park, the beer garden
has reopened. Walking one recent afternoon toward the cluster of trestle
tables on the banks of the Neuer See, a small boating lake, the scene
ahead of me was so normal it was surreal. It was busy\! Children were
taking turns on the wooden swing. A couple of row boats drifted lazily
across the lake.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was only when I got closer that I saw the plexiglass dividers on the
tables.

“Knock knock\!” said the older woman sitting on the other end of our
table as she waved to my 4-year-old son through the plastic.

The man at the boat stand was disinfecting a pile of life vests. We,
too, rented a boat that afternoon (after writing down our names, address
and phone numbers on another dog-eared paper list).

“Can I touch the oar?” my 8-year-old daughter asked uncertainly. She had
noticed the couple getting into the rowing boat next to us wearing
rubber gloves.

Her question echoed something I heard on the soccer field, when my older
daughter’s team resumed practicing last month.

“The kids ask me: ‘Can I touch the ball? Can I pass the ball?’” said
Emilia Rahaus, a 19-year-old coach.

Coronavirus soccer, at least in the amateur sphere, looks nothing like
real soccer. There are no games. The children — seven on each half of
the field — train individually with their own balls at clearly marked
locations two meters apart. The goals are disinfected after use.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s so familiar and yet so different,” Ms. Rahaus said. Behind her, on
the far end of the field, a banner in the blue-white color of West
Berlin’s traditional soccer club fluttered in the afternoon breeze:
“Youth is our
future.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

My son is allowed only half days in nursery. One daughter goes to school
two days a week, the other 90 minutes a day.

“Home schooling was a breeze compared to this,” one fellow mother
sighed.

She recently called in sick at work because the logistics of multiple
children with wildly different schedules was just too much. Her husband
earns more, so he can’t afford to miss his Zoom meetings, which leaves
the burden of child-care squarely on her.

“So much for school openings helping parents get back to work,” she
said.

And something else has crept into conversations: Is it all necessary?

Germany has been so successful at containing the pandemic that few
people here know anyone who got infected.

“Trust me, it’s just the flu,” a taxi driver told me recently. His mask
was casually suspended from the rearview mirror.

Even our pediatrician called all the precautions “quite exaggerated.”

Every Saturday, [an eclectic mix of coronavirus
protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-far-right.html)
take to the streets to air their frustrations with restrictions. The
sight of them — masked and standing six feet apart — was telling of yet
another new normal: “When we used to protest we weren’t allowed to cover
our faces,” my mother chuckled. “Nowadays you *have* to cover your
face.”

If social distancing during a protest is tricky, try social distancing
in the pool. Outside the entrance of my local pool, there was a graphic
of what it looks like in theory: four swimmers in a five-square-meter
area of water.

In practice, it looked a little
different.

That weird dance we all do on the sidewalk to avoid getting too close to
someone? Picture that in a swimming lane.

“Watch your distance\!” a man shouted, when I overtook him.

I told my husband about it later. A Brit who has been reprimanded more
than once for crossing an empty road against a red light, he is
convinced most Germans love all the new rules they can now enforce on
other citizens.

We were having a date. Our first in corona times.

Before the pandemic, date night had been a fixture of our lives, a
longstanding tradition that had carried us through the disruptions of
three babies and two intense jobs. Every Friday, an evening of
uninterrupted conversation. Call it marital maintenance.

So when our [favorite local restaurant](http://jungbluth-restaurant.de/)
reopened after two months of lockdown, it was a Big Deal, up there with
a visit to the hair dresser.

I dressed up in my new face mask, a snazzy number with a flower pattern
I had bought specially for the occasion (and that had so impressed the
guy at the pool).

It all went well until I went down the one-way system to the bathroom
the wrong way and got told off by another patron.

“See?” my husband said.
