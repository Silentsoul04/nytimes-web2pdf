# In the W.H.O.’s Coronavirus Stumbles, Some Scientists See a Pattern

The agency’s advice sometimes lags behind rapidly evolving research into

Even as the World Health Organization leads the worldwide response to
the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/podcasts/the-daily/asymptomatic-coronavirus-spread.html)
pandemic, the agency is failing to take stock of rapidly evolving
research findings and to communicate clearly about them, several
scientists warned on Tuesday.

In a news briefing on Monday, a W.H.O. official asserted that
transmission of the coronavirus by people without symptoms is “very
rare.” Following concerted pushback from researchers, officials on
Tuesday walked back the claim, saying it was a “misunderstanding.”

But it is not the first time the W.H.O.’s assessment has seemed to lag
behind scientific opinion.

The agency [delayed endorsing masks for the general public until
Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/health/coronavirus-masks-who.html),
claiming there was too little evidence that they prevented transmission
of the virus. Virtually all scientists and governments have been
recommending masks for months.

The W.H.O. has said repeatedly that small airborne droplets, or
aerosols, are not a significant factor in the pandemic’s spread,
although a growing body of evidence suggests that they may be.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The W.H.O. has been out of step with most of the world on the issue of
droplets and aerosols,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease
expert at the University of Minnesota.

These scientific disagreements have wide policy implications. Many
countries, including the United States, adopted lockdown strategies
because they recognized that isolating only people who were sick might
not be enough to contain the epidemic.

If the virus is transmitted by small airborne droplets, people will need
to continue to avoid congregating in poorly ventilated spaces, even if
they practice rigorous hand hygiene.

The W.H.O. traditionally has taken a cautious approach to evaluating
scientific evidence. But the pace of research has changed: Now
scientists are rushing to publish preliminary research, even before
their results can be thoroughly vetted by other experts.

The avalanche of findings may bring advances — like a vaccine — in
record time. But the onslaught also has led to confusion, even
[retractions of high-profile
results](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“On the one hand, I do want to cut the W.H.O. some slack, because it is
hard to do this in an evolving pandemic,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director
of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “At the same time, we do rely on
the W.H.O. to give us the best scientific data and
evidence.”

The W.H.O.’s thinking on asymptomatic transmission does not appear to
have changed much since February, when the W.H.O. China Joint Mission
[reported](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)
that “the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear, but
appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver
of transmission.”

Studies later estimated this number could be [as high as 40
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html);
the current best estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is 35 percent. The research prompted many countries,
including the United States, to endorse use of masks by everyone.

But on Monday, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the W.H.O.’s technical lead for
coronavirus response, said that “it still seems to be rare that an
[asymptomatic person actually
transmits](https://twitter.com/mvankerkhove/status/1270081494552281094)
onward to a secondary individual.”

Her statement provoked an immediate backlash from scientists, who noted
that study after study had shown transmission of the virus from people
before they ever felt
symptoms.

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: A Missed Warning About Silent Coronavirus Infections

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Asthaa Chaturvedi and Alexandra Leigh Young, with help from Rachelle Bonja; and edited by Lisa Tobin

#### Why an early scientific report of symptom-free cases went unheeded.

</div>

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: Long before the world understood that seemingly healthy
    people could spread the coronavirus, a doctor in Germany tried to
    sound the alarm. Matt Apuzzo on why that warning was so unwelcome.
    
    It’s Thursday, July 9.

  - michael barbaro  
    Good. OK, so we’re going to get started.

  - camilla rothe  
    Very good, OK.

  - michael barbaro  
    So you’re recording, right?

  - camilla rothe  
    Yep.

  - michael barbaro  
    You are recording, and I’m recording. So I think we can —

michael barbaro

Matt, tell me about this doctor in Germany, Dr. Camilla Rothe.

matt apuzzo

Yeah, she is a tropical medicine specialist, basically an infectious
disease specialist. She’s at the Munich University Hospital. She’s at
the infectious disease clinic there. And she’s part of this network of
doctors around the world that serve as kind of like an early detection
system.

  - camilla rothe  
    We mainly work with returned travelers, as well as with migrants
    from tropical destinations and who may import even novel pathogens.

matt apuzzo

They kind of report back to major health organizations, like, hey, I’m
seeing a weird virus over here, or Ebola case pops up over here, or
here’s a weird thing.

  - camilla rothe  
    In Germany, we are responsible for anything exotic.

michael barbaro

And so what prompted you to begin talking to her?

matt apuzzo

So January 27, this patient in Munich — 33-year-old employee from an
auto parts company — walks into her clinic. And right away it’s pretty
clear something weird is going on.

  - camilla rothe  
    He informed us that when he came to work in the morning, he’d been
    told by his boss that a business partner who’d visited the company
    the week before, coming from China, had just phoned. And she’d said
    that on the weekend back home in China, she’d been diagnosed with
    the novel coronavirus infection. And he’d actually been ill over the
    weekend himself. And he’d asked us whether he could be checked for
    this new virus at our institution.

  - michael barbaro  
    And this was January 27, so had the coronavirus been detected in
    Germany?

  - camilla rothe  
    No, not yet.

  - michael barbaro  
    So what were you thinking when this man came into your office?

  - camilla rothe  
    Well, it was January. It was a time of year when there are lots of
    respiratory infections circulating. In fact, it’s the peak of the
    influenza season. And he’d been very unspectacularly ill over the
    weekend, so it could have been anything. In contrast, the pictures
    that we received from China by then were pictures of a very serious
    disease — people being on ventilators, et cetera. So I thought,
    well, I mean, interesting story, but this could be anything. And we
    took a swab from his nasal pharynx and sent it to the lab. And a few
    hours later, I was phoned by the lab and informed that, in fact, the
    test tested positive for the novel virus.

  - michael barbaro  
    Huh. So at this point, you have just been told that you have the
    first confirmed case of the coronavirus in Germany. And based on
    what you knew about the contact that had brought him to you in the
    first place, what were you thinking about that?

  - camilla rothe  
    That was quite a puzzle, because I’d obviously grilled him on the
    fact whether the Chinese business colleague appeared in any way ill.
    Had she coughed, or did she have a runny nose, or did she look ill
    in any way? And actually, he said she had held quite intense
    business workshops and meetings without showing any obvious signs of
    illness. And then on day two, which was the Tuesday, more employees
    of the company came to our clinic. And another three, all of them
    with very minor mild symptoms, were tested positive. That was the
    point when I thought, we need to spread the news to get this out to
    the world. And we contacted The New England Journal of Medicine, and
    they were interested. And it was very rapidly accepted and put
    online for people to read it.

michael barbaro

Matt, this paper that Dr. Rothe publishes, what does it find?

matt apuzzo

On the surface, it’s a really simple straightforward paper. It just
says, we had this weird case with this guy who tested positive for the
coronavirus, and the person he caught it from didn’t appear to have any
symptoms. And that’s kind of weird because that’s not what we think is
supposed to happen with this disease. So we thought it was important to
just put it out there, and this could have serious ramifications. Just
telling the world. In a nutshell, that’s all it really says.

michael barbaro

Well, help me understand that. For people who don’t work in the world of
infectious diseases, what is the significance of this man’s diagnosis?

matt apuzzo

It’s funny. You look back now at the end of January, and it’s sort of
like you’re looking at another time, another world. We’re still trying
to find out what this disease is. And so the assumption kind of was,
well, this is probably going to behave like SARS, because their genetic
cousins. So good chance it’s going to spread like that. And the thing
about SARS is, you don’t spread it until you are sick. Until you have
symptoms, you are not really contagious.

  - camilla rothe  
    So if a disease behaves like that, it is much more easy to control.
    It’s easy to define what a case is, who is a suspect case, someone
    who has symptoms. And if you ask these people to stay at home, you
    have already a good means to contain the virus. Now, if you have a
    virus that behaves differently, like what we had observed, which
    spreads before it even causes symptoms, this is much more difficult
    to control because people would never go for a test. They are not
    aware they are infected. They are mixing with people in the same way
    that they normally do — with colleagues, with friends, with loved
    ones. So it’s far more difficult to contain an infection like that.

  - michael barbaro  
    So this just flew in the face of the common understanding of the
    virus at that point.

  - camilla rothe  
    Absolutely. And then something strange happened that I personally
    don’t fully understand until today.

matt apuzzo

What Dr. Rothe didn’t know was that around 20 minutes away, in this sort
of suburb of Munich, in the regional health office, they were starting
up a command center basically to do all the tracking and the tracing and
all of the stuff that needed to be done. And the doctors there were
working on their own paper that they were going to get published in a
different journal. And so now you’ve got two separate groups of
scientists writing on the same case for different journals.

michael barbaro

And what did this group 20 minutes away, what did they find in their
paper?

matt apuzzo

It’s really, really similar. So whereas Dr. Rothe says, this woman is
not symptomatic — and she says that because this woman is leading two
days of business meetings and she’s not sneezing, she’s not coughing.
She’s not showing any signs of being fatigued or feverish or in any way
sick. The government doctors, after extensive interviews, they come back
and say, yeah, but we don’t think the Chinese patient had no symptoms.
We think she was probably experiencing some symptoms that were so mild
that even she didn’t recognize them. And so this dispute became, does
she have no symptoms, or does she have such mild symptoms that even she
doesn’t recognize that she’s sick?

michael barbaro

OK, so Dr. Rothe has published a paper saying that the patient had no
symptoms. This government agency has now published a paper saying that
she had early, essentially undetectable symptoms. So what’s the
significance of that distinction?

matt apuzzo

So this has been the story of my life for the past however many months.
The amount of time I’ve spent in conversations about the word
“asymptomatic” or “pre-symptomatic” or “oligosymptomatic” or any of
these words, right? What does it mean? If you are somebody who studies
diseases, and you are somebody who really wants to understand the
characteristics of this new virus, well, then obviously you want to know
what exactly needs to happen before you can become contagious. Can you
be just a passive carrier? Can you just walk around spreading this thing
and you’ll never get sick? Is that a real thing that happens? Or does it
only spread after you get symptoms? Or does it only spread when you have
mild symptoms? That is a real distinction in the scientific world.

michael barbaro

Right.

matt apuzzo

However, from a practical standpoint of what you’re going to tell the
public and how you’re going to control this disease, if you wake up in
the morning and you’re like, aw man, my neck is kind of stiff, I
probably just slept wrong. And then you go into work and you infect
people, what does it matter whether you are pre-symptomatic, whether
that neck ache was actually an early sign that you were getting sick and
you just didn’t recognize it? If your strategy is, if you are sick, stay
home, that all falls apart if you can spread this disease before you
even know you’re sick.

michael barbaro

In other words, any version of not feeling sick is a huge danger when it
comes to this virus.

matt apuzzo

Absolutely. Because it means, I don’t recognize that I’m a danger to
you. And you don’t recognize that you’re a danger to me. And I don’t
recognize that you’re a danger to me. And we all walk around and we
don’t know that we can make each other sick.

  - camilla rothe  
    Whether this person is ever going to be symptomatic or not doesn’t
    really matter. What the key message is, you can infect other people
    without knowing that you’re infected. I think the somehow sad thing
    is that this semantic debate — which is OK between scientists and so
    on, but it’s slightly splitting hairs — this debate somehow obscured
    the message we wanted to send out. And was somehow misleading,
    because it’s led us away from the core message to say, guys, keep
    your eyes open. This virus may spread without people knowing.

matt apuzzo

So this all would have been a kind of academic discussion between two
groups of doctors in Germany. But at the beginning of February, a couple
of days after Dr. Rothe’s paper came out, this thing completely
escalated.

\[music\]

And what happened was, Science Magazine, a very respected journal, wrote
a story in which the German national health official said, Dr. Rothe’s
paper is flawed. She never interviewed the woman. We don’t think she was
asymptomatic. We do think she had symptoms. And now suddenly, this issue
that might have otherwise been a very academic debate is now front and
center in the national discussion over what exactly are the
characteristics of this new virus.

  - camilla rothe  
    We were accused of, how can you claim someone is asymptomatic when
    you haven’t talked to him? So if you like, this is formally a
    correct accusation, so the correct title could have been
    pre-symptomatic because the patient then developed symptoms at some
    point. But that was a slightly misguiding debate we were somehow
    sucked into then.

michael barbaro

And Matt, as best you can tell, is there validity to this critique from
the government scientists of Dr. Rothe’s paper and her findings?

matt apuzzo

Yeah, I mean, I think there’s definitely a fair critique that she should
have interviewed the Chinese patient before asserting that she had no
symptoms.

  - camilla rothe  
    Which, by the way, wouldn’t have been our role because we are
    physicians. It’s none of our business if anyone should have spoken
    to her, then the public health authorities of Bavaria. And they did.
    And they kind of summarized their phone call to say, she didn’t have
    any symptoms while she was in Munich. All she had was what she
    already knew as a feeling of jet lag and, well, the way you feel
    after a long distance flight. And she herself had not noticed
    anything abnormal to the situation until the Thursday when she’d
    returned to Shanghai and she fell ill, when she had chills and fever
    and cough and all that.

matt apuzzo

So as if this debate couldn’t get any bigger, it’s now going to go
totally global because the world’s leading health organization, the
W.H.O., is about to weigh in.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

matt apuzzo

So the morning of February 4, Dr. Sylvie Briand from the World Health
Organization tweets the science article, and she says, “It is important
to differentiate asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic transition. 2019-nCoV
study claiming new coronavirus can be transmitted by people without
symptoms was flawed.” And so now everybody who’s on the frontlines of
this discussion is now basically saying Dr. Rothe got it wrong.

  - camilla rothe  
    And that, of course, was disappointing in a way to see that even the
    highest-ranking somehow health authority didn’t get a very simple
    clinical message, but also got lost in semantics.

michael barbaro

Matt, why did the W.H.O. take the step of publicly disputing and
criticizing Dr. Rothe’s finding?

matt apuzzo

I think there’s a couple ways to look at it. And one is that if you are
the World Health Organization, and you jump in with two feet into this
idea that this disease can spread without symptoms, it is a seismic
change in the way we think about Covid-19, and has massive ramifications
for public health policy in every country in the world. So of course,
they need to be cautious. They can’t just go, oh my god, here’s an
observation by one doctor with one patient, and we’re going to change
the world’s policies based on that. That’s unrealistic. But what’s
really confusing about all this is it didn’t take very long until it
wasn’t just Dr. Rothe in Munich. Because the Bavarian health authorities
get genetic information back, and they find genetic proof that it did
spread before symptom onset in two other patients. And so now it’s not
just Dr. Rothe saying, hey, I saw something weird. Now we have mounting
evidence from this cluster saying, it’s pretty darn clear this is
happening. And so now you really do wonder, why was the response from
the World Health Organization, we don’t think this is a big deal? And
not, boy, the evidence is growing, we’re not there yet, but we’re taking
this really seriously. And we should maybe be start thinking about how
we would adapt our policies if this really catches on.

  - camilla rothe  
    I would have expected a very neutral and curious way and an open
    way, and to at least take into consideration that this virus might
    behave different than the other SARS virus that we knew. And that
    somehow didn’t happen. I don’t understand why it wasn’t. I still
    don’t understand. Maybe one day someone will be able to explain to
    me. I don’t know.

matt apuzzo

I talked to a lot of doctors about this. And there are many who say that
you have to look at this from kind of a stark public policy standpoint.
This is early to mid February. If you tell the world that this thing can
spread before people are symptomatic, before they even know they’re
sick, then the next question is, OK, so what do we do about it? We don’t
have enough testing. We don’t have a contact tracing capability to
handle this, and we don’t have P.P.E. for everybody. What do we do?
We’ve talked to public health officials in other countries who said,
yeah, looking back, we probably could have said, this is looking more
and more like a possibility. But that’s a scary place to be if you don’t
have an answer for what you’re supposed to do next, and that’s kind of
where we found ourselves.

michael barbaro

I mean, I just want to wrap my head around this. Because what you seem
to be saying is that there’s a possibility that embracing this finding
is just too frightening for the people of the W.H.O., because of what it
would mean for policymakers in every country of the world. But isn’t
that the job of the World Health Organization to sometimes scare the
crap out of people, even if there’s no logical solution to the scare,
because they need to know?

matt apuzzo

So the W.H.O. says they definitely did not do that. That is not what
happened. But this issue of should the World Health Organization or
other public health officials be scaring the crap out of people, I mean,
I get that. But I think most people would tell you no. Because there’s a
huge danger in telling people, this is the big one, this is it. Because
the vast majority of alerts aren’t the big one. You need people to take
their advice seriously and rationally and not feel like, oh, here comes
another alert. And so it’s like they got to constantly straddle this
line between, I need you to hear me and take this seriously, but I can’t
also get crazy and say, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, this is the
one, tbjs is the one. Because if it’s not the one — and most aren’t —
then the next time, you’re just not going to listen.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Matt, what is the implication on the ground of organizations like the
W.H.O. resisting this idea that there is symptomless spread? What does
that actually mean throughout the world?

matt apuzzo

Well, I mean, so I’m in Belgium. And here’s a practical example. Belgium
locked down nursing homes and said, you can’t visit if you’re sick. And
thousands of people in nursing homes died. And they think that
symptomless visitors and symptomless care workers brought the disease
in, and they just had no idea that was even a possibility. We had the
Diamond Princess cruise off the coast of Japan, where one of the reasons
that people were allowed to mix and mingle and go to the buffet, even
after a former passenger tested positive, was because, well, we don’t
think he was symptomatic when he was on board. And then February 29, we
get a tweet from the U.S. surgeon general, all caps: “Seriously, people,
stop buying masks. They are not effective in preventing the general
public from catching coronavirus.” And it’s hard to imagine the surgeon
general weighing in like that if there was kind of a growing acceptance
in the medical community that, boy, this might actually be spreading
before symptoms.

michael barbaro

And of course, now we know that symptomless spread can be curbed, and a
primary way to curb it is masks.

matt apuzzo

Yeah, and now good luck messaging that when you’ve been telling the
public, in all caps, masks don’t help. As you look at these moments, it
just cost us time. And that’s kind of the story of Covid right now. We
lost time.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

So, Matt, where does this debate stand at the moment? I mean, is there a
settled understanding of whether or not, and how frequently, someone
without symptoms can spread the coronavirus?

matt apuzzo

I think the best science now is people without symptoms are contributing
to the spread of this pandemic. It’s significant. We don’t know exactly
how significant it is.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. But it is clearly something that happens. And because it’s
symptomless, it represents a special danger in this pandemic.

matt apuzzo

Exactly right.

michael barbaro

So that’s the public health consensus. But given everything that you
have just told us, do you think that the public has reached that same
conclusion? Has that message convincingly reached the world?

matt apuzzo

Well, the message is still a mess, right? I mean, we saw in early June,
the W.H.O. came out and said, oh, symptomless spreading is really rare.
And then they walked it back the next day. And part of what the W.H.O.
is still doing is trying to draw this distinction between asymptomatic
and pre-symptomatic, and it feels like we’re right back in February.

michael barbaro

Right. We’re making distinctions that don’t mean all that much to people
who are trying to decide whether to go to work, whether to go to a
restaurant, whether to see friends.

matt apuzzo

Yeah, and those are life and death situations right now. If I wake up in
the morning and I believe that I’m not sick, and if the whole policy
comes down to me understanding the difference between asymptomatic and
oligosymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, then the important
message is lost. I’m putting other people’s lives in danger with my
decisions.

michael barbaro

Matt, thank you very much.

matt apuzzo

Good to be with you.

\[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Doctor, if German authorities and European health officials and the
    W.H.O. had taken your findings seriously back in January, despite
    the fact that it was a single patient, despite the fact that there
    was a semantic debate around the title of the paper, how do you
    think it would have made a difference in the state of the pandemic
    today?

  - camilla rothe  
    Ha. That is very difficult to tell. It would be too easy, even
    though I would like to say that that could have saved hundred
    thousands of lives. Had authorities been stricter at an earlier
    point in time, well, would have people accepted it? This may sound
    strange, but maybe we needed the drastic pictures that we saw in
    Italy, when the military had to basically bury the coffins because
    nobody else could, or the dramatic pictures from New York City.
    Maybe that we needed, all of us needed that shock to take it
    seriously and really to pull up our socks to fight the virus. So
    it’s very difficult to tell what would have happened had we taken
    this onboard early on.

  - matt apuzzo  
    Has this experience changed how you see the global health community,
    your colleagues essentially?

  - camilla rothe  
    Oh, yes, definitely. Definitely. It was a very sobering experience.
    I still don’t know what to make of it. What I really hope is that
    someone is going to somehow work this up in a, again, in a
    scientific way to say, what happened? What happened in the heads of
    people? Why was this unwelcome news? Why was this dismissed? Can we
    learn from this? Is this, if you like, a cognitive error on the side
    of decision makers? And what can we do to prevent this from
    happening again? And I was, to be honest, deeply disappointed by it.
    But more so, I really wish to understand what was behind it. I’m
    really hoping that one day someone will come and explain to me what
    the issue really was.

\[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, Doctor, we really appreciate your time, and we wish you the
    best of luck.

  - camilla rothe  
    Thank you so much. Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Amid
intense pressure from President Trump to reopen schools, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would issue new
guidelines to local school districts. In tweets on Wednesday morning,
Trump described the original C.D.C. guidelines, which call for masks,
social distancing, staggered arrival times and no meals in cafeterias,
as, quote, “tough, expensive and impractical.”

  - archived recording (robert redfield)  
    But I want to make it very clear that what is not the intent of
    C.D.C.‘s guidelines is to be used as a rationale to keep schools
    closed.

michael barbaro

A few hours later during a briefing at the White House, the C.D.C.‘s
director emphasized that those guidelines are suggestions, not
requirements, and said that he did not want the guidelines to prevent
schools from reopening. And in a major ruling on Wednesday, the Supreme
Court upheld a regulation from the Trump administration that lets
companies with religious or moral objections to birth control limit
coverage of them under the Affordable Care Act. The 7-to-2 ruling could
result in as many as 126,000 women losing coverage for contraceptives
from their employers. It was the latest case involving the relationship
between church and state, in which the court’s majority has sided with
religious groups.

\[music\]

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The reaction prompted the W.H.O. to clarify its position in a live
session hosted on Facebook and Twitter. Dr. Van Kerkhove said her
comment had been based on only two or three studies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I was just responding to a question, I wasn’t stating a policy of
W.H.O. or anything like that,” she said. Dr. Van Kerkhove said her
statement was also based on unpublished evidence that some countries
have shared with the W.H.O.

But critics, including its own officials, said the organization should
be transparent about its sources. “W.H.O.’s first and foremost
responsibility is to be the science leader,” said Lawrence Gostin,
director of the W.H.O. Collaborating Center on National and Global
Health Law.

“And when they come out with things that are clearly contradicted by the
scientific establishment without any justification or citing studies, it
significantly reduces their credibility.”

A key point of confusion is the difference between people who are
“pre-symptomatic” and will go on to develop symptoms, and those who
are “asymptomatic” and never feel sick. Dr. Van Kerkhove suggested that
her comments were about people who are truly asymptomatic.

A widely cited
[paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5) published in
April suggested that people are most infectious up to two days before
the onset of symptoms, and estimated that 44 percent of new infections
were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing
symptoms.

W.H.O. refers to such people as pre-symptomatic. “OK, technically fine,”
Dr. Jha said. “But for all intents and purposes, they are asymptomatic —
they are without symptoms.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Van Kerkhove said that by using the two terms, W.H.O. officials are
in fact trying to be very clear about the group of people they are
referring to.

“Unfortunately, that’s not how everybody uses it,” she said. “I didn’t
intend that to make things more
complicated.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The W.H.O. continues to maintain that large respiratory droplets
expelled by sneezing or coughing are the main route of transmission and
to downplay a possible role for aerosols, smaller particles that may
linger in the air.

But evidence is piling up that aerosols may be an important route.

“What they haven’t recognized is that activities like coughing and
talking, even breathing in some cases, are also aerosol-producing
procedures,” said Linsey Marr, who studies airborne transmission of
viruses at Virginia Tech.

W.H.O. officials said they were aware that breathing and talking might
result in aerosols, but questioned their importance in spreading the
virus.

“To date, there has been no demonstration of transmission by this type
of aerosol route,” said Dr. Benedetta Allegranzi, the W.H.O.’s technical
lead on the coronavirus.

But the W.H.O. defines airborne transmission too narrowly, some
scientists said. Airborne transmission also includes the possibility
that the virus is aloft for shorter distances, then inhaled.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They have a very early 20th century, very unsophisticated view of what
aerosols and airborne transmission are,” said Dr. Don Milton, an expert
on public health aerobiology at the University of Maryland.

Up until the 1950s, Dr. Milton said, tuberculosis was thought to be
spread by prolonged close contact. “We now know that it’s only
transmitted by aerosols,” he said.

Some scientists are suspicious that W.H.O.’s stance on masks and
aerosols may stem less from scientific research than from a concern over
supplies of personal protective equipment for medical workers.

The organization currently recommends respirator masks that would block
aerosols only for health care workers doing medical procedures that
produce aerosols.

Dr. Van Kerkhove said that the W.H.O.’s guidance was based only on
science and not on any considerations of supply. While a shortage of
P.P.E. is a problem, she said, “it doesn’t change what we recommend.”

All of the experts said it was not that the W.H.O. is wrong on all
counts, but that given the implications of its statements, it should be
more cautious in concluding that transmission by air or by people
without symptoms is not significant.

“We don’t know,” Dr. Milton said. “But they also don’t know.”

Some experts said that when the W.H.O. uses the phrase “there is no
evidence” to indicate uncertainty, it is in fact conveying certainty
about the absence of a phenomenon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Van Kerkhove conceded that point.

“That’s a fair statement,” she said. “There’s a lot of research that
needs to be done to really understand this, and we are open to the fact
that there is new research every day.”
