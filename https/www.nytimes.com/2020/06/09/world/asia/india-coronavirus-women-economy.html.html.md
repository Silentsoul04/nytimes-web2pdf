# For Indian Women, the Coronavirus Economy Is a Devastating Setback

</div>

India’s women were already dropping out of the labor force. Coronavirus
restrictions — and one of the worst economic slumps in decades —
threaten even more losses for them.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

NEW DELHI — Over and over, Seema Munda kept refusing her parents’ pleas
to get married. She wanted to be a nurse, not a housewife — and why was
employment all right for her brother but not her?

So last summer, Ms. Munda lied about where she was going and slipped out
of her conservative village in northern
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/world/asia/india-coronavirus-wedding-groom.html).
She traveled 1,000 miles south, to the city of Bengaluru, where she
found work stitching shirts at a factory.

“This job liberated me,” she said.

But when the coronavirus pandemic hit, Ms. Munda’s life of independence
shattered. In March, India instituted one of the strictest lockdowns in
the world. In April, more than 120 million Indians lost their jobs,
including Ms. Munda, 21.

As the world takes stock of staggering losses from the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/economy/economic-recovery-coronavirus-resurgence.html),
economists predict especially dire setbacks for women in the work force.
The United Nations [warned in a recent
report](https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2020/policy-brief-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-women-en.pdf?la=en&vs=1406)
that the pandemic has not only exacerbated [inequalities between the
sexes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html),
but threatened to undo decades of gains in the workplace.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The International Labour Organization
[found](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_744685.pdf)
that 41 percent of women were employed in sectors at high risk for job
or working-hour losses from the pandemic, compared with 35 percent of
men.

The global slowdown could have especially stark consequences in
developing economies, where around 70 percent of working women are
employed in the informal
[economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/economy/economic-recovery-coronavirus-resurgence.html)
with few protections.

After Ebola quarantine measures were lifted in West Africa, for
instance, [women were slower than men to recover their
livelihoods](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_women_9_apr_2020_updated.pdf)
and had a harder time securing loans to rebuild businesses.

In India, a nation of 1.3 billion, the coronavirus lockdown, which was
imposed in late March, has only added to the setbacks for women, who
were already being shaken out of the work force in greater numbers in
recent years.

One national employment study conducted in May [found that a higher

men](https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/women-people-in-semiurban-areas-bear-the-brunt-of-job-losses/1836606).
Among Indians who remained employed, women were more likely to report
anxiety about their futures.

In India, marriage does not necessarily translate into a loss of ****
employment. But it often constrains women’s autonomy, making it
difficult for them to leave secluded villages where policing of their
choices is common, patriarchal values are ironclad and job opportunities
are scarce.

Rohini Pande, an economics professor at Yale who researches women’s
employment patterns in India, said female migrant workers could face
steep challenges recovering work. Many women [struggle to persuade their
parents to let them defer
marriage](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/world/asia/bangalore-india-women-factories.html)
and leave their villages for jobs.

“The pipeline was already extremely leaky,” said Ms. Pande, who directs
the Economic Growth Center at Yale. “It’s just going to get leakier.”

Employment figures for India’s women have been a cause of concern for
years.

From 2005 to 2018, female labor participation in India [declined to 21
percent from about 32
percent](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?locations=IN),
one of the lowest rates in the world. The rate for men also fell — India
is experiencing a youth boom and has not been able to create enough new
jobs to keep up — but not nearly as far as for women.

Economists have offered several explanations for the slide, including a
cultural one: As India’s economy expanded, families that could afford to
keep women at home did so, thinking it afforded them a degree of social
status.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Domestic duties cut into the time women can search for jobs. In India,
[women perform 9.6 times more unpaid care work than
men](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_633135.pdf),
about three times the global average. The pandemic has increased that
burden for many women, according to the International Labour
Organization.

Swarna Rajagopalan, a political scientist and founder of Prajnya Trust,
an organization focusing on gender equality in India, said job scarcity
could make it harder for women to enter or re-enter the work force — at
least in the short term.

India’s economy may contract by five percent this year, [according to
some
estimates](https://www.crisil.com/en/home/our-analysis/reports/2020/05/minus-five.html),
representing perhaps the worst slump since the country became
independent from the British.

“I really worry about this,” Ms. Rajagopalan said. “We still think of
men as being the primary breadwinners of our families, and if we have to
make choices about letting people go, women will lose their jobs. It
doesn’t matter how desperately they need them, or how hard they work.”

Many of the hardest-hit industries have been those with a high
proportion of female workers, including hospitality and manufacturing,
where women are often employed without contracts, making it easier to
let them go.

Although India recently lifted most of its lockdown measures in an
effort to ease pressure on the economy, many women fear that even a
limited degree of economic freedom will be difficult to
regain.

Seema Munda said she had found “the key to unlocking my dreams” when she
moved to Bengaluru last July to work at Pearl Global, a garment factory
that employs women from poorer states like Odisha and Jharkhand, where

Her parents were initially furious when they realized she had left their
village, Laujoda, for a city at the other end of India. Ms. Munda calmed
them down when she offered to send some of her earnings

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“I said, ‘Whenever I ask you for money for my studies, you always turn
me down,’” she recalled. “‘So if you let me go and work, not only will I
have money for myself but also to spare for you.’”

Ms. Munda started fresh. She moved into a hostel with dozens of other
young women from the factory. They slept on straw mats on the ground.

When Ms. Munda received her first paycheck, about $112, she went to a
clothing store with a handful of crisp notes.

“I bought my favorite dress,” she said. “It was exhilarating.”

But when India went under lockdown, the factory closed and the women
found themselves in a precarious situation. Around the country,
businesses shut down. Trains and buses suspended their services,
stranding millions of migrant workers in cities.

Within a few weeks, Ms. Munda said Pearl Global stopped paying her. She
was forced to leave the hostel and take shelter in a school.

By the end of May, as India’s travel restrictions eased further, Ms.
Munda made a wrenching decision and joined others in boarding trains
home. With little money left, she said she had no other choice but to
return to Jharkhand.

“My family will never let me come back now,” she said by telephone. “I
don’t want to get married.”

Ms. Munda stopped answering calls from a reporter. Friends from
Bengaluru were also unable to reach her. They worried that her parents
had taken her phone.

One factory worker who traveled with Ms. Munda said she hid her face
with a stole and sobbed during the three-day trip to Jharkhand.

Hemant Kumar, the chairman of Ashankura Trust, a nongovernmental
organization that helps migrant workers in Bengaluru, said only a few
women had picked up his calls after reaching their
villages.

Some told him that their families had forbidden them from venturing back
out for jobs.

In one of her last conversations with a reporter, Ms. Munda expressed
anger that “parents value sons more than daughters.” She said returning
home could mean “the end of my economic activity and hence my life.”

“I dread to think of that possibility,” she said. “Our future is in
darkness.”
