He was compared to Heller, Mailer and Styron, and though he never
achieved their celebrity, he was beloved by his students and readers. He
died in the coronavirus pandemic.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

The writer Nicholas Rinaldi, in a poem published in 1981 titled ``We
Have Lost Our Fathers,'' proffered a grim view of human destiny. ``We
will die,'' he wrote. ``They will not remember who we were.''

Mr. Rinaldi, who died on May 27, is very likely to defy that prophecy.
He will not be soon forgotten by the hundreds of students he inspired as
a professor of literature and creative writing, nor by the many readers,
past and future, of his poetry and acclaimed four novels.

He was 86 when he died at Bridgeport Hospital in Connecticut. The cause
was pneumonia, which he developed as a complication of the novel
coronavirus, his son David said.

Mr. Rinaldi published his first novel, ``Bridge Fall Down,'' in 1985. It
was followed by ``The Jukebox Queen of Malta'' (1999), ``Between Two
Rivers'' (2004) and ``The Remarkable Courtship of General Tom Thumb''
(2014).

In
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/books/books-in-brief-fiction-937886.html}{The
New York Times Book Review}, Adam Mazmanian wrote that ``Between Two
Rivers,'' the biography of a building and its residents in Lower
Manhattan between the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in
1993 and 2001, was a ``sprawling, elegant study.''

And in reviewing ``The Jukebox Queen of Malta'' in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/14/books/books-of-the-times-the-attractions-of-malta-don-t-include-egg-creams.html}{The
Times}, Richard Bernstein wrote that it offered a ``funny, melancholy,
romantic, disturbing, character-rich window'' on World War II.

Here Mr. Rinaldi was traversing ground --- ``the absurdist confines of
World War II'' --- that had been the territory of Joseph Heller, Norman
Mailer and William Styron, Mr. Bernstein wrote. (The book carried a
cover blurb from Mr. Heller.)

``His new book does not have the searing, epochal quality of the works
of those famous writers,'' Mr. Bernstein added, ``but it does show that
Mr. Rinaldi belongs in their company.''

Nicholas Michael Rinaldi was born on April 2, 1934, in Brooklyn to Frank
and Rose (Lopena) Rinaldi. His father was a violin dealer and collector,
his mother a seamstress.

Raised in the Borough Park section, he graduated in 1951 from Brooklyn
Preparatory School, a Jesuit institution. He entered St.
Andrew-on-Hudson, a seminary in Hyde Park, N.Y., where he studied until
1957. He enrolled in a master's program that year at Fordham University
and went on to earn a doctorate in English literature in 1963 with a
dissertation on William Faulkner.

He met his future wife, Jacqueline Tellier, at Fordham; they married in
1959, and she survives him. In addition to her and their son David, Mr.
Rinaldi is survived by their daughter, Tina Banas; their sons Paul and
Stephen; eight grandchildren; and Mr. Rinaldi's sister, Isabelle
Rinaldi.

Mr. Rinaldi started his teaching career in 1966 at St. John's University
in Queens, then moved to Connecticut to teach at Fairfield University,
like Fordham a Jesuit institution as well. He taught there for 30 years,
established a creative-writing program and served as a dean and as
chairman of the English department.

Critics often praised Mr. Rinaldi for how thoroughly he developed his
fictional characters, as if he had known them intimately.

Explaining his method, he once said: ``Some writers always groove to
personal experience, but I always work with invented (or historical)
characters, people I don't know. That's what drives the engine of
creating --- to find out who these people are.''
