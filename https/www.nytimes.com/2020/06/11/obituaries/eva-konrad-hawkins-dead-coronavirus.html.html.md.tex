Whether studying algae at the New York Aquarium or creating
underwater-life exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History, Eva
Konrad Hawkins found a refuge in New York City as a marine scientist.

A Jew who grew up in Hungary, Dr. Konrad Hawkins had lived through the
Holocaust and the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and then fled Communist
oppression for the United States. There she also conducted research and
taught biology at the University of Pennsylvania, Fairleigh Dickinson
University in New Jersey and City College in Harlem.

She died of Covid-19 on April 18 at a nursing home in the Bronx, family
members said. She was 90.

Her brother was the writer and sociologist Gyorgy Konrad, a prominent
Hungarian dissident during Communist rule who died in September. Though
the siblings survived the German occupation, relatives and classmates
were murdered in concentration camps. Their house was looted and their
synagogue ransacked.

``They saw at an early age how easy it is to lose everything, and this
formed the basis of their grown-up thinking,'' Mr. Konrad's widow, Judit
Lakner, said.

Mr. Konrad remained in Hungary after the uprising as an opponent of the
regime. But his sister felt stifled as a scientist and longed to study
at American universities. ``She wanted to live in a democracy, to live
without fears,'' Ms. Lakner said.

Dr. Konrad Hawkins decided to defect. Taking only a backpack, she
traveled to Hungary's northern border and crossed snowy, wooded terrain
on foot into Austria. She emigrated to the United States in 1957.

Eva Konrad was born March 12, 1930, to a prosperous family near Debrecen
in eastern Hungary. She was 14 when the Germans invaded.

While most Jews in their village were killed in Auschwitz and other Nazi
death camps, she and George, who was 10, and two of their cousins
managed to escape to a safe house in Budapest, thanks to a gentile
shopkeeper who used documents obtained through bribes, a cousin, Paul
Zador, said in an interview.

Young Eva had to wear a yellow Star of David when walking outside or
risk being shot. At one point, she narrowly escaped a roundup and
deportation to a camp.

After the war, she and her brother were reunited with their parents, who
had been sent to the Strasshof concentration camp near Vienna.

Dr. Konrad Hawkins earned her Ph.D. in botany from the University of
Pennsylvania in the early 1960s and married Charles Hawkins later in the
decade. They divorced after several years.

Dr. Konrad Hawkins, who wrote a number of scientific journal articles on
algae, had a consuming passion for her field, Dr. Zador said. He
recalled one episode during a visiting by her at a beach house. ``While
I was cooking her lunch, she was down by the water looking for algae,''
he said.

She had a limited social life because she was ``fanatical about her
research,'' Dr. Zador's wife, Ellen Ficklen, said. ``It was her and her
microscope,'' she said.

Dr. Konrad Hawkins eventually settled in uptown Manhattan and saw New
York City as her adopted home.

``She was a very proud New Yorker,'' Ms. Lakner said. ``She didn't
belong to anywhere else, only to New York. She loved the freedom.''
