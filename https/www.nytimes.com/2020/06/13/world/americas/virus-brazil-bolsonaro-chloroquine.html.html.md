*\[Read more on* [*Brazil’s Coronavirus cases and
deaths*](https://www.nytimes.com/article/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html)*.\]*

RIO DE JANEIRO — The coronavirus was taking root in Latin America when
President [Jair
Bolsonaro](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus.html)
of Brazil startled the medical community with a claim: A miracle drug
was on hand.

“God is Brazilian, the cure is right here\!” [the president
exclaimed](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/coronavirus/deus-brasileiro-a-cura-ta-ai-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-remedio-ainda-em-teste-contra-covid-19-1-24337060)
in late March to a throng of supporters.
“[Chloroquine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html)
is working everywhere.”

Since then, the virus has ripped through Brazil. More than 41,000 people
have died — Brazil has now passed Britain and has recorded more
fatalities than any country other than the United States — and the daily
death toll is now the highest in the world, bucking the downward trend
that is allowing other major economies to reopen.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Experts point to Mr. Bolsonaro’s rejection of the emerging scientific
consensus on how to fight the pandemic — including his promotion of
unproven remedies such as chloroquine and
[hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trial.html)
— as one of the factors that helped tilt the country into its [current
health
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/world/americas/latin-america-virus-death.html).

Mr. Bolsonaro ordered the armed forces to mass produce it in the
military’s pharmaceutical laboratory and ordered a large supply of the
drug’s ingredients from India.

“Decisions are being made not based on evidence and empirical data but
rather on anecdotal reports,” said [Denise
Garrett](https://www.sabin.org/updates/pressreleases/dr-denise-garrett-joins-sabin-director-coalition-against-typhoid),
a Brazilian-American epidemiologist who worked at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for more than 20 years. “Bolsonaro
invested a huge amount of money into an action that has not been proven
to be effective at the expense of increasing testing and contact
tracing.”

Between February, when Brazil identified its [first coronavirus
case](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/world/americas/brazil-italy-coronavirus.html),
and June, when Brazil’s coronavirus caseload topped 828,000, lagging
only behind the United States, the country had months to learn from
other nations that had been ravaged by the virus and prepare for the
pandemic.

Instead, Mr. Bolsonaro has led the country down what health experts call
a perilous path: He sabotaged quarantine measures adopted by governors,
encouraged mass rallies and repeatedly dismissed the danger of the
virus, asserting that it was a “measly cold” and that people with
“athletic backgrounds,” like himself, were impervious to serious
complications.

Earlier this week, Mr. Bolsonaro’s administration [stopped disclosing
comprehensive coronavirus
statistics,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/world/americas/brazil-coronavirus-statistics.html)
leaving Brazilians without an official tally showing the trajectory and
scope of the outbreak. The data was restored after the Supreme Court
ordered the ministry to resume publishing
it.

Under his tenure, decisions about medical and scientific protocols
became measures of political loyalty. As the coronavirus crisis
worsened, Mr. Bolsonaro leaned on the health ministry to embrace
widespread use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, straining his
relationship with the two physicians who have served as health
ministers. One was fired in April and the other one [lasted less than a
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/world/americas/brazil-health-minister-bolsonaro.html)on
the
job.

Their successor, an active duty general with no medical experience,
agreed to [issue
guidance](https://www.saude.gov.br/noticias/agencia-saude/46919-ministerio-da-saude-divulga-diretrizes-para-tratamento-medicamentoso-de-pacientes)encouraging
doctors to prescribe the drug widely for Covid-19 patients.

Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are both anti-malaria drugs but they
have distinct secondary uses; [hydroxychloroquine also treats lupus and
rheumatoid
arthritis](https://www.nytimes.com/article/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html).
Both drugs are among the pharmaceuticals being studied as potential
remedies for Covid-19, but neither drug has been approved as a reliable
treatment for Covid-19 patients.

The United States Food and Drug Administration [warned
against](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or)
use of the two drugs in Covid-19 patients outside of hospital settings
because they can cause heart problems.

Margareth Dalcolmo, a prominent pulmonologist and researcher at Fiocruz,
a government agency that does health care research in Rio de Janeiro,
said Brazil’s embrace of the drug set a dangerous precedent — and is
hampering the necessary research.

“Today chloroquine became a political panacea, which is harmful for
science,” she said in an interview. “What we have, as I see it, is an
unfortunate politicization of pharmaceuticals.”

The controversy over hydroxychloroquine has also reverberated outside
Brazil.

In mid-May, President Trump [said he had begun taking the
drug](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-coronavirus.html)as
a preventive measure, which generated consternation among doctors.

Later that month, the White House announced it was donating two million
doses of the drug to Brazil so [it could be
used](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/joint-statement-united-states-america-federative-republic-brazil-regarding-health-cooperation/)
“to treat Brazilians who become
infected.”

Representative Eliot Engel, the New York Democrat who chairs the House

irresponsible that President Trump and Jair Bolsonaro have put politics
over science,” [he said in a statement on
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/HouseForeign/status/1267826331930128386?s=20)

Studies into the drug’s uses continue. Earlier this month, the [first
carefully controlled
trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html)
of hydroxychloroquine found the drug does not prevent the disease in
people who have been exposed to a sick patient.

Also, a prominent medical journal, The Lancet, took the rare step
of[retracting a widely-read
study](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/06/05/world/europe/05reuters-health-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-lancet.html)
earlier this month that found the drug could be dangerous in Covid-19
patients. The study, which was withdrawn after its underlying data was
called into question, led doctors to halt some clinical trials.

In Brazil, the battle over hydroxychloroquine began in March as doctors
were preparing for a crush of patients and testing a variety of drugs
based on treatment protocols that had shown promise in other countries.

Marcelo Kalichsztein, a prominent pulmonologist in Rio de Janeiro, began
prescribing hydroxychloroquine to coronavirus patients soon after they
developed symptoms, along with the antibiotic azithromycin and a zinc
supplement. He did so having found the research of[the French
microbiologist, Dr. Didier
Raoult](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/magazine/didier-raoult-hydroxychloroquine.html),
persuasive. But Dr. Raoult’s [research was
discredited](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/06/hydroxychlorine-covid-19-study-did-not-meet-publishing-societys-expected-standard/),
and the scientific group that published it said later that the paper had
not met its
standards.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Dr. Kalichsztein, who contracted the virus in early April and took
hydroxychloroquine, said the treatment had been effective in preventing
the disease from reaching an inflammatory stage among more than 100
patients whose care he oversaw.

Doctors began sharing their experiences with the drug and tips on how to
mitigate the risk of heart complications in Zoom meetings and group
chats on WhatsApp.

While these discussions were happening out of sight, Nise Yamaguchi, a
São Paulo immunologist and oncologist, emerged as a high profile
champion for the drug, arguing in television interviews that it had the
potential to prevent patients from becoming sick enough to require
hospitalization.

Dr. Yamaguchi, who caught Mr. Bolsonaro’s attention and was summoned to
meet with him, said she never intended to become embroiled in the heated
political debate that has added to Brazil’s polarization.

“The doctors and scientists that act based on academic research can’t
allow themselves to be guided by political matters, since the health of
the patient is paramount,” she said in an email.

But by mid April, hydroxychloroquine became something of a litmus test
among Brazilians who revere and loath the far-right president, who has
invested a lot of political capital — and public funds — in the
drug.

Staunch supporters of the president clamored for more widespread use of
the drug in YouTube videos, memes and tweets that claimed that a
lifesaving drug was being maligned by leftists. They promoted their
posts with hashtags that included \#BolsonaroWasRight,
\#HydroxychloroquineSavesLives and \#HydroxychloroquineNow.

Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the president’s sons, posted a video on his
YouTube channel on April 17 that attacked a study that warned about the
side effects of the drug.

“The left is coming together to create fake studies about chloroquine,”
[he wrote in the video
caption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5--FDXaOg4). “The objective is
to demonize the medicine, even though they know that it’s effective to
save lives.”

The charged political debate surrounding the use of the drug could
interfere with ongoing trials, said Dr. Garrett, the former C.D.C.
expert.

“Either volunteers won’t want to be part of it because they are
contaminated by the political debate or the ones who will be part of it
may be doing it driven by political ideology,” she said.

And that, she said, would be “very unfortunate for public health.”
