Nineteen people died and more than 170 were injured in the eastern
Chinese province of Zhejiang on Saturday after a truck carrying
liquefied gas exploded on a highway.

Videos of the accident, near the city of Wenling around 4 in the
afternoon, showed a large explosion that appeared to send the chassis of
the truck careening into nearby buildings. Other footage picked up by
Chinese state news outlets showed charred facades of nearby buildings
with windows blown out by the shock wave, and flaming wreckage sending
up thick black plumes into the sky.

Chinese state
\href{https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1271797616599154688}{news
outlets} said rescue workers were searching for people trapped in the
residential and factory buildings, some of which had collapsed. The
truck was carrying gas between two cities on
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html}{China's}
east coast, Ningbo and Wenzhou, and was exiting a highway when the
accident occurred, according to the state-run Zhejiang News. The
accident shut down traffic on the highway going both ways. Other videos
showed cars nearby on fire.

A local official said the cause of the crash and explosion was being
investigated. More than 100 rescue personnel and 34 fire trucks had been
called to the scene.

Video picked up by state news outlets showed the truck appeared to have
caught fire before the explosion.

China has been trying to raise safety standards in the gas and chemical
industries after

explosions at a number of plants} in recent years.

Over the past two decades China has built out an extensive highway
network, and the number of vehicles on it has grown rapidly. That has
driven problems with road safety that the government has sought to
address in sporadic safety campaigns. More than 200,000 Chinese die each
year in road accidents, according to the World Health Organization.
