Janet Mendez started receiving bills soon after returning in April to
her mother’s home from Mount Sinai Morningside hospital, where she
nearly died of Covid-19. First, there was one for $31,165. Unable to
work and finding it difficult to walk, Ms. Mendez decided to put the
bill out of her mind and focus on her recovery.

The next one was impossible to ignore: an invoice for $401,885.57,
although it noted that the hospital would reduce the bill by $326,851.63
as a “financial assistance benefit.” But that still left a tab of more
than $75,000.

“Oh my God, how am I going to pay all this money?” Ms. Mendez, 33,
recalled thinking. The answer came to her in about a second: “I’m not
going to be able to pay all this.”

Ms. Mendez is optimistic that her insurance company will cover a large
part of the costs, but only after receiving a series of harassing phone
calls from the hospital about payment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokesman for the hospital told The Times that Ms. Mendez erroneously
received a bill that should have gone directly to her insurance company
or the government. Coronavirus patients, through a series of federal aid
packages, are supposed to be largely exempt from paying for the bulk of
their care.

But mistakes are likely to occur, particularly given the number of
people who have recently lost their health insurance amid an economic
downturn and widespread job loss. And when they do happen, patients like
Ms. Mendez will be the ones to have to sort out the complicated billing
process at a time when they are still recovering from Covid-19.

“We’re looking at a tsunami,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president
at the Community Service Society of New York, which is trying to help
Ms. Mendez get her bill reduced. “The earthquake has struck, and now
we’re waiting for the bills to roll on
in.”

When Ms. Mendez got over the initial shock and examined her bill more
closely, she was struck by how vague and arbitrary the charges seemed.
She was billed $3,550 for “inpatient charges” and another $42,714.52 for
“pharmacy,” but without any breakdown of what medicines she received or
how much each cost.

Ms. Mendez said the bill should have at least been itemized, listing
each drug she was being charged for — and the price. She was, after all,
unconscious for much of her hospitalization.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I don’t know what medicines they put in me,” she said. “I can’t say
they did this, or they didn’t do this.”

Most of the line items on her hospital bill are vague. Some of the most
expensive are four entries that simply read “Medical — Cardiac Care.”
Each one ranges from $41,000 to $82,000.

Part of the confusion was that Ms. Mendez had recently changed health
insurers, and she had arrived at the hospital struggling to breathe and
without her new insurance information. The hospital billing department
concluded she was uninsured and sent her a bill directly.

“To be clear, neither this patient nor any Mount Sinai patient should
receive a bill or be expected to directly pay for their Covid-19 care,”
a spokesman for Mount Sinai Health System, Jason Kaplan, wrote in an
email, describing it as an isolated
error.

While eye-popping medical bills are nothing new, Covid-19 patients are
supposed to be largely exempt. During Ms. Mendez’s hospitalization, a
huge bailout of hospitals was taking shape.

In New York City, hospitals received more than $3 billion in federal
payments last month from an early round of bailout payments. The
hospital where Ms. Mendez was treated, Mount Sinai Morningside (formerly
Mount Sinai St. Luke’s),
[received](https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-COVID-19-High-Impact-Payments/b58h-s9zx/data)
at least $63.7 million.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The federal dollars are intended to help compensate hospitals and health
care providers for the expense of treating Covid-19 patients like Ms.
Mendez. The money is also meant to help make up for [the revenue
hospitals](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/index.html#collapseTwo)
lost as elective procedures were canceled and non-Covid patients
dwindled.

The money comes with some conditions that are intended to protect
patients from medical debt. For instance, health care providers are not
permitted to [seek extra
payment](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/provider-relief-fund-general-distribution-faqs.pdf)
from patients with health insurance who received care at an
out-of-network hospital. Nor can they “balance-bill” — that is, bill the
patient for the difference between what the insurer will pay and the
hospital’s charges.

But the protections do not fully insulate patients. Even if a hospital
takes federal money, some of the doctors who treat patients there can
send their own bills to patients
directly.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Ms. Mendez received a bill separate from the hospital. The doctors who
cared for her individually charged between $300 and $1,800 for each day.
Some days, four different doctors billed her for treatment.

Depending on their insurance plan, patients may still be stuck with
paying co-payments, deductibles and a percentage of the bill — which can
amount to thousands of dollars, although some plans may limit
out-of-pocket costs, said Jack Hoadley, a health policy researcher at
Georgetown University.

And significantly, some of the conditions imposed with the bailout funds
only apply to patients with insurance.

Hospitals can seek reimbursement from the government for treating
uninsured patients through a different process. But it may turn out that
uninsured patients still receive bills.

Ms. Mendez has submitted the bill to Cigna, her new insurer, and said
that she was led to believe her share of it will be under $10,000.

Like thousands of other gravely ill Covid-19 patients in New York City,
Ms. Mendez, an office administrator for a Domino’s Pizza franchise, had
been deeply sedated and placed on a ventilator to keep her breathing
soon after arriving at the hospital on March 25. She was in the hospital
for 19 nights.

When she awoke, she could not remember her own name or where she was,
she said in an interview.

It was a day or two before her memory returned and her confusion
receded.

When she was discharged, an ambulance took her to her mother’s home.

At first her mother tried to keep the bills from her. But then Ms.
Mendez said she began to get phone calls from Mount Sinai asking her how
she intended to pay.

She is hopeful that insurance will cover the vast majority of the
charges. But she is also worried that more bills will arrive.

“I haven’t seen anything that says ‘ambulance’ on it,” she said,
wondering if she was going to be charged for the ride to the hospital.
Then she remembered that she left the hospital by ambulance as well.
“Maybe I’ll be charged for both of them.”
