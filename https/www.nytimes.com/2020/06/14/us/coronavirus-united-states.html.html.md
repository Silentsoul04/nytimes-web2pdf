CHICAGO — The warning has echoed ominously for weeks from
epidemiologists, small-town mayors and county health officials: Once
states begin to reopen, a surge in [coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) will follow.

That scenario is now playing out in states [across the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
particularly in the Sun Belt and the West, as thousands of Americans
have been sickened by the virus in new and alarming outbreaks.

Hospitals in Arizona have been urged to activate emergency plans to cope
with a flood of
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/health/coronavirus-underlying-conditions.html)
patients. On Saturday, Florida saw its largest single-day count of cases
since the pandemic began. Oregon has failed to contain the spread of the
virus in many places, leading the governor on Thursday to pause what had
been a gradual reopening.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And in Texas, cases are rising swiftly around the largest cities,
including Houston, San Antonio and Dallas.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m very concerned about it,” said Mayor Eric Johnson of Dallas, noting
that after months of warnings and isolation, many residents had stopped
wearing masks and maintaining social distance out of sheer fatigue.
“They’ve been asked for quite some time to not be around people they
love, and that they want to spend time with. Wearing a mask is not
pleasant. And I think people are tired.”

For close to a month, [much of the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
has looked like a nation open or beginning to open, and increasingly
unfettered by restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
With many government limits removed and people left to make individual
choices about precautions, Americans have gone back to salons and
restaurants, crowded into public parks and, in dozens of cities, joined
[large public
demonstrations](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles)
protesting police misconduct.

Over all, daily coronavirus cases across the United States are
essentially steady, stuck on a plateau. More than two million people
have now contracted the virus in this country, [according to a New York
Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
and every day, about 21,100 new known cases are reported, not much lower
than the numbers from a month ago. About 800 people die from it each
day. Those figures have both dropped significantly since peaking in
April.

But as of Saturday, the daily number of new coronavirus cases was
climbing in 22 states, shifting course from what had been downward
trajectories in many of those places.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The spikes in cases bring leaders in these states to a new crossroads:
Accept the continued rise in infections as an expected cost of reopening
economies or consider slowing the lifting of restrictions aimed at
stopping the spread or even imposing a new set of limits.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Houston on Thursday, [the county’s top elected official
warned](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Hidalgo-to-announce-COVID-19-threat-level-15332940.php)
that the community was “on the precipice of a disaster” and urged
residents to minimize contact with others. More than 300 new cases have
been identified in that county on each recent weekday.

But at the city’s Galleria mall, there were few signs of concern: People
stood in a tightly spaced line for pretzels at an Auntie Anne’s kiosk.
At California Nails, two women sat maskless during pedicures. Signs
urged social distancing, but in crowded walkways outside stores,
shoppers brushed past one another, only inches apart.

Throughout most of Florida, the reopening of public life has allowed
bars and movie theaters to operate at half capacity and gyms at full
capacity. On June 5, the state loosened restrictions further, even as
the caseload was beginning to go up.

In Salt Lake City, some people are now behaving as they did before the
coronavirus pandemic, even amid a rise in cases, said Teresa Kehl, a
Utah resident who runs summer soccer camps with her husband.

“We went to a restaurant the other night and none of the employees had
masks on,” Ms. Kehl said. “It was kind of shocking.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Angela Dunn, the Utah state epidemiologist, has traced the state’s
resurgence in the coronavirus to the state’s reopenings, which began
before Memorial Day.

“The timing directly correlates with our loosening up restrictions,” Dr.
Dunn said. “That definitely has something to do with it.”

There is ample reason to tie the latest surge of infections to
relatively early reopenings. Clusters of infections in food processing
facilities, jails and nursing homes continue to create hot spots in some
places, but they do not explain the broader pattern.

Most of the 10 hardest-hit states that have seen rising case levels
started reopening on or before May 8. Louisiana, where cases have
started rising again after extended declines, began reopening on May 15.
Another hard-hit state with growing cases, California, has reopened in a
more incremental way, with continuing restrictions in some regions.

Many states that were slowest to reopen have seen a different
trajectory, at least so far. Most of the 10 states hit hard over all in
the pandemic — but currently seeing decreasing daily cases of the virus
— began reopening in mid-May or later. Only two of those states,
Pennsylvania and Indiana, began reopening before May 15. Some of the
others, New Jersey and Michigan, only began reopening in earnest in
June. And two others, New York and Illinois, kept restrictions in their
worst-hit areas while reopening less populous regions.

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: What We’ve Learned About the Coronavirus

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Michael Simon Johnson and Annie Brown; with help from Alexandra Leigh Young; and edited by Theo Balcomb and Lisa Chow

#### Six months into the pandemic, we take stock of where we are, and where we might be going.

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, the pandemic feels different in the U.S. than it did two
    weeks ago, three weeks ago, a month ago. It feels — and these are
    highly qualitative words, and I know you’re probably rolling your
    eyes — it feels less desperate, and it feels a little less urgent.
    And I’m not even quite sure why that is. So what do you make of
    that? I mean, does that mean we’ve gotten complacent?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. I think some parts of the country are not afraid yet.
    
    They see this as something that happened to the other. To urban New
    Yorkers, to blacks and Hispanics in the big cities far away.
    
    But I also see that, even in New York, it’s a combination of, “Well,
    we survived the first wave and it didn’t get me.” Or, “The people I
    knew who got it, survived.” And, “Boy, am I bored, and frustrated in
    lockdown.” And, “I want my job back.” And, “I want my hanging out
    with my friends back.”

  - michael barbaro  
    Mm-hm.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    And I think we have gotten used to the idea of death — of absorbing
    a lot of death.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Today, my colleague, Donald G. McNeil Jr., returns with an update on
    the state of the coronavirus, and what we’ve learned about the virus
    six months into the pandemic.

  - \[music\]  
    It’s Monday, June 15.
    
    Donald, the last time that we spoke to you was in mid-April, when
    the death toll from the coronavirus in the U.S. was nearing 40,000.
    And various states, at that time, were beginning the process of
    opening back up. Slowly, but opening back up. Where is the pandemic
    now?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK. Well, there are 113,000 dead in the U.S., the last time I
    looked. Basically, every state has reopened to some extent in
    different ways, with different phases. In about 21 of those states,
    cases are going up, as was feared. Hospitalizations are going up. So
    I would see this as a very worrying situation.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, given that — I mean, in terms of how the United States is
    managing the virus and its spread, are we doing better now than we
    were many, many weeks ago, when we spoke? Or are we doing worse?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I think we’re doing considerably worse in that now we know what the
    danger is, and yet we’re still getting an enormous number of
    infections. Now, the places that were hit hard in the first wave —
    which is New York in the Northeast, but also places far away from
    that, like New Orleans, Seattle and California — they are mostly
    coming down. They got seriously scared. They had intense lockdowns
    that lasted relatively long. They are wearing masks, they are
    practicing social distancing. And cases are coming down in those
    states. In states where there wasn’t a big first wave of the virus,
    where they were more upset by the economic effects of the lockdown —
    lots of people out of work, lots of people suffering, lots of people
    frustrated in their houses — those are were the cases, in general,
    are going up. Places like Texas, places like North and South
    Carolina, places like Arizona. And that’s dangerous because they’re
    coming out of lockdown, and opening society, and encouraging people
    to be in greater contact with each other at a time when the cases
    are already on the upswing. So you’re not flattening the curve.
    You’re allowing the curve to spike up again.

  - michael barbaro  
    So is it fair to say, at this point in the pandemic, the cities and
    the states that were hardest hit at the beginning seem to have
    enforced the strongest lockdowns, and therefore the virus infection
    rates seem to be going down there. Whereas states that weren’t hit
    as hard at the beginning, and perhaps didn’t respond as forcefully,
    are now experiencing an uptick in infections instead?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. In general, that’s correct.

  - michael barbaro  
    So, Donald, now that we have lived with this virus for about half a
    year, I want to turn to the things that we have learned about it,
    and that we didn’t know when we first started talking to you. And I
    wonder if we can start with transmission.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK.

  - michael barbaro  
    I remember you telling me, back in February, the main modes of
    transmission are droplets. You cough or sneeze near me, I catch the
    virus from you. The other was the virus living on surfaces. And I
    would touch that surface, I might touch my eye, I would get
    infected. What have we learned about the actual levels of
    transmission from these two? Did one of them turn out to be a much
    bigger vector than the other?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Those two are still vectors, although surfaces may be a little less
    important than we feared. But the really important thing we’ve
    learned is that there is aerosol transmission. Little tiny, tiny
    droplets, the kind that hang in the air inside a room for hours, can
    hold enough virus to transmit this disease. And we emit those
    droplets not just through coughing or sneezing, but just through
    talking, especially loud talking, through laughing, through singing.
    You know, we’re unaware of this fine mist of droplets that comes out
    of our mouth at all times. You’re only sort of aware of it if you’re
    in the front row at a theater and you realize the actresses are
    spitting on you. But, actually, if you and I were to sit three or
    four feet apart, and we’re talking, and joking, and laughing, we
    would actually be spreading a cloud of a very fine mist of droplets
    at each other. So we’re learning that transmission, particularly in
    indoor spaces where there is no wind, is probably a major spreader
    of this because everybody’s vulnerable to it.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. So staying on this idea of what we’ve learned — asymptomatic
    carriers. What have we learned about people who may not even know
    they have the virus? They don’t show any symptoms, but they may be
    spreading it. How much has our understanding changed about how
    important asymptomatic carriers are in this pandemic?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    It has changed a lot. The initial estimates out of China were that
    there were very few asymptomatic carriers — like, 1 percent. That
    has turned out to probably be quite wrong. The C.D.C estimates that
    the number of asymptomatic carriers is about one third.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Right. And that changes a lot about how we handle this disease.

  - michael barbaro  
    What do you mean?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, OK — so temperature checks probably aren’t very useful because
    —

  - michael barbaro  
    You’re asymptomatic.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    — one of the symptoms you feel is fever. If you don’t feel fever,
    you can still spread the disease. So you’re going to have to detect
    the disease through testing rather than through saying, hey, we’ve
    got a lot of sick people around here. Because one third of your
    people are not going to be sick, but they’re still spreading the
    disease. So if you wanted to open up your office to people — like I
    said, fever checks wouldn’t work. You’d actually have to test
    everybody, you’d have to test them frequently, and you’d have to be
    able to get the results back very quickly. Because you don’t want
    somebody who’s asymptomatic working in the office for two or three
    days while you’re waiting for the results of the test to come back.

  - michael barbaro  
    And how possible is that kind of testing? I mean, what you’re
    proposing is every workplace having some sort of mandatory testing
    system to weed out people who may have the virus, and especially
    those who may be asymptomatically infected.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. I mean, there’s a lot of thinking about testing. In the
    beginning of it, when we only had, you know, 10,000, 20,000 tests,
    we were only testing people who were sick, who had symptoms. It was
    very hard to get a test. Now, we’ve reached a point where we’re on
    track to get to a million a day, I think. When you’ve reach that
    level, you can use testing for surveillance. That is, you sort of
    look around the country and say, where do we have hot spots? Now,
    probably, to do that right, we need, like, 5 million tests a day,
    that’s what a Harvard study suggested. And it means testing in New
    York City, but also testing in Winnemucca, Nev., and every place
    else. Because you want to know wherever the virus is popping up, you
    want to spot it, and you want to test not just the sick but a broad
    spectrum of people. You know, maybe one day, you test all the third
    graders in the county, or something like that. Another day, you test
    everybody in nursing homes, and things like that. Now, that’s at the
    5 million test level. If you go up —there was a Nobel Prize-winning
    economist at N.Y.U. who proposed that, if we had 30 million tests a
    day, we could literally use this as a way to completely reopen the
    economy. And that would mean everybody who’s in contact with other
    people in an office would have to be tested every day, and we’d need
    rapid results. And it would cost, he figured, about 1.5 billion
    dollars per week. But he said, you know what, that’s a whole lot
    less than lockdown has been costing us. We could completely reopen
    the economy if we could test 30 million people a day. And we’d save
    money by having the old economy going again. Now, the logistics of
    doing that is wildly unimaginable. The proposal from the N.Y.U.
    economist has been put in the crazy ideas box for now. And yet,
    people who have really studied this stuff think of it as, wow —
    crazy, but good. So what are you going to do? You know, it depends
    on what people are willing to commit money to do.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. And for those who have had the virus, and have recovered — of
    which there are hundreds of thousands of people — what are we
    learning about immunity?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    We know that people have antibodies. We know they have IgG
    antibodies, which are the ones that appear later, and usually —
    usually — indicate immunity. So we know that people turn up positive
    on antibody tests. And top experts are saying, we think we can
    assume they’re immune to the disease, but we’re not sure yet.
    Because we don’t really know what level of antibodies you need in
    order to be immune. So nobody is saying, OK, that’s it, you’ve
    passed one test, you’re immune. That’s what people would like to
    think. All sorts of people ask me, should I get an antibody test?
    And I keep saying, sure, if it’s going to make you feel better, get
    an antibody test. But don’t assume you’re immune just because you’ve
    got a positive. You probably are, but we don’t know that yet. It’s
    still too early.

  - michael barbaro  
    So recalling our very last conversation, in which we talked about
    the idea that there might be two classes of people in this pandemic
    — the immune and the susceptible. We are not yet at a place of our
    understanding of the coronavirus where anyone is truly considered
    immune, and therefore sort of invulnerable and able to wander the
    world differently than the rest of us.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Scientifically speaking, no, we’re not there yet. But practically
    speaking, a lot of people — even doctors I know — who’ve been
    infected and have recovered are behaving as if they’re immune.
    They’re reasonably confident that they’re immune. I mean, they
    shouldn’t let down their guard, A, because it’s not smart and, B,
    because it sets a bad example. But they probably worry a whole lot
    less than they did before. Now, we do not know how long immunity
    lasts — and that’s going to be another great, big question. And we
    can’t know that until some months, or years, have passed because
    this virus has only been around since November. So, probably, the
    immunity is going to last a few years. But we don’t know that yet
    either. These are all unknowns. Immunology is complicated.

  - michael barbaro  
    And given everything you just said — under the current
    circumstances, where will the United States be by the fall when it
    comes to death?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I’m very worried about the fall for several reasons — which I can go
    into if you want to.

  - michael barbaro  
    Please.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK. We know the virus transmits indoors. And when it gets cold,
    people aren’t going to be able to eat outdoors again. They’re going
    to want to get into warm spaces. So the possibility for transmission
    is really high. We also know, not just from 1918, but from — Michael
    Osterholm at Minnesota has looked at eight influenza epidemic since,
    I think, it’s 1763. And in each one of them, no matter what time of
    year the virus first hit, winter, spring, summer, or fall, it faded,
    and then came back several months later in a much more lethal wave.
    And that was the phenomenon in 1918. There was a brief, but scary,
    breakout in Haskell County, Kansas, in army camps and stuff. And
    then, the disease mostly disappeared in the United States — seems to
    have mostly gone overseas and hit the troops in the trenches in
    Europe. And then, in the fall and winter, it came roaring back. And
    a third of the deaths took place in a little tiny period between
    September and December, 1918. So I’m very worried that something
    like that could happen this fall and winter, and that we’re not
    mentally prepared for it.

  - michael barbaro  
    So the infection and death rate for the next few months quite likely
    will not be representative of what this virus is capable of. And the
    fall and the winter may be very, very different and much scarier.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    That’s possible. And that’s what a lot of top public health people
    are worried about — that we will have transmission. I mean, we’re
    still seeing 20,000 new infections per day. And we’re at about a
    little under 1,000 new deaths per day. And that’s been consistent
    for a couple of months now.

  - michael barbaro  
    And this might be a strange question — but is that a good number, or
    a bad number?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    That’s a terrible number. I mean, 1,000 deaths a day from this?
    20,000 new infections a day? I mean, that’s not an epidemic you have
    under control. You know, we don’t talk about it that way, but that’s
    a rapidly spreading epidemic. Now, we may become complacent about
    that, we may sort of accept that as the new norm. And that may lull
    us into a sense of complacency when fall arrives. And that’s a
    worry. And that’s why I’m so eager for treatment or vaccine to hurry
    up, hurry up, hurry up.

  - michael barbaro  
    And where are we in that vaccine process now?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, there’s 150 or so vaccine candidates being looked at around
    the world. In the United States, we have designated different
    candidates for warp speed. Meaning, testing the vaccines, but
    simultaneously paying companies to build factories to make them so
    that all the ones that turn out to be both safe and effective will
    have, hopefully, millions of doses ready to roll immediately.
    Because one of the big roadblocks to getting vaccine is not just
    testing the vaccine and making sure it works, but then suddenly
    producing 300 to 600 million of doses for this country, depending on
    if you need one or two doses, and seven-plus billion doses for the
    world. So you want to get a head start on the production as much as
    you can. So we’re doing that with a number of candidates. And we’ve
    never seen anything like this before.

  - michael barbaro  
    Does all that encourage you to think that we might have a vaccine
    much faster than we’ve ever had a vaccine before? I remember you
    telling me that the fastest we’ve ever really had a vaccine in
    production and available to people, from start to finish, is close
    to four years.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes that was the mumps vaccine, and the record is four years. But I
    think we’re doing things very, very differently this time. We’ve got
    multiple candidates. And some of those vaccines — if what we’re
    being told is correct — are actually going into production even as
    we speak.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    So that’s very encouraging to me.
    
    But things go wrong when you test vaccines. You get surprises that
    you didn’t expect. And so let’s hope multiple things don’t go wrong.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    So, Donald, we’ve talked about the risk of many different activities
    in this moment of the pandemic. We have not talked about something
    that has been going on for several weeks now in the United States,
    which are large-scale protests and demonstrations since the police
    killing of George Floyd. And I wonder what your sense is about the
    risk involved in those protests of spreading the virus?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, I don’t worry when there are crowds, outdoors, spaced 6 feet
    apart and wearing masks. I do worry when people are jammed up
    against each other, either confronting a police line, or on a dais
    while they’re making speeches, or something like that. I worry about
    anybody who’s pushed into the back of a police van. I worry about
    people who’ve been in cells together. I worry about the funeral
    ceremonies, which all took place indoors. You know, these are all
    potential super-spreader situations.

  - michael barbaro  
    And have we yet seen any uptick in transmission from the U.S.? I
    know it may take several weeks for us to determine that, but have
    we?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I mean, if we have spikes here, it’s going to be very hard to say,
    oh, that spike came from the protest. Because how do you do contact
    tracing of everybody else who was in a crowd of 10,000 people with
    you? You know, it’s easy to do contact tracing on your family and
    your co-workers at the office. It’s very hard to do contact tracing
    on a whole crowd of strangers. So we won’t necessarily know, when
    people fall ill, that they got infected at the protest march. I
    mean, each individual person may say, well, the only time I’ve been
    in association with a lot of other people was when I was at a
    protest march. But for some epidemiologist to put all those stories
    together as those people turn up in hospitals, or as their
    grandmothers turn up in hospitals, is going to be very difficult. So
    we may not see the signal we would expect to see, if that makes
    sense.

  - michael barbaro  
    I’m curious, you know, reflecting on everything that you have just
    told us, I’m curious how you are operating now in the world knowing
    everything you now know, six months into this pandemic? What your
    routines are, what your precautions are. Are you taking the subway?
    Are you always wearing a mask? Are you going to any kind of office?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I’m working from home. I’m working a lot. I’m lucky in that I’m not
    out of work. But my girlfriend, and a lot of other people I know who
    are out of work, are pent-up, and frustrated, and angry. And some
    are really worried about their income. I always wear a mask when I
    am indoors with other people, as in the grocery store or pharmacy. I
    avoid going indoors with other people, basically, at all costs. If I
    were riding the subway, I would definitely wear a mask. I’m not
    riding the subway. I’m very worried about what’s going to happen in
    New York City when a lot of people have to go back to work. Because
    right now, we’ve got near gridlock on the F.D.R. Drive and stuff
    sometimes, because a lot more people are in cars because they’re
    afraid to go on the subway. But at some point, we’re going to have
    to go back on the subway. And, frankly, I think the M.T.A. ought to
    take the windows off the buses and subways. I know it’s crazy — and
    I know it’s going to be cold in winter, and hot and un-air
    conditioned in summer. But that’s the way to get breeze blowing
    through enclosed spaces. And if we want to go back into our offices,
    we’re going to have to find a way to have breeze blowing through
    enclosed spaces so that the virus does not hang in the air. We’re
    going to have to rethink our workplaces, or stay out of them,
    because they’re going to be too dangerous until we have a vaccine.

  - michael barbaro  
    Do you intend to return to an office anytime soon?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    No. I’m 66 years old. You know, I’m reasonably healthy, but I’m also
    in a higher-risk group. So I think me being in an office with a lot
    of members of “The Daily” team breathing on the microphones, or
    whatever, would be dangerous for me right now. So no. And I’m sad
    that, you know, I have not seen my granddaughter, except on video.
    She was born on the 4th.

  - michael barbaro  
    Mazel — mazel tov\!

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you. Thank you. And I intend not to hold her until I’m
    vaccinated or immune. My daughter — the apple did not fall far from
    the tree, and she’s just as determined as I am that we should play
    by the rules on that, I think. So it’s sad. But I’m taking the long
    view. This increases the chances that both my granddaughter and I
    will make it to her high school graduation. So that’s the plan. And
    if I have to sacrifice a little bit of seeing her right now, you
    know, OK, I’ll make that sacrifice for both of us.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, we wish both of you the best. And we’re really grateful for
    your time. And thank you very much.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you for letting me on again.

    The Times reports that, as infections rise in 22 American states,
    officials there are facing a choice: Accept the increase as the cost
    of reopening their economies, or slow the reopening process and even
    impose new restrictions, however unpopular they may be. In an
    interview published on Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a White House
    advisor on the pandemic, said that waves of infections would likely
    spike and fall for months, and that he did not expect the U.S. to
    return to normal for another year.

  - \[music\]  
    We’ll be right back.

  - michael barbaro  
    Here’s what else you need to know today. The chief of police in
    Atlanta resigned over the weekend, after an officer she oversees
    killed a 27-year-old black man, Rayshard Brooks. Before he was shot
    to death, Brooks had failed a sobriety test, run from the police and
    grabbed a taser from an arresting officer — a sequence of events
    that Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said did not warrant his
    death.

  - keisha lance bottoms  
    While there may be debate as to whether this was an appropriate use
    of deadly force, I firmly believe that there is a clear distinction
    between what you can do and what you should. I do not believe that
    this was a justified use of deadly force.

michael barbaro

Bottoms immediately ordered that the officer who had killed Brooks be
fired. And the Times reports that protests over the death of George
Floyd have been held in more than 2,000 U.S. cities and towns across all
50 states over the past three weeks. The protests, The Times found,
defied traditional demographic fault lines, occurring not just in
Democratic strongholds, but in rural, conservative and majority white
communities.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As testing capacity has increased, so has the number of cases being
counted, and officials in places like Arizona and Florida say the
increase in cases may be explained, at least partly, by the growing
availability of tests.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, said
Friday in an [interview with ABC
News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fauci-tells-abcs-powerhouse-politics-attending-rallies-protests/story?id=71219338)
that it was important to look both at case numbers and the percentage of
positive tests to understand whether upticks in cases reflected broader
transmission in American cities.

“If you test more, you will likely pick up more infections,” Dr. Fauci
said. He added, “Once you see that the percentage is higher, then you’ve
really got to be careful, because then you really are seeing additional
infections that you weren’t seeing before.”

But epidemiologists said that even taking into account a rise in
testing, the increase in confirmed cases in Sun Belt states suggested
increased transmissions. Other measures, such as the percentage of
positive tests and hospitalizations, reflect that worsening outlook. In
Florida more than 4.5 percent of those who tested between May 31 and
June 6 had the virus, compared with about 2.3 percent of people who
sought tests in mid-May. Earlier in the pandemic, the percent of people
testing positive in Florida was higher, but that was during a period
when testing was far more limited. Similar rates in Arizona and Texas
have also risen in recent weeks.

In Arizona, more than 1,400 people who were believed to have the virus
were hospitalized on Friday, up from 755 a month earlier and higher than
at any other point in the pandemic. In Texas, the 2,166 coronavirus
patients hospitalized on Friday were the most yet in that state.

For states with growing coronavirus outbreaks, some officials have
arrived at the same conclusion: The rise in infections is unfortunate
but inevitable.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)

        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their

        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

“I think it’s only a matter of time before the public sees those numbers
and starts emailing us that we need to shut down again,” Ms. Gerard said
during a board meeting.

For many business owners, the continued uncertainty about the path and
the intensity of the pandemic has been vexing.

In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, moved energetically to reopen
the state in May, and places like swimming pools, gyms and Little League
fields have opened in recent weeks. Arizona officials reported more than
1,600 cases in a day for the first time on Friday.

Carla Logan, the owner of a bistro near downtown Phoenix, said that she
was trying to save her business while making sense of Arizona’s rising
number of cases. Theories by some
[scientists](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/21/opinion/coronavirus-warm-weather-summer-infections.html)
that the virus might diminish amid [warmer
weather](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/06/02/will-warm-weather-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus/)
were fading fast.

“We were hoping and praying the Arizona heat would kill the virus, but
that didn’t happen,” she said. “A second shutdown for us would be
catastrophic.”

In Florida, the number of new coronavirus cases has topped 1,000 for all
but one of the past seven days. Most of the state began to reopen on May
4, though South Florida is still under tighter restrictions. Miami’s
beaches only reopened on Wednesday.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has attributed the uptick to more
widespread testing. Retail stores, including Publix supermarkets and
Home Depot, now offer tests at a handful of locations, and state-run
sites allow anybody to get tested, regardless of age or symptoms,
without a doctor’s prescription. Even then, demand at some sites is low,
and more than half of the available tests a day do not get used, the
governor said.

In some ways, life in the state feels like it is getting back to normal.
The Kennedy Space Center hosted the SpaceX launch. Jacksonville has been
eager to host the Republican National Convention. Orlando has allowed
the filming of professional wrestling and expects to soon welcome the
National Basketball Association and Major League Soccer.

Despite the uptick in cases in some states, there are also states that
have been reopened for weeks where the number of new known virus cases
has slowed. Pennsylvania, Indiana and Colorado — which all began
reopening in late April or early May — have seen hopeful signs.

It is possible that the full effect of reopening may be hidden from
view. Certain states and counties are testing less than others. And
reopening has looked different in different places, partly depending on
varying habits of residents.

In places where masks are standard and people are adhering to social
distancing — both recommended by public health experts — transmission
may be slower.

In Douglas County, Kan., home to 122,000 people, only 82 cases of the
coronavirus have been identified, an exceedingly low number for a place
of its size.

The county, which includes the college town of Lawrence, kept in place
restrictions on businesses even after statewide mandates were dropped.
Residents have continued to wear masks and stay far apart, said Dan
Partridge, the director of the local public health agency.

“The worry I have is that fatigue will set in and compliance will slip,”
Mr. Partridge said.

Epidemiologists point to another factor that could result in even more
coronavirus outbreaks in the coming days: the widespread demonstrations
across the country, where protesters are packed shoulder-to-shoulder,
often without masks.

Minneapolis, where protests erupted after the death of [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/article/george-floyd-who-is.html), is
being watched especially closely, though health officials say that it is
too soon to know what effect the demonstrations had on the virus.

A small number of Minnesota National Guard members mobilized for the
protests have tested positive, and new testing sites have been
established for demonstrators.

At least 30 cases nationally have been linked to protests, including 10
National Guard members and one police officer in Nebraska who have been
infected. Contact tracers in Chicago and elsewhere have begun asking
people who are positive for the coronavirus whether they have attended
protests.

Julie Bosman reported from Chicago, and Mitch Smith from Overland Park,
Kan. Reporting was contributed by Manny Fernandez from Houston, Patricia
Mazzei from Miami, Simon Romero from Albuquerque, Amy Harmon from New
York, and David Montgomery from Austin, Texas.
