# Pakistan’s Lockdown Ended a Month Ago. Now Hospital Signs Read ‘Full.’

Medical workers are falling ill in Pakistan at alarming rates as the

KARACHI — Pakistanis stricken by the coronavirus are being turned away
from hospitals that have simply closed their gates and put up signs
reading “full house.” Doctors and nurses are falling ill at alarming
rates, and are also coming under physical assault from desperate and
angry families.

When
[Pakistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/pakistan-stock-exchange-shooting.html)’s
government lifted its lockdown on May 9, it warned that the already
impoverished country could no longer withstand the shutdown needed to
mitigate the pandemic’s spread. But now left unshackled, the virus is
meting out devastation in other ways, and panic is rising.

Before reopening, Pakistan had recorded about 25,000 infections. A month
later, the country recorded an additional 100,000 cases — almost
certainly an undercount — and the pandemic shows no signs of abating. At
least 2,356 people have died of Covid-19, according to official figures
released Thursday.

Pakistan is now reporting so many new cases that it is among the World
Health Organization’s top 10 countries where the virus is on the rise.
The W.H.O. wrote a [letter criticizing the
government’s](https://www.dawn.com/news/1562494) efforts on June 7 and
recommended that lockdown be reimposed, stating that Pakistan did not
meet any of the criteria needed to lift it.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Medical professionals now expect the virus to peak in July or August and
infect up to 900,000, adding further strain to an already shaky health
care system some warn may collapse.

But government officials have ruled out the possibility of a further
lockdown and dismissed the recommendations by the W.H.O.

On a recent day in the sprawling port city of Karachi, Ali Hussain and
his brother shuttled between public hospitals, looking for help and
receiving none. Mr. Hussain’s older brother had a severe cough and fever
but had been unable to get a coronavirus test for days.

“We cannot afford the private hospitals, they are charging tens of
thousands rupees,” said Mr. Hussain, who earned 20,000 rupees per month,
about $121, working at a textile mill before the lockdown.

Like many others, the Hussain family is suffering not only because of
the coronavirus itself but also the economic devastation the pandemic
has wrought. Mr. Hussain said he and his brother could barely afford to
feed themselves since they lost their jobs in March, let alone pay for
private
care.

“We are completely broke and we do not know what to do,” Mr. Hussain
lamented.

The World Bank projects that Pakistan’s economy will contract by 0.2
percent next fiscal year. Up to 18 million of the country’s 74 million
jobs could be lost, according to the Pakistan Institute of Development
Economics, an independent research firm set up by the government.

More immediately, Pakistan’s struggling health care sector is in deep
crisis.

Only a third of Karachi’s 600 beds in intensive care wards are available
to treat coronavirus patients in the city’s private and public
hospitals, for a population of about 20 million, according to local
health officials. According to the W.H.O., only 751 ventilators are
dedicated to the pandemic in Pakistan, the world’s fifth most populous
country, with some 200 million people.

Health care workers admit privately that they are referring patients
like Mr. Hussain’s brother to other hospitals they know are at or over
capacity because they fear being attacked by desperate families. Medical
workers across Pakistan are being assaulted on a near-daily basis for
not being able to admit patients or having to tell families that their
loved ones had died.

“Our hospitals are completely exhausted,” said one doctor, who asked for
his name to be withheld because he is a government employee.

Late last month, a family attacked the staff of one Karachi hospital
with knives and iron rods after doctors declared their relative dead,
rampaging through the emergency ward. On May 14, the emergency
department of another major government hospital in Karachi was ransacked
after health care workers refused to give over the body of their loved
one, warning the family could contract the virus by handling the remains
without using any precautions.

After several similar episodes, employees say that many hospitals are
now handing over the bodies of coronavirus victims to their families
anyway, worried more about the violent backlash than the pandemic’s
spread.

The anger reflects the grief and panic that is setting in across the
country, and also an erosion of trust between the state and its
citizens.

[Prime Minister Imran
Khan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/world/asia/pakistan-imran-khan-bin-laden-martyr.html)
and other officials have frequently dismissed the virus as a common flu,
then rushed to urge people to stay home before dismissing the severity
of the pandemic again. Unfounded rumors have spread on social media that
the government is inflating coronavirus numbers to milk the
international community for more aid money, secretly leaving patients to
die of other
causes.

since the lockdown was lifted. In March, doctors and nurses [threatened
to walk off the job and some called in
sick](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/asia/pakistan-coronavirus-tablighi-jamaat.html),

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

So far, at least 35 health care workers have died of the pandemic, the
Pakistan Medical Association said in a statement Thursday. At least
3,600 health care workers are infected with the virus, according to
official figures.

The government “did not listen to what doctors were saying. Now the
result of this negligence is obvious,” the Pakistan Medical Association
said in its statement.

In Punjab, the country’s most populous province, a doctors’ association
claimed earlier this month that 40 percent of the province’s medical
staff had tested positive for coronavirus.

“While the pandemic stares us all in the face, the morale of health care
providers has hit rock bottom,” said Dr. Salman Haseeb Chaudhry, who
represents the Young Doctors Association, at a news conference this
month.

At a protest among health care workers on Tuesday, Shafiq Awan, the
leader of a paramedic association in Karachi, said the government was
not heeding their
advice.

“We need protective gear, not salutes and praises. If we start dying or
are unable to work, who will treat patients?” Mr. Awan asked.

Under withering criticism, Prime Minister Khan hit back on Thursday,
saying that his government had responded adequately to the pandemic.

Mr. Khan was at first reluctant to impose a lockdown, stating in early
March that the country’s economy could not weather the fallout. By the
end of that month, the country’s powerful military sidelined Mr. Khan to
shut down the country.

Both the government and military came under [immense pressure from
Pakistan’s powerful
Islamists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/world/asia/pakistan-coronavirus-ramadan.html)
to loosen the lockdown during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting that
started in April and ended last month. After just a few weeks, the
lockdown was lifted.

“We are a low middle-income country, with two-thirds of the population
dependent on daily incomes,” Dr. Zafar Mirza, the de facto health
minister, said Wednesday.

“We have to make tough policy choices to strike a balance between lives
and livelihoods.”
