*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

In a long life, Leota Dooley, who was 97 when she died of Covid-19 on
April 23, did a lot of things. One of them was to help make the Valley
more musical.

That’s the area around [Salida](http://salida.com/), a mountain-ringed
town along the Arkansas River in central Colorado. It’s a popular stop
for outdoor enthusiasts these days, but for a long time it was more
isolated. Ms. Dooley, who loved music and had a fine second-soprano
voice, was part of several efforts to ensure that there was musical
entertainment to be had amid the lovely scenery.

She was an original member of an all-comers-welcome community singing
group called [the Noteables](http://www.salidasings.org/noteables.html)
that was founded in 1988. (The group is still going strong, though its
spring concert was canceled because of the virus.)

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Paula Lallier, who joined the group in the early 1990s, remembers
receiving a helping hand from Ms. Dooley, who was known as Lee, at a
house concert.

“I was new in Noteables and had started taking voice lessons with one of
the founders,” she said in a phone interview. “I think just to give me
some encouragement she had me sing this duet with Lee.”

“Of course Lee’s lovely voice and encouraging manner did a lot for my
confidence,” she added. “She was just such a classy, lovely, gentle,
warmhearted soul.”

The voice teacher who arranged that duet was Jeanne Kostelic, who said
Ms. Dooley was one of the initiators of another musical effort, called
Concerts Plus, in the 1990s.

“The only classical music we had was from Aspen during the summertime,”
she said by phone. “There was nothing in the wintertime.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Concerts Plus brought in performers during the off-season, including
classical musicians and contemporary acts like Max Morath, the ragtime
performer.

Leota Elizabeth Herren was born on Dec. 16, 1922, in Hutchinson, Kan.,
to Clarence and Nellie Herren. [An obituary in The Chaffee County
Times](http://www.chaffeecountytimes.com/obituaries/leota-dooley/article_dcd20214-9c75-11ea-8bd5-b337d7f2b33f.html)
said that after graduating from Emporia State University in Kansas,
where she majored in English and library sciences, she bought land near
Mount Princeton in Nathrop, a village north of Salida. By 1950, with the
help of her mother, she had built a cabin there.

In the 1940s and ’50s she worked in the engineering libraries of several
aircraft companies. She married George Dooley in 1964, and over the
years they owned or managed an assortment of businesses in the Salida
area, including, in the late 1970s, Dooley’s Bar. Her husband [died
in 2009](http://www.chaffeecountytimes.com/obituaries/george-d-dooley/article_ad3ee599-81d9-56f0-b918-78ea1abbea04.html).
She has no immediate survivors.

At her death Ms. Dooley was a resident of Columbine Manor Care Center in
Salida, and was one of a number of residents there who [died amid an
outbreak](https://arkvalleyvoice.com/four_additional_covid_19_cases_staff_at-columbine_manor/)
of the new coronavirus.

Ms. Dooley had moved to the care facility because she was having
difficulty walking, but her mind was still keen, as fellow members of
the ABC Book Club attest. They held their December meeting near the
manor just so she could be sure to attend. Who wouldn’t want someone
with a library sciences background in their book
club?
