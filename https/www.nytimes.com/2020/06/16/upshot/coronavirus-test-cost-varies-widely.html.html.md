# Most Coronavirus Tests Cost About $100. Why Did One Cost $2,315?

</div>

U.S. health care prices are unregulated, opaque and unpredictable. When
Congress required insurers to cover Covid-19 testing, a few providers
decided to take advantage.

In a one-story brick building in suburban Dallas, between a dentist
office and a family medicine clinic, is a medical laboratory that has
run some of the most expensive [coronavirus
tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/upshot/virus-testing-shortfall-arizona.html)
in America.

Insurers have paid Gibson Diagnostic Labs as much as $2,315 for
individual coronavirus tests. In a couple of cases, the price rose as
high as $6,946 when the lab said it mistakenly charged patients three
times the base rate.

The company has no special or different technology from, say, major
diagnostic labs that charge $100. It is one of a small number of medical
labs, hospitals and emergency rooms taking advantage of the way Congress
has designed compensation for coronavirus tests and treatment.

“We’ve seen a small number of laboratories that are charging egregious
prices for Covid-19 tests,” said Angie Meoli, a senior vice president at
Aetna, one of the insurers required to cover testing costs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

How can a simple coronavirus test cost $100 in one lab and 2,200 percent
more in another? It comes back to a fundamental fact about the American
health care system: The government does not regulate health care prices.

This tends to have two major outcomes that health policy experts have
seen before, and are seeing again with coronavirus testing.

The first is high prices over all. Most medical care in the United
States costs [double or
triple](https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-research/international-comparisons-of-health-care-prices-2017-ifhp-survey)what
it would in a peer country. An appendectomy, for example, costs $3,050
in Britain and $6,710 in New Zealand, two countries that regulate health
prices. In the United States, the average price is $13,020.

The second outcome is huge price variation, as each doctor’s office and
hospital sets its own charges for care. One [2012
study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1151669)found
that hospitals in California charge between $1,529 and $182,955 for
uncomplicated appendectomies.

“It’s not unheard-of that one hospital can charge 100 times the price of
another for the same thing,” said Dr. Renee Hsia, a professor at the
University of California, San Francisco, and an author of the
appendectomy study. “There is no other market I can think of where that
happens except health care.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There is [little
evidence](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/complex-relationship-between-cost-and-quality-us-health-care/2014-02)
that higher prices correlate with better care. What’s different about
the more expensive providers is that they’ve set higher prices for their
services.

Patients are, in the short run, somewhat protected from big coronavirus
testing bills. The federal government [set aside $1
billion](https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim) to pick up the tab
for uninsured Americans who get tested. For the insured, federal laws
require that health plans cover the full costs of coronavirus testing
without applying a deductible or co-payment.

But American patients will eventually bear the costs of these expensive
tests in the form of higher insurance premiums. In some cases, they are
paying for additional tests, for flu and other respiratory diseases,
that doctors tack onto coronavirus orders. Those charges are not exempt
from co-payments and can fall into a patient’s deductible.

Those kinds of bills could make patients wary of seeking care or testing
in the future, which could enable the further spread of coronavirus. In
an April poll, the Kaiser Family Foundation
[found](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-early-april-2020/)that
most Americans were worried they wouldn’t be able to afford coronavirus
testing or treatment if they needed it.

Redacted medical bills and explanation-of-benefit documents provided by
health insurers, coupled with bills that New York Times readers [have
shared](https://twitter.com/sarahkliff/status/1270342169539366914), show
the huge price variation in coronavirus tests. In Texas alone, the
charge for a test can range from $27 to the $2,315 that Gibson
Diagnostic has
charged.

Some patients are billed nothing at all for testing at public sites,
where local government agencies pick up the tab. It’s hard to know the
true range of what health providers charge and what insurers pay,
because both parties typically keep that information
[secret](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/health/hospitals-trump-prices-transparency.html).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Health care providers testing for coronavirus also have additional
protections if they want to charge high prices. The recent CARES Act
requires that insurers cover the full cost of coronavirus testing, with
no co-pays or deductibles applied to the patient. The health plans must
also pay an out-of-network doctor or lab its full charge so long as the
provider posts that “cash price” online.

That latter provision is meant to prevent a practice known as “balance
billing”: when an insurer pays an out-of-network doctor something less
than the full charge, and the doctor bills the patient for the
remainder.

Health policy experts
[worry](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/usc-brookings-schaeffer-on-health-policy/2020/04/09/how-the-cares-act-affects-covid-19-test-pricing/#:~:text=Loren%20Adler,-Associate%20Director%2C%20USC&text=Tucked%20in%20the%20Coronavirus%20Aid,The%20first%20of%20these%20\(Sec.)
that the policy unintentionally gives some providers the green light to
set exceptionally high charges, knowing that insurers are legally
required to pay.

“If you are an out-of-network lab, you can name your price,” said Loren
Adler, an associate director at the U.S.C.-Brookings Schaeffer
Initiative for Health Policy. “I could say it’s $50,000, and you are
required to pay me that amount.”

No health care provider has been quite that bold in its coronavirus
testing prices; most have kept their charges relatively modest.

Many health care providers have settled on test prices of $50 to $200.
Medicare initially paid heath providers $51.31 for coronavirus tests but
[bumped](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-increases-medicare-payment-high-production-coronavirus-lab-tests-0)
reimbursements up to $100 in mid-April. LabCorp, one of the country’s
largest diagnostic testing firms, [bills
insurers](https://www.labcorp.com/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/health-plan-information)
$100 for its tests.

A few health providers have set their prices significantly higher. A
chain of emergency rooms in Texas and Oklahoma, for example, has
regularly charged patients $500 to $990 for coronavirus tests. A small
hospital in Colorado and a laboratory in New Jersey have also come to
insurers’ attention for their especially high bills.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Multiple insurers identified Texas as the state where they’ve received
the highest proportion of expensive tests. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Texas has received more than 600 out-of-network bills for coronavirus
tests that are over $500, with an average charge of $1,114.

Gibson Diagnostic Labs’ website advertises “Covid-19 testing for your
patients with results in just 24 to 48 hours.” The website states the
“cash price” for a coronavirus test as $150, which is what they bill
the government for uninsured patients’ tests. The billed charges for
insured patients were many multiples
higher.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

Three large health insurers independently identified Gibson Diagnostic,
which is in Irving, Texas, as the source of their highest-priced tests
received during the pandemic.

One national health plan was surprised to notice testing for sexually
transmitted diseases tacked onto some of the coronavirus bills that ran
through Gibson Diagnostic.

In a statement last week, the company said the $2,315 price was the
result of “human error” that occurred when a billing department employee
entered the wrong price into an internal system. It billed 117 tests at
that price, and had 23 of the claims paid in full. Some insurers paid
partial reimbursements or sent back no money at all.

The company said one insurance plan flagged the high price in mid-April,
which led it to reduce the price to $500. The new charge was still 500
percent of the Medicare rate and $350 higher than the online cash price.
The company declined to comment on how it settled on the new price and
why it differed from the one posted on its website.

Gibson Diagnostic also said that it had recently reversed a few of its
$2,315 charges and, after an inquiry from The Times, would reverse the
rest of those bills within 24 hours.

Other laboratory owners questioned why even $500 would be necessary to
run a relatively simple test. A data set of 29,160 coronavirus test
bills provided by Castlight Health, a firm that assists companies with
health benefits, found that 87 percent cost $100 or less.

The American Clinical Laboratory Association estimates that its members,
which have run a collective 11 million coronavirus tests, charge between
$95 and $209.

“I don’t believe it’s commercially reasonable,” said Peter Gudaitis, who
runs Aculabs in New Jersey, a member of the association.

Gibson Diagnostic may have come to a similar conclusion: This week, the
company reached out to The Times to say it would once again lower its
price. Now, the lab charges $300 per coronavirus test.

The high prices have frustrated state insurance regulators, who lack
authority to tamp down what health care providers charge. “We see these
infrequently, but they are infuriating when they do occur,” said Mike
Rhoads, a deputy commissioner of consumer services at the Oklahoma
Insurance Department. “There are free testing sites in our state. This
does not need to happen.”

He has encouraged the administrators of health plans he regulates to
contact their members of Congress, to urge refinements to the CARES Act
that would help bring prices down.

Some members of Congress say they are looking into the issue,
particularly those who recently worked on a bipartisan effort [to outlaw
surprise medical
bills](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/upshot/surprise-billing-democrats-2020.html)
(that effort has been sidelined since the arrival of the pandemic).
Legislators say they are still researching the issue, and no action is
currently planned.

“We’ve got no regulatory authority over the health care providers,” Mr.
Rhoads said. “There is not much we can do. We hope that somebody puts
some pressure on these out-of-network providers to stop doing this,
particularly during this period of time.”
