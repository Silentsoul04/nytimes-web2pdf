Beware the number of enemies you make, and pray to God they don’t have
literary agents.

That’s a lesson President Trump never learned. But he’ll be schooled
anew in late July, the scheduled publication date for a book by his
niece, [Mary
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/mary-trump-book-lawsuit.html).
Spoiler alert: She’s not defending the honor of a misunderstood uncle.
She’s reportedly plunging a dagger into him, though its lethalness is
unclear. It’s not as if she had an Ivanka-grade seat to the circus of
his life.

John Bolton had an excellent, if briefly occupied, perch as the third of
Trump’s four national security advisers so far. That’s surely why he
makes the president so nervous. Trump and his flunkies are raging about
and [suing to
delay](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/us/politics/john-bolton-book-publication.html)
distribution of Bolton’s book, “[The Room Where It
Happened](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/books/review-room-where-it-happened-john-bolton-memoir.html),”
set for release early next week. (“He’s broken the law,” Trump [fumed on
Monday](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-trumps-threats-boost-boltons-book/story?id=71259356),
referring to the administration’s claims that Bolton is trafficking in
classified information. “I would think that he would have criminal
problems.”) But Martha Raddatz of ABC News has [done a long
interview](https://deadline.com/2020/06/john-bolton-abc-news-donald-trump-martha-raddatz-1202959216/)
with Bolton to be aired on Sunday. One way or another, the truth will
come out.

Then again, the truth was never in. While most presidential
administrations leak like kitchen faucets — or at worst, garden hoses —
Trump’s leaks like Niagara Falls, as many unflattering books and much
unsparing journalism have already shown. And while most presidential
administrations have a few embittered exiles, Trump’s has a teeming
diaspora of disgusted refugees, many of whom tattled as soon as they
fled, either on the record or in whispers to reporters.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But many others have yet to spill the beans, at least not every last
lima, pinto and garbanzo, and I think we’re on the cusp of a bean
buffet. As Trump grows even meaner and more erratic and as the election
nears, the impulse to expose him will intensify. It could be what
topples him.

In addition to the books I mentioned and [a rumored
tell-all](https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-cohen-is-writing-a-secret-tell-all-to-spill-the-beans-on-trump)
by the Trump fixer Michael Cohen, there’s the [recent
denunciation](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/)
of the president in The Atlantic by Gen. James Mattis, his former
defense secretary, who had previously taken such pride in holding his
tongue.

It [was
seconded](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-kelly-trump-military-force-agrees-with-mattis/)
— sort of — by Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff, who
clearly has more to say and may well say it between now and November. As
I noted [in a previous
column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/opinion/trump-military.html),
the two belong to an array of current and former military leaders who,
in an extraordinary break with tradition, have taken public issue with a
sitting president, venting their disapproval of Trump.

But there’s no reason to believe that this revolt will be confined to
men and women in uniform. Trump has incensed and alarmed officials and
staffers in all kinds of institutions and all corners of the government.
He has burned through personnel like a pyromaniac.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And that’s just over the three and a half years of his presidency. His
path to it is strewn with [betrayed business
associates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454),
duped clients, ditched friends and estranged family members. Their
reticence, to the extent that they practiced it, has always existed in
proportion to his potency. The weaker he seems to become, the chattier
they’re likely to be. Revenge is a dish best served on CNN.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’m wondering if there’s another Anthony Scaramucci out there, a
post-Mooch snitch. I’m wondering about diplomats who might jettison
their last scraps of discretion.

I’m wondering what H.R. McMaster, Trump’s second national security
adviser, has to say. I’m wondering what Rex Tillerson, his first
secretary of state, hasn’t said yet. Neither strikes me as a figure so
partisan that he feels compelled to prop up whoever happens to be
leading the Republican Party, including a twisted tyrant like Trump.
Neither has [the Faustian
stench](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/05/opinion/sunday/pompeo-trump.html)
of a Bill Barr, a Mike Pompeo, a Nikki Haley.

But those are just the names we recognize, the associates who are on our
radar. Trump’s niece wasn’t. At this point his detractors are so legion
that there’s no way for him and his unscrupulous sentries to head all of
them off at the pass. They’re like a zombie apocalypse, lurching
straight for the White House.

Yes, I know, Trump has survived the display of piles of his dirty
laundry before, readily recasts unethical behavior as boldness and
blithely dismisses horror over his antics as the last gasps of a
faltering establishment. In the context of his brand, [the title of Mary
Trump’s
book](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/books/mary-trump-book.html),
“Too Much and Never Enough,” is less affront than affirmation. It
sounds like a James Bond movie. (The subtitle, “How My Family Created
the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” sounds more like a “Frankenstein”
remake.)

But there comes a tipping point when the people who saw you up close and
cringe at the memory cannot be shrugged off. And for Uncle Donald, it
may fast be arriving.
