\section{Irene Neuwirth Makes a Flower Necklace Out of
Paper}\label{irene-neuwirth-makes-a-flower-necklace-out-of-paper}}

The Los Angeles jeweler goes outside the box for her latest creation,
part of our Designer D.I.Y. series.

By \href{https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-testa}{Jessica Testa}

``On a typical day, I'd be in my studio designing,'' said Irene
Neuwirth, a jewelry designer known for her use of candy-colored gems.
``It's what I love to do and where I love to be.''

But while sheltering in place at her California home, Ms. Neuwirth
hadn't just lost access to her creative space, but also to her storage
of precious and semiprecious stones. What's a jewelry designer to do
without her jewels?

Go back to the basics ---~sketching and painting ---~and play around
with some new materials.

Here, Ms. Neuwirth used one of her spring 2020 designs as inspiration
for a colorful, one-of-a-kind necklace. She completed the project in
about three hours, she said, ``with pauses to take the dogs out, sit in
the yard, answer emails.''

STEP 1

\hypertarget{make-the-flowers}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Make the
flowers}}{Make the flowers}}\label{make-the-flowers}}

On white sheets of paper, Ms. Neuwirth drew seven distinct flowers,
using her
\href{https://www.modaoperandi.com/irene-neuwirth-ss20/one-of-a-kind-tropical-flower-cuff}{turquoise
tropical flower cuff} as a guide. Then she painted each flower in shades
of blue, pink or yellow.

Draw each flower in slightly varying sizes, with the largest being about
**** 3 **** inches **** in diameter. Ideally no two blooms will look
exactly alike; that's the charm of the project.

Fill in each with a watercolor --- either the summery palate Ms.
Neuwirth chose or your own combination of colors. Let the flowers dry
before cutting out each one.

STEP 2

\hypertarget{make-the-chain}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Make the
chain}}{Make the chain}}\label{make-the-chain}}

Using your double-sided tape, fasten the back of each flower onto your
ribbon or twine.

Arrange the flowers so that they're all touching, with some edges
slightly overlapping.

Tie the ends of the ribbon in a bow.
