# Billionaire’s Sentence for Child Abuse Prompts Anger in China

</div>

Wang Zhenhua, a real-estate developer and former Communist Party member,
was jailed for five years for child molestation. Many criticized the
sentence as too lenient.

A Shanghai court on Wednesday
[sentenced](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aU_BA5CvK5tJMM8rPLZx_w?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0&scene=1&clicktime=1592385659&enterid=1592385659)
a billionaire real-estate developer and philanthropist to five years in
prison for child molestation, ending a high-profile case that spurred
soul searching about how
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html)
handles child abuse and protects its wealthiest and best connected.

The developer, Wang Zhenhua, was detained [last
summer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/business/child-sexual-abuse-wang-zhenhua-seazen.html)
after news outlets reported that he had assaulted a 9-year-old girl.
After censors sought to delete reports about the case, a flurry of
online rage culminated in state-media criticism of Mr. Wang, whose
Chinese Communist Party membership was revoked.

The five-year sentence, typical for child molestation, though other
charges can increase the time of imprisonment, raised further ire on
social media, where news about the case was trending Wednesday evening.
Two local news polls on the microblogging site Weibo found respondents
overwhelmingly believed the punishment to be too lenient. In one poll,
carried out by Phoenix News, 15,000 of 17,000 respondents said Mr. Wang
had gotten off too easily.

In recent years in China, dozens of women have come forward to report
abuse by powerful men. While [some have won
justice](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/world/asia/china-metoo.html),
others have had their efforts blocked [by
censors](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/world/asia/china-women-me-too-censorship.html),
lawsuits, and the authorities’ reluctance to intervene in cases of
sexual abuse.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The court also said on Wednesday that it had sentenced a person named
Zhou Yanfen to four years’ imprisonment in connection with Mr. Wang’s
case. Local news outlets reported last year that a woman identified only
as “Ms. Zhou” had taken two girls to meet Mr. Wang, who is 58, at a
hotel after telling their parents she was taking them to Shanghai
Disneyland. The police later arrested Ms. Zhou along with Mr. Wang.

The hearings were closed, and details of the accusations made in court
have not been made public. But local news media said that Mr. Wang
committed a crime against one of the children in a hotel room.

The trial, which the court said lasted 16 hours over two days, concludes
a case that resulted in a rare instance of public fury overturning
Beijing’s harsh information controls. It has also prompted dialogue
about child abuse in China.

Numbers on the problem are scarce, and Chinese researchers and
child-welfare groups say that the data that does exist is likely to
vastly undercount abuse. Chinese [courts
handled](http://www.xinhuanet.com/2018-12/25/c_1123901403.htm) 11,519
cases involving child molestation from 2015 to November 2018, according
to Xinhua, the official state news agency.

In 2013, Chinese law-enforcement agencies and courts changed their
procedures to make it easier to prosecute the sexual abuse of children
younger than 12 and ordered severe punishments when there was evidence
of an organized effort to procure children for abuse. China’s top
prosecutors recommended a further crackdown in 2018.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In one of the most up-voted comments on social media responding to the
news of Mr. Wang’s sentence, one [user
wrote](https://www.weibo.com/2656274875/J73sIaaSD?refer_flag=1001030103_&type=comment#_rnd1592388931688),
“In five years he will be out of jail and continue, while the child will
live in this shadow for her whole life.” Others confessed a lack of
familiarity with the law, but also shock that such a crime could carry
only a five-year sentence.

Some [raised the case of Bao
Yuming](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/world/asia/china-metoo.html),
a lawyer and former board member for the telecommunications company ZTE,
who was accused earlier this year of abusing a girl he informally
adopted when she was 14. Mr. Bao was ousted from his job, but he has not
been charged with a crime. He has denied wrongdoing.

The 58-year-old Mr. Wang made much of his riches via his development
company, Seazen Holdings, which built out real estate in Shanghai and
nearby cities as housing prices boomed over the past two decades. Last
year, Seazen’s board replaced Mr. Wang with his son Wang Xiaosong.

When Mr. Wang was accused last year, the Communist Party’s powerful
Central Committee for Political and Legal Affairs, which oversees
China’s law enforcement and courts, issued a sharp commentary, writing
“sexual assault on children will surely be dealt with by the sword of
the law, no exception\!”
