# India-China Border Dispute: A Conflict Explained

The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers in a brawl with Chinese troops was the

hardly the

high in the Himalayas did not involve any exchange of gunfire.

Instead, soldiers from the two nuclear-armed nations fashioned weapons
from what they could find in the desolate landscape, some 14,000 feet
above sea level.

Wielding fence posts and clubs wrapped in barbed wire, they squared off
under a moonlit sky along jagged cliffs soaring high above the Galwan
Valley, fighting for hours in pitched hand-to-hand battles.

Some Indian soldiers died after tumbling into the river in the valley
below. Others were beaten to death. By the next day, 20 Indian troops
were dead. It remains unclear if there were Chinese casualties.

The conflict stretches back to at least 1914, when representatives from
Britain, the Republic of China and Tibet gathered in Simla, in what is
now India, to negotiate a treaty that would determine the status of
Tibet and effectively settle the borders between China and British
India.

The Chinese, balking at proposed terms that would have allowed Tibet to
be autonomous and remain under Chinese control, refused to sign the
deal. But Britain and Tibet signed a treaty establishing what would be
called the McMahon Line, named after a British colonial official, Henry
McMahon, who proposed the border.

India maintains that the McMahon Line, a 550-mile frontier that extends
through the Himalayas, is the official legal border between China and
India.

But China has never accepted
it.

In 1947, India declared its independence from Britain. Two years later,
the Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong proclaimed an end to his country’s
Communist Revolution and founded the People’s Republic of China.

Almost immediately, the two countries — now the world’s most populous —
found themselves at odds over the border. Tensions rose throughout the
1950s. The Chinese insisted that Tibet was never independent and could
not have signed a treaty creating an international border. There were
several failed attempts at peaceful negotiation.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

China sought to control critical roadways near its western frontier in
Xinjiang, while India and its Western allies saw any attempts at Chinese
incursion as part of a wider plot to export Maoist-style Communism
across the region.

By 1962, war had broken out.

Chinese troops crossed the McMahon Line and took up positions deep in
Indian territory, capturing mountain passes and towns. The war lasted
one month but resulted in more than 1,000 Indian deaths and over 3,000
Indians taken as prisoners. The Chinese military suffered fewer than 800
deaths.

By November, Premier Zhou Enlai of China declared a cease-fire,
unofficially redrawing the border near where Chinese troops had
conquered territory. It was the so-called [Line of Actual
Control.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/india-china-border.html)

Tensions came to a head again in 1967 along two mountain passes, Nathu
La and Cho La, that connected Sikkim — then a kingdom and a protectorate
of India — and China’s Tibet Autonomous Region.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

A scuffle broke out when Indian troops began laying barbed wire along
what they recognized as the border. The scuffles soon escalated when a
Chinese military unit began firing artillery shells at the Indians. In
the ensuing conflict, more than 150 Indians and 340 Chinese were killed.

The clashes in September and October 1967 in those passes would later be
considered the second all-out war between China and India.

But India prevailed, destroying Chinese fortifications in Nathu La and
pushing them farther back into their territory near Cho La. The change
in positions, however, meant that China and India each had different and
conflicting ideas about the location of the Line of Actual Control.

The fighting was the last time that troops on either side would be
killed — until the skirmishes in the Galwan Valley on Tuesday. Indian
news outlets reported that Chinese soldiers had also been killed, but
Beijing was
tight-lipped.

It would be 20 more years before India and China clashed again at the
disputed border.

In 1987, the Indian military was conducting a training operation to see
how fast it could move troops to the border. The large number of troops
and material arriving next to Chinese outposts surprised Chinese
commanders — who responded by advancing toward what they considered the
Line of Actual Control.

After decades of patrolling the border, a Chinese platoon pitched a camp
near Daulat Beg Oldi in April 2013. The Indians soon followed, setting
up their own base fewer than 1,000 feet away.

The camps were later fortified by troops and heavy equipment.

By May, the sides had agreed to dismantle both encampments, but disputes

In June 2017, the Chinese set to work building a road in the Doklam
Plateau, an area of the Himalayas controlled not by India, but by its
ally Bhutan.

The plateau lies on the border of Bhutan and China, but India sees it as
a buffer zone that is close to other disputed areas with China.

Indian troops carrying weapons and operating bulldozers confronted the
Chinese with the intention of destroying the road. A standoff ensued,
soldiers threw rocks at each other, and troops from both sides suffered
injuries.

In August, the countries agreed to withdraw from the area, and China
stopped construction on the
road.

President Trump [offered on Twitter to

What was clear was that it was the most serious series of clashes

confrontation to come.
