# Advertisers Are Fleeing Tucker Carlson. Fox News Viewers Have Stayed.

</div>

Amid a backlash and an ad boycott, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is still
attracting big audiences, another sign of the nation’s political divide.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent weeks, [Tucker
Carlson](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/business/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news-writer.html),
the conservative Fox News host, has challenged the Black Lives Matter
movement, dismissed demonstrators as “criminal mobs,” accused a Texas
police chief of “sounding more like a therapist than a cop” and mocked a
CNN children’s special about racism that featured Elmo, the “Sesame
Street” puppet.

His comments have generated a harsh backlash. Critics have called Mr.
Carlson’s on-air monologues incendiary and accused him of making racist
remarks. Major advertisers, including the Walt Disney Company and
Sandals, the vacation resorts, [have
fled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news-advertisers.html),
requesting that Fox News remove their ads from Mr. Carlson’s 8 p.m.
hour.

Viewers, however, are tuning in.

“Tucker Carlson Tonight” was seen by 4.2 million people on Monday,
making it the most-watched television program in the country that night,
ahead of entertainment fare on the major networks. His show was the
highest rated on Fox News last week, and he has pulled ahead of Sean
Hannity, the network’s usual ratings leader, in total viewers for June.

Fox News’s stars, including Mr. Carlson, are no stranger to advertising
boycotts and denunciations from the left. But at a moment of deep
national turmoil, prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in
Minneapolis last month, the response to Mr. Carlson offers another sign
of the nation’s deep political divide. Major American brands have
recoiled from his program — and celebrities like Padma Lakshmi have
[accused
him](https://twitter.com/PadmaLakshmi/status/1270194782002913280) of
spreading “race-baiting filth” — even as many viewers remain
enthusiastic.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Carlson, a conservative pundit who previously hosted shows on CNN
and MSNBC, has seized on the high Nielsen numbers as a sign that his
message — which warns about censorship from the left, and depicts the
country’s unrest as ominous and violent — is resonating.

“You are not alone,” Mr. Carlson told viewers on Tuesday, noting that
his Monday program had ranked first among “cable and broadcast news,
entertainment and sports.”

“You may feel like you are,” he continued. “Suddenly, your opinions
qualify as crimes. Dare to say what you think at work and you will be
fired in the middle of a recession. Write what you think online and you
will be silenced by the big tech companies.”

But his remarks have not sat easily with Mr. Carlson’s advertisers,
including companies like Papa John’s, Poshmark, Angie’s List and the
office furniture brand
[Vari](https://twitter.com/WorkWithVari/status/1270851022555172864?s=20),
all of which have distanced themselves from “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”
T-Mobile announced its defection in a memorable Twitter post from Mike
Sievert, the company’s chief executive, who wrote: “Bye-bye, Tucker
Carlson\!”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Thursday, the fitness equipment company NordicTrack also said it
would no longer advertise on Mr. Carlson’s program.

“The show has almost no big-name advertisers left right now,” Kara
Alaimo, a public-relations expert who teaches at Hofstra University,
said in an interview. “This is just not an issue you want to be on the
wrong side of, if you’re a mainstream brand.”

Fox News has said brands removed from “Tucker Carlson Tonight” typically
have their ads run on other programs, and the network retains the
revenue. Fox News also earns a significant portion of its income from
subscription fees paid by cable providers, rather than spending by
individual advertisers.

Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, who control Fox News, are usually
reluctant to make changes at the network because of outside pressure.
Last week, Mr. Carlson acknowledged his superiors’ support: “We work for
one of the last brave companies in America, and they’re not intimidated.
We’re grateful for that.”

Since demonstrations began, Mr. Carlson has adopted a hard-edge
approach, encouraging President Trump to be [more harsh, not
less](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/business/media/unrest-trump-tucker-carlson-anderson-cooper.html),
in cracking down on protesters. The ad boycott intensified after Mr.
Carlson, on June 8, said the unrest “is definitely not about black
lives, and remember that when they come for you.” (Fox News said the
pronoun “they” referred to liberal leaders, not protesters.)

This week, Mr. Carlson criticized police officials in Fort Worth for
dropping charges for rioting. The police responded by saying that more
serious criminal charges had not been dropped, but Mr. Carlson repeated
his criticism, calling the department’s actions “shameful.”

Though he enjoys Fox News’s backing, Mr. Carlson, a longtime Washington
resident, may be on the cusp of leaving his liberal-leaning hometown. He
recently put his Washington home up for sale, and has spent much of the
quarantine at his houses in Florida and Maine. Through a spokeswoman,
the host declined to comment about his plans.

On Wednesday, Mr. Carlson yielded the nightly ratings crown to Mr.
Hannity, who attracted 4.5 million viewers for his telephone interview
with Mr. Trump. Across all of television, Mr. Hannity enjoyed the
largest audience. Mr. Carlson was in second place, not far behind.
