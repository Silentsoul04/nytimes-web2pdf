From shows based on children’s books to productions that introduce

Online stages have the spotlight now that real ones are dark. The
following companies enable children to watch, perform or learn about
theater remotely.

**ArtsPower National Touring Theater:** For $15, families can stream a
show from the company for an unlimited time as part of its new on-demand
service. All based on children’s books, the hourlong musicals include
extras like author interviews and how-to-dance videos. The service’s
first title, “[Chicken
Dance](https://artspowerondemand.teachable.com/courses),” adapts Danny
Schnitzlein’s comic barnyard
tale.  
[*artspowerondemand.teachable.com*](https://artspowerondemand.teachable.com/)

**Beat by Beat Press:** This theater publisher has created two musicals
for ages 7 to 14 that camps, schools and youth groups can rehearse and
present virtually. After buying a license ($149.50 until Sept. 1, but
organizations with low funds can pay less), the group downloads scripts,
recorded accompaniment and other materials. Actors individually record
and upload their numbers, which, when viewed successively, coalesce into
a show. The choices: “[The Show Must Go
Online\!](http://www.bbbpress.com/musicals/the-show-must-go-online/)” or
“[Super Happy Awesome
News\!](http://www.bbbpress.com/musicals/super-happy-awesome-news/)”  
[*bbbpress.com*](http://www.bbbpress.com/)

**Chicago Children’s Theater:**
[CCTv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClI9nwq0sLwmxnSC8xvN9lw), this
troupe’s YouTube channel, just made its debut with “[Frederick, A
Virtual Puppet
Performance](https://chicagochildrenstheatre.org/performance/frederick-puppet).”
An adaptation of [Leo Lionni’s picture
book](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/books/frederick-by-leo-lionni/)
about field mice, it features a surprising narrator: the actor Michael
Shannon. On Saturday the theater’s [Boing\!
festival](https://chicagochildrenstheatre.org/boing-2020/) will include
the premiere of “Doll Face Has a Party\!,” based on the picture book
written by Pam Conrad and illustrated by Brian Selznick.

**Funikijam World Music:** Offering classes and shows that introduce
children 9 and under to a variety of global cultures, the company has
presented its menu in a virtual format. In its Totally Awesome Summer
program, families can find music videos, online activities, excerpts
from recorded performances and [many free
classes](https://www.funikijam.com/find-a-class).  
[*funikijam.com*](https://www.funikijam.com/)

**The New Victory Theater:** Normally the home of international
productions, the theater has devised [New Victory Arts
Break](https://newvictory.org/stories/category/family-engagement/new-victory-arts-break/),
a free weekly series of activities to do from Monday to Friday. Each
package — they’re all on the website — has a theme, like songwriting or
tap dance. [This week’s
edition](https://www.newvictory.org/stories/new-victory-arts-break-juneteenth/)
honors Juneteenth with songs, readings, history and drama.  
[*newvictory.org*](https://newvictory.org/)

**The Paper Bag Players:** The troupe that makes stories out of
cardboard and paper teaches small children to do the same. Its webpage
[Activities for Kids at
Home](https://thepaperbagplayers.org/activities-for-kids-at-home/)features
weekly video installments with clips from past performances and projects
like how to [turn a box into a
car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34&v=yR1Q1pVj6pc&feature=emb_title).

**TheaterWorksUSA:** This national company offers [TheaterWorks
Anywhere](https://twusa.org/shows-artists/on-tour/anywhere/), a webpage
with free activities, behind-the-scenes information and video clips of
musical adaptations of books like “Charlotte’s Web” and “[Dog Man: The
Musical](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/theater/review-dog-man-the-musical.html).”
(Monthly subscriptions, starting at $5, provide access to more content.)
It recently introduced
[TheaterWorksUSAcademy](https://twusa.org/academy/), a fee-based program
of skill lessons and master classes, including a [DIY: Family Musicals\!
course](https://twusa.org/academy/diy-family-musicals/) that begins on
Saturday.  
[*twusa.org*](https://twusa.org/)

**Trusty Sidekick:** Children can view free videos of nine of [the
troupe’s shows](https://www.trustysidekick.org/the-shows), a smorgasbord
for different ages, on its website through June. But [Sidekick
Studio](https://www.trustysidekick.org/studio), its series of
mini-classes, will remain online all summer. So will a video of the
company’s latest experiment, “[The Planetary Discovery
Census](https://www.trustysidekick.org/planetarycensus-view),” an
intergalactic adventure featuring cast members and the audience
interacting on Zoom.
