Unclear policies, confusing customer-service protocols and
not-yet-fulfilled refunds continue to be an issue. Our columnist sees
what she can do.

I've received thousands of emails from Times readers since the
coronavirus put the brakes on travel in mid-March. And if there's one
thing that's obvious, it's that the aftershocks of canceled trips
persist. Unclear policies, confusing customer-service protocols and
not-yet-fulfilled refunds continue to be an issue --- months later, and
even as the world reopens.

This week, I dipped into my email inbox, grab-bag style, for three
questions to tackle in brief. Have your own? Ask me at
\href{mailto:travel@nytimes.com}{\nolinkurl{travel@nytimes.com}}.

\hypertarget{dear-tripped-up}{%

In early February, I used Orbitz to book a round-trip Qantas Airways
flight from San Francisco to Melbourne, scheduled to depart in April.
The flight was canceled. Who should one lobby for refunds in this case:
the online travel agency or the airline? Meredith

\hypertarget{hi-meredith}{%
\subsubsection{Hi Meredith,}\label{hi-meredith}}

I've gotten a lot of questions about this issue. Many readers report
being herded like cattle from an online travel agency to an airline, and
back --- then around again.

Always start with the company that sold you the ticket. O.T.A.s like
Orbitz can change most reservations (save for certain types on some
low-cost carriers), so you're well within reason to let the customer
service representative do your bidding with the airline.

I've
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/travel/trip-refund-airlines.html}{said
it before} and I'll say it again: When a flight to, from or within the
United States is canceled because of the pandemic, you're entitled to a
cash refund. And if you're not getting that as an initial option from
sites like Orbitz, it's because they can only process refunds after
they've been granted that right by the end provider; here, the airline.
That's why
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/travel/coronavirus-refund-travel-ota.html?smtyp=cur\&smid=tw-nytimestravelhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/travel/coronavirus-refund-travel-ota.html}{getting
refunds from}O.T.A.s can be complicated, especially during this global
crisis. These agencies are squished between an unprecedented number of
consumer requests and airlines that stall or stonewall --- or perhaps
never pick up the phone. If you're hitting roadblocks like these, ask
that your case be escalated (Orbitz and other O.T.A.s have a hierarchy
of urgency). Don't be shy about following up.

That persistence seemed to work for you, even without my help: By the
time I emailed Orbitz, a spokeswoman confirmed that the refund was
already in process. Yes, it's now June, and although call volumes in
March and April have leveled off for most agencies by now, the current
environment is still far from normal --- patience is key.

I have a flight to France coming up next month. Delta rebooked me on a
different flight on my original departure date, which seemed fine --- I
understand flexibility is key nowadays. But when I hopped online to
double-check my options, I didn't see the new flight on Delta's
schedule. In fact, it didn't appear until a few days later. What's the
story? Sabine

\hypertarget{hi-sabine}{%
\subsubsection{Hi Sabine,}\label{hi-sabine}}

Although airline technology has improved in recent years, the pandemic
has placed extraordinary stress on the system.

Even as the world begins to open up, flight schedules will be slimmer
than normal this summer. Delta, like all airlines, has been compressing
its schedule into fewer flights, so it's possible that the flight you
were rebooked on was kept ``off-sale'' to give already-booked passengers
dibs before being made available to new passengers. It's also possible
that the new flight was full for a period of time, during which time it
wasn't appearing for sale online.

There are complexities to publishing and adjusting airline schedules,
for sure, but there is one upside to a system that's so in flux: mistake
fares, or bargain-basement price glitches, that eagle-eyed consumers can
score before they're corrected. There are several websites that comb for
these deals, including \href{https://www.secretflying.com/}{Secret
Flying,} \href{https://scottscheapflights.com/}{Scott's Cheap Flights}
and \href{https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/}{Airfarewatchdog.}

I paid a \$125 ``miles redeposit fee'' when I canceled my United
Airlines reward flight a couple of months ago. How can I get that money
back? Jen

\hypertarget{hi-jen}{%
\subsubsection{Hi Jen,}\label{hi-jen}}

Save for the famously flexible Southwest, most airlines have long
imposed some sort of fee --- usually between \$75 and \$150 --- when
passengers change or cancel tickets booked with miles. These so-called
``restocking fees'' tend to lessen or disappear with elite status.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

Although commonplace in normal times, these fees felt particularly
out-of-step at the start of the pandemic. Facing increased pressure in
March, many carriers waived them; United took a bit longer than some
others to reverse its policy but eventually fell in line. On June 1, the
airline announced that it will continue to waive redeposit fees on all
award tickets with 2020 departure dates.

Refunds and waivers
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/travel/coronavirus-travel-trip-refunds.html}{have
been a moving target} since the pandemic started, and if you got
ensnared in an unfavorable policy before it changed for the better, you
have plenty of company. If you're committed to getting that restocking
fee reversed, your best bet is to call the airline --- a United
spokeswoman wouldn't commit to this as an across-the-board option, but
she said the company will address the issue on a case-by-case basis.
