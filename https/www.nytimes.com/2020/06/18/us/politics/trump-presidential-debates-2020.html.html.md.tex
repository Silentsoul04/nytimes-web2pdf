The Trump team wants one more debate than is typically held in the
general election, and argued that they should start earlier because the
coronavirus may prompt an increase in early voting.

Top aides to President Trump tried on Thursday to negotiate with the
commission overseeing presidential debates to increase the number of
times that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-coronavirus.html}{Mr.
Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.} face off in the
fall.

The Trump camp pushed for four debates, one more than is typically held
in the general election, and argued that they should start earlier
because there may be an increase in early voting as people struggle with
fears of the coronavirus in crowded places, according to a person
briefed on the meeting. Traditionally, the first debate is held in
September, after the nominating conventions. Mr. Trump's advisers want
them to begin soon after Labor Day.

The online meeting featured Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal
lawyer; his campaign manager, Brad Parscale; and another senior campaign
official, Michael Glassner. They met with Frank Fahrenkopf, the
co-founder and co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates,
said the person briefed on the meeting, who was not authorized to speak
publicly.

Mr. Giuliani, who advised the Trump campaign in 2016, also proposed that
both campaigns get to recommend a set number of moderators, and that
they each get to strike some of them from the other person's list before
they reach an agreement, the person said.

Mr. Giuliani did not respond to a message seeking comment.

In a statement, Mr. Parscale said: ``We want fair debates. We want them
sooner and we want a bigger schedule. We also don't want them up against
football games competing for viewers. As many Americans as possible need
to see the stark differences between the accomplishments and leadership
of President Trump and the failed record and sleepiness of Joe Biden.''

Kate Bedingfield, the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, accused Mr.
Trump of trying to ``change the subject'' now that he is down in the
polls.

``But there's a catch: He'll only do it if he can pick the moderators,''
she said. ``We are not going to ride the roller coaster of the
ever-changing Trump campaign position on debates, nor are we going to be
distracted by his demands.''

She said the Biden campaign would follow the rules and guidance set up
by the commission, ``so long as Donald Trump does the same, and does not
intimidate the commission into changes from past practices.''

The Trump campaign's posture marks a departure from what the president's
advisers were discussing last year. Back then, as the Democratic primary
season was intensifying, Mr. Trump's advisers discussed whether the
president would even take part in debates sponsored by the commission.

But since then, the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and a global
recession, combined with the Trump administration's failures responding
to the virus, have changed Mr. Trump's standing in the race.

In all recent national surveys and many state surveys, Mr. Trump trails
Mr. Biden. A
\href{https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3664}{new
national poll} from Quinnipiac University on Thursday showed Mr. Biden
with an advantage of eight percentage points, and a new
\href{https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-biden-widens-lead-over-trump-republicans-enthusiastic-but-fear-motivates-dems}{Fox
News national poll} put Mr. Biden up by 12 points.
