Protests and boycotts are the talk of the day as Indians grapple with
the deaths of 20 soldiers in chaotic clashes with Chinese troops.

NEW DELHI --- An Indian government minister has called for Chinese
restaurants to be closed. Other Indian officials have suddenly put
contracts to Chinese companies under review. And crowds of men are now
smashing Chinese-made televisions in the street.

A wave of anti-Chinese anger is cresting across
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html}{India}
as the nation struggles to absorb the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/indian-china-border-clash.html}{loss
of 20 Indian soldiers beaten to death} this week by Chinese troops in a
high-altitude brawl along India's disputed border with China.

``We should bleed
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html}{China}
with a thousand cuts,'' said Ranjit Singh, a retired army major who is
calling for a boycott of Chinese goods. ``We need to hit them where it
hurts most, and that is economically.''

And the tensions are hardly easing. Sonam Joldan, a teacher in the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/world/asia/india-china-border-ladakh.html}{Ladakh
region} near the India-China border, reported on Thursday seeing a line
of 100 Indian Army trucks heading toward the front line, wending its way
up the Himalayan mountains ``like a caravan of ants.''

How did he feel watching the forces go by?

``Patriotic, of course,'' Mr. Joldan said. ``India can't watch the
Chinese aggression go on forever. They have to be stopped at some
point.''

The killing of the Indian soldiers, he said, was unforgivable.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/18/world/18india2/merlin_173657220_ef4ac6fd-5356-44e0-96dc-9359b750a66f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Indian and Chinese generals continued to meet on Thursday to discuss
de-escalation at the border high up in the Himalayas where the brawl
erupted, officials said. But military analysts and satellite imagery
indicated that Chinese troops had yet to pull back.

By some accounts, in recent weeks they have taken about 23 square miles
of territory claimed by India and show no signs of leaving.

Western intelligence officials said that India would not accept this and
that the chances of more fighting remained high, especially with
thousands of opposing troops eyeball-to-eyeball along a remote front
line that has erupted in violence several times, including
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/india-china-border-clashes.html}{a
major war between India and China in 1962}.

Troops from both sides have been instructed not to use firearms during
faceoffs along the border, but that did not stop a vicious hand-to-hand
battle from raging for several hours Monday night. One Indian military
analyst posted a picture on Twitter of
\href{https://twitter.com/ajaishukla/status/1273478468919951361}{steel
clubs studded with nails} that he said had been used by the Chinese
troops.

On Thursday, several of the Indian soldiers killed were given last
rites, including Col. Bikkumalla Santosh Babu, whose body was driven
through the streets of Suryapet, in central India, in an army truck
draped with marigolds. As the cortege passed, people stood on their
balconies, stiff right hands to their temples in a final salute.

Some officers in India's army now want to change the rules of engagement
along the border and abandon the de facto code that calls for neither
side to use guns during confrontations. Military analysts worry that
doing so could set off an arms race that would turn the frequent
faceoffs and fistfights between opposing border patrols into much
deadlier events.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to walk a fine line. Although he
seems reluctant to escalate a major conflict with China --- which has a
mightier military --- much of his political brand has been tied up in
projecting an image of a forceful, increasingly powerful India, and he
has signaled that he will not back down.

``India wants peace,'' he said in a televised address on Wednesday.
``But if provoked, India is capable of giving a befitting reply.''

Whenever he has been in a pinch, Mr. Modi has been able to count on a
wave of Indian nationalism. Such sentiment helped in the early stage of
the coronavirus pandemic when he asked India's entire population of 1.3
billion to stay indoors for the sake of the nation and
\href{https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/in-lockdown-delhi-is-frozen-in-fear-and-the-present-tense/articleshow/75512122.cms}{many
diligently obeyed}.

And last year, when Indian paramilitary forces were attacked in a
suicide bombing linked to a terrorist group in Pakistan, Mr. Modi
ordered airstrikes on Pakistan. The brinkmanship set off a jolt of
jingoism that, a few months later, helped propel him to a crushing
re-election victory.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

But he and his generals know that China's power eclipses Pakistan's. So
India's emerging strategy to contain China involves a broader mix of
tactics, including economic and diplomatic ones.

On Thursday, the Indian Express, one of the nation's leading newspapers,
\href{https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/border-dispute-chinese-firms-india-business-railways-telecom-6464148/}{reported
that} India's government was preparing to cancel a huge railway contract
that had been given to a Chinese company.

That may be just the beginning.

\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0Di0zLHFk}{Protests have broken
out} across India to boycott Chinese goods, a move that will not be
easy. The phones in most Indians' hands are made in China, as are
countless other products. India-China trade has grown enormously, from
\$3 billion in 2000 to more than \$95 billion in 2018. And as of last
year, a trade deficit between the two nations had reached
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/world/asia/narendra-modi-xi-jinping-india-china.html}{nearly
\$60 billion in China's favor}.

Mr. Modi can count on
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/asia/modi-india-press-media.html}{a
friendly media landscape}, especially when it comes to national security
issues.

Last week, before the deadly clash, Indian media outlets carried
articles saying that all was well on the Himalayan border, which was
what the Indian generals had been telling them. Now, Indian outlets are
running instructions on how to remove Chinese-made apps like TikTok from
mobile phones.

``We can break China's backbone economically,'' Mr. Singh, the retired
army major, said in a recorded message he sent to residents in his
neighborhood. ``Shun Chinese goods. If you have any lying in your house,
please throw them out.''

``Take pictures of items thrown on the roads,'' the message said. ``Let
them become viral --- let them reach China and tell them this is what we
think of them.''
