## Brazil passes one million cases after reporting a one-day total of more than 54,000.

Brazil on Friday became the second country to pass one million
coronavirus cases, recording a staggering 54,771 cases in the past 24
hours — an increase the country’s Health Ministry attributed at least in
part to a lag in reporting from three states. The United States has
reported more than 2.2 million cases.

More than 48,954 people in Brazil have died of Covid-19, second only to
the total in the United States, according to [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/americas/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html).
If the trend lines hold, some epidemiologists project the death toll of
the epidemic in Brazil could surpass that in the United States by late
July. Latin America has become an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic
in recent weeks,[largely because of Brazil’s ballooning
caseload](https://www.nytimes.com/article/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

About half of Friday’s increase was due to delayed reporting in three
states, including São Paulo, health officials said.

The country’s response to the crisis has been widely criticized at home
and abroad. President Jair Bolsonaro has [dismissed the
danger](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus.html)
posed by the virus, [sabotaged quarantine
measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/world/americas/virus-brazil-deaths.html)
adopted at the state level and called on Brazilians to continue working
to keep the economy from collapsing.

In early June, Brazil’s government [removed numbers on coronavirus cases
and deaths from the Health Ministry’s
website](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/world/coronavirus-update-us-usa.html#link-3cfab740),
claiming without evidence that state officials had been reporting
inflated figures to secure more federal funding. The numbers were later
brought back after a Supreme Court justice ordered the government to
stop suppressing the data.

As the country reached the one million case mark, the government was
distracted by other political crises. An associate of Mr. Bolsonaro’s
son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, was arrested on Thursday in connection
with a [corruption
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/18/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-corruption-probe.html).
The president was also [forced to fire his minister of
education](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/18/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-cabinet-minister-resigns.html)
on Thursday, who is being investigated for threats and insults against
Supreme Court justices.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hours before the new case numbers were announced on Friday, the Ministry
of Health presented a [new
plan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/ministerio-da-saude-divulga-orientacoes-para-retomada-segura-de-atividades-saiba-quais.shtml?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=twfolha)
with guidelines on how local officials could safely resume activities in
cities and states. The plan, however, wasn’t coordinated with local
officials.

As several states repeatedly set record daily highs for new coronavirus
cases this week, their officials aimed to subdue alarm while doubling
down on calls for greater vigilance, mask-wearing and social distancing.

Florida, among the hardest hit states, [reported 3,822 new cases on
Friday](https://fdoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8d0de33f260d444c852a615dc7837c86),
beating the single-day record it set the previous day, and bringing its
total of cases close to 90,000. A total of 3,104 people have died.

South Carolina also reported on Friday [a record of 1,081 new daily
cases](https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/sc-testing-data-projections-covid-19).
It was the seventh time in 11 days that the state broke its single-day
case record, and the state epidemiologist on Thursday pleaded with
residents to wear masks and practice social distancing.

“We understand that what we’re continuing to ask of everyone is not easy
and that many are tired of hearing the same warnings and of taking the
same daily precautions,” Dr. Linda Bell, the epidemiologist, said in a
statement. “Every day that we don’t all do our part, we are extending
the duration of illnesses, missed work, hospitalizations and deaths in
our
state.”

also recorded a new single-day high, reporting 3,183 new coronavirus
cases, breaking a record set the day before.

The recent spikes come as policymakers across the United States are
struggling to find a precarious balance between reopening their battered
economies and keeping future outbreaks at bay.

This week, outbreaks have been growing [in much of the South and
West.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html)Officials
in Oklahoma and California also reported their highest daily case
numbers on Thursday. And Texas became the sixth state in the nation to
surpass 100,000 cases, according to[a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html).
Cases there have doubled over the past month.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, sought to allay
concerns about the spike in cases. He attributed the rise to an increase
of infections among people under 40, many of whom, he stressed, were
asymptomatic and less likely to put a strain on hospitals. The majority
of deaths in the state were among residents 65 and older, and were
centered at long-term care facilities, where Mr. DeSantis said the
number of cases was declining.

He said an increase in testing across the state had also contributed to
the rise, even as he cautioned that there had been an “erosion of social
distancing among the younger population.” “As you test more, you find
more,” he said.

[The Trump administration has made a misleading
claim](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/politics/pence-coronavirus-governors.html)
that the recent jumps are a result of more aggressive testing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But public health officials point to the easing of restrictions at
businesses such as bars and restaurants, and a lack of social distancing
among many beachgoers, among other factors, to help explain the rise.
Some businesses in the state have had to reclose after employees fell
ill. Apple on Friday said it was temporarily closing 11 retail stores
across four states — Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Arizona
— amid the surge in infections.

Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and
an influential policy maker within the central bank system, cited the
rising caseloads in South Carolina and Florida as he warned of the
economic impact of states’ reopening before the virus is under control.

Mr. Rosengren said that because of the virus’s continued spread “and the
acceleration of new cases in many states, I expect the economic rebound
in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the
outset of the
pandemic.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The World Health Organization issued a dire warning on Friday that the
coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, and noted that Thursday was a
record day for new cases — more than 150,000 globally.

“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O. “Many people are
understandably fed up with being at home. Countries are understandably
eager to open up their societies and their economies. But the virus is
still spreading fast. It is still deadly, and most people are still
susceptible.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If the outbreak was defined early on by a series of shifting epicenters
— including Wuhan, China; Iran; northern Italy; Spain; and New York —
it is now defined by its wide and expanding scope. According to a Times
database, [81 nations have seen a growth in new
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
over the past two weeks, while only 36 have seen declines.

Dr. Tedros said that almost half of the new cases reported on Thursday
came from the Americas. Large numbers are also being reported from
Africa, South Asia and the Middle East.

Dr. Tedros urged individuals to continue to maintain distance from
others, to cover their noses and mouths with masks when appropriate and
to wash their hands. He said nations must continue to find, isolate,
test and care for every person infected with the virus, and to test and
quarantine every contact. “We call on all countries to exercise extreme
vigilance,” he said.

But risks are multiplying as nations begin to reopen their economies.

In India, which initially placed all 1.3 billion of its citizens under a
lockdown — then [moved to
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/world/asia/reopening-before-coronavirus-ends.html)
even with its public health system near the breaking point — officials
reported a record number of new cases Wednesday. And the virus is now
spreading rapidly in nearby Pakistan and Bangladesh as well.

It took Africa nearly 100 days to reach 100,000 cases, [the W.H.O. has
noted,](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200617-covid-19-sitrep-149.pdf?sfvrsn=3b3137b0_4)
but only 19 days to double that tally. South Africa now averages a
thousand more new cases each day than it did two weeks ago.

And some countries where caseloads had appeared to taper — including
Israel, Sweden and Costa Rica — are watching them rise again. Costa
Rica’s health minister said Friday that the country was [halting
reopening its
economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-costa-rica/costa-rica-halts-reopening-as-coronavirus-infections-keep-rising-idUSKBN23Q37L)because
of the increase in
cases.

decision of whether to require masks is growing increasingly
contentious, with some viewing the requirements as an essential safety
measure while others call them an infringement on personal
liberty.

The chief executive of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Adam Aron, drew a
swift backlash on Thursday after he said that moviegoers would not be
required to wear masks at the company’s theaters when they reopen next
month. He said that AMC “did not want to be drawn into a political
controversy.”

“We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on
those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary,” Mr. Aron
said in [an interview published Thursday by Variety
magazine](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-coronavirus-movie-theaters-covid-19-1234642047/).

AMC [reversed
itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/AMC-theaters-masks-coronavirus.html)
on Friday, saying it had consulted with scientific advisers and would
require masks in theaters nationwide when it reopens on July 15.

“This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our
customers, and it is clear from this response that we did not go far
enough on the usage of masks,” the company said in a statement.

Alamo Drafthouse Cinema also said on Friday that it would require face
masks in its theaters.

Similar tensions are playing out nationwide, even as cases surge in
several states.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, where there has been a surge, on
Thursday ordered people to wear face masks in most indoor — and some
outdoor — public settings.

And Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, caving to pressure from
rising case counts and local officials, allowed towns and counties to
decide for themselves whether to make face masks mandatory. Previously,
municipalities there were forbidden to introduce more restrictive rules.

In Texas, a Dallas County executive issued an order saying that all
residents over the age of 10 [“shall
wear”](https://www.dallascounty.org/Assets/uploads/docs/covid-19/orders-media/061920-Amended-SupplementalOrderonContinuingRequirements.pdf)
face coverings in public when social distancing is not possible,
effective immediately and lasting until at least August 4th. The orders
extended to businesses, requiring employees and customers to wear masks
or face a fine of up to $500. Residents will not be required to wear
masks if they are exercising outdoors or pumping gas.

The order came after Texas reported more than 4,600 new cases Friday,
hitting a new single-day high for the second day in a row, according to
[a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html).

Rest assured, France’s culture minister says: The kiss has not been
banished from movies.

Franck Riester, the minister, said on Friday that as movie and
television shoots in France slowly started up again after months of
lockdown, actors were working out ways of safely smooching again.

“Kissing has started again, if I may say so, on movie sets,” Mr.
Riester[told RTL radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dX3iuNs1u8),
although he did not refer to any specific films or actors. “Some artists
got tested, waited a bit, and then did that kiss that is so important in
cinema.”

Last month, the body that oversees health and hygiene conditions on
French film sets issued
a[guide](http://www.cchscinema.org/covid-19-guide-des-preconisations-de-securite-sanitaire-pour-les-activites-de-la-production-audiovisuelle-cinematographique-et-publicitaire/#)
on how to keep the virus at bay, including measures for scenes that
require physical intimacy.

Those included adapting or rewriting the action, postponing filming, or
asking actors to get tested or regularly take their temperature. Wearing
masks was also recommended, camera angles permitting.

The government has created a 50-million-euro guarantee fund to help
producers who are forced to cancel a film shoot for coronavirus-related
reasons, but some worry that insurers will balk at the slightest
deviation from the guidelines.

Marina Foïs, an actress,[expressed
frustration](https://www.voici.fr/news-people/actu-people/marina-fois-pourquoi-elle-trouve-ridicule-les-nouvelles-mesures-imposees-sur-les-tournages-682223)
on French television last week that “insurances are going to have an
opinion on how we make a movie” and said she would find it hard to
follow social distancing guidelines with her co-stars while filming.

“If I want to act well, I need to abandon something, I need to let
happen what will happen,” she told France 5.

Movie theaters are one of the few businesses still closed around France.
They are scheduled to open next week, but will only be allowed to fill
up half of their seats, with distancing between viewers. Masks will be
recommended, but not required, though individual theaters may set their
own
rules.

People [lined up outside an
arena](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007199618/trump-tulsa-rally-supporters-coronavirus.html)
in Tulsa, Okla., in anticipation of President Trump’s campaign rally on
Saturday, his first since the pandemic began. But health officials
braced for the possibility that the event could further spread the virus
in a state that has seen a surge in new cases.

A lawsuit filed by local residents and businesses to stop Mr. Trump from
holding the rally because of the risks of spreading the virus was
rejected on Friday afternoon by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The lawsuit
had demanded that the event be postponed unless the BOK Center, the
19,000-seat arena where the rally is to be held, agreed to enforce
certain social distancing guidelines.

The court said that because Oklahoma’s reopening plan, put in place on
June 1, allowed businesses to use their discretion when instituting
social distancing measures, such restrictions were not mandatory.

At the same time, city officials rescinded a three-night curfew, after
Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had spoken with the mayor, “who
informed me there will be no curfew tonight or tomorrow for our many
supporters” — a chaotic about-face from the previous plans.

Local health officials have warned that Mr. Trump’s rally has the
potential to become a “super spreader” event. Tulsa’s police chief,
Wendell Franklin, said this week that his department was planning for “a
mass amount of people that probably Tulsa has never seen before.”

The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said this week that
attendees would be given face masks, but that using them would be
optional. Mr. Trump has eschewed masks in public, and Ms. McEnany said
on Friday that she would not wear one at the rally.

The state has recorded more than 9,700 confirmed cases. With about 245
cases per 100,000 people, the state’s per capita total ranks in the
bottom 20 percent of the country. But the Oklahoma State Department of
Health reported 352 additional cases on Friday, [its second-highest

As many as 300,000 employees are expected to return to their jobs next
week as office work, in-store retail, outdoor dining and [several other
sectors of the city’s
economy](https://www.nytimes.com/article/new-york-phase-reopening.html)
restart with limits. Apple said this week it was going to reopen 10
stores in the city “by appointment” for customers to pick up purchases
or for repairs.

The shift in phases will be a major test for a dense city where people
have already been gathering in crowds outside bars, in parks and other
public places.

Asked at his daily news briefing on Friday exactly how much activity he
would deem safe, Mayor Bill de Blasio put the onus on New Yorkers to
decide for themselves.

“This is a very personal decision that people need to make, and I’d say
to anyone who feels cautious or uncomfortable, listen to that — and less
is more, right?” Mr. de Blasio said. “We are going through stages —
we’re feeling our way.”

A short time later, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ended his run of [more than 100
consecutive daily news
conferences](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/insider/andrew-cuomo-briefings.html),
with an address from his office. After confirming that New York City
would ease more restrictions on Monday, he presented a montage of New
Yorkers during the crisis that featured his own narration.

During his address, Mr. Cuomo warned that “Covid isn’t over” — there
were 25 additional deaths reported statewide — and said more work was
needed to contain it. But he also struck a reflective and celebratory
tone, citing continued low levels of virus-related infections,
hospitalizations and deaths.

“I’m so incredibly proud of what we all did together, and as a
community,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We reopened the economy and we saved
lives.”

Italian scientists on Friday said they found traces of the virus in
samples of sewage water collected in December, further suggesting that
the virus was already circulating in the country months before [the
outbreak at the end of
February](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html).

Researchers at the Italian National Institute of Health discovered the
presence of the RNA of the virus in samples taken in the northern cities
of Milan and Turin on Dec. 18, more than two months before the country’s
first case was diagnosed on Feb 20. Traces were also found in samples
from the city of Bologna, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of
Milan, on Jan. 29.

“We showed that the virus was already circulating,” said Lucia
Bonadonna, an official at the institute. “Probably in asymptomatic or
little-symptomatic forms before we had our first local case.”

While the new findings shift the virus’s timeline earlier in Europe,
they do not significantly change the pandemic’s known timeline. Chinese
officials reported the outbreak in Wuhan on Dec. 31, but later traced
cases that emerged as far back as Dec. 1.

Italian scientists and officials have long suspected that the virus had
moved undetected in the northern region of Lombardy, an economic hub
where there is frequent trade with China, at least weeks before the
contagion came to light.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Similar evidence has recently emerged around the world, indicating that
by the time the authorities were aware of an outbreak, the virus was
already more widespread than initially believed.

In France, [a sample taken from a patient on Dec. 27 tested
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/world/europe/france-coronavirus-timeline.html)
last month. And in California, health officials discovered [a

Feb. 6](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/santa-clara-county-coronavirus-death.html),
weeks before the earliest recorded case of U.S. community transmission.

    Mr. Abe’s government is also in discussions to ease international
    travel bans for passengers arriving from Australia, New Zealand,
    Thailand and Vietnam.

  - **Britain** reduced its Covid-19 alert level to three from four. At

England’s top golfer, Tommy Fleetwood, was ranked 10th in the world when
the PGA Tour suspended its schedule in March. But when[tour play resumed
last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/sports/golf/pga-tour-charles-schwab.html),
he was on the wrong side of the Atlantic.

In its haste to return, the tour, which has a playing membership that
spans the globe, set up things up so that any player not based in the
United States was effectively out of bounds. For Fleetwood in northwest
England, the hazards were many, including a two-way quarantine, the
possibility of catching the virus from a fellow passenger on a
trans-Atlantic flight, and a monthslong separation from his wife, Clare;
their 2-year-old son, Franklin; and his stepsons, Oscar, 13, and Mo, 12.

“If I was living in America,” Fleetwood said, “I’d be playing right
now.”

Golf is not the only sport that has forged ahead without the full
support of its competitive membership. This week’s decision by the

Health experts worry that in the race to find drugs and vaccines, a
substantial proportion of studies may be excluding older subjects,
purposely or inadvertently, even as 80 percent of American deaths have
occurred in people over age 65.

“A year from now, when these trials are published, I don’t want to see
that there’s no one in them over 75,” said Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, a
geriatrician at Harvard Medical School and Hebrew SeniorLife. “If they
create a drug that works really well in healthy 50- and 60-year-olds,
they’ve missed the boat.”

She and her team have reviewed 241 interventional Covid-19 studies that
have been undertaken in the United States and are listed on
clinicaltrials.gov, a site maintained by a division of the National
Institutes of Health.

They found that 37 of these trials — which test drugs, vaccines and
devices — set specific age limits and would not enroll participants
older than 75, 80 or 85. A few even excluded those over 65.

Another group of 27 trials set no maximum age but used study designs
that could nevertheless disqualify many older adults. Some excluded
people with illnesses common among the older population, like
hypertension or diabetes, even if participants controlled the disease
through medication. “Surrogates for age exclusion,” Dr. Inouye said.

There is a long history of older people being excluded from clinical
trials, even when the diseases in question disproportionately affected
this group.

“Ideally, the patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial reflect

“Unfortunately, this is seldom the

Genetic analysis of the coronavirus spreading in Beijing indicates that
it has recent roots in Europe, Chinese government scientists have told
the World Health Organization.

That is a strong suggestion that “the disease was probably imported from
outside Beijing at some point,” though not that Europe was the origin of
the new outbreak, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the health
emergency services program at the W.H.O., said on
Friday.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Chinese researchers have posted the genomic sequence to online databases
for further analysis, Dr. Ryan said.

Officials have been [racing to explain and contain the new outbreak in
the Chinese
capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/coronavirus-beijing-china.html),
a cluster of more than 180 infections at the vast Xinfadi wholesale
market that emerged after 56 days of no new locally-transmitted cases.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There has been no wholesale lockdown, but the city’s schools have been
shut and strict limitations imposed in high-risk neighborhoods. On
Thursday, thousands of restaurant workers lined up around the city to
get tested.

Travelers are being required to show proof of a negative nucleic acid
test taken within seven days of boarding planes or trains out of
Beijing, and the wait-list at some hospitals stretches into September,
according to
[Caixin](http://china.caixin.com/2020-06-18/101568962.html?cxw=IOS&Sfrom=Wechat&originReferrer=iOSshare),
a Chinese investigative news outlet.

The health authorities also released new guidelines urging the public to
prevent “splash contamination” by not rinsing raw meat or seafood
directly under the tap.

Chinese officials had initially pointed to imported [salmon as a
possible
source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/world/asia/coronavirus-china-salmon.html)
of the new cluster, an idea that echoed some Chinese suggestions early
in the pandemic that the virus itself may have originated elsewhere. But
Dr. Ryan of the W.H.O. said there was no sign that fish had transmitted
the virus in Beijing.

However, a top Chinese epidemiologist made another kind of link to
seafood.

Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, told reporters on Thursday that seafood vendors
at the Xinfadi market had suffered the most infections and showed
symptoms earlier than those who sold beef and lamb.

He suggested that low temperatures and high humidity in the seafood and
meat areas may have contributed to the virus’s spread, and suggested
that clues to the virus’s emergence might be found in the proximity of
fish and meat stalls — true of both the Xinfadi market and the market in
the city of Wuhan, where the initial outbreak was
identified.

[*In the latest edition of The Australia
Letter*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/world/australia/coronavirus-new-normal.html)*,
a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau, our reporter* [*Livia
Albeck-Ripka*](https://www.nytimes.com/by/livia-albeck-ripka) *explains
what it’s like to “tiptoe out into the world” after an outbreak.*

Earlier this month, I was standing among thousands of people as I
[reported on a Black Lives Matter protest in
Melbourne](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/world/george-floyd-global-protests.html),
wondering if I was too close to them.

One person near me was without a face covering, another kept shuffling
closer, and a third — her surgical mask pulled down below her chin — was
yelling in my direction. That was 13 days ago, one day short of the
standard coronavirus incubation period.

But I’m fine. I think. And maybe that odd and unsettling feeling is just
what this phase of the pandemic feels like for all of us — not quite
panic-stricken, not quite normal.

We’ve seen upticks in cases of the virus in some places but others
escaped relatively unscathed, and no one seems to be able to tell us
exactly why. At the same time, countries where the pandemic’s curve had
appeared flattened are now seeing rises in case numbers.

Australia’s Victoria State, where at least three protesters have
contracted the virus, on Wednesday recorded [its largest single-day
increase in infections in over a
month](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-17/coronavirus-cases-in-victoria-rise-by-21/12362782).

What’s now clear is that there’s a cost in returning to normal, and that
in some cases, we might only be a misstep or two away from another
surge.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So as we tiptoe out into the world, how much risk should we take?

Some of us operate on the assumption that if they follow regulations,
they will be fine. Others feel [frustrated by the
inconsistencies](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/06/12/scott-morrisons-double-standards-on-protests-make-it-clear-whose-lives-matters-most/)
in official advice, or that rushing back to normal life before a vaccine
is available would be dangerous.

“Everything we’re doing is unknown territory,” said Hassan Vally, an
epidemiologist and senior lecturer in public health at La Trobe
University in Melbourne.

“What we do know,” he added, “is that as a society we can’t survive in
complete lockdown until we get a vaccine: We have to get back to
normal.”

When I got home after the recent protest, I removed my mask carefully. I
scrubbed my hands for 20 seconds. I changed my sweater. I washed my
face. That night, I went out to eat with friends for the first time in
weeks. There were no masks to remind me of the pandemic.

After a beer, and laughing face-to-face with a group for the first time
in weeks, it was even easier to forget. Since then, I’ve begun to feel
my hypervigilance fade even further. I don’t wipe down my door handles
as often, or my phone, and I’m still fine. For
now.

## The Trump Administration, after a backlash, will reveal information about loan recipients.

Bowing to [political

the Trump administration said on Friday evening that it would disclose

[The

the amount of money that they took from the federal government. The
reversal came as Democrats had seized on the secrecy surrounding the
program to suggest that the bailout was an example of the Trump
administration engaging in corporate cronyism.

The new disclosures will apply to loans of more than $150,000. The
information will be broken down into five loan ranges, up to the maximum
amount of $10 million. The Small Business Administration will release
business names, addresses, demographic data and jobs supported.

The Treasury Department, which jointly administers the loan program with
the S.B.A., did not say when the new information would be made public,

applications, which might not be submitted for
months.

All week long, two competing narratives faced off on Wall Street.

Investors were encouraged by signs that business reopenings were having
an immediate positive effect on the economy. But they were troubled by
the growing number of coronavirus infections around the country.

stores in states where cases are spiking. The number of new cases is
increasing in at least 20 states, an analysis[by The Times

Apple’s decision had an instant impact on the market: Shares of
companies that are likely to benefit from a return to normalcy, like
airlines and retailers, immediately gave up their gains. Oil prices also
gave up their early gains.

The push and pull this week has come amid mixed reports on the economy.
A Labor Department report on Thursday showed that another 1.5 million
workers had filed for state unemployment benefits. The pace of layoffs
has slowed in recent weeks [but remains
elevated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html).
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that retail sales [rebounded
sharply](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/may-retail-sales.html)
in May, as stores reopened and governments lifted some restrictions. But
there is growing uncertainty about the economic picture going forward.

Yet despite investors’ general unease, the S\&P 500 was up nearly 2
percent for the
week.

Around the United States, but mostly in small towns in the West,
[hundreds of professional rodeos have been
canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/coronavirus-rodeos.html)
— hard blows to tradition and economies. In many places, the rodeo is
the biggest event on the annual calendar.

Stonyford, Calif., can feel like the middle of nowhere. But it could
always count on a few crowded days every year during its annual rodeo,
when the town’s population swells into the thousands.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Not this year. There was no [77th Stonyford
Rodeo](https://www.stonycreekhorsemen.org/).

Some rodeos, like Stonyford, with $18,000 in prize money, are relatively
small affairs. Others are immense undertakings filled with concerts,
carnivals and livestock shows — and $1 million or more in payouts.

The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, the governing body of about
700 annual rodeos, estimates that about half will not take place in
2020. Those still on the schedule are working with fingers crossed, some
moving dates to buy more time.

“Covid-19 has impacted the entire country, every business you can think
of,” said George Taylor, chief executive of the association. “Our
business is a representation of that, but also represents a loss of
community — something that brings these small towns together.”

Rodeos hold a unique spot in the American sports landscape. They are not
a league, but a loose coalition of community events, usually run by
nonprofit organizations and volunteers.

In late May, when Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming tearfully announced the
cancellation of July’s [Cheyenne Frontier
Days](https://www.cfdrodeo.com/) for the first time in the event’s
124-year history, he was surrounded by representatives of other canceled
Wyoming rodeos. They were socially distanced, wearing masks and cowboy
hats.

The virus kills by filling the lungs with fluid and robbing the body of
oxygen, yet the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority,
a federal health agency known as
[BARDA](https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx),
notified companies and researchers this month that it was [halting
funding for new treatments for this severe form of
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/health/coronavirus-lung-treatment-funding.html),
the disease caused by the virus.

The new policy highlights the Trump administration’s staunch support for
[a potential
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline.html)
as the way to return American society and the economy to normal. [BARDA
has
pledged](https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx)
more than $2.2 billion in deals with five vaccine manufacturers for the
coronavirus, compared with about $359 million toward potential Covid-19
treatments.

The decision to suspend investment in lung treatments blindsided
academic researchers and executives at small biotech companies, who said
they spent months pitching their proposals to BARDA. The change in
policy was posted without fanfare on a government website on June 3, and
was not announced in a statement.

Some clinicians and bioethicists contend that BARDA should continue
supporting research into treatments for lung conditions, while other
experts contend the new policy is a sensible use of limited federal
dollars.

About 95 percent of the patients hospitalized for Covid-19 at Northwell
Health in New York, a system of 23 hospitals at the epicenter of the
region’s epidemic this spring, have developed severe respiratory
distress, said Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, the regional director of critical
care medicine at Northwell.

“You’re going to need other forms of treatments for a lot of those
people, and I feel like that’s where there’s going to be a gaping hole,”
she
said.

## Three pro sports teams shut down facilities in Florida, amid worries over player safety.

Two Major League Baseball clubs, the Philadelphia Phillies and the
Toronto Blue Jays, and a professional hockey team, the Tampa Bay
Lightning, shut down their training facilities in Florida this week,
after several players and staff members tested positive and others
showed symptoms consistent with the virus.

The Phillies said in a statement Friday that five players and three
staff members working at the club’s facility in Clearwater had tested
positive for the virus, first reported by
[NBC](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/phillies/phillies-coronavirus-outbreak-clearwater-players-staff).
The club said eight staff members tested negative and more than 30
others were awaiting results.

The Blue Jays facility, in nearby Dunedin, was closed Thursday after one
of the players appeared to exhibit Covid-19 symptoms, [according to
ESPN](https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1274042733154492418). And
[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/29334802/source-lightning-close-facility-due-coronavirus-outbreak)
and the Canadian network
[TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/tampa-bay-lightning-temporarily-close-training-facilities-due-to-covid-19-1.1487646)
reported that the Lightning shut down a facility after multiple players
and staff tested positive. Both the N.H.L. and M.L.B. are hoping to
start up in late July.

Florida has become[a hub for sports
leagues](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/sports/basketball/nba-disney-world-mls.html)
trying to restart, but the state has seen a [sharp rise in
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/sports/basketball/nba-disney-world-mls.html).
The N.B.A., W.N.B.A., Major League Soccer and others are all attempting
to hold their upcoming seasons there.

The shutdowns on Friday cast a shadow over the return of professional
sports, which this week became a source of friction between Mr. Trump
and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.

Mr. Trump rebuked Dr. Fauci after Dr. Fauci said Thursday
on[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/football-happen-fauci-spt-trnd/index.html)
that the National Football League would need to replicate the kind of
safety “bubble” planned by professional basketball and soccer leagues to
safely resume play.

“Unless players are essentially in a bubble — insulated from the
community and they are tested nearly every day — it would be very hard
to see how football is able to be played this fall,” Dr. Fauci said.

Mr. Trump [wrote on Twitter on

that “Tony Fauci has nothing to do with N.F.L. Football. They are
planning a very safe and controlled opening.”
