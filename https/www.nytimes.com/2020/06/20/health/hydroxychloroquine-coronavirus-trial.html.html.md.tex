The National Institutes of Health decided to stop one trial because the
drug was unlikely to benefit patients, and another because not enough
people enrolled.

The National Institutes of Health said Saturday that it had stopped two
clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug that President
Trump promoted to treat and prevent the coronavirus, one because the
drug was unlikely to be effective and the other because not enough
patients signed up to participate.

The agency halted a trial that had aimed to enroll more than 500
patients after an independent oversight board determined that the drug
did not appear to benefit hospitalized patients. The same day, the
N.I.H. said it had closed another trial --- of hydroxychloroquine and
the antibiotic azithromycin --- because only about 20 patients had
enrolled in the planned study of 2,000 people.

The two trials the N.I.H. shut down represent the latest evidence that
hydroxychloroquine has not lived up to its early promise of fighting the
coronavirus.

\href{https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-halts-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine}{The
N.I.H. said Saturday} that an independent oversight board that monitors
safety met late Friday to discuss the 500-patient trial and ``determined
that while there was no harm, the study drug was very unlikely to be
beneficial to hospitalized patients with Covid-19,'' the disease caused
by the virus.

``In effect, the drug didn't work,'' said Dr. William Schaffner, a
professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
who was not involved in the research. ``I think we can put this drug
aside and now devote our attention to other potential treatments.''

Mr. Trump had called the drug a ``game changer'' and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-coronavirus.html}{took
it himself} in hopes of protecting himself from infection with the
coronavirus. Drugmakers donated millions of doses to the federal
stockpile, which distributed them to hospitals around the country, where
doctors with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/health/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html}{few
other options} administered the drug to severely ill patients.

On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html}{revoked
the emergency authorization} it had granted to hospitals to give
hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, to patients. The
agency said that the drugs were unlikely to be effective and could carry
potential risks.

While the N.I.H. said it did not identify safety concerns as part of its
review of the 500-patient trial, others have concluded that
hydroxychloroquine carries potential risks. This spring, the F.D.A.
issued a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html}{warning
that the drugs could cause dangerous heart arrhythmias in Covid-19
patients.}

The planned trial, which was being run by the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute, a division of the N.I.H., had enrolled more than 470
patients when the study was stopped. The study sought to learn whether
the drug benefited hospitalized patients and those who visited the
emergency room, as well as people who were likely to be admitted to the
hospital. It was one of several placebo-controlled studies that had been
organized to test the drug after a series of small, poorly controlled
trials showed early signs of a benefit.

The other trial that was halted, involving hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin, was testing
\href{https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-begins-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin-treat-covid-19}{whether
the drugs}, given together earlier in the disease, could prevent
hospitalization and death from Covid-19. That study, led by the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an arm of the N.I.H.,
``sought to fill this knowledge gap by testing it in a randomized,
placebo-controlled trial --- considered the gold standard for
determining whether an intervention can benefit patients,''
\href{https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/bulletin-nih-clinical-trial-evaluating-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-covid-19}{the
agency said in a statement}.

The agency said it did not find any safety problems, but concluded that
the recent decision by the F.D.A. to revoke its emergency authorization
of hydroxychloroquine ``could further dampen enthusiasm for enrollment
in studies evaluating these drugs.''

Several other large trials of hydroxychloroquine have been stopped or
have not shown the drug to be effective.

``No surprise,'' said Dr. David R. Boulware, an infectious disease
specialist at the University of Minnesota, who is studying
hydroxychloroquine as a preventive and an early treatment against the
coronavirus. He said the evidence is increasingly clear that the drug
does not work in hospitalized patients. ``Whether there is any benefit
for pre-exposure prophylaxis or early treatment is as yet unknown, but
the role of hydroxychloroquine --- if any --- appears increasingly
doubtful.''

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

On Wednesday, the
\href{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments}{World
Health Organization said} it was stopping the hydroxychloroquine arm of
a large clinical trial that is testing several treatments against the
virus because evidence ---
\href{https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19}{including
results from a large study} in the United Kingdom --- showed it did not
reduce mortality rates of hospitalized patients.

And on Friday, the Swiss drugmaker
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/06/19/world/europe/19reuters-health-coronavirus-novartis-hydroxychloroquine.html}{Novartis
said it was halting its clinical trial} because it could not recruit
enough patients to sign up. Only a handful enrolled even though the
company had planned for a study involving 440 people.

Other researchers are still studying whether hydroxychloroquine could be
used earlier in the course of the illness, or to prevent people from
getting infected from the virus. While some of those studies are still
underway,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html}{one
such trial --- led by Dr. Boulware --- concluded earlier this month}
that hydroxychloroquine was not effective in preventing infections after
someone had been exposed.

That trial included 821 people and looked at whether those who were
exposed to the virus, such as health care workers or family members of
people who had been infected, were less or more likely to be infected
themselves if they were given the drug. It found that there was not a
meaningful difference.
