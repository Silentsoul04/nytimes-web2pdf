The psychological fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has yet to fully
show itself, but some experts have forecast a tsunami of new disorders,
and news accounts have [amplified that
message](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus).

The World Health Organization [warned in
May](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis)
of “a massive increase in mental health conditions in the coming
months,” wrought by anxiety and isolation. Digital platforms such as
Crisis Text Line and Talkspace regularly reported spikes in activity
through the spring. And more than half of American adults said the
pandemic had worsened their mental health, according to a recent survey
by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

But this wave of new mental problems is still well offshore, and it
could yet prove to be a mirage. Psychiatrists and therapists who work
with people in the wake of earthquakes, hurricanes and other disasters
noted that surges in anxiety and helplessness were natural reactions
that seldom become traumatic or chronic. Surveys that ask people about
their emotions are poor predictors of lasting distress, and the
prevalence of severe mental disorders, like schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder, are stable and very unlikely to have changed because of the
pandemic. Most people living with these conditions needed continuous
care before the virus took hold and will still need it when outbreaks
are contained.

“In most disasters, the vast majority of people do well,” said Dr.
Steven Southwick, a professor of psychiatry at Yale who has worked with
survivors after numerous cataclysms, including mass shootings. “Very few
people understand how resilient they really are until faced with
extraordinary circumstances. In fact, one of our first jobs in these
situations is to call attention to just that.”

Prescription trends provide little evidence of an explosion in mental
disorders in recent months. In March, at the height of the epidemic in
many regions, prescriptions for anti-anxiety drugs such as Xanax and
Klonopin were up by 15 percent over February; antidepressants were up by
14 percent, and sleeping pills by 5 percent, according to data provided
by OptumRx, the pharmacy benefit arm of UnitedHealth
Group.

But those rates began to decline in early April. And the total
prescriptions in that month were 8.7 million for anxiety drugs and 27.4
million for antidepressants — very close to their usual averages for
April, according to data supplied by IQVIA, a health care analytics
firm. Prescriptions for other categories of psychiatric drugs, like
anti-psychosis medications, remained at average monthly levels through
March and April.

“Modest transient rises in the use of antidepressant and anxiety
medications allay concerns over the pandemic having driven steep
increases in common mood and anxiety disorders,” Dr. Mark Olfson, a
professor of psychiatry at Columbia, said in an email. The March bump in
prescriptions for anxiety drugs in particular could partly reflect
people stockpiling medications that they were already taking, or
increasing their dosage, he said.

In the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, many health officials also
were concerned about a wave of new mental disorders that might overwhelm
the system. [In a 2004
study,](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.161.8.1377)
researchers dug into prescription data for the month before and after
the terrorist attack, comparing prescription rates across a range of
psychiatric drugs. “The acute shock and fear of the events of September
11 were not accompanied by a commensurate increase in the use of
psychotropic medications,” they concluded, except for a modest increase
in New York City.

The evidence from recent surveys asking people about their emotions
during the pandemic is not convincing one way or the other either,
experts said. One reason is that these surveys often do not make
distinctions between people in the thick of the action — front-line
workers, in this case — and everyone else. Millions of Americans have
been juggling Zoom cocktail hours with Netflix binges: a time-management
challenge, perhaps, but not one that has been linked to prolonged
trauma.

Moreover, psychological distress usually takes time to consolidate into
the kind of persistent condition that drives people to seek treatment,
revealing a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. Generalized anxiety
disorder, for instance, is defined in part by excessive anxiety for at
least six months. Post-traumatic stress requires, first, experiencing a
life-threatening event, either personally; through a loved one; or up
close, like witnessing deaths in an intensive care unit. Nightmares and
other reverberations of the trauma are common, but these typically must
persist for at least three months to qualify for the full diagnosis of a
chronic condition.

“There are a number of surveys out there, and I think they are all
useful, to some extent,” said Emma Beth McGinty, an associate professor
in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “But they’re
using a mishmash of measures of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and
not a validated psychiatric instrument,” or questionnaire.

The [best American survey to
date](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766941?guestAccessKey=8b48ddf2-8b20-4aaf-8d21-1b201bc8f567&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=060320),
posted early this month by JAMA and led by Dr. McGinty, administered a
standard, [widely studied psychiatric
questionnaire](https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/k6/Self%20admin_K6.pdf)
online to a nationally representative sample of 1,468 adults. It found
that 14 percent of people had high levels of psychological distress,
compared with an average of 4 percent during the pre-Covid era. It found
little difference in respondents’ feelings of loneliness, compared to
averages before the
pandemic.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“The longer people experience these levels of psychological distress,
the more likely they are to present with a diagnosis that would benefit
from treatment,” Dr. McGinty said in a phone interview. “But the
question of whether that’s really going to happen is an open one. We did
this in early April, right as the shutdown and stay-at-home orders were
implemented, when people were experiencing all this for the first time.
One might hypothesize that the stress has eased, we’ve gotten more used
to this and the world has opened up a bit.”

Dr. McGinty and her collaborators plan to conduct another such survey
later this summer, she said, and possibly one in the fall, to see
whether levels of psychological distress change as the epidemic changes
shape through the year.

The fear of infection and disruptions caused by the coronavirus, without
question, have intensified the distress of many individuals, especially
those who have lost regular access to care as a result, or who had
pre-existing dread of infections — from obsessive-compulsive disorder,
for example.

“In my mind, since this started, there’s nowhere that’s clean,” said
Naomi, a doctor in New York City who has a diagnosis of O.C.D.; she
asked that her last name be omitted for privacy. “It was like a complete
meltdown for me, because being a doctor, I know so much about pathogens
and what can so easily happen.”

But when it comes to collective trauma of the chronic, disabling kind,
many experts remain skeptical. Studies done in the wake of hurricanes,
earthquakes and floods find that no more than 10 percent of people
develop such prolonged reactions — and those are the people directly and
intimately hit by the destruction. The other 90 percent pick up the
pieces, and in time the nightmares and surges of panic recede.

Living through a pandemic is nothing like surviving a natural
catastrophe such as those: it’s less visible, less predictable, a
creeping threat rather than flying debris — a marathon, psychologically,
rather than a sprint to safety. A wave of new mental health disorders
may indeed be on the way, especially if Covid-19 cases explode again
late in the year, or the economic downturn deepens.

But the evidence so far says nothing persuasive about whether it will be
a tsunami or a ripple.
