[President
Trump’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/style/trump-tulsa-tie.html)
campaign promised huge crowds at his
[rally](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-rally-portsmouth-new-hampshire.html)
in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday, but it failed to deliver. Hundreds of
teenage
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
users and K-pop fans say they’re at least partially responsible.

Brad Parscale, the chairman of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, posted
on Twitter on Monday that the campaign had fielded [more than a
million](https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1272543199647666176?s=20)
ticket requests, but [reporters at the event
noted](https://twitter.com/AsteadWesley/status/1274465912951844866?s=20)
the attendance was lower than expected. The campaign also canceled
planned events outside the rally for an anticipated overflow crowd that
did not materialize.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, [said
protesters](https://twitter.com/cmsub/status/1274473814211125249/photo/1)
stopped supporters from entering the rally, held at the BOK Center,
which has a 19,000-seat capacity.

But reporters present said there [were few
protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/trump-rally-tulsa.html#link-60a18f83).
According to a spokesman for the Tulsa Fire Department on Sunday, the
fire marshal counted 6,200 scanned tickets of attendees. (That number
would not include staff, media or those in box suites.)

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TikTok users and [fans of Korean pop music
groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/smarter-living/the-edit-k-pop.html)
claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets
for Mr. Trump’s campaign rally as a prank. After the Trump campaign’s
official account @TeamTrump posted a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1271205174611259393) asking
supporters to register for free tickets using their phones on June 11,
K-pop fan accounts began sharing the information with followers,
encouraging them to register for the
[rally](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-rally-portsmouth-new-hampshire.html)
— and then not show.

The trend quickly spread on TikTok, where videos with millions of views
instructed viewers to do the same, [as CNN
reported](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/16/politics/tiktok-trump-tulsa-rally-trnd/index.html)
on Tuesday. “Oh no, I signed up for a Trump rally, and I can’t go,” one
woman joked, along with a fake cough, [in a
TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@proloser12245/video/6838621598229056773)
posted on June 15.

Thousands of other users posted similar tweets and videos to TikTok that
racked up millions of views. Representatives for TikTok did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.

“It spread mostly [through Alt
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/style/elite-tiktok.html) — we
kept it on the quiet side where people do pranks and a lot of activism,”
said the YouTuber Elijah Daniel, 26, who participated in the social
media campaign. “K-pop Twitter and Alt TikTok have a good alliance where
they spread information amongst each other very quickly. They all know
the algorithms and how they can boost videos to get where they want.”

Many users deleted their posts after 24 to 48 hours in order to conceal
their plan and keep it from spreading into the mainstream internet. “The
majority of people who made them deleted them after the first day
because we didn’t want the Trump campaign to catch wind,” Mr. Daniel
said. “These kids are smart and they thought of everything.”

Twitter users on Saturday night were quick to declare the social media
campaign’s victory. “Actually you just got ROCKED by teens on TikTok,”
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1274499021625794565?s=20) in
response to Mr. Parscale, who had tweeted that “radical protestors” had
“interfered” with attendance.

“Leftists and online trolls doing a victory lap, thinking they somehow
impacted rally attendance, don’t know what they’re talking about or how
our rallies work,” Mr. Parscale said in a statement on Sunday.
“Registering for a rally means you’ve RSVPed with a cellphone number
and we constantly weed out bogus numbers, as we did with tens of
thousands at the Tulsa rally, in calculating our possible attendee
pool.”

Mary Jo Laupp, a 51-year-old from Fort Dodge, Iowa, [said she had been

TikTok users express their frustration about Mr. Trump’s hosting his

“I recommend all of those of us that want to see this 19,000-seat

video.

When she checked her phone the next morning, Ms. Laupp said, the video
was starting to go viral. It has more than 700,000 likes, she added, and
more than two million
views.

Ms. Laupp said she was “overwhelmed” and “stunned” by the possibility
that she and the effort [she helped
inspire](https://www.tiktok.com/@maryjolaupp/video/6840619115585998085)
might have contributed to the low rally attendance.

“There are teenagers in this country who participated in this little
no-show protest, who believe that they can have an impact in their
country in the political system even though they’re not old enough to
vote right now,” she said.

The effort to deprive Mr. Trump of a large crowd spread from Twitter and
TikTok across multiple social media platforms, including Instagram and
Snapchat.

Erin Hoffman, an 18-year-old from upstate New York, said she heard from
a friend on Instagram about the social media campaign. She then spread
it herself via her Snapchat story, and said friends who saw her post
told her they were reserving tickets.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Trump has been actively trying to disenfranchise millions of Americans
in so many ways, and to me, this was the protest I was able to perform,”
said Ms. Hoffman, who reserved two tickets herself and persuaded one of
her parents to nab two more. “He doesn’t deserve the platform he has
been given.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Laupp said that many of the people who shared her video added
commentary encouraging people to procure the tickets with fake names and
phone numbers. In the comment section under her own video, TikTok users
exchanged advice on how to acquire a Google Voice number or another
internet-connected phone line.

“We all know the Trump campaign feeds on data, they are constantly
mining these rallies for data,” said Ms. Laupp, who worked on several
rallies for Pete Buttigieg’s campaign for the Democratic nomination for
president. “Feeding them false data was a bonus. The data they think
they have, the data they are collecting from this rally, isn’t
accurate.”

Campaign officials on Sunday said that many people who had signed up
were not supporters, but online tricksters. One campaign adviser claimed
that “troll data” was still usable, claiming it would help the campaign
avoid the same pitfall in the future. The adviser said that the data
could be put into the system to “tighten up the formula used to
determine projected attendance for rallies.”

Ms. Laupp added that several people who took part in her campaign
complained that once they signed up for the rally with their real phone
numbers, they couldn’t get the Trump campaign to stop texting them and
sending them messages.

Mary Garcia, a 19-year-old student from California, said that she used a
Google Voice number to sign up for the rally, but that two of her
friends who also signed up used their real numbers and had been
inundated with texts from the Trump campaign.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Garcia said she decided to sign up on a whim after seeing Ms.
Laupp’s video, but after she saw the Trump campaign boasting about its
record-setting ticket numbers she regretted what she had done.

“I feel like it doesn’t even matter if the rally is full or not,” Ms.
Garcia said. “They are going to boast about a million tickets being
registered, and then they’ll just lie or whatever about how big the
audience was.”

K-pop stans have been getting increasingly involved in American politics
in recent months. After the Trump campaign [solicited
messages](https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1270127968736677888) for
the president’s birthday on June 8, K-pop stans submitted a stream of
prank messages. And earlier in June, when the Dallas Police Department
asked citizens to submit videos of suspicious or illegal activity
through a dedicated app, K-pop Twitter claimed credit for [crashing the
app](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/what-we-can-learn-from-k-pop-stans-about-fighting-fascism)
by uploading thousands of “fancam” videos.

They also reclaimed the \#WhiteLivesMatter hashtag in May, by spamming
it with endless K-pop videos, in hopes to make it harder for white
supremacists and sympathizers to find one another and communicate their
messaging.

Whether or not the prank to call in false tickets was the reason for the
empty upper rafters at Mr. Trump’s rally, teenagers online celebrated.
