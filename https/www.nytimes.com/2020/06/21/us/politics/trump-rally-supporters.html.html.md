TULSA, Okla. — The difference between a
[rally](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-nh-rally-postponed.html)
for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and one for [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/style/trump-tulsa-tie.html)
starts with the attire.

There is no official uniform for either event, but while those who come
out for Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, show little
pattern in their dress, there’s a unity to Mr. Trump’s biggest fans. A
red hat is an obvious
[rally](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-rally-coronavirus.html)
must. Without the cap, American flag colors will do, or a T-shirt that
insults one of the president’s political archenemies — Hillary Clinton,
Barack Obama or a mainstream media outlet, for starters.

Packing recently for his first Trump rally, Donald Fanning of Wichita,
Kan., made sure to dress the part. On Saturday night in Tulsa, he wore
an American-flag T-shirt along with American-flag suspenders that were
hitched to American-flag swimming trunks.

And, in sync with many other Trump supporters, Mr. Fanning did not wear
a mask, even though the rally was the president’s first event since the
coronavirus pandemic ground the campaign trail to a halt.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Why? Because the virus was “a scare tactic more than anything,” Mr.
Fanning said. “And I just don’t believe all those deaths are
coronavirus.”

He wound up being one of a crowd of 6,200 in an arena that houses
19,000, according to estimates from local officials.

The view that greeted the president as he took the stage was surprising:
a half-empty arena floor. However, once stripped of the visual, Mr.
Trump’s speech featured a familiar set list. He unsheathed attacks
against Democratic opponents, casting party members as out-of-touch
socialists. He derided the news media. He put specific focus on
progressive women of color, including Representatives Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.

But more than any attack — personal or policy — Mr. Trump doubled down
on a stubborn strategy of narrow focus, blocking out the onslaught of
challenges facing the country in favor of describing the United States
as he wished it to be. The Tulsa rally was, more than anything, a safe
space of Mr. Trump’s own creation, however personally unhealthy for his
supporters or politically ill-suited for his re-election. (Oklahoma is
[not a swing
state](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/oklahoma).)

[Inside the Bank of Oklahoma
Center](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html)
on Saturday night, there was no coronavirus pandemic to worry about,
even as Oklahoma reported an increase in positive cases. Testing was
derided as a “double-edged sword,” with the president disclosing he had
told advisers [to slow it
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html).
The national protests about racial inequality and police brutality, the
president said, were the result of a few rogue officers, not evidence of
systemic racism.

you’ll get rid of racism,” he said, referring to the Rev. Al
Sharpton.

Jeff Eskew, a 52-year-old from Oklahoma City, dismissed the virus. “I’ve
been watching this closely over the last four months or so, and the
numbers just don’t add up to me.”

“Give me liberty or give me corona,” he said, paraphrasing the famous
phrase of revolution from Patrick Henry.

The entire scene, from speaker to speaker, brought to mind the famous
words of Kevin Bacon’s character in “Animal House,” as chaos erupted
around him: “Remain calm. All is well.”

Even Mr. Trump’s own political standing, increasingly in peril [as polls
show him losing
ground](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-virus-protests-polls.html)
among key demographics like [older
adults](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politics/trump-older-voters-2020.html)
and suburban women, came across sounding stronger than ever — on a glide
path to re-election against a bumbling Democratic opponent who would
destroy the country.

“If the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no
one will be safe and no one will have control,” said Mr. Trump,
straining to redefine his opponent. “Joe Biden is not the leader of his
party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the president’s attempts to revive the showmanship that helped make
him famous could not obscure his own political challenges. In Oklahoma,
a deeply conservative state where his victory in November is largely
assured, the campaign [fell well short of its attendance
goals](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html),
leading to the embarrassing spectacle of empty seats. The gap between
attendance predictions and reality delighted Mr. Trump’s opponents,
befuddled his allies and even involved teenage users of TikTok, who
claimed credit for boosting the campaign’s expectations with false
sign-ups and bad data.

By Sunday, the campaign released a statement pushing back on the idea
that online efforts to diminish attendance had worked.

Six of Mr. Trump’s own campaign staff members tested positive for the
coronavirus before the rally, underlining the persistent threat posed by
the
pandemic.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Juneteenth holiday weekend also showed how Mr. Trump’s handling of
race, and specifically his relationship with black Americans, continues
to be a flash point.

Leaders of Mr. Trump’s campaign often assert that they can make inroads
with black voters before the election, but self-inflicted errors have
complicated such efforts. This past week alone, the campaign received
substantial blowback for initially announcing the rally on June 19 in
Tulsa, considering that the city was the site of one of the country’s
[deadliest racist
massacres](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/tulsa-greenwood-massacre.html)
and that the date marked Juneteenth, which commemorates black
emancipation. Community leaders were also upset that Mr. Trump’s allies,
perhaps to atone for its initial announcement, floated the idea that Mr.
Trump or Vice President Mike Pence might tour the Greenwood neighborhood
where the 1921 massacre took place. Such a visit would have required
strict safety measures and jeopardized the Juneteenth celebration, which
drew thousands of attendees.

The poor results could be a harbinger for the general election. Mr.
Trump and his allies fell short of attendance expectations with a
strategy that exclusively relied on motivating his base of predominantly
white conservatives. At the same time, they fueled a backlash from
racially diverse Tulsans who mobilized quickly, enraged by a president
who they say is not fit to govern for all.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump is “inciting people because he wants them to react,” said Mr.
Jackson, the civil rights activist and former presidential candidate
mentioned by Mr. Fanning. Reached by telephone, Mr. Jackson said Mr.
Trump “wants to run on law and order,” and the Tulsa rally was another
example.

Kevin Matthews, a Democratic state senator from Tulsa, said he believed
Mr. Trump’s approach to Tulsa had backfired, partially because of a
failure to communicate with local black leaders.

“We were not consulted on a monumental visit to our area,” Mr. Matthews
said, describing the president’s attitude toward Tulsa’s black community
as “We know what’s best for you.”

If such feedback were heeded, it could be a wake-up call for a
Republican Party that has, to this point, dismissed bad polling and
unfavorable electoral results as outliers. But if the pattern of the
Trump administration holds, a president whose first dance after being
inaugurated was to Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” will continue to operate in
that
fashion.

At the Bank of Oklahoma Center, many of his supporters said they did not
want Mr. Trump to change any more than they themselves wanted to change.

They roared with approval when he called the coronavirus “Kung Flu,” a
racist nickname even one of his own senior advisers, Kellyanne Conway,
[once called “highly
offensive](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/488276-kellyanne-conway-says-its-highly-offensive-to-refer-to-coronavirus-as).”
Chants broke out of “Lock her up,” evoking the 2016 presidential
campaign, even as the Democratic Party has moved on from Mrs. Clinton.
Some people wore Confederate flags. Others brought signs that supported
the QAnon conspiracy theory that claims the existence of a “deep state”
plot against Mr. Trump and his supporters. (One of the president’s sons,
Eric Trump, [posted a QAnon

to his Instagram page on Saturday afternoon before deleting it shortly
afterward.)

Trina Moore, 61, drove 10 hours from Denver to attend the rally. Her
children are essential workers on the front lines of the pandemic, she
said.

“I’ve been home all by myself during quarantine and I wanted a reason to
go somewhere,” Ms. Moore said. “I just don’t believe in the virus thing.
I’d go to Europe. I’d get on a plane. I'd do whatever.”

Cloth masks were given to every attendee at the security entrance, but
few sported them inside. Asked where his free mask was, Mr. Eskew
laughed.

“I threw it in the trash,” he
said.
