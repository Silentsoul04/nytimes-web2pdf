# A Moratorium on Evictions Ends, Leaving Thousands of Tenants Fearful

Eviction cases are expected to soar in New York City as housing courts
reopen and landlords seek to recoup income lost during the pandemic.

A [moratorium on
evictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/evictions-moratorium-cares-act.html)
that New York State imposed during the coronavirus pandemic expired over
the weekend, raising fears that tens of thousands of residents
struggling in the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression
will be called into housing courts, which reopened on Monday.

Housing rights groups estimate that in the coming days, 50,000 to 60,000
cases could be filed in New York City’s housing courts. In addition,
thousands of cases that were already in progress but were paused in
March can now resume.

The number of eviction cases expected to be filed reflects the typical
caseload in a three-month period, which was the length of the
moratorium. But it does not take into account the fallout from the more
than one million city residents who have lost their jobs or were
furloughed in recent months and whose federal stimulus payments of an
extra $600 per week will soon run out, housing advocates say.

A second order issued by the state that shields tenants directly
affected by the pandemic expires in late August and could produce an
even bigger wave of eviction cases.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“All levels of government have to realize that they cannot let tens of
thousands of people end up in homeless shelters,” said Edward Josephson,
the director of litigation and housing at Legal Services NYC. “It’s the
most dire thing that we have ever seen.”

But many landlords say they, too, are facing financial calamity, with
the loss of rental income leaving them unable to pay their own bills,
including mortgages, and invest in building upkeep.

“It is clear that the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic are
nowhere near an end,” said Jay Martin, the executive director of the
Community Housing Improvement Program, or CHIP, which represents about
4,000 property owners. “There are thousands of tenants and building
owners who need help now.”

As housing courts nationwide begin to reopen and federal stimulus checks
are about to end, eviction cases are expected to soar. A [recent report
by
Amherst](https://www.amherstcapital.com/documents/20649/0/Amherst+Market+Commentary+-+May+2020+Issue/b6520038-308f-4708-8ed5-3b678d8ed560),
an analytics and data real estate firm, found that up to 28 million
renters are at risk of eviction.

In the days leading up to the first moratorium deadline, [dozens of
members of the New York State
Legislature](https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/article/attachment/2020.06.17_-_letter_from_nys_legislators_to_gov._cuomo_re_eviction_moratorium_and_court_closures.pdf),
as well as many housing groups, urged Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to extend
universal protection to all tenants, even in cases not directly caused
by the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They also expressed concern that housing courts would reopen physically
on Monday, placing tenants and others at risk of contracting and
spreading the
virus.

But the state’s chief administrative judge, Lawrence K. Marks, decided
against that, citing public health concerns. But case filings can be
sent online or through the mail, and hearings will be held virtually.

Susanna Blankley, the coalition coordinator for the Right to Counsel NYC
Coalition, said it was “unconscionable” for housing courts to restart at
all.

“In what world is it good to evict people in the middle of a pandemic?”
Ms. Blankley said. “Who are you opening for? It has to be for the
landlords.”

Even though the courthouses were closed on Monday, people protested the
virtual reopening outside the Brooklyn location, holding signs that
read, “EVICTION FREE NYC.”

The past three months have been extremely difficult not only for
tenants, but also for smaller landlords.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

About 25 percent of renters have not paid rent in May, April and June,
according to a survey by CHIP. About 20 percent of the landlords
represented by the group said they were concerned about losing their
properties.

Lincoln Eccles, who owns a 14-unit apartment building in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, said the closing of housing courts in March delayed two cases
he had against separate tenants who have not paid rent in years.
Together, the tenants owe tens of thousands of dollars in rent, he said.

Before the pandemic, Mr. Eccles said he expected to resolve those cases
by July or August. With the courts’ closing and their typical snail’s
pace even as they reopen, he does not expect a resolution for many more
months.

He said he collected full rent payments from only nine of his 14 units
this month; some of the tenants have not paid because of the pandemic,
he
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“If it’s a choice between me being solvent or the tenant staying in
place, I have no choice but being solvent,” said Mr. Eccles, who said he
was operating in the red this year.

He is still paying off a $9,000 repair on the building’s boiler in
February.

“Contrary to what the tenant advocates say, most of us landlords — the
real landlords — going to court is the last option,” he said. “I don’t
know of anyone who would knowingly evict someone who had a financial
loss because of Covid.”

Nonetheless, eviction is an option that landlords do exercise. There
were 37,000 residential evictions in 2018 and 2019 combined, [according
to the
city](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hra/downloads/pdf/services/civiljustice/OCJ_Annual_Report_2019.pdf),
though the annual number has steadily declined in recent years. There
were nearly 3,000 residential evictions this year before the moratorium
took place.

Deborah Metts is worried she will be added to that list.

She lost her marketing executive job in March and could not afford the
next month’s rent on her Harlem apartment. Since then, Ms. Metts has
helped start a tenant association in her building, organized a rent
strike among some tenants and asked the property owner to give residents
a break on rent. (The company has not responded, she said.)

“The last few months for me have been scary and really eye-opening,” Ms.
Metts, 37, said. “The minute you go from privilege, in a sense of still
being employed, to having nothing — things change very quickly.”

She said she was more concerned that her neighbors could face eviction
proceedings and have no place to go if they lost their homes.

Of the ZIP codes in New York City with the most evictions in 2018 and
2019, people of color make up more than 96 percent of the population in
those areas, according to census data. All of them were in the Bronx or
Brooklyn.

“When we talk about evictions, the vast majority of those people will be
black and brown people,” Ms. Metts said. “If society cares about social
justice, one of the places they need to put their money where their
mouth is is in eviction prevention.”

About 2.3 million tenants in New York City recently received slight
relief on their future rent. The city’s Rent Guidelines Board, which
sets rates for rent-regulated apartments, [froze those rents for a
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/nyregion/nyc-rent-guidelines-board-freeze.html);
it was only the third time the board had not approved a yearly increase
in its 50-year history. The freeze does not affect market-based rents.

Across the country, including in New York, tenants have rallied around a
broad \#CancelRent campaign, criticizing eviction moratoriums and rent
freezes as inadequate during the economic turmoil.

For the past several months, MD Khan, a cabdriver, has been receiving
letters from his landlord titled “Notice of failure to pay rent.” Mr.
Khan, 57, said he stopped driving in mid-March because he worried about
contracting the virus.

Still not working, he has not been able to afford his $1,175 rent on his
studio apartment in Jamaica, Queens, since March. He said he believed
the letters were the first step in his landlord eventually taking him to
housing court.

“I don’t have a job,” Mr. Khan said, “and I don’t have income.”
