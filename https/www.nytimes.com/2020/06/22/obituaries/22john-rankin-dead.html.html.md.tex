\section{John Rankin, Grant Proposal Writer Who Loved Languages, Dies at
65}\label{john-rankin-grant-proposal-writer-who-loved-languages-dies-at-65}}

Mr. Rankin was a proposal writer working in the Washington area before a
series of strokes beginning in 2013 left him disabled. He died of the
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

John Rankin loved language. His classmates at Phillips Exeter Academy
ragged him for reading the dictionary. He was a French major at Wesleyan
University, and tutored his future wife, Lia Ribero, who is from
Colombia, in English, while he learned Spanish from her by osmosis, as
she put it.

He taught himself Portuguese and Amharic, an Ethiopian language. He
taught his children, Monica and John, IV, whom he raised to be bilingual
in Spanish and English, to declaim Puck's soliloquy from ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' when they were 5 and 4, and mimed trumpets as they
performed.

When Mr. Rankin suffered a heart attack and a series of strokes
beginning in 2013 that damaged the left side of his brain and robbed him
of language and movement on his right side, it was a particularly cruel
blow.

Yet he was able to attend the graduation of his daughter Monica in 2018
from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and she could see how proud
he was. ``He just looked stoic and happy,'' she said.

Mr. Rankin died on May 2 of multi-organ failure from Covid-19 at the
Adventist Healthcare Shady Grove Medical Center in Rockville, Md. He was
65. Mr. Rankin tested positive for the coronavirus in March, Monica
Rankin said.

He had been living in nursing homes in recent years because of his
disabilities.

John Edwin Rankin III was born on June 27, 1954, in Washington to John
Edwin Rankin, Jr., a veterinarian, and Blanche Etta (Rowe) Rankin, a
bookbinder at the Pentagon. In addition to his daughter and son, he is
survived by another daughter, Ana Carolina, and his sister, Maria. His
brother, Paul, died in 2011.

John attended Exeter on a scholarship, graduating in 1972, and was a
mentor to the other black students there, a small, tight-knit minority.
When his friend Hugo St. John's white roommate insulted him with a slur,
John arranged for Hugo to share his suite. By senior year, John was a
proctor; he was also the head of the kitchen staff, an early lesson in
double consciousness. ``A good number of us were working in the
kitchen,'' Mr. St. John said.

Ellis Moss, who was a freshman when John was a senior, said: ``We were
fish out of water --- African-Americans in a very un-African-American
environment. He would say to me, `I need you to do more studying.' It
was ingrained in us that we would help each other. It was not an option
for one of us to fail.''

After he graduated from college, Mr. Rankin returned to Washington and
worked as a grant proposal writer, Ms. Ribero said, at organizations
like the Education Writers Association and the Hispanic Policy
Development Project. Later, he was a freelance proposal writer, working
from home in Maryland.

``His two vices were work and smoking,'' Ms. Ribero said, ``and I was
worried about his health and it wasn't good for the marriage.'' The
couple divorced in 2011, after two decades together, but made amends
after his illnesses. An earlier marriage, to Sara Workeneh, also ended
in divorce.

Although Mr. Rankin's speech became severely impaired, his singing was
perfect; he could belt out ``Hail to the Redskins,'' the fight song for
his favorite football team, with no stumbles.
