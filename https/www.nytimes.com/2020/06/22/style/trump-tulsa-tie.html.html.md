It is the picture of the tie, like the echo of the words, that lingers.
The tie no longer secured in its big, boastful knot, but rather hanging
limply around the neck, like a boxer on the ropes. The tie, that has
been as close to a sartorial spirit animal as President Trump has had,
along with his red MAGA hat and his elaborately constructed hair,
completely *un*tied.

The tie as it was in the small hours of Sunday morning as the president
arrived at Andrews military base from his [ill-fated campaign
rally](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/trump-tulsa-rally.html)
in Tulsa, Okla., later landing by helicopter at the White House and
striding across the South Lawn, MAGA cap crushed in one hand. The tie as
most observers could never remember seeing it before, at least around
the neck of this president.

Together, the two accessories created an image as striking as those of
the sparsely populated rows in
[Tulsa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-rally-coronavirus.html),
and the empty overflow area outside. And as potentially symbolic, though
probably not in the way Mr. Trump would like.

After all, this is not a president who ascribes to the shirt
sleeves[photo
op](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/fashion/donald-trump-barack-obama-ties.html).
Not someone who invites his electorate in to see him, jacket tossed
aside, elbows-deep in work at his desk. Not someone interested, like
President Barack Obama and former Prime Minister David Cameron of
Britain or even former Vice President Joe Biden, who seems equally
comfortable with or without a tie, in announcing his sensitivity to the
younger generation and their value system by willingly rejecting the
suit.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He is, rather someone who believes deeply in the pageantry of his
office, of airbrushed calculation (see: Ivanka, Melania, even Jared),
branding, and the power of costume. Be that pageantry in the generals
whom he famously once lauded as “straight from central casting” or his
[disastrously staged
march](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
across Lafayette Park to St. John’s Church in response to the protests
in Washington D.C.

It’s a tenet that was clearly on display in Tulsa not just in his own
uniform — the flag-reflecting blue suit, white shirt, red tie — but in
supporting acts that included Lara Trump, son Eric’s wife and a Trump
campaign adviser, in a white wrap dress; Kimberly Guilfoyle, son Don
Jr.’s girlfriend and chairwoman of the Trump Victory Finance
Committee, in a bright blue wrap dress; and Kayleigh McEnany, the White
House press secretary, in red, like a matching patriotic array.

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And when it comes to Mr. Trump’s costume, the tie matters. Especially
the bright red tie, which he made his doppelgänger during the 2016
campaign, glowing in all its Republican glory; subliminally reminding
everyone of the party’s Reagan heyday; of the good old times when
everyone dressed according to establishment role; representing, in all
its [ridiculous, below-the-belt
length](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/opinion/the-ties-that-blind.html)
— well, who knows? Something\! Manhood or power or Mr. Trump’s
willingness to stretch the rules (he also Scotch-taped the back,
remember?). The psychological speculation has been endless, and varied.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The problem is, when the tie becomes a sign of victory, it can also be a
sign of defeat. So it looked Sunday morning. Sure, it was very early.
You can understand why a tie might be undone. But Mr. Trump understands
as well as anyone that he is always on display, always playing his part.
There isn’t really a backstage in his job, especially during his
entrance and exit moments.

Add to that the cap-in-hand, and the symbolism gets pretty loaded. As
one[observer](https://twitter.com/InkwellPaul/status/1274753478418665479)tweeted,
“I mean, when does a baseball coach scrunch up their team cap — it ain’t
when they’re winning, is it?”

Nope. It’s usually when they are about to throw it on the ground and
jump up and down on it in frustration and disgust, because nothing is
going according to plan. At least in the movies, from which Mr. Trump
does seem to derive most of his cues.

Which is why, through all the bombast and brouhaha, the denialism and
accusations, that both characterized the flop in Oklahoma and followed
it, the unplanned photo op stood out as a rare moment of truth, caught
on camera. It was *real* Reality TV.

The campaign rally was supposed to be the start of a new stage (pun
intended). Maybe it actually will
be.
