Leaders of local and state health departments have been subject to
harassment, personal insults and death threats in recent weeks, a
response from a vocal and angry minority of the public who say that mask
requirements and restrictions on businesses have gone too far.

One top health official, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the director of the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Health, issued a statement on Monday
condemning attacks on public health directors and disclosing that she
faced repeated threats to her safety.

“The death threats started last month, during a Covid-19 Facebook Live
public briefing when someone very casually suggested that I should be
shot,” Dr. Ferrer said in a statement. “I didn’t immediately see the
message, but my husband did, my children did, and so did my colleagues.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is deeply worrisome,” she added, “to imagine that our hardworking
infectious disease physicians, nurses, epidemiologists and environmental
health specialists or any of our other team members would have to face
this level of hatred.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Across the country, many public health officials [entered the
coronavirus pandemic with bare-bones staffs and strained
budgets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/coronavirus-health-departments.html),
leaving them ill-prepared to handle a mounting crisis. Before the
pandemic, they had focused on illness prevention, contact tracing for
communicable diseases, vaccinations and campaigns against smoking and
vaping.

Now some of them, suddenly facing the public with regular television
briefings about efforts to fight the coronavirus, are choosing to leave
their positions
entirely.

Lori Tremmel Freeman, the chief executive of the National Association of
County and City Health Officials, said last week that dozens of top
health officials have resigned or been fired since the pandemic began.
At least four state health directors have resigned from their posts; Dr.
Amy Acton, the state health director of Ohio, [stepped
down](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200611/dr-amy-acton-resigns-as-state-health-director-democrats-cite-criticism-from-gop-lawmakers)
this month after enduring anti-Semitic attacks and demonstrations by
armed protesters on her front lawn.

Dr. Umair A. Shah, the executive director of the public health
department in Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, described a
tense new role. “Now that we’re quite visible and we’re part of very
difficult decision-making, naturally those decisions are having an
incredible impact on community members in a very specific way,” Dr. Shah
said. “That’s where the problem comes in.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Not all of the officials have said why they are leaving, and some have
cited personal reasons or planned retirements, but Ms. Freeman said she
had heard many accounts of harassment.

“There’s a big red target on their backs,” Ms. Freeman said. “They’re
becoming villainized for their guidance. In normal times, they’re very
trusted members of their community.”

Some critics of the public health directors have said that they believe
that allowing businesses to operate is worth the risk of spreading the
coronavirus, and that health directors are too cautious about
reopenings. Others have cited conspiracy theories that claim that the
coronavirus is a hoax; that the development of a vaccine is part of a
massive effort to track citizens and monitor their movements; and that
wearing a mask or cloth face covering is a practice that impedes
personal freedom.

In Washington State, where rural counties are [struggling with new
outbreaks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html)
and trying to warn residents to take basic precautions to stem the
spread of the virus, pleas from local health officials have often been
answered with hostility and threats.

In Yakima County, which has more than six times as many cases per capita
as the county that includes Seattle, hospitals have reached capacity and
patients were being taken elsewhere for medical care. Gov. Jay Inslee
warned over the weekend that “we are frankly at the breaking point,” and
has said he would require Yakima residents to wear face coverings in an
effort to slow the virus’s
spread.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“I’ve been called a Nazi numerous times,” said Andre Fresco, the
executive director of the Yakima Health District. “I’ve been told not to
show up at certain businesses. I’ve been called a Communist and Gestapo.
I’ve been cursed at and generally treated in a very unprofessional way.
It’s very difficult.”

In California, angry protesters have tracked down addresses of public
health officers and gathered outside their homes, chanting and holding
signs. Last week, a group called the Freedom Angels did just that in
Contra Costa County, Calif., filming themselves and posting the videos
on Facebook.

“We came today to protest in front of our county public health officer’s
house, and some people might have issues with that, that we took it to
their house,” one woman said in a video. “But I have to tell you guys,
they’re coming to our houses. Their agenda is contact tracing, testing,
mandatory masks and ultimately an injection that has not been tested,”
she said, apparently referring to a vaccine even though none have been
approved.

Dr. Nichole Quick, the chief health officer for Orange County, Calif.,
resigned as protests and harassment intensified after [an order to
require face masks in certain
businesses](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/06/08/o-c-chief-health-officer-dr-nichole-quick-resigns-amid-mask-controversy-threats/),
including grocery stores and pharmacies. Emily Brown, director of the
Rio Grande County Public Health Department in rural Colorado, was [fired
when she encountered community
resistance](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/14/876714176/public-health-workers-face-threats-unemployment-while-fighting-virus)
to the stricter rules she had encouraged.

The departures across the country have prompted industry officials to
ask whether a dearth of leadership is ahead for health departments, even
as they combat the pandemic.

“We’ve never seen this level of vitriol before,” said Kat DeBurgh, the
executive director of the Health Officers Association of California.
“I’m worried not just about the present but about the future. When
they’re subject to such harassment, who is going to step into these
jobs?”

Mitch Smith contributed reporting.
