# University of Michigan Withdraws From Hosting Trump-Biden Debate

</div>

The decision comes amid concerns about holding a large gathering during
the coronavirus pandemic. The debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, will
instead be held in Miami.

The University of Michigan said Tuesday it would withdraw from hosting a
presidential debate in October, citing concerns about bringing large
numbers of national and international media and campaign officials to
the campus amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, will be moved to Miami’s Adrienne
Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, [according to the Commission on
Presidential
Debates,](https://www.debates.org/2020/06/23/statement-second-presidential-debate/)which
oversees debates in a presidential general-election race. The Miami arts
center was the site of the 2020 Democratic primary season last summer.

“It is with great disappointment that I must ask for the University of
Michigan to be released from its agreement with the Commission on
Presidential Debates to host the Presidential Debate on Oct. 15, 2020,”
Michigan’s president,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Mark
Schlissel, [said in a statement
Tuesday.](https://record.umich.edu/articles/u-m-no-longer-hosting-oct-15-presidential-debate/)

He added: “In consideration of the public health guidelines in our state
as well as advice from our own experts — we feel it is not feasible for
us to safely host the presidential debate as planned.’’

The Detroit Free Press [first reported Michigan would
withdraw](https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2020/06/22/u-m-withdraw-hosting-october-presidential-debate/3239836001/)
from hosting the debate.

The move comes as President Trump has sought to alter the debate
schedule, add a fourth debate to the planned three and exert more
control over the selection of moderators, which is typically handled by
the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit organization that
sponsors presidential general election
debates.

The campaign of Mr. Trump’s opponent, former [Vice President Joseph R.
Biden
Jr](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/biden-transition-team.html).,
has rebuffed his proposals, dismissing them as a “distraction.”

Presidential general election debates cost their hosts millions of
dollars, sums universities typically raise from their own large donors
in order to bask in the prestige of hosting an event that draws
international attention. But with the coronavirus pandemic stretching
budgets and making large gatherings of students and donors on campus not
viable, some of the value in hosting a major debate may be lost.

The debate will become the second major presidential campaign event to
move to Florida after officials elsewhere raised concerns about large
gatherings being safe during the coronavirus pandemic. After officials
in North Carolina, including Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, sought
assurances that delegates would adhere to social distancing at the
Republican National Convention in Charlotte, the Trump campaign
announced that Mr. Trump would instead accept the G.O.P. nomination in
Jacksonville, Fla.

In a letter on Monday to the Commission on Presidential Debates, Jen
O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, asked for information
about what protocols debate hosts would put in place to assure the
safety of the candidates, moderators and attendees.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. O’Malley Dillon also wrote that Mr. Biden was committed to debating
Mr. Trump on [Sept. 29, Oct. 15, and
Oct. 22](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html),
and that his yet-to-be-selected [running
mate](https://www.nytimes.com/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html)
would take part in the vice-presidential debate scheduled for Oct. 7.

“Our position is straightforward and clear: Joe Biden will accept the
Commission’s debates, on the Commission’s dates, under the Commission’s
established format and the Commission’s independent choice of
moderators,” Ms. O’Malley Dillon said [in the
letter](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/7038-biden-letter-to-debate-commission/94c02d45d35cdd5b9865/optimized/full.pdf#page=1),
which was obtained by The New York Times. “Donald Trump and Mike Pence
should do the same.”

“Any ‘debate proposals’ in lieu of that are just an effort to change the
subject, avoid debates, or create a distracting ‘debate about debates,’”
she added.

The details of the letter were first reported [by The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-campaign-confirms-he-will-attend-three-debates-with-trump-criticizes-the-president-for-flipping-on-his-debate-stance/2020/06/22/b48be3a0-b49a-11ea-a510-55bf26485c93_story.html).

The letter came four days after [The Times
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/trump-presidential-debates-2020.html)
that top aides to Mr. Trump had held an online meeting with officials
overseeing the debates, in which they pushed for a fourth debate between
Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden and argued that the events should take place
sooner than planned in order to accommodate voters wishing to cast their
ballots early. (Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has [repeatedly and falsely
claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/republicans-mail-voting-trump.html)
that mail-in voting is rife with fraud.)

Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, was in the meeting and
also proposed a system allowing both campaigns to recommend a set number
of moderators and then strike some of them from their opponent’s lists
until an agreement was reached.

In her letter, Ms. O’Malley Dillon noted that the Trump campaign’s
position was [a shift from months
earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/trump-presidential-debate-democrat.html),
when the president’s advisers were discussing whether Mr. Trump would
take part in debates sponsored by the commission at all. “The Trump
position seems to be saying that he will debate if he can pick the
moderators,” she wrote.

The commission, which has produced the general election debates since
the 1988 campaign, typically spends months negotiating the details with
representatives for the candidates. The group did not respond to a
request for comment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump campaign’s proposal for an extra debate came as a [wave of
recent polls showed the president trailing Mr.
Biden](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/upshot/polling-trump-erosion-support.html)
both nationally and in key swing states, suggesting that Mr. Trump’s
advisers viewed the debates as a possible turnaround opportunity.

“An earlier and longer debate schedule is necessary so Americans can see
the clear difference between President Trump’s vibrant leadership and
Biden’s confused meandering,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign
spokesman.

Ms. O’Malley Dillon said in her letter that even if the coronavirus
remained prevalent in the months ahead, she hoped that the second debate
— originally set to be held in Michigan — would follow a town-hall-style
format as has been customary in recent years, enabling voters to ask
questions of the candidates directly.

“We know that voters have many, many questions for the president,” she
wrote.
