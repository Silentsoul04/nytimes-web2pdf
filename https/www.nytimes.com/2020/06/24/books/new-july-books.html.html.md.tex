After the ``Manfall'' pandemic wipes out most of the men on the planet,
Cole disguises her son --- one of the last males on Earth --- as a girl
and tries to get him to safety before the government can snatch him.
Their cross-country journey is treacherous, as they evade not only the
Department of Men but also Cole's sister, Billie, who is determined to
separate mother and son. Beukes's imagined world --- complete with
bootleg sperm and faux baby bumps --- is a thrilling setting for an
examination of maternal love.

The longtime ``Jeopardy!'' host has enthralled viewers for more than 30
years. Now, he writes about family, success and philanthropy; talks
about legendary contestants like
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/arts/television/jeopardy-goat-ken-jennings.html}{Ken
Jennings}; and answers the questions he gets most often from fans
(including why he shaved his mustache).

Don't let the title mislead you; this unusual book is less a memoir than
the origin story of a popular Twitter persona, Duchess Goldblatt, a
fictional 80-something with thousands of followers drawn to her brisk
literary wit. (Her \href{https://twitter.com/duchessgoldblat}{Twitter
bio} identifies her as the ``beloved inspirational author of `Feasting
on the Carcasses of My Enemies: A Love Story.''') Here the duchess
describes how she found solace in building a new identity online as her
real life was coming undone.

Bug Montage, a mechanic, has built a good and honest life for his
family. But when his life starts to go off the rails --- his mother is
facing eviction from her nursing home, his business is in the red --- he
agrees to do one last heist. This novel is a fast-paced, fresh take on
noir that tears through the underbelly of Virginia.

Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton, makes the case that
Gingrich's pugnacity altered the character of the Republican Party,
ushering in a new level of political vitriol. Gingrich's actions helped
legitimize political ruthlessness and cunning, Zelizer argues, and his
influence can be seen leading to the election of President Trump.

Readers of Martin's novel,
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/books/review/andrew-martin-early-work.html}{Early
Work},'' will recognize plenty in these pages. One of the novel's
central characters reappears, and Martin returns to familiar themes in
this collection: substance abuse, professional ambivalence, low-grade
existential dread. Cocaine lands two grown siblings in an emergency room
on Christmas Eve; a marriage teeters on implosion during a vacation on
the Jersey Shore.

by Maggie O'Farrell (Knopf, July
21)}{`Hamnet,' by Maggie O'Farrell (Knopf, July 21)}}\label{hamnet-by-maggie-ofarrell-knopf-july-21}}

Few (good) novelists have dared conjure Shakespeare, the English
language's unparalleled genius, as a character, much less pulled it off.
O'Farrell's own genius was to see a literary opportunity in the paucity
of information about Shakespeare's domestic life, and in the connection
between his dead son and his great play.

Women find themselves in uncanny, unsettling situations throughout this
collection, complete with drugged seltzer, family rivalries and the
lingering specter of past traumas. The opening lines of the book set the
tone: ``I want to tell you about the night I got hit by a train and
died.

``The thing is --- it never happened.''

The tragedy at the center of this book is profound: When Trethewey was
19, her former stepfather killed her mother. Over the course of the
book, the author, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, examines the legacy of
this murder on herself and her family; how her mother's selflessness
formed her as a writer; and how poetry was a necessary outlet for
Trethewey as she began understand herself while growing up biracial in
the South.

The discovery of a mysterious outsider rattles an unnamed Southern town.
Pew, as the person is called, resists easy categorization --- their
gender and sex are ambiguous, and they hardly speak. Some residents hail
Pew as a divine being, while others remain skeptical and fearful; the
tension builds over seven days as the town prepares for an annual
festival haunted by sinister rumors.

Details are scant about this book, but the author, President Trump's
niece and a psychologist, has promised damning stories about her uncle
and the Trump family dynamics. She also

Draper offers a comprehensive account of the U.S. invasion, which is
familiar territory for him: In an earlier book,
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/review/Lewis3-t.html}{Dead
Certain},'' he focused on the Bush administration and the president's
stubborn faith in the war. This deeply reported account, which draws on
interviews and declassified documents, suggests that the invasion and
Saddam Hussein's ouster were both inevitabilities in President Bush's
mind.

Why are so many countries teetering toward autocracy? Applebaum is a
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has lived in Poland off and on
since the late 1980s and is well-positioned to investigate. As she
writes: ``Given the right conditions, any society can turn against
democracy. Indeed, if history is anything to go by, all of our societies
will.''

Dickey, the cultural historian and author of ``Ghostland,'' here
explores some of America's most outlandish fringe beliefs and how they
have taken hold, from the Jersey Devil --- a legendary creature believed
to lurk in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey~--- to the Lemurians,
extraterrestrials said to live inside California's Mount Shasta. There's
even a chapter devoted to the Kentucky Meat Shower of 1876, when chunks
of flesh reportedly fell from a clear sky.

A psychiatrist offers a sobering look at the legal system's relationship
to people with mental illness, and how the American prison system
exacerbates their suffering. An early decision by the police as to
whether someone belongs in a hospital or jail has profound lifelong
consequences. This book examines how such people end up incarcerated and
the legacy of the harm they endure.

Elizabeth, the central character in this novel, is struggling. She and
her husband are both underemployed, careening toward bankruptcy and
strained by the demands of parenthood. As she reckons with her failed
dreams, she leans on an old but tempestuous friendship while navigating
through economic and personal collapse.
