# N.Y. Will Impose Quarantine on Visitors From States With Big Outbreaks

New Jersey and Connecticut will also require visitors to quarantine for
two weeks. The rule reflects a stark shift in the course of the
outbreak.

A few months ago, [New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-travel-cuomo.html)
was suffering through the worst ravages of the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/travel/virus-vacation.html)
pandemic. Hospitals filled to near capacity. Hundreds of people died
each day, reaching a peak in mid-April.

The rest of the country recoiled at the sight of a New York license
plate.
[Florida](https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-82.pdf)
and [Rhode
Island](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/03/29/coronavirus-rhode-repeals-new-york-quarantine-order/2935388001/)
singled out [New York
travelers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/nyregion/ny-quarantine-rules.html),
who researchers now believe [helped to seed the
spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
of the virus in other states.

But as New York has largely controlled its outbreak, other states —
especially in the Sun Belt and the West — have seen virus cases surge,
leading to a table-turning moment: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday
announced that anyone coming to [New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/nyregion/ny-quarantine-rules.html)
from a state currently hard hit by the virus would have to quarantine
for two weeks.

The restrictions were based on specific health metrics related to the
coronavirus, Mr. Cuomo said. At the moment,
[travelers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/travel/virus-vacation.html)
from eight states — as well as New Yorkers returning from those states —
would have to quarantine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We now have to make sure that the rate continues to drop,” Mr. Cuomo
said. “A lot of people come into this region and they could literally
bring the infection with them. It wouldn’t be malicious or malevolent,
but it would still be real.”

*\[*[*Thinking of traveling within the US? Here’s where you can
go*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/travel/state-travel-restrictions.html)*.\]*

Failure to quarantine in New York could result in thousand-dollar fines,
Mr. Cuomo said. Travelers to [New
Jersey](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/nyregion/Coronavirus-restaurants-reopening-ny-nj.html)
and Connecticut would also be told to quarantine, though officials from
both states said there was no enforcement mechanism at the moment.

The order — a “joint travel advisory” with the two other states — would
take effect at midnight, Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday. He said the quick
implementation was aimed at preventing a rush of travelers trying to
avoid the requirement, which currently applied to Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.

Washington State had originally been included, but after a further
review of the data, it was dropped from the list.

In recent days, Texas has seen record-high levels of hospitalizations

particularly in Houston, have struggled to keep up with the rising
number [patients needing intensive

Amid rising hospitalizations in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper [said on
Wednesday](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243760267.html)
that the state would “pause” its move into the next phase of reopening
and make masks required statewide in public when distancing is not
possible.

In Florida, more than 20,000 people tested positive for the virus over
the last five days ending Tuesday; in New York, where far more people
are being tested daily, roughly 3,100 tested positive over those same
five days.

Only a handful of states — including Maine, Rhode Island and Hawaii —
have required out-of-state travelers to quarantine. A larger number have
asked travelers to quarantine but do not mandate doing so. And a few,
such as Florida and Kansas, apply the requirement only to those coming
from certain states.

The new quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would apply
to any person arriving from a state with a positive test rate higher
than 10 per 100,000 residents, or a state with a 10 percent or higher
rate over a seven-day rolling average.

Mr. Cuomo said that enforcement would be up to each of the three states.
In New York, he said, those violating the quarantine order could be
“subject to a judicial order and mandatory quarantine.” A first
violation could result in a $2,000 fine and could go up to $10,000 for
subsequent violations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Indeed, the effect of the order may be largely symbolic. Even in places
where out-of-state arrivals are already formally required to quarantine,
there has not been widespread enforcement to make sure the rules were
being followed.

A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said that if a New Yorker believes that a
recent arrival — or a returning neighbor — has not been abiding by the
quarantine, then that person should start by reporting the possible
violation to the local health department.

“You could argue that every law is the honor system until you get
caught,” Mr. Cuomo said. “You can violate the quarantine until you get
caught,” he added, then “you’re in mandatory quarantine and fined
thousands of
dollars.”

said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Mr. Cuomo, who hosted the news conference from New York City, was joined
via video link by Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey and Gov. Ned
Lamont of Connecticut, all three Democrats.

“This is a smart thing to do. We have taken our people, the three of us,
these three states, through hell and back,” Mr. Murphy said. “The last
thing we need to is subject our folks to another round.”

The goal, the governors said, was to maintain the hard-fought gains
against the virus that have been made, at great economic and human cost,
over the past three months. On Monday, for example, nearly 49,000 people
were tested for the virus in New York, with just shy of 600 coming back
positive.

Since the middle of March, New Yorkers have largely abided by the orders
to stay at home and wear masks in public, creating a new way of life in
the city and surrounding suburbs that helped to bring new infections
down to a manageable level.

At the same time, many New Yorkers with the means to do so fled, often
to [out-of-state
locales.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/16/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-moving-leaving.html)
By late March, Florida began requiring travelers from the New York area
to quarantine. Other states sought to restrict visitors.

Now, the virus appears to be spreading far more rapidly outside of New
York, with new infections surging in places like Arizona and Texas.
Those who left for other states, upon their return to New York, will
have to quarantine.

The city and state have begun a phased reopening of business that has
been more cautious than other areas of the country, and Mr. Cuomo as
well as other officials have been concerned about a resurgence of the
virus. The travel restrictions were an attempt at mitigating the risk of
new infections coming from outside the state.

“We now have the virus under control. Yeah, but Florida doesn’t, Texas
doesn’t, these other states don’t,” he said last week. “And what happens
if they get on a plane and they come to J.F.K.? So, we get the infection
rate down and then because other states are high, we could have a
problem.”

Epidemiologists do not see a uniform coronavirus wave spreading across
the country, but multiple outbreaks that are out of sync with each
other. In that context, they said, quarantine requirements made sense.

They also cautioned that the outbreak remains active and that the
situation in any one state or region of the country could still change.
