The coronavirus pandemic is still raging in this country. In fact, in
more than 20 states, the number of cases is rising. More than 120,000
Americans have died from the virus. This country has a quarter of all
the cases in the world even though it makes up only 4 percent of the
world population.

Things are so bad here that the European Union, which has lowered its
rates, is considering [banning U.S.
citizens](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/coronavirus-EU-American-travel-ban.html)
when it reopens its borders.

This situation is abysmal, and it would not have been so bad if
President Trump had not intentionally neglected his duty to protect
American citizens.

From the beginning, Trump has used every opportunity to downplay the
virus, [claiming in
February,](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-kag-rally-manchester-new-hampshire-february-10-2020)
“Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer,
it miraculously goes away.” Well, we’re now in June, summer. It’s not
just warm, it’s hot. And the cases in the hottest states — those in the
South and Southwest — are surging.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Trump has consistently been resistant to testing, falsely claiming that
an increase in testing is somehow linked to an increase in cases. But in
fact, the more you test, the more you are able to control the virus by
identifying, isolating and treating the infected, thereby reducing the
spread of the virus. Testing is how you reduce your cases. It is also
how you save lives.

But Trump believes that to reveal the true extent of the virus’s
presence in this country would make him look bad. So more people get
sick and more people die.

[He said in
May:](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-says-coronavirus-testing-overratedclaims-fewer-cases-if-no-testing-2020-05-14)
“When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is
wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few
cases. They don’t want to write that. It’s common sense. We test much
more.”

What Trump is truly saying here is, let people get sick without proper
surveillance. He is saying, let them suffer out of sight. He is saying,
some will die, but so what. He is saying vulnerable Americans are
collateral damage in his image-making and re-election bid.

At his rally in Tulsa, Trump took a step deeper into the darkness,
[saying](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-slow-down-testing-coronavirus-i-dont-kid/):
“When you do testing to that extent you’re going to find more people,
you’re going to find cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing
down, please.’ They test and they test. We got tests for people who
don’t know what’s going on.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If there actually was a slowdown, it allowed the virus to spread and
more people to get sick and die.

Trump stood in the White House briefing room and [suggested that
injecting disinfectant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33QdTOyXz3w)
into the body could possibly cure the virus, known officially as
SARS-CoV-2. After this insane and dangerous remark, states [saw a
spike](https://people.com/health/states-report-spike-in-poison-control-calls-after-trump-disinfectant-comments/)
in poison control calls. A survey for the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention found that [a third of
Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6923e2.htm?s_cid=mm6923e2_w)
were “engaged in non-recommended high-risk practices with the intent of
preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including using bleach on food
products, applying household cleaning and disinfectant products to skin
and inhaling or ingesting cleaners and disinfectants.”

Trump pushed the use of hydroxychloroquine, without sufficient
scientific backing, to prevent transmission of the virus or to treat
infection, even saying that he [took a course of it
himself](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-he-s-no-longer-taking-hydroxychloroquine-n1214301).
The Food and Drug Administration approved an emergency use of the drug
for Covid-19. The federal government began to stockpile it. States
requested doses from the federal stockpile. Then, researchers found that
Covid-19 patients were more likely to die if they took the drug, not
less likely.

During the height of the crisis, some states experienced a [shortage of
ventilators](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/amid-grave-shortage-of-ventilators-some-hospitals-start-sharing-between-patients-searching-for-alternatives/)
to treat gravely ill patients. [Trump
claimed](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-16000-ventilators-stockpile-obama/index.html)
that the Obama administration had left no ventilators in the national
stockpile, that there were “empty cupboards.” In truth, his own
administration confirmed a few days ago that [16,660 ventilators were
availabl](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/trump-inherited-more-ventilators-than-have-been-distributed/)e
for use when Trump took office and in March, and outrageously the Trump
administration had distributed only 10,760 of them as of Tuesday. States
were scrambling for ventilators to keep people alive, and the Trump
administration held some back.

This all says nothing of Trump’s lag in using the Defense Production Act
to more quickly get supplies to cities and states.

Trump then pressured states to reopen economically even before those
states met the administration’s own guidelines for reopening. Now, many
of the states that quickly reopened, no doubt in part to please the
president, are the same ones in which cases are rising and more people
than necessary are dying.

Trump has even mocked the wearing of masks, which experts say is a
proven way to reduce virus transmission.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now Trump is having another mask-optional rally with yelling people
sitting and standing close together, a blatant violation of social
distancing rules.

It seems that in every possible way, Trump has willfully and arrogantly
put more Americans at risk of getting sick and dying, and the results
have been inevitable: More Americans got sick and died.

There is no way to remove Trump’s culpability in this. If your feeble
effort saves two lives when an earnest, robust, science-driven effort
would have saved four, are you not responsible for the two deaths?

At this point, how do we not label Trump a killer of American citizens
by negligence, ignorance and incompetence?
