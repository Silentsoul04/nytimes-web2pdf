An independent report on the coronavirus outbreak at the Holyoke
Soldiers' Home describes ``the opposite of infection control,'' as
administrators combined wards of infected and uninfected patients.

BOSTON --- An investigation of 76 deaths linked to the coronavirus at
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/they-survived-the-worst-battles-of-world-war-ii-and-died-of-the-virus.html}{a
state-run veterans' home} in Massachusetts paints a picture of a
facility in chaos, as traumatized nurses carried out orders to combine
wards of infected and uninfected men, knowing that the move would prove
deadly to many of their patients.

Workers at the facility, the Holyoke Soldiers' Home, remembered the days
in late March as ``total pandemonium'' and a ``nightmare.''

One social worker told investigators,
\href{https://www.mass.gov/doc/report-to-governor-baker-re-holyoke-soldiers-home/download}{in
a report released on Wednesday}, that she ``felt like it was moving the
concentration camp, we were moving these unknowing veterans off to
die.''

Another recalled sitting in a makeshift ward that was crowded with sick
and dying patients, some unclothed or without masks, and trying to
distract a man who was ``alert and oriented,'' chattering about the
Swedish meatballs his wife used to make.

``It was surreal,'' she said. ``I don't know how the staff over in that
unit, how many of us will ever recover from those images.''

Nursing home deaths have accounted for
\href{https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/27/metro/first-time-state-divulges-death-toll-by-nursing-home-more-than-80-have-20-or-more-covid-19-deaths/}{more
than 60 percent} of the fatalities from the coronavirus in
Massachusetts, a state that prides itself on its health care system.
None of those deaths have received more attention than the cluster at
the Holyoke Soldiers' Home, which housed frail veterans of World War II
and other conflicts.

The 174-page independent report, led by the former federal prosecutor
Mark Pearlstein, blasts decisions made by the facility's superintendent,
Bennett Walsh, as ``utterly baffling from an infection-control
perspective.''

The report was especially scathing on the decision to combine crowded
wards. But it catalogs a series of other errors, including failure to
isolate infected veterans, failure to test veterans who had symptoms,
and the rotation of staff members between wards, accelerating the spread
of the virus.

``In short, this was the opposite of infection control: Mr. Walsh and
his team created close to an optimal environment for the spread of
Covid-19,'' the report said.

Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said on Wednesday that the accounts
in the report were ``one of the most depressing and utterly shameful
descriptions of what was supposed to be a care system that I have ever
heard of.''

The state is acting to fire Mr. Walsh,
\href{https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/02/metro/holyoke-soldiers-home-has-been-overlooked-understaffed-led-by-inexperience/}{a
retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel} with no previous nursing home
experience, the governor said. A lawyer for Mr. Walsh was not
immediately available for comment.

Mr. Walsh's supervisor, Francisco Urena, resigned from his post as the
state's secretary of veterans' services on Tuesday in anticipation of
the report. Mr. Baker said the secretary was asked to step down.

``Our administration did not do the job we should have done overseeing
Bennett Walsh and the Soldiers' Home,'' Mr. Baker said.

``I'm very sorry,'' Mr. Urena told a reporter for WCVB, a local
television station. ``I tried my best.''

The report suggests that Mr. Walsh, who left the military after a
distinguished 24-year career, was selected by the home's Board of
Trustees in part because his family is politically powerful in western
Massachusetts, and that state officials were not happy with his
management, which was marked by a high rate of staff turnover.

Mr. Walsh, through his lawyer, disputed many elements of the report. He
said it ``contains many baseless accusations that are immaterial to the
issues under considerations,'' and that he would review legal actions.

``It is clear that Mr. Walsh reached out for help when the crisis
erupted,'' said a statement from the lawyer, William Bennett. ``The
failure of the Commonwealth to affirmatively respond to that request
contributed to many of the problems outlined in the report.''

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

Staff members told investigators that they were initially discouraged
from wearing protective equipment, in an effort to conserve a limited
supply, and that they felt ``annoyed, paranoid and fearful for their
lives because they could not find masks,'' the report said.

The most troubling portions of the report describe the weekend of March
28 and 29, when staffing was so short at the home that two wards were
hurriedly combined, a decision one employee described as ``the most
insane thing I ever saw in my entire life.''

A social worker described listening to the chief nursing officer say
``something to the effect that this room will be dead by Sunday, so we
will have more room here.'' Another social worker recalled seeing a
supervisor point to a room and say, ``All this room will be dead by
tomorrow.''

Several staff members told investigators that, in the confusion, some of
the dying men did not receive adequate pain relief medication.

None of the facility's top administrators acknowledged taking part in
the decision to combine the two wards, and its medical director, David
Clinton, told investigators he was not consulted.

``We find this not to be credible, and at the very least, that Dr.
Clinton was aware (or should have been aware) of the move and did
nothing to stop it,'' the report said.

Val Liptak, the interim administrator brought in to manage the crisis,
told investigators that, though she and her team had a ``collective
90-plus years of nursing'' among them, ``none of us have ever seen
anything like this.'' The overcrowded ward, she said, ``looked like a
war zone.''

Among the disturbing revelations in the report was that supervisors had
instructed social workers to call the families of sick veterans and try
to persuade them to change their end-of-life health care preferences, so
that the veterans would not be transferred to a hospital.

One social worker said she stopped making those calls because ``it felt
wrong,'' as she put it, ``in the pit of my belly and heart.''
