Joseph R.
[Biden](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/trump-biden-2020-election.html)
Jr. has taken a commanding lead over President
[Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/trump-biden-2020-election.html)
in the 2020 race, building a wide advantage among women and nonwhite
voters and making deep inroads with some traditionally
Republican-leaning groups that have shifted away from Mr. Trump
following his ineffective [response to the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html),
according to a new national
[poll](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/upshot/biden-trump-poll.html)
of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College.

Mr.
[Biden](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/upshot/joe-biden-voters-coronavirus.html)
is currently ahead of Mr. Trump by 14 percentage points, garnering 50
percent of the vote compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump. That is
among the most dismal showings of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and a sign
that he is the clear underdog right now in his fight for a second term.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has been an unpopular president for virtually his entire time
in office. He has made few efforts since his election in 2016 to broaden
his support beyond the right-wing base that vaulted him into office with
only [46
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president) of
the popular vote and a modest victory in the Electoral College.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But among a striking cross-section of voters, the distaste for Mr. Trump
has deepened as his administration failed to stop a deadly disease that
crippled the economy and then as he responded to a wave of
racial-justice protests with angry bluster and militaristic threats. The
dominant picture that emerges from the poll is of a country ready to
reject a president whom a strong majority of voters regard as failing
the greatest tests confronting his administration.

Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by enormous margins with black and Hispanic
voters, and women and young people appear on track to choose Mr. Biden
by an even wider margin than they favored Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump
in 2016. But the former vice president has also drawn even with Mr.
Trump among male voters, whites and people in middle age and older —
groups that have typically been the backbones of Republican electoral
success, including Mr. Trump’s in
2016.

Arlene Myles, 75, of Denver, said she had been a Republican for nearly
six decades before switching her registration to independent earlier
this year during Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial. Ms. Myles said that when
Mr. Trump was first elected, she had resolved to “give him a chance,”
but had since concluded that he and his party were irredeemable.

“I was one of those people who stuck by Nixon until he was waving
goodbye,” Ms. Myles said. “I thought I was a good Republican and thought
they had my values, but they have gone down the tubes these last few
years.”

Ms. Myles said she planned to vote for Mr. Biden, expressing only one
misgiving: “I wish he was younger,” she said.

Most stark may be Mr. Biden’s towering advantage among white women with
college degrees, who support him over Mr. Trump by 39 percentage points.
In 2016, exit polls found that group preferred Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Trump
by just 7 percentage points. The poll also found that Mr. Biden has
narrowed Mr. Trump’s advantage with less-educated white
voters.

The exodus of white voters from the G.O.P. has been especially
pronounced among younger voters, an ominous trend for a party that was
already heavily reliant on older Americans.

Fifty-two percent of whites under 45 said they supported Mr. Biden while
only 30 percent said they supported Mr. Trump. And their opposition is
intense: More than twice as many younger whites viewed the president
very unfavorably than very favorably.

Tom Diamond, 31, a Republican in Fort Worth, Texas, said he planned to
vote for Mr. Trump but would do so with real misgivings. He called the
president a “poor leader” who had mishandled the pandemic and said Mr.
Biden seemed “like a guy you can trust.” But Mr. Trump held views closer
to his own on the economy, health care and abortion.

“Part of you just feels icky voting for him,” Mr. Diamond said. “But
definitely from a policy perspective, that’s where my vote’s going to
go.”

Some unease toward Mr. Trump stems from voters’ racial attitudes.
According to the poll, white voters under 45 are overwhelmingly
supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, while older whites are
more tepid in their views toward racial justice activism. And nearly 70
percent of whites under 45 said they believed [the killing of George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)
was part of a broader pattern of excessive police violence toward
African-Americans rather than an isolated incident.

What’s striking, though, is that even among white seniors, one of Mr.
Trump’s strongest constituencies, he has damaged himself with his
conduct. About two-fifths of whites over 65 said they disapproved of Mr.
Trump’s handling of both the coronavirus and race relations.

Mr. Trump retains a few points of strength in the poll that could offer
him a way to regain a footing in the race, and the feeble condition of
his candidacy right now may well represent his low point in a campaign
with four and a half months still to go. In 2016, Mr. Trump often
trailed Mrs. Clinton in national polls by slimmer margins, and
ultimately overcame her lead in the popular vote with razor-thin
victories in key swing states.

His [approval
rating](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/trump-approval-older-voters-coronavirus.html)
is still narrowly positive on the issue of the economy, with 50 percent
of voters giving him favorable marks compared with 45 percent saying the
opposite. Should the fall campaign become a referendum on which
candidate is better equipped to restore prosperity after the pandemic
has subsided, that could give Mr. Trump a new opening to press his case.

The president is also still ahead of Mr. Biden among white voters
without college degrees, who hold disproportionate influence in
presidential elections because of how central the Midwest is to
capturing 270 electoral votes.

Yet if Mr. Trump still has a significant measure of credibility with
voters on the economy, he lacks any apparent political strength on the
most urgent issues of the moment: the pandemic and the national
reckoning on policing and race.

Nearly three-fifths of voters disapprove of Mr. Trump’s handling of the
coronavirus pandemic, including majorities of white voters and men.
Self-described moderate voters disapproved of Mr. Trump on the
coronavirus by a margin of more than two to one.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most of the country is also rejecting Mr. Trump’s call to reopen the
economy as quickly as possible, even at the cost of exposing people to
greater health risks. By a 21-point margin, voters said the federal
government should prioritize containing the coronavirus, even if it
hurts the economy, a view that aligns them with Mr. Biden.

Just a third of voters said the government should focus on restarting
the economy even if that entails greater public-health risks.

That debate could become the central focus of the campaign in the coming
weeks, as coronavirus outbreaks grow rapidly in a number of
Republican-led states that have resisted the strict lockdown measures
imposed in the spring by Democratic states like New York and California.

The public also does not share Mr. Trump’s resistance to mask wearing.
The president has declined to don a mask in nearly all public
appearances, even as top health officials in his administration have
urged Americans to do so as a precaution against spreading the
coronavirus. In the poll, 54 percent of people said they always wear a
mask when they expect to be in proximity to other people, while another
22 percent said they usually wear a mask.

Just 22 percent said they rarely or never wear a mask.

Mr. Trump’s job approval on race relations was just as dismal. Sixty-one
percent of voters said they disapproved of Mr. Trump’s handling of race,
versus 33 percent who said they approved. By a similar margin, voters
said they disapproved of his response to the protests after the death of
Mr. Floyd.

Mr. Trump has sought several times in the last month to use
demonstrations against the police as a political wedge issue, forcing
Democrats to align themselves squarely either with law-enforcement
agencies or with the most strident anti-police demonstrators.

The poll suggested most voters were rejecting that binary choice, as
well as Mr. Trump’s harsh characterization of protesters: Large
majorities said they had a positive overall assessment of both the Black
Lives Matter movement and the
police.

The picture of Mr. Biden that emerges from the poll is one of a broadly
acceptable candidate who inspires relatively few strong feelings in
either direction. He is seen favorably by about half of voters and
unfavorably by 42 percent. Only a quarter said they saw him very
favorably, equaling the share that sees him in very negative terms.

Mr. Trump, by contrast, is seen very favorably by 27 percent of voters
and very unfavorably by 50 percent.

Harry Hoyt, 72, of York County in Southern Maine, said he has sometimes
voted for Republican presidential candidates in the past and cast a
grudging vote for Mrs. Clinton in 2016. He felt better this time about
his plan to vote for Mr. Biden.

“Biden would be a better candidate than Trump, simply because he’s a
nice person,” Mr. Hoyt said. “One of the most important things to me is
the character of the man in charge of our country.”

Significantly, one group that saw Mr. Biden as far more than just
acceptable was black voters. Fifty-six percent of black respondents in
the poll said they saw Mr. Biden very favorably, a far more enthusiastic
judgment than from any other constituency.

The limited passion for Mr. Biden among other Democratic constituencies
does not appear to be affecting his position against Mr. Trump. Though
only 13 percent of people under 30 said they had a very favorable
opinion of the former vice president, that group is backing Mr. Biden
over Mr. Trump by 34 percentage points.

Nicholas Angelos, a 20-year-old voter in Bloomington, Ind., who said he
supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, said he
would vote for Mr. Biden as the “lesser of two evils.” He said he
believed the former vice president would “try his best,” in contrast to
Mr. Trump, whom he described as “an autocrat” and “anti-science.”

“We all have to compromise,” said Mr. Angelos, who described himself as
very liberal. He added of Mr. Biden, “I don’t think he’s anything
special.”

For the moment, voters also appear unpersuaded by one of the primary
attack lines Mr. Trump and his party have used against Mr. Biden: the
claim that, at age 77, he is simply too old for the presidency. Mr.
Trump, 74, has mocked Mr. Biden’s mental acuity frequently over the last
few months and his campaign has run television advertisements that cast
Mr. Biden as absent-minded and inarticulate.

But whatever reservations voters may have about Mr. Biden’s age, three
in five said they disagreed with the claim that he was too old to be an
effective president. The percentage of voters who agreed, 36 percent,
exactly matched Mr. Trump’s existing support in the presidential race.

Lindsay Clark, 37, who lives in the suburbs of Salt Lake City, was among
the voters who said she would probably vote for Mr. Trump because she
was unsure Mr. Biden was “physically and mentally up to the task” of
being president. But Ms. Clark expressed little admiration for Mr.
Trump, whom she called unpresidential.

Ms. Clark, who voted for a third-party candidate in 2016, said she was
hard-pressed to name something she really liked about Mr. Trump,
eventually settling on the idea that he expressed himself bluntly.

“I was just trying to think if I could think of something off the top of
my head that I was like, ‘Yes, I loved when you did that\!’” she said of
Mr. Trump. “And I kind of just
can’t.”

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: This fall’s presidential race is likely to be decided by a
    handful of battleground states won by President Trump in 2016. Nate
    Cohn on what a major new poll from The New York Times found about
    how voters in those states view the president and his Democratic
    rival.
    
    It’s Thursday, June 25.
    
    Nate, the last time we talked about polling in the presidential
    race, it was still the Democratic primary. It was back in November.
    And the polling that you all did showed that no matter which
    Democrat Donald Trump would face, he was doing OK.

  - nate cohn  
    Yeah. The polls showed that Donald Trump was pretty competitive. He
    was in a close race against all of his major Democratic rivals. He
    wasn’t always ahead. He was losing to Joe Biden, for instance. But
    he was in a pretty good and highly competitive spot, even at a
    moment where he was facing imminent prospect of impeachment in the
    House of Representatives. And so after all of that, for him still to
    be so close, it sure seemed like he was in a pretty decent position,
    all considered.

  - michael barbaro  
    So what was your thinking going into this next big poll that you all
    just finished?

  - nate cohn  
    Well, I did not think that Donald Trump would be doing quite as well
    as he had done in October. And there have been a lot of polls over
    the last couple of months indicating that Joe Biden has had a
    gradually building lead, both nationwide and in the battleground
    states. But given that we had such good results for the president in
    the past, I thought there was a pretty distinct possibility that we
    would show a race that was, you know, even if not extremely close,
    still competitive.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what happened once this polling got underway?

  - nate cohn  
    Well, we get the results back every morning from the last night of
    interviews. And from the start, it was pretty clear that this was a
    very different set of polling data.
    
    The first morning’s numbers were really bad for Trump. And you know,
    it’s something you try not to pay any attention to. It’s just one
    day of interviews, and the numbers change a lot. But you know, the
    next morning, and the next morning after that, it was bad again. And
    in the end, we polled for 14 days. And for all 14, the numbers were
    bad for the president. And they never got better.

  - michael barbaro  
    And just how bad?

  - nate cohn  
    Really bad. We did seven different polls. We have a national survey
    that showed Joe Biden leading by 14 points, 50 to 36 percent.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - nate cohn  
    We have six battleground state polls. These are the six states that
    Donald Trump won in 2016, but that were most closely fought last
    time — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North
    Carolina. And here again, Joe Biden had a considerable lead. He was
    up 9 percentage points across those six states, including a lead of
    at least six points in every one of them.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow. So that is legitimately, seriously bad polling data for the
    incumbent President, Donald Trump?

  - nate cohn  
    Yeah. I mean, if you look back historically, it is really hard to
    find an example of an incumbent president sitting in such a bad
    position heading into re-election. It’s worse than Jimmy Carter in
    1980 at this stage, or even in the final polls, for instance.

  - michael barbaro  
    Huh.

  - nate cohn  
    There’s just not much for the president to hang his hat on here.

  - michael barbaro  
    So let’s talk about what the battleground state polls show,
    specifically about why voters seem to be souring on President Trump.
    What’s the story that the data from these battleground state polls
    tell you about why that is?

  - nate cohn  
    The polls tell a really simple story. They say that voters across
    the battleground states have concluded that the president has failed
    to meet the most important crises of our political moment. They
    think he’s failed on the coronavirus. They think he’s failed on race
    relations. And they think he’s failed in the protests, and so on.
    And as a result, there has been a rebellion among white voters in
    the battleground states, the very voters that four years ago were
    responsible for the president’s persistent strength in these states.

  - michael barbaro  
    So before we get to the revolt of these white voters, which seems
    very important, let’s talk about these issues that voters do not
    think the president has properly managed and maybe go through a few
    of them, one by one.

  - nate cohn  
    I think it’s worth just breaking them down into two groups. One is
    the coronavirus. Voters disapprove of the way he’s handled it by a
    wide margin. 56 percent of voters in the battleground states say
    they disapprove, includes a significant number of people who voted
    for him in 2016. And it’s not just that they take issue with the
    president’s effectiveness. There’s an underlying disagreement
    between the president and the electorate about priorities.

  - michael barbaro  
    What do you mean?

  - nate cohn  
    So we asked voters whether they thought the federal government’s
    priority should be to limit the spread of the coronavirus, even if
    it hurts the economy. Or if they think the federal government’s
    priority should be to restart the economy, even if it increases the
    risk to public health. And voters in the battleground states said,
    by a 20-plus point margin, that they thought the priority ought to
    be to limit the spread of the coronavirus. And incredibly, that even
    includes the people who have lost their jobs as a result of the
    coronavirus over the last few months.

  - michael barbaro  
    I want to pause on this. Because this seems really fascinating. By
    20 percent, voters favor conquering the virus over reopening the
    American economy. Because that is the complete opposite of the
    message from the president.

  - nate cohn  
    It’s the complete opposite. And it really goes against so much of
    what we usually assume about American politics, right? It’s the
    economy, stupid. But here we have a rare issue where voters very
    explicitly are prioritizing something else. I can’t think of another
    comparison for it except war.

  - michael barbaro  
    Hm.

  - nate cohn  
    You know? In World War II, it’s not like if you had asked voters,
    what should be the priority, you know, helping the economy or
    beating the Japanese, that they would be like, oh, it’s the economy,
    stupid.

  - michael barbaro  
    Right. You’re saying with lives on the line, voters are telling us
    in this poll that the economy takes something of a backseat.

  - nate cohn  
    That’s right.

  - michael barbaro  
    What seems interesting is that the president is banking on an
    economic recovery, or goodwill over his management of the economy
    prior to the pandemic, to win re-election. But it sounds like from
    what you’re saying, that wouldn’t necessarily give him a boost,
    because voters are not prioritizing the economy the way they usually
    do.

  - nate cohn  
    Yeah. I mean, he’s right to think that’s his advantage. I mean,
    astonishingly, given the overall economic numbers, voters in the
    battleground states say they approve of the president’s handling of
    the economy, by a 15-point margin. That’s a —

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - nate cohn  
    — what, 30 points different than his overall approval rating? And
    the reason for that disconnect is just fundamental and simple. The
    coronavirus is more important. And they may appreciate what he’s
    done on the economy. But in this case, emphasizing the economy isn’t
    what they’re looking for.

  - michael barbaro  
    So what about the second big issue that you said voters disapprove
    of the president’s management of, which is race and the protests
    over race and policing?

  - nate cohn  
    Right. Just a whole spectrum of different issues relating to race
    and criminal justice and the protests, the president’s ratings are
    even worse on those issues than they are on the coronavirus. And
    here again, the president has this fundamental disconnect with the
    electorate, where his priorities aren’t the same as theirs. I mean,
    we asked whether they would rather have a candidate who says that we
    need to be tough on protests that go too far, or whether they would
    rather have a candidate who says we need to focus on the cause of
    protests, even when they go too far. And voters said, by a 40-point
    margin, that they would rather have the candidate who focuses on the
    cause of the protests, even when they’re going too far. And it’s
    also including a significant number of people who backed the
    president.

  - michael barbaro  
    So the gulf between how the president is talking about these
    protests and how voters across the battleground states are thinking
    about these protests is enormous.

  - nate cohn  
    Yeah. And I wouldn’t have guessed that, personally.

  - michael barbaro  
    So Nate, how does this disapproval of how the president’s handling
    these major crises, how does that explain this concept you touched
    on earlier of white voters revolting against the President?

  - nate cohn  
    Well, a pretty significant number of white voters in the
    battleground states do not side with the president, either his
    handling of the coronavirus or on these racial issues. And these are
    now the issues that are most important in the minds of voters in the
    battleground states. And so while maybe in 2016, a lot of these
    voters were focused on who would do the best on trade or
    immigration, now what’s on their mind is who is the best job
    handling protests and coronavirus. They’re not so sure they want to
    vote for the President anymore. In our poll, nearly 15 percent of
    the people who say they voted for President Trump in 2016 aren’t
    willing to say they support him against Joe Biden. And 7 percent of
    those voters say there’s almost no chance they’ll vote for him
    again.

  - michael barbaro  
    So 7 percent of his base plans on flipping, and 15 percent is very
    open to flipping, because of the way he has handled all of these
    complex questions over the past few months or year?

  - nate cohn  
    Yeah. And I should note they may not necessarily flip. They could
    vote third party. They could stay home. They have other options
    here. But a meaningful number of them at the moment say they would
    back Joe Biden for president.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - nate cohn  
    So at the moment, the president’s coalition, this core base of
    support among white voters that got him to victory in 2016, just is
    not there for him anymore. It has suffered serious defections,
    mainly at its periphery, you know, not the people wearing MAGA hats.
    But the sort of people who voted for Obama in 2012, backed Donald
    Trump in 2016 because they liked what he had to say about illegal
    immigration and trade, are not putting up with him right now.

  - michael barbaro  
    And who is this voter, this white voter who is now turning on the
    president four years later?

  - nate cohn  
    It’s a pretty broad group of white voters. It includes
    college-educated white voters. It includes white voters without a
    college degree. It includes young voters. Young white voters now
    back Joe Biden by 20 points.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - nate cohn  
    It includes older white voters. At the moment, the president is
    losing among seniors, who were the bedrock of his support in 2016.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow. You know, Nate, I’m curious if there’s a prototypical swing
    state region that you think of as being illustrative of everything
    that you’re describing here, this alienation, this disapproval of
    the way the president is handling everything since we last polled
    these battleground states.

  - nate cohn  
    Well, I could indulge you on that question. I could tell you about
    how in the Green Bay region of Wisconsin or in Northeast
    Pennsylvania or something that Joe Biden is now ahead, and Donald
    Trump won there big in 2016. But you know, frankly, it’s true
    everywhere. There are no exceptions here. There’s no place where the
    president’s holding up fairly well and I can be like, that’s the
    place where it’s particularly bad. There’s no region that epitomizes
    this more than any other. I could choose anywhere and tell you that
    the president appears to be losing ground among white voters. It’s
    true in the battleground states. It’s true nationally. It’s true
    everywhere.

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    OK. Nate, let’s talk about what these polls, both the national poll,
    but especially the six battleground state polls, have told us about
    Joe Biden and why he seems to be leading so handsomely over Donald
    Trump.

  - nate cohn  
    You know, my honest answer is that I think our answers on Joe Biden
    are kind of boring.

  - michael barbaro  
    Boring how?

  - nate cohn  
    You know, the voters, they like Joe Biden. He’s got a 50 percent
    favorability rating. It’s fine. They don’t seem to have a very
    strong opinion of him either way. They do think he would do a better
    job than Trump on almost every issue, except the economy and China.
    But there’s not a groundswelling of support for him. And there’s not
    particularly deep opposition to him either. Instead, 55 percent of
    voters say there is at least some chance they would vote for him. So
    that to me indicates that a pretty broad swath of the electorate is
    at least considering the guy at this stage.

  - michael barbaro  
    Hm. And what you’re describing is an alternative, rather than a
    charismatic figure that voters are looking to with great ardor.

  - nate cohn  
    I think that’s right. A lot of the divides that you might think
    about in American politics today, like between young and old, and so
    on. They don’t really even exist on Joe Biden. Everyone just kind of
    has a modestly favorable view of him. And there are many
    circumstances in which maybe that’s not the exact candidate you’d
    want to run for president. But it may be exactly the right candidate
    at a time when a clear majority of the electorate has resolved that
    it does not want to reelect the current president.

  - michael barbaro  
    Nate, you’re painting a scenario in which Joe Biden seems to be
    thriving as a reflection of President Trump’s weakness. And that’s a
    familiar concept in presidential campaigns. But I went through the
    battleground state poll that you sent me about 24 hours ago. And I
    was really struck by the number of issues on which respondents to
    the poll said they thought that Joe Biden would do a better job than
    President Trump. It was immigration. It was protests. It was the
    pandemic. And so how do we know whether that is a reflection of
    President Trump, or a true sense that people believe Joe Biden is
    inherently the best person to do those things?

  - nate cohn  
    You know, it’s a great question. Unfortunately, the way that we’ve
    asked this question to voters, I don’t think we can disentangle
    whether they think Joe Biden would be good versus believing that
    Donald Trump is bad. We’re just asking voters whether they think Joe
    Biden would do a better job than Donald Trump. And so I don’t think
    we can pull out the varying effects of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on
    that. I do think, though, that one thing that stands out to me is
    how much the results of those questions matches up with Trump’s
    approval rating on those issues, which at least to me implies that
    it’s more about the president than it is about Joe Biden.

  - michael barbaro  
    Hm. In other words, disapproval of the president is kind of mirrored
    in the data of approval or the belief that Joe Biden would do
    something better?

  - nate cohn  
    That’s right.

  - michael barbaro  
    This data clearly suggests there’s not a tremendous amount of
    passion around Joe Biden. And yet, he’s developed this very
    significant lead over President Trump. And so I wonder whether that
    means that the electability case for Joe Biden, which was debated
    endlessly throughout the primary, has kind of proven to be exactly
    what Joe Biden and the people around him said it would be now that
    there’s a two person race, Biden versus Trump.

  - nate cohn  
    Well, I don’t think we can run the counterfactual and see whether
    Elizabeth Warren would be leading today if she had been the
    Democratic nominee or Bernie Sanders. What I think we can say is
    that the case for Joe Biden’s electability is playing out here. The
    case for Joe Biden’s electability was always that a sufficient
    number of voters do not want to re-elect the president, so choose
    someone who maximizes the appeal of the Democratic candidate with
    the broadest number of voters. I don’t know whether that means that
    a different candidate would be doing better or worse than Joe Biden.
    But what we do know is that Joe Biden is up nine points across
    battleground states that voted for Trump last time. He’s up 14
    points nationwide. And he would have a distinct chance of winning by
    the widest margin of any candidate in my lifetime.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, Nate, that leads me to a very important and delicate question
    that involves you and me. Because four years ago, we were having a
    conversation about polling. And Donald Trump was down in those
    polls. I was the host of a different show called “The Run Up.” You
    were the first guest on the first episode. And the title of that
    episode was, “Could Hillary Clinton Win in a Landslide?” So I think
    you know where this question is now headed.

  - nate cohn  
    How could I not?

  - michael barbaro  
    So what is different about this lead, if anything, that makes you
    and should make us trust it?

  - nate cohn  
    Well, I think we should all approach this with a lot of humility. I
    mean, polling is tough the day before the election. It’s really
    tough five months before the election. The national environment has
    changed a lot in the last five months. It can change a lot in the
    next five months. That said, I think that this lead is different
    from Hillary Clinton’s lead. It doesn’t mean that Donald Trump can’t
    win. But it is different. It’s different in two ways. One, it’s a
    wider lead. Joe Biden is up by more. If the polls were just as wrong
    as they were in 2016, and the election were held tomorrow, Joe Biden
    would still win. I mean, the polls could be more wrong. There’s no
    law of polling that says that 2016 is the worst case scenario or
    something. But this is a bigger advantage than Hillary Clinton had
    down the final stretch. It’s a more persistent advantage. And it’s
    wider than even her peaks. The second difference is a methodological
    one, which is that we are much more focused on the battleground
    states this time than we were in 2016. In 2016, we had really good
    national polling. And we did not have very much good polling in the
    battleground states. We have resolved to flip that around, to try
    and deal with the things that went wrong four years ago. None of
    that ensures that our results will be perfect if the election were
    held tomorrow. But it is a reason why it is less likely that these
    polls would be fundamentally wrong in the same way that so many
    state polls were fundamentally wrong four years ago.

  - michael barbaro  
    A key caveat, however, seems to be that the lead that Joe Biden has
    developed over these past few months has occurred when he has been
    largely invisible. Right? I mean, this has been a very unusual
    campaign in the sense that the President is as visible as he’s ever
    been, every day — at the White House, on Twitter and now campaign
    rallies. Whereas Joe Biden has been largely quarantined and kind of
    offstage. Inevitably, that will change. And I wonder how much that
    could begin to alter some of the dynamics of these polls.

  - nate cohn  
    I think that it absolutely could begin to help narrow the race. And
    this was the pattern in 2016, by the way. There were these moments
    of the race when the talk was always about Donald Trump. And he
    would get in these fights. The news would be all about how Donald
    Trump said this ridiculous stuff. All these Republicans would be
    criticizing him. And then Hillary Clinton would have this lead. And
    then two weeks later, something would happen, when it was her
    emails, or the “deplorables” line, or random health scares, and so
    on. And Hillary Clinton’s lead would fall right back down to a more
    competitive race. And I think it is certainly possible that if
    voters focus as much on Joe Biden at any point in this election
    cycle as they focused on Hillary Clinton, that would probably lead
    to a tighter race than the one we have now.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Perhaps put more simply, what you’re saying is that campaigning in
    absentia, essentially, is working for Joe Biden. And it’s working
    pretty well.

  - nate cohn  
    Absolutely. I mean, the fundamentals of the race right now are that
    Donald Trump is really unpopular. Donald Trump is the defining
    feature of the race. That adds up to a big win for Joe Biden right
    now. If that formulation changes, and Joe Biden is just as important
    in the minds of voters as Donald Trump, maybe Joe Biden’s lead would
    shrink a lot. Maybe it would shrink a little. I don’t know. But what
    I can say is that this particular dynamic is working out really well
    for Joe Biden.

  - michael barbaro  
    Nate, thank you very much. And I want to warn you that we are going
    to be doing this a lot for the next five months, but not too much.

  - nate cohn  
    Thank you for having me. And I am looking forward to it.

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    Here’s what else you need to know today.

was chased down and killed while jogging in South Georgia, three white
men were indicted on charges ranging from malice murder to false
imprisonment.

    This is another positive step, another great step for finding
    justice for Ahmaud, for finding justice for this family and the
    community beyond.

Local police were slow to arrest and charge the three men, prompting the
first in a series of public protests in the past few months over the
extrajudicial killing of black Americans. And the U.S. recorded nearly
37,000 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the highest single-day
total since the pandemic began. With infections rising so quickly, the
City of Houston said it was running out of intensive care beds. The
governor of Texas urged residents to stay inside. And Washington and
North Carolina said they would require that masks be worn in public.

    We’re going to have a quarantine on visitors from those states that
    have a positivity rate north of 10 percent over a seven day moving
    average. So it could change a little bit over time. Hopefully, those
    states that are so grave — Florida, Texas, Arizona — will come back
    with a lower infection rate.

In the Northeast, where infection rates have declined, the governors of
three neighboring states — New York, New Jersey and Connecticut — said
they would require a two-week quarantine for travelers coming from
states where cases are surging.

  - archived recording (ned lamont)  
    What that means in terms of quarantine will be enforced differently
    in different states. What we want to do here in the state of
    Connecticut is one, if you come up from those states and you haven’t
    tested, and you haven’t had a negative test, you’re coming up here,
    you’ve got to quarantine for 14 days.
