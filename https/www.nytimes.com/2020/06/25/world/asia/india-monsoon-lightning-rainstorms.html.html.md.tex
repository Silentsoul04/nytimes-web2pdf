NEW DELHI --- Scores of people died in violent rainstorms in
northeastern India on Thursday, including many farmers working in their
fields and children playing outside who were killed by lightning
strikes, Indian officials said.

The storms came as the yearly monsoon rains began in northern India,
sweeping across the subcontinent and drenching cities and towns in their
path.

``Nature's fury was at its worst today,'' said Manoj Kumar Tiwary, a top
police official in the state of Bihar, which reported on its Facebook
page that 83 people had died of lightning strikes across the state.
Officials also reported widespread damage to property across the state.

``Some were walking, some were working in fields,'' he said, adding that
the dead included ``children playing in the courtyards of their
houses.''

Each year,

kills thousands of people in India}. According to the National Crime
Records Bureau, which classifies lightning strikes as a cause of
accidental death,
\href{https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/chapter-1-accidents-2018.pdf}{2,357
people across India died in 2018} from lighting strikes that year, the
last year for which such data was available.

But the high numbers of deaths in such a short time span are much rarer.
During a two-day period in
2016,\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/world/asia/india-lightning-deaths-bihar-monsoon.html}{lightning
strikes killed at least 70 people} in the country. That time, many of
the fatalities were also around Bihar.

India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, expressed condolences in a
Twitter message, saying the state government is ``engaged in relief work
with promptness.''

``In some districts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, heavy rains and
lightning caused the death of many people,''
\href{https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1276160894557401091}{Mr.
Modi wrote in Hindi}, ``I express my condolences to the families of
those who have lost their lives in this disaster.''

The India Meteorological Department said on Thursday thunderstorms are
likely to hit flood-prone areas of Bihar and along its long and porous
border with Nepal.

Pushpesh Singh, an official in Uchhati village in eastern Bihar, said in
a telephone interview that he saw villagers running for their lives
after a tree was hit by a lightning bolt. One woman in a nearby field,
he said, died while she was planting in her field.

``Some people are still refusing to go back to their homes,'' Mr. Singh
said, ``They are too frightened.''
