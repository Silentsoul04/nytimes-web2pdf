## Beyoncé, ‘Black Parade’

<div class="css-14bkxgk">

</div>

[Beyoncé](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/arts/music/beyonce-black-is-king.html)
released “Black Parade” on Juneteenth, and it makes ambitious,
far-reaching connections. The lyrics allude to black American
achievement, culture and struggle, to African history and deities, to
the power of women, to Beyoncé’s own success and to this month’s
[protests](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles):
“Rubber bullets bouncin’ off me/Made a picket sign off your picket
fence/Take it as a warning.” The music pulls its own connections — to
trap electronics, African songs, brass bands, gospel choirs — while
Beyoncé flaunts new melody ideas in each verse. Voices gather around
her, as her solo strut turns into a parade, or a more purposeful march:
“Put your fists up in the air/Show black love,” she insists. JON

## Prince, ‘Witness 4 the Prosecution (Version 1)’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Witness 4 the Prosecution (Version 1)” is the first previously
unreleased song from what will be a vastly expanded reissue of Prince’s
1987 double album “Sign ‘o’ the Times,” due Sept. 25. It’s meaty
funk-rock that sounds like it was recorded live: heavy on the backbeat,
with sassy horns, thumb-popping bass, a gospelly backup choir (shouting
“witness\!”) and biting, distorted lead guitar, all stoking Prince as
he testifies in a case of obsessive love. PARELES

## Dinner Party featuring Phoelix, ‘Freeze Tag’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dinner Party is the alliance of the producers and musicians 9th Wonder,
Terrace Martin, Kamasi Washington and Robert Glasper. Phoelix joins them
to sing “Freeze Tag,” about an all-too-common scenario: “They told me
put my hands up behind my head/I think they got the wrong one,” he
recounts in a high, gentle croon. “Then they told me if I move, they
gon’ shoot me dead.” The music is quiet-storm R\&B, complete with wind
chimes, but as the chord progression circles and Phoelix sings the verse
again and again, the fraught, frozen moment grows harrowing. PARELES

## Sun Ra Arkestra, ‘Seductive Fantasy’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than 25 years after Sun Ra’s death, the Afrofuturist pioneer’s
ensemble continues to uphold his legacy in performances around the
world, but it hasn’t released a studio album of new music in two
decades. That will change later this year. The first single from the
Arkestra’s forthcoming LP is “Seductive Fantasy,” a slow-moving,
blood-pumping vamp that first appeared on [the 1979 album “On
Jupiter.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyTdUr1u9ok) On the new
version, the first sound you hear is the steady baritone saxophone line
of [Danny Ray
Thompson](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/arts/music/danny-ray-thompson-dead.html),
who played on the original too; he died just months after this newer
recording was made. Across a quick four minutes, saxophones carry a
simple melody, then join up with the reeds to make a messy gouache of
harmonies while Marshall Allen’s alto saxophone nearly flies off the
handle, squealing its way toward liftoff. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

## Charlie Puth, ‘Girlfriend’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some pleasant falsetto funk from [Charlie
Puth](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/arts/music/charlie-puth-voicenotes-interview.html),
a formalist with a lithe voice and a cloying demeanor. “Baby would you
ever want to be my girlfriend?” he coos. “I don’t want to play no
games/this is more than just a phase.” It’s effective, but perhaps not
quite as catchy as his [recent commercials for
Subway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD61F6SNkTo). JON CARAMANICA

## The Chicks, ‘March March’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Chicks — [they have dropped
Dixie](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/arts/music/dixie-chicks-change-name.html)
in this moment of rejecting references to the Civil War-era South — are
a long way from traditional country in “March March” from their coming
album, “Gaslighter.” The initial beat is an electronic thump and blip,
and the lyrics are topical and sometimes profane, praising the teenage
activists who are demanding gun control and environmental action:
“Watching our youth have to solve our problems/I’m standing with them,
who’s coming with me?” sings Natalie Maines. Fiddle and banjo do arrive
— and the tune has modal Appalachian echoes — but the song sends a
message for right now. PARELES

## Becca Mancari, ‘Lonely Boy’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Becca Mancari and her producer, Zac Farro from Paramore, build a
Minimalist latticework of plucked strings, syncopated drums and pealing
guitars — Stereolab gone to Nashville — as she sings “Are you a lonely
boy?” in an upturned phrase like an encouraging smile. “Lonely Boy” is
from her new album, “The Greatest Part”; she has said she [wrote it
about her
dog](https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/06/becca-mancari-origins-lonely-boy-stream/),
but its affection extends further. PARELES

## Nadine Shah, ‘Trad’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Take me to the ceremony/Make me holy matrimony,” Nadine Shah sings,
layering on vocal harmonies as a guitar line buzzes around her like a
persistent mosquito. It’s from her new album, “Kitchen Sink,” which is
by turns sardonic and haunted. The verses of “Trad” are dryly skeptical
about the institution of marriage, while that chorus makes it sound like
an ominous, decisive ritual. PARELES

## Flock of Dimes, ‘Like So Much Desire’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Like So Much Desire” is the title song from an absorbing new EP by
Flock of Dimes, Jenn Wasner’s solo project when she’s not fronting Wye
Oak. It’s a gorgeous, lofty waltz, with synthesizers billowing around
acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies, as Wasner sings an enigmatic
reverie about “losing the old for the new, like so much desire.” PARELES

## boyband, ‘Tattoo’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

First came the first-wave protean [SoundCloud
rappers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/arts/music/soundcloud-rap-lil-pump-smokepurrp-xxxtentacion.html),
followed by the auteur era of [Lil
Peep](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/arts/music/lil-peep-archives-come-over-when-youre-sober.html)
and his acolytes. This song, the fourth single from boyband — a producer
affiliated with the Internet Money collective — perhaps suggests the
third wave of the emo-rap revival is here. The sentiment is satisfyingly
direct, if delivered a little awkwardly in places. But at the hook,
boyband summons an image that’s tough and soft all at once: “Might
tattoo your name so I can watch it fade away.”

## Jack Harlow featuring DaBaby, Tory Lanez and Lil Wayne, ‘Whats Poppin’ (Remix)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wafting up from TikTok ubiquity, “Whats Poppin” has been a surprising
breakthrough for the brash and buoyant rapper Jack Harlow, with a jiggly
beat that leavens him just enough. Now, six months after the song’s
initial release, it’s hovering in the Top 20 of the Hot 100 and has
earned a posse-cut remix of heavyweights: DaBaby, pugnacious and
indignant; Tory Lanez, thirsty and salacious; and Lil Wayne, as limber
as he’s sounded in quite some time. CARAMANICA

## Arca, ‘Mequetrefe’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Arca’s music has often been a barrage, summoning peak impact from sounds
that are cranked up, maxed out and then suddenly truncated, as if
they’ve hurtled directly into a brick wall. Her new album, “KiCk i,”
mingles that attack with flashes of quasi-pop. The slapping, sputtering
percussion in “Mequetrefe” (a derogatory Spanish slang term for certain
men) is joined by a pretty instrumental line, and Arca’s vocal chants
are patterned like song verses and choruses; still, impact prevails.

## Nicole Mitchell and Lisa E. Harris, ‘Purify Me With the Power to Transform’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The flutist [Nicole
Mitchell](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/arts/music/nicole-mitchell-black-earth-ensemble-mandorla-awakening.html)
and the vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Lisa E. Harris both use
composition and sound to open up listeners to bold new ways of thinking
about the world, and to encourage them to see past its present-day
limitations. Both have long taken inspiration from the allegorical
science-fiction writings of Octavia Butler; for their first
collaboration, Mitchell and Harris wrote “EarthSeed,” an album-length
suite of compositions, based on a [Butlerian
idea](https://www.goodreads.com/series/57804-earthseed). “Purify Me With
the Power to Transform” is the closing piece, a drift of voices and
strings and ambient tones that sounds like it’s bidding goodbye to a
broken present. RUSSONELLO
