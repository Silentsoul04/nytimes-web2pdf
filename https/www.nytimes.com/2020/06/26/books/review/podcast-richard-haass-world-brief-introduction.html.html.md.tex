The ambition of Richard Haass's new book is clear from its title:
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/books/review/the-world-richard-haass.html}{``The
World: A Brief Introduction.''} In just 400 pages, Haass, who has been
the president of the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations since
2003, offers a primer on world affairs. On this week's podcast, Haass
talks about why he wrote it.

``The whole lesson of this pandemic, and the whole lesson of 9/11, is we
can't ignore the world, or if we do ignore the world, it's at our
peril,'' Haass says. ``These oceans that surround us are not moats.
We've got to pay attention to the world \emph{and} we've got to fix
things here at home.''

Abhrajyoti Chakraborty visits the podcast to discuss his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/books/review/miri-alvarez-shibli-appanah.html}{recent
review of four novels in translation}, including Yu Miri's ``Tokyo Ueno
Station,'' translated by Morgan Giles. The novel is narrated by Kazu, a
dead man who spent his final years in a camp of homeless people in
Tokyo's Ueno Park and haunts the area after his death.

``It's modernist in the sense that it's narrated in a very experimental
way,'' Chakraborty says. ``Kazu isn't always just speaking about his
stories or confessing his feelings. It's interspersed with, say,
conversations he might be overhearing from people around the park, be it
visitors or his fellow homeless dwellers. He's a ghost, so sometimes
he'll just disappear into one of the nearby museums and you have pages
of descriptions of paintings or what's really happening inside
galleries.''

Also on this week's episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the
publishing world; and Tina Jordan and John Williams talk about what
people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.

Here are the books discussed in this week's ``What We're Reading'':
