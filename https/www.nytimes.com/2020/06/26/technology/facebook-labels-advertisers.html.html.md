SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook rolled out measures on Friday to add more
context to problematic political posts on its site, as the social
network grappled with a growing outcry from some of its largest
advertisers over the issue of hateful speech.

Facebook said it would attach labels to all posts across its network
that discuss the subject of voting, in a move intended to hamper any
disenfranchisement of voters in the November election. The labels will
direct users to accurate voting information, the company said.

In addition, Facebook said it would expand its policies around hate
speech and prohibit a wider category of hateful language in ads on the
site. A post that violates Facebook’s rules but is from an important
political figure, such as President Trump, will get a label saying it
was deemed “newsworthy” enough to remain, the company said.

Facebook has been trying to deal with its role in spreading
disinformation and divisive content. The Silicon Valley company has been
under fire for allowing inaccurate or inflammatory posts from Mr. Trump
to remain unaltered on its site, even as [Twitter has attached fact
checks and
warnings](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/technology/twitter-trump-dorsey.html)
to the same content on its service.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has said that [he believes
in supporting free
speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/zuckerberg-facebook-free-speech.html)
and that posts from political leaders should not be policed because they
are in the public’s interests to view and read. But critics have said
Mr. Zuckerberg is simply allowing hateful speech to flourish on the
social network with few limits.

In recent weeks, Facebook has faced increasing opposition to its
position on hateful speech from one of its most important constituents:
advertisers, which generate the bulk of its [$70.7
billion](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx)
in annual revenue. Brands like Eddie Bauer, Ben & Jerry’s and Magnolia
Pictures have announced that they will [cease buying advertising on
Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/business/media/facebook-ad-boycott.html)
until it reconsiders its
stance.

On Friday, more companies said they would pull back from advertising on
Facebook because of hateful speech remaining on the site. They included
Unilever, the British-Dutch maker of consumer goods and one of
Facebook’s largest advertisers;
[Coca-Cola](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/coca-cola-pauses-advertising-on-all-social-media-platforms-globally.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain),
which is another big advertiser on social media; and [Levi
Strauss](https://twitter.com/levis/status/1276670275732398081?s=21), the
maker of Levi’s and Dockers clothing. On Thursday, Verizon also said it
was [pausing its
advertising](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303717/verison-facebook-adl-ad-boycott-instagram-north-face-rei-ben-and-jerrys)
on Facebook.

“The stakes are too high,” said Steve Lesnard, vice president of
marketing at the North Face, a clothing brand that is participating in
the ad boycott. “The platform needs to evolve.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Facebook has also been grappling with an internal uproar over Mr.
Trump’s inflammatory posts. [Employees staged a virtual
walkout](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html)
this month in protest of Mr. Zuckerberg’s position of allowing the posts
to remain. Some of the company’s earliest workers have also [implored
the chief executive to change his
mind](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/technology/facebook-trump-employees-letter.html)
in an open letter.

Mr. Zuckerberg has refused to budge, though he said he and others on his
policy team will review the company’s rules.

Since then, Facebook has made modifications that do not require it to
pull down hateful speech but that give people more options with such
posts. The company said this month that it would allow people in the
United States to [opt out of seeing social-issue, electoral or political
ads](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/technology/opt-out-political-ads-facebook.html)
from candidates or political action committees in their Facebook or
Instagram feeds, for example.

On Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a livestreamed address to his
employees, “I’m committed to making sure Facebook remains a place where
people can use their voice to discuss important issues, because I
believe we can make more progress when we hear each other.”

He added, “But I also stand against hate, or anything that incites
violence or suppresses voting, and we’re committed to removing that no
matter where it comes from.”

He said the definition of hate speech would grow to prohibit ads that
claim “people from a specific race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or
immigration status are a threat to the physical safety, health or
survival of others.” He said the policy would expand to protect
immigrants, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers “from ads suggesting
these groups are inferior or expressing contempt, dismissal or disgust
directed at them.”

For posts on voting, the company said it would attach links to what
Facebook calls its “voter information center,” an initiative it has
pushed in recent weeks to provide users with more data on elections.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yael Eisenstat, a visiting fellow at Cornell Tech, who in 2018 headed
the elections integrity team for political ads at Facebook, said the
changes “are important and good steps.”

“They should have come a long time ago, but clearly there has been an
incredible amount of pressure,” she said.

She added that it was still an “open question” as to whether Facebook
would “enforce these policies against the less clear-cut posts by the
president that are intentionally sowing distrust in the electoral
process.”
