*\[Read more on* [*Roger Stone’s sentence being commuted by President
Trump*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html)*.\]*

WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday denied a request by President
Trump’s friend [Roger J. Stone
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/roger-stone-facebook.html)
for a two-month delay before he begins serving his prison term, despite
the fact that his motion was unopposed by the Justice Department.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia granted Mr. Stone an additional two weeks before he
must report to a federal prison in Jesup, Ga., but ordered him placed
under home confinement in the meantime.

The judge’s order seemed to reflect some impatience about why Mr. Stone,
a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, had not yet been imprisoned. In
a trial Judge Jackson oversaw, [a jury convicted
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html)
in November on seven felonies, including lying to federal investigators,
tampering with a witness and impeding a congressional inquiry. The judge
[sentenced
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/roger-stone-40-months-sentencing-verdict.html)
in February to 40 months in prison.

The Bureau of Prisons initially ordered Mr. Stone, 67, to report to
prison in April, then put off the date until June 30 after the judge, in
an order denying him a new trial, said his imprisonment should begin no
sooner than April 30.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then this month, citing the pandemic, Mr. Stone asked Judge Jackson to
delay his imprisonment until Sept. 1. He noted his age and health
concerns, which were not publicly
revealed.

In a nod to the intense criticism over the Justice Department’s handling
of the case, prosecutors told Judge Jackson that they did not oppose the
delay — but purely because of department guidelines for defendants who
are about to begin their prison terms and pose no risk of flight or
threat to public safety.

“There is no instance in which this office has opposed a request to
extend a self-surrender date during the pandemic,” prosecutors in
Washington said this week in a filing to the judge. The department’s
stance was drafted “to conform with our policy and practice — and for no
other reason,” its lawyers said.

That seemed to conflict with a statement from Mr. Stone’s lawyers. Their
filing to the judge said government lawyers had told them this month
that the Bureau of Prisons “was no longer extending surrender dates
based on Covid-19 and that, therefore, B.O.P. would not be changing
Stone’s June 30, 2020, surrender date.”

After further discussions, Mr. Stone’s lawyers said, they were informed
that the department would not oppose his request for a delay.

The Justice Department’s handling of Mr. Stone’s case has been deeply
fraught. He was one of a string of former Trump aides who were charged
as a result of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S.
Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016
election.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

After Attorney General William P. Barr reversed their sentencing
recommendation for a stiff prison term, four career prosecutors quit the
case and one of them left the department entirely. This week, in [a
statement](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/7042-aaron-zelinsky-testimony/ad5f15a1e37896bd07bb/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
to the House Judiciary Committee during an oversight hearing, one of
those prosecutors said his superiors cited “heavy pressure from the
highest levels of the Department of Justice to cut Stone a break.”

“What I heard — repeatedly — was that Roger Stone was being treated
differently from any other defendant because of his relationship to the
president,” said [the prosecutor, Aaron S.J.
Zelinsky](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/justice-department-politicization.html).
Mr. Zelinsky has now left his assignment in the United States attorney’s
office in Washington but remains a department prosecutor in Baltimore.

Mr. Barr has dismissed Mr. Zelinsky’s account as hearsay.

The coronavirus has been spreading through federal prisons. So far, 89
inmates and one staff member have died of the disease, according to
Bureau of Prisons statistics.

In an Instagram post this month, Mr. Stone complained that he had been
ordered to serve his sentence in a prison that had a “substantial”
problem with the virus, while other high-profile prisoners were granted
reprieves.

But Judge Jackson wrote that Mr. Stone’s prison was as yet “unaffected.”
She said two weeks of home confinement for Mr. Stone would help protect
other inmates “who share defendant’s anxiety over the potential
introduction and spread of the virus.”
