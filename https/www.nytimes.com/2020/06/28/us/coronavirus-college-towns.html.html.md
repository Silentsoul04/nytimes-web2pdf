DAVIS, Calif. — The community around the University of California,
Davis, used to have a population of 70,000 and a thriving economy.
Rentals were tight. Downtown was jammed. Hotels were booked months in
advance for commencement. Students swarmed to the town’s bar crawl,
sampling the trio of signature cocktails known on campus as “the Davis
Trinity.”

Then came the coronavirus. When the campus closed in March, an estimated
20,000 students and faculty left town.

With them went about a third of the demand for goods and services, from
books to bikes to brunches. City officials are expecting most of that
demand to stay gone even as the economy reopens.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fall classes will be mostly remote, the university announced last week,
with “reduced density” in dorms. Davis’s incoming vice mayor, Lucas
Frerichs, said the city was anticipating “a huge impact” with a majority
of the university’s 39,000-plus students still dispersed in September.

For “townies,” rules require congregation to remain limited, too, as
confirmed coronavirus cases continue to climb in California. One of the
Davis Trinity bars has closed, with no plan to reopen. On a recent
Sunday, downtown was filled with “takeout only” signs and half-empty,
far-flung cafe tables. Outside the closed theater, a lone busker stood
on a corner playing “Swan Lake” on a violin to virtually no one.

Efforts to stem the pandemic have squeezed local economies across the
nation, but the threat is starting to look existential in college towns.

Reliant on institutions that once seemed impervious to recession, “town
and gown” communities that have evolved around rural campuses — Cornell,
Amherst College, Penn State — are confronting not only Covid-19 but also
major losses in population, revenue and jobs.

Where business as usual has been tried, punishment has followed: This
week, Iowa health authorities [reported case
spikes](https://ktiv.com/2020/06/23/virus-cases-spike-among-young-adults-in-iowa-college-towns-2/)
among young adults in its two largest college towns, Ames and Iowa City,
after the governor allowed bars to reopen. And on campuses across the
country, [attempts to bring back football
teams](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-coronavirus-cases.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
for preseason practice have resulted in outbreaks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than 130 coronavirus cases have been linked to athletic departments
at 28 Division I universities. At Clemson, at least 23 football players
and two coaches have been infected. At Arkansas State University, seven
athletes across three teams tested positive. And at the University of
Houston, the athletic department stopped off-season workouts after an
outbreak was
discovered.

Sports are not the only source of outbreaks in college towns.
Mississippi officials tied several cases to fraternity rush parties that
apparently flouted social distancing rules. In Baton Rouge, La., at
least 100 cases were linked to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district
near Louisiana State’s campus. And in Manhattan, Kan., home to Kansas
State, officials said Wednesday that there had been two recent
outbreaks: one on the football team, and another in the Aggieville
entertainment district just off campus.

For the cities involved, the prognosis is also daunting. In most college
towns, university students, faculty and staff are a primary market.
Local economies depend on their numbers and dollars, from sales taxes to
football weekends to federal funds determined by the U.S. census.

Students at Ohio University represent three-quarters of the usual
population of Athens, Ohio. In Ithaca, N.Y., every other person in town
is — or used to be — connected to Cornell or Ithaca College.

The local economy in Ann Arbor, Mich., takes in [nearly $95 million a
year](https://communityrelations.umich.edu/facts-figures/) in
discretionary spending from the University of Michigan’s 45,000-plus
students. Ari Weinzweig, cofounding partner of Zingerman’s, a landmark
bakery and deli, said sales have been down 50 percent, and the company
has had to furlough nearly 300 of its 700 employees since the pandemic.

The town’s Literati Bookstore launched a [GoFundMe
campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-literati-bookstore-amp-booksellers)
to keep from going out of business, and created a virtual site for its
famed “[public typewriter](https://www.publictypewriter.com/)” so
customers could keep leaving anonymous typed messages, a company
tradition. (“Oh how I wish for a coffee not made by my own hands,”
someone typed online in May.)

In State College, Pa., [an estimated 65
percent](http://www.statecollegepa.us/DocumentCenter/View/9291/State-College-Neighborhood-Plan-Borough-Wide-Conditions?bidId=)
of the community is made up of students at Penn State’s main campus, a
local juggernaut that enrolls 46,000 students,
[employs](https://factbook.psu.edu/factbook/HrDynamic/EmployeesbyClassificationSummaryPSULaw.aspx?YearCode=2019humors&FBPlusIndc=N)
more than 17,000 nonstudents and injects [about $128 million a
year](https://www.psu.edu/ur/newsdocuments/Penn-State_Economic-Contribution-Study_February-2019.pdf)
into rural Centre County.

The university has announced plans to reopen with double-occupancy dorm
rooms but many classes will be remote, and it is still not known how
many students will return. Also in question is the future of Penn State
football, a local economic linchpin that generated $100 million in
2018-19 [for the university
alone](https://www.scribd.com/document/448272170/Penn-State-2018-19-fiscal-year-NCAA-Report-Final#from_embed?campaign=SkimbitLtd&ad_group=126006X1587341X3675db3cbb273c0b115aafcc767f8ca5&keyword=660149026&source=hp_affiliate&medium=affiliate).

Local governments are bracing, too. Amherst, Mass., is scheduled to vote
this week on a proposal to increase annual water and sewer fees by an
average of $100 per household, a result of a [precipitous drop in water
use](https://www.amherstma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/51625/8b-FY21-Water-and-Sewer-Rate-Memo---61220-FINAL)
as students have abandoned Hampshire College, Amherst College and the
University of Massachusetts in that New England college town.

Ithaca’s mayor, Svante Myrick, said his city was preparing to cut its
$70 million budget by about $14 million, and has furloughed a quarter of
its employees, including his assistant. He personally has taken a 10
percent pay cut. A [resolution](https://www.ithacatu.org/cancelrent)
passed earlier this month asked the state to let him authorize blanket
rent forgiveness for three months.

Unemployment in the Ithaca metropolitan area has soared to 10 percent
from 3 percent before the pandemic. Sales tax receipts have tanked as
about $4 million per week in student spending has disappeared along with
Cornell’s students, Mr. Myrick said. About two-thirds of the land in his
jurisdiction is university-owned, he said, and therefore exempt from
property tax.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re going to be looking at Hoovervilles — or maybe Trump Towns — all
over the country,” said the mayor, a Democrat who clashes frequently
with his upstate area’s Republican congressional delegation. “It’s bad.
It’s really bad.”

Compounding the concern is the 2020 census. Conducted every 10 years,
the national head count determines the distribution of federal funding
for a vast number of local and state programs, including transit, public
safety and
Medicaid.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Because the window for responses has coincided with campus shutdowns,
college towns are reporting significant undercounts of students living
off-campus, with dire financial implications.

A census without Ohio University students could knock the official
population of Athens from 24,000 down to as few as 6,000 people. With an
Oct. 31 deadline approaching, responses in student neighborhoods are
currently running some 20 percentage points lower than in 2010, with
[response rates](https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html) in some
tracts of less than 31 percent.

Mayor Steve Patterson of Athens estimates an undercount could cost his
small city up to $40 million over the next 10 years “for things like
community development block grants, jobs and family services and senior
services that rely on a strong census count to get a full funding.”

“We could be feeling this for the next decade,” Mr. Patterson said.

In California, where Democrats have prioritized the census, the city of
Davis and its surrounding county partnered long before the pandemic with
the university to maximize its response rate, which is now higher than
the state average. But the exodus of students has cut sales tax revenues
by 50 percent, Mr. Frerichs
said.

Virtual graduation in June slashed hotel occupancy from 90 percent to 10
percent during the local hospitality industry’s usual peak season.
Bookings have since rebounded slightly, Mr. Frerichs said, but only to
about 25 percent, substantially denting hotel occupancy tax revenues.

Transit ridership has dropped so precipitously, he said, that local
authorities have been using the buses to transport supplies to and from
food banks. The city has begun reaching out to unions and identifying
budget cuts in case the economy does not quickly bounce back.

Already, Mr. Frerichs said, the council has opted to leave three open
positions for police officers vacant. “That’s three sets of eyes and
ears on the street,” he said, “but this is a legitimate concern. Long
term, this could be on par with the great recession for us.”

Or maybe worse than the recession, he added, because in 2008 at least
the town could still gather.

Now the bike traffic is scant, the farmers market socially distanced,
and the baristas working reduced hours at coffee shops ask customers to
alert them when they leave so maintenance can disinfect their tables.
The virus even canceled Davis’s annual town-and-gown party, Picnic Day.

“Part of me is enjoying reclaiming the community,” said Mr. Frerichs,
who attended the university and has lived for 24 years in Davis. “But
one of the things that makes a college town so wonderful is the vibrant
young population.”

“They’re the lifeblood, and without them — well, the squirrels are
having a field day,” he said. “But for the rest of us, it’s just so
quiet.”

Lincoln, Neb.
