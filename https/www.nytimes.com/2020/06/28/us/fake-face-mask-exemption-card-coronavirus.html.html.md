# Mask Exemption Cards From the ‘Freedom to Breathe Agency’? They’re Fake

The group, which is selling the cards online, is not a real government

Cards for sale that claim to exempt people from wearing masks during the
coronavirus pandemic are fraudulent, federal officials said.

The cards — featuring a red, white and blue eagle logo and approximately
the size of a business card — say the bearer is exempt from ordinances
requiring them to wear masks in public.

“Wearing a face mask posses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under
the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose
my condition to you,” reads the card, which misspells “poses” and
incorrectly names the Americans with Disabilities Act.

There’s also a warning that businesses or organizations can be reported
to the Freedom to Breathe Agency, the group behind the cards. One
version of the cards featured the Justice Department’s logo and listed a
legitimate phone number where complaints about violations of the
Americans with Disabilities Act can be submitted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The cards were being sold online in boxes of at least 500 for
$49.99.

But such cards and fliers [were not issued or
endorsed](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdnc/pr/covid-19-alert-fraudulent-facemask-flyers)
by the Justice Department, federal officials said.

“Do not be fooled by the chicanery and misappropriation of the DOJ
eagle,” said Matthew G.T. Martin, the United States attorney for the
Middle District of North Carolina. “These cards do not carry the force
of law. The ‘Freedom to Breathe Agency,’ or ‘FTBA,’ is not a government
agency.”

Mr. Martin’s statement mentioned nothing about charges arising from the
cards, and the group distributing them said no legal action had been
taken against it.

The cards were created in response to complaints, the group’s
communication team said in an email, and as “an educational tool” to
help people “understand their legal and human rights so they can stand
up to the unlawful, unscientific and unconstitutional mandates.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The communications team declined to provide a named spokesperson, citing
concerns over “the safety of our key members.” The group said it had
received hundreds of reports and continued to get them daily from people
who did not want to wear masks and because of that had been “denied
access, discriminated, degraded, intimated and coerced.”

“These are people who have medical conditions where wearing a face mask
puts them at significant health risk,” the group added.

The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth
face
coverings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html)
in public places to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Footage

The founder of the Freedom to Breathe Agency, Lenka Koloma, advertised
the cards on her Facebook page, and they were sold on a site created
through the commerce platform Shopify. The site was unavailable on
Sunday
afternoon.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“Shopify takes concerns around the goods and services made available by
merchants on our platform very seriously,” a company spokeswoman, Sheryl
So, said. “We have multiple teams who handle potential violations of
[Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup),
including malicious and deceptive practices.”

The original Facebook group and a website on the Wix platform for the
Freedom to Breathe Agency were also taken down. Facebook and Wix could
not immediately be reached on Sunday.

The group behind the cards said it had requested support and information
from Wix and that it had experienced “unlawful and unconstitutional
censorship by Facebook.”
