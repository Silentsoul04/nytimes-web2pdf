# Trump Faces Mounting Defections From a Once-Loyal Group: Older White Voters

No Democrat has won or broken even with voters over 65 in two decades.
But seniors’ dismay about President Trump could change that.

Clifford Wagner, an 80-year-old Republican in Tucson, Ariz., never cared
for President Trump.

He supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential primary race and cast a
protest vote in the general election for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian
nominee. An Air Force veteran, Mr. Wagner described the Trump presidency
as a mortifying experience: His friends in Europe and Japan tell him the
United States has become “the laughingstock of the world.”

This year, Mr. Wagner said he would register his opposition to Mr. Trump
more emphatically than he did in 2016. He plans to vote for Joseph R.
Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, and hopes the election is
a ruinous one for the Republican Party.

“I’m a Christian, and I do not believe in the hateful, racist, bigoted
speech that the president uses,” Mr. Wagner said, adding, “As much as I
never thought I’d say this, I hope we get a Democratic president, a
Democratic-controlled Senate and maintain a Democratic-controlled
House.”

Mr. Wagner is part of one of the most important maverick voting groups
in the 2020 general election: conservative-leaning seniors who have
soured on the Republican Party over the past four years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Republican presidential candidates typically carry older voters by solid
margins, and in his first campaign Mr. Trump bested Hillary Clinton by
seven percentage points with voters over 65. He won white seniors by
nearly triple that margin.

Today, Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are tied among seniors, according to a
poll of registered voters conducted by The New York Times and Siena
College. And in the six most important battleground states, Mr. Biden
has established a clear upper hand, leading Mr. Trump by six percentage
points among the oldest voters and nearly matching the president’s
support among whites in that age group.

That is [no small
advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/biden-trump-seniors.html)
for Mr. Biden, the former vice president, given the prevalence of
retirement communities in a few of those crucial states, including
Arizona and Florida.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No Democrat has won or broken even with seniors in two decades, since Al
Gore in 2000 devoted much of his general-election campaign to warning
that Republicans would cut popular programs like Social Security and
Medicare. In 2016, Mr. Trump, now 74, seemed in some ways keenly attuned
to the political sensitivities of voters in his own age group. As a
candidate, he bluntly rejected his party’s longstanding interest in
restructuring government guarantees of retirement security.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Trump’s presidency has been a trying experience for many of
these voters, some of whom are now so frustrated and disillusioned that
they are preparing to take the drastic step of supporting a
Democrat.

The grievances of these defecting seniors are familiar, most or all of
them shared by their younger peers. But these voters often express
themselves with a particularly sharp kind of dismay and disappointment.
They see Mr. Trump as coarse and disrespectful, divisive to his core and
failing persistently to comport himself with the dignity of the other
presidents that they have observed for more than half a century. ****
The Times poll also found that most seniors disapproved of Mr. Trump’s
handling of race relations and his handling of the protests after the
death of George Floyd.

And as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the country, putting
older Americans at particular risk, these voters feel a special kind of
frustration and betrayal with Mr. Trump’s ineffective leadership and
often-blasé public comments about the crisis.

The president has urged the country to return to life-as-usual far more
quickly than the top public-health officials in his own administration
have recommended. Some prominent Republican officials and conservative
pundits have even suggested at times that older people should be willing
to risk their own health for the sake of a quicker resumption of the
business cycle.

In The Times poll, seniors in the battleground states disapproved of Mr.
Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic by seven points, 52 percent
to 45 percent. By a 26-point margin, this group said the federal
government should prioritize containing the pandemic over reopening the
economy.

Former Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, a 40-year-old
Republican deeply versed in the politics of the retiree-rich swing
state, said many seniors were disturbed by important aspects of Mr.
Trump’s record and found Mr. Biden a mild and respectable alternative
who did not inspire the same antipathy on the right that Mrs. Clinton
did in 2016.

Regarded by much of his own party as bland and conventional, Mr. Biden’s
nostalgia-cloaked candidacy may be uniquely equipped to ease a sizable
group of right-of-center seniors into the Democratic column, at least
for one election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He’s not ever been known to be a radical or an extreme leftist or
liberal, so there is certainly a degree of comfort there,” Mr. Curbelo
said. He added: “This public health crisis is so threatening, especially
to seniors, and because the president hasn’t earned high marks in his
handling of it, I think that has also been a factor in Biden’s improving
numbers.”

Mr. Biden and his allies have expressed growing excitement about the
political possibilities that the shifting senior vote could create in
the fall. That is true not only in Sun Belt retirement havens but also
in Midwestern states where Mr. Biden is currently running well ahead of
Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 performance with a range of conservative-leaning
constituencies, including older whites.

In Iowa, former Gov. Tom Vilsack, a close Biden ally, said the former
vice president had closed a substantial deficit in the
state<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>through his response to
the coronavirus, his connection with older rural voters and his ability
to empathize.

“Part of it is the demeanor he has projected during the course of this
pandemic,” Mr. Vilsack said, before acknowledging, “As much as Joe’s
doing, it’s probably as much or more what the president has done or
failed to do.”

He cited [an

from a group of [anti-Trump
Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/opinion/lincoln-project.html)
that cast Mr. Trump’s approach to crisis as erratic and selfish, unlike
past presidents who have confronted national tragedies like the
Challenger disaster and the Oklahoma City bombing.

“Each of those presidents was able to connect emotionally to the
feelings of the nation,” Mr. Vilsack said. “This president has had a
really, really hard time doing that.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s ineffective response to the coronavirus weighed on the
thinking of many older voters surveyed in the poll, including Patrick
Mallon, 73, a retired information technology specialist in Battle Creek,
Mich.

Mr. Mallon said he was a registered Republican who had long been unhappy
with Mr. Trump but mindful that he was presiding over a strong economy.
The pandemic set Mr. Mallon firmly against Mr. Trump’s re-election.

“The main reason is Donald Trump saying, ‘Don’t wear a mask, this thing
is going to go away, we can have large gatherings,’” he said.
“Everything he says is incorrect and dangerous to the country.”

When young people contract the coronavirus, Mr. Mallon added, “most of
them will survive, but they’re going to give it to their parents, their
grandparents — and I’m sorry, we’re just as important as that younger
generation is.”

The abandonment of Mr. Trump by older voters is far from universal, and
he still has a strong base among older white men and self-described
conservatives. Nationally, the oldest voters approve of Mr. Trump’s
handling of the economy by 12 points, more than double the figure for
voters of all ages.

And in the battleground states, Mr. Trump has a 10-point lead over Mr.
Biden with white men over the age of 65, even as Mr. Biden has opened up
an advantage with white women in the same age group. Nonwhite seniors in
the battleground states currently support Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump by a
huge margin, 65 percent to 25 percent.

Even among some seniors supportive of Mr. Trump, however, there is an
undercurrent of unease about the way he approaches the presidency.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Karen Gamble, 65, of Reidsville, N.C., said that she was dissatisfied
with the overall government response to the coronavirus outbreak and
echoed many popular complaints about Mr. Trump’s persona. She said she
wished, for instance, that Mr. Trump “wouldn’t be such a bully and would
conform to being in a regal-like position, as our presidents have always
been.”

Ms. Gamble said she was planning to support Mr. Trump in the election
all the same, describing Mr. Biden as too old and too compromised on
matters related to China. But Ms. Gamble, who said she has a “severe
lung problem,” expressed hope that Mr. Trump would change his approach
to the pandemic.

“We can’t blame him for this — how many presidents could really do any
better than what he’s done?” Ms. Gamble said, before adding: “I just
wish he wouldn’t let the country open up as much as it has. I see all
these teens and young people at the beach, and I fear for them because
now they’re getting sick.”

In Tucson, Gerald Lankin, a more forceful Trump supporter, said he would
back the president mainly as a vote “against the Democrats.” Mr. Lankin,
77, said he found Mr. Trump’s personal manner offensive but agreed with
him on most issues and saw Democrats as “much, much, much, much too far
to the left.”

“He hasn’t really done anything that I can say I’m against,” Mr. Lankin
said of Mr. Trump. “I think what he’s doing is the best he can. But,
boy, he is tough to take. He is a tough guy to take.”

There may be time for Mr. Trump to regain his footing with seniors,
along with several other right-leaning groups that have drifted away
during the bleakest months of his presidency. His ability to do so could
have far-reaching implications not just for his chances of winning a
second term, but also his party’s ability to keep its hold on the
Senate.

At the moment, Mr. Trump’s unpopularity with older voters appears to be
hindering other Republicans in states including Arizona and Michigan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gayle Craven, 80, of High Point, N.C., a registered Republican, said she
had not voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and would reject him again this
year. She said she saw Mr. Biden as an “honest man.”

“Trump is the biggest disappointment,” she said. “He has made America
look like idiots. I think he’s an embarrassment to my country.”

Other older voters leaning toward Mr. Biden cautioned that they could
still change their minds, like Frederick Monk, 73, of Mesa, Ariz., who
said he had voted for Mr. Trump but quickly came to see him as
“incompetent.”

Still, Mr. Monk said his mind was not fully made up. If Mr. Biden
chooses an overly liberal running mate, he said he could cast a vote for
Mr. Trump and hope his second term is an exercise in futility.

“Hopefully the Democrats retake the Senate and make his next four years
miserable, if he lasts that long,” Mr. Monk
said.
