SACRAMENTO — Only a few weeks ago, thousands of Southern
[Californians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)
were flocking to beaches, Disneyland was announcing it would soon reopen
and Whoopi Goldberg was lauding Gov. Gavin Newsom on “The View” for the
state’s progress in combating the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html).
The worst, many in
[California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
thought, was behind them.

In fact, an alarming surge in cases up and down the state was only just
beginning.

Over the past week [California’s case
count](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html)
has exploded, surpassing 200,000 known infections, and forcing Mr.
Newsom to roll back the state’s
[reopening](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-california-cases-rising.html)
in some counties. On Monday, he said the number of people hospitalized
in
[California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-california-cases-rising.html)
had risen 43 percent over the past two weeks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Los Angeles County, which has been averaging more than 2,000 new cases
each day, surpassed 100,000 total cases on Monday, with the virus
actively infecting one in every 140 people, according to local health
officials. More than 2,800 cases were announced in the county on Monday,
the most of any day during the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than 7,000 new cases were announced across California on Monday,
its highest single-day total of the pandemic.

On Sunday, Mr. Newsom shut down the bars in a half-dozen counties,
including Los Angeles County and in the Central Valley, and recommended
that another eight counties voluntarily close their nightspots and
gathering places. On Friday, Imperial County, along the Mexican border,
was [told to return to a stay-at-home
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-florida-texas-bars-closing.html).
And Disneyland has since rescinded its decision to open its gates.

California was the first state to shut down and one of the most
aggressive in fighting the virus. But the state that was so proactive in
combating the spread of the coronavirus is now being forced to ask
itself what went wrong.

“To some extent I think our luck may have run out,” said Dr. Bob
Wachter, a professor and chair of the department of medicine at the
University of California, San Francisco. “This is faster and worse than
I expected. You have to have a ton of respect for this thing. It is
nasty and it just lurks and waits to stomp on you if you let your guard
down for a second.”

On Monday, the governors of New York and New Jersey said they were
reconsidering plans to allow indoor dining in the coming days because
they were so alarmed by [the rise in coronavirus cases in the South and
the
West](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The head start that California appeared to enjoy — the companies that
allowed employees to work from home as early as February, the governor
who warned residents in daily briefings to stay home and appeared to be
listened to — was not protective enough in the long
run.

Younger people appear to account for the large surge in new cases, as
they have in many other states. Latinos, who make up a large swath of
the state’s essential work force, have also recently seen [consistently
high case
counts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/corona-virus-latinos.html).

And just as in Texas and Florida, the state’s reopening appears to have
triggered a large resurgence. Pressured in part by businesses, church
groups and conservatives, Mr. Newsom ceded control of much of the timing
of reopening to local officials who were eager to regain a sense of
normalcy and stem economic losses. The result was a decentralized,
haphazard process that sowed confusion and gave residents a false sense
that they were in the clear.

Unlike people in the Northeast, many Californians did not have a sense
of urgency or immediacy toward the virus because infection rates had
been so low for months. There were no overflowing morgues or ambulance
sirens at all hours.

In a state with 40 million people, outbreaks have been heterogeneous:
San Quentin State Prison on the San Francisco Bay, food-processing
plants in the Central Valley, nursing homes, dense urban neighborhoods
filled with essential workers and family gatherings in remote rural
communities have all accounted for clusters of cases.

But health experts and state officials say the ultimate reasons for the
surge lie in the millions of individual decisions made across the vast
state.

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles blamed “irrational exuberance.”

“A lot of people didn’t stick with the plan,” the mayor said in an
interview on Friday. “The idea was, we would do a move, wait three
weeks, check the impact, take the next move.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Instead, Mr. Garcetti said, the reopening “was like a tidal wave — one
move led to the next, led to the next, led to the next. And then we had
the protest on top of that, and other things. And we have yet to be able
to identify where spread is happening and what we can do to crank it
down.”

State Senator Richard Pan, a Sacramento physician who led the state’s
push to tighten immunization requirements, said that the state might
have flattened its curve at first, but that it never bent it down toward
zero.

“How this disease spreads is all about the margins,” Dr. Pan said. “All
it takes is, like, 5 percent more people doing more high-risk behavior
to change its direction.”

Dr. Pan blames partisanship and misinformation spread by President
Trump. On the weekend after June 20, when bars reopened in Los Angeles
County, an estimated 500,000 people visited nightspots. Additionally,
half of the restaurants visited by county inspectors are not complying
with new public health rules, according to health officials.

“I’m frustrated because it’s not that we don’t know what to do,” Dr. Pan
said. “We know what to do. We’re just not doing it.”

California was one of the earliest states to get hit by the virus. Soon
after it first appeared on American shores, Silicon Valley, south of San
Francisco, was considered a major hot spot, seeded by travelers arriving
from China.

Counties across the Bay Area banded together to announce [the nation’s
first stay-at-home
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/california-covid-19.html)
on March 16, followed by a statewide order three days later. Cellphone
data showed that Californians moved around less than people in other
states, and infection rates stabilized at a plateau well below the
levels experts had projected, making military field hospitals and sports
arenas and auditoriums — all mobilized in case of a shortage of beds —
unnecessary.

By May, with low case counts remaining steady, Mr. Newsom was coming
under increasing pressure to reopen. Harmeet K. Dhillon, a civil rights
attorney and member of the Republican National Committee, filed more
than a dozen lawsuits related to the reopening. If residents could
congregate at Costco, they should be able to go to church, she argued.
Elon Musk, the head of Tesla, railed that his Bay Area car factory was

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Mr. Newsom localized the reopening process, allowing counties to move at
different speeds, repeatedly declaring that “localism is determinative,”
and vowing to collaborate with county governments, not issue orders.
Church congregations were allowed to meet with restrictions.

Advocates for reopening like Ms. Dhillon felt vindicated.

“I feel that our lawsuits were responsible for large sectors of
California’s economy opening up much sooner than the governor originally
intended,” she said, adding that she fielded countless calls from
business owners. “People are absolutely devastated.”

But Mr. Newsom was also criticized by those who worried the state was
reopening too quickly.

Dr. Sara Cody, the chief health officer of Santa Clara County and the
architect of the Bay Area’s stay-at-home orders, said the system was
bewildering to residents who cross county lines regularly.

“For the public it’s incredibly confusing,” Dr. Cody said in an
interview. “What’s the message? How can it be that something is OK here
and in the adjoining county it’s not?”

The measures have become even more disparate in the past few weeks. In
Napa and Sonoma Counties, wine tastings and restaurant meals are
permitted both indoors and outside. In San Francisco, restaurant dining
is only available outdoors. Mayor London Breed of San Francisco
announced last week that the city would postpone the reopening,
scheduled for Monday, of hair and nail salons, massage shops, museums,
tattoo parlors and outdoor bars.

Diana Dooley, a former state secretary of Health and Human Services who
dealt with the Ebola and Zika pandemics during her tenure, said she had
watched “with great empathy” as the crisis gripped California.
Initially, she said, “it looked like the Bay Area was driving the
decisions.” And as the virus spread, Californians were generally
compliant.

“But after several months, the impatient people have made top-down
orders very hard to enforce,” she said.

The result, she said, is a sense in some parts of the state of “a kind
of liberty gone rampant.”

“People want to go to bars, they want to go to picnics,” she said.
“These protest rallies have heightened that sense of ‘I want to be in
a crowd.’ We’re coming up on the Fourth of July and people want to be in
connection with each other.”

“You can only lead if people follow,” Ms. Dooley said. “Newsom has done
a pretty good job of creating awareness, and people in California are
more inclined to believe this is serious. But what they can do about it,
we’re still getting to.”

David Townsend, a veteran Democratic political consultant in the state,
said California’s size and political complexity pose a considerable
challenge. Although the Legislature is overwhelmingly Democratic, more
than a fifth of the electorate is Republican.

“You have the Inland Empire doing one thing, Los Angeles doing another,
Orange County — it’s pretty hard to corral everybody in California and
get them to do the right thing. It’s just so big.”

Mr. Townsend said the pressure would be tough for any governor.

“How do you put the genie back into the bottle?” Mr. Townsend added.
“I’m not sure there’s much more he can do.”
