Inclement weather has hampered the search for the hikers, who officials
said were climbing in different locations.

U.S. park rangers on Monday found the body of one of three hikers who
disappeared separately in the past 10 days at Mount Rainier National
Park in Washington State, officials said.

The body of Matthew Bunker, 28, of Seattle, who vanished on Friday, was
found on Monday along the base of Liberty Ridge, where he had been
hiking with a group, the National Park Service said on Monday night. He
had been skiing behind a partner at about 10,400 feet above sea level
when, on their way back down, “unknown events” caused Mr. Bunker to fall
in “steep and treacherous terrain,” said Patti Wold, a spokeswoman for
the Park Service.

The terrain is prone to rockfalls and avalanches, including one that
[killed six climbers
in 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/six-climbers-are-missing-on-mount-rainier.html).

The search for Mr. Bunker and the other hikers has been hampered by
inclement weather. But on Monday, clear skies allowed for another
helicopter search.

“We extend our deepest condolences to Matthew’s loved ones and friends,”
Tracy Swartout, deputy superintendent of Mount Rainier National Park,
said in a statement. “It brings us a great degree of sorrow to be unable
to bring him home to his family.” Mr. Bunker graduated from West Point
in 2013 and served five years in the military.

The Park Service said the search for the two other hikers — Vincent
Dije, 25, who disappeared on June 19, and Talal Sabbagh, 27, who
disappeared on June 22 — was continuing.

Missing hikers are not uncommon on Mount Rainier this time of year,
officials said, because many climbers are surprised by the changing
conditions as they ascend the mountain.

“It feels like summer, but at high elevation we have lots of snow,” said
Terry Wildy, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service at Mount
Rainier. “For folks that are hiking, it may not be obvious where trails
are or what is underneath the snow.”

Mount Rainier, an active volcano that at its peak is more than 14,000
feet above sea level, was among the national parks that were temporarily
off-limits during the coronavirus pandemic. Hiking was forbidden from
March 24 to June 5. The visitors’ center and other buildings there
remain closed.

Mr. Dije, a student from Indonesia who is living in Seattle, and Mr.
Sabbagh, who is from Seattle, were both last seen in the area of the
park known as Paradise. It is on the southern part of the mountain and
where most visitors go to drive up the trail.

Mr. Dije was hiking the Van Trump Trail, at least 5,000 feet above sea
level, toward Mildred Point at Longmire, officials said. His car was
found at the park.

The National Park Service said it was working closely with the
Indonesian Consulate in San Francisco and with Mr. Dije’s relatives.

Mr. Sabbagh’s car was found parked at a lot in Paradise, officials said.

Kathryn Van Waes, the executive director of the American Hiking Society,
said in an interview on Monday that hiking “is generally safe during
this pandemic.”

“It is a really good idea to get outside, but we recommend people stay
fairly close to home,” she said.

Ms. Van Waes suggested that hikers try not to go on difficult hikes at
this time.

“The medical system is already under a lot of stress,” she said. “Stick
to front country and fairly easy hikes where you are less likely to get
lost.”
