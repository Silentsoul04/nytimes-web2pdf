# Trump Is Running on the Courts Again. Should Biden Do the Same?

</div>

President Trump’s promises to evangelicals on judges were a key part of
shoring up support in 2016. Some Biden backers want to see him run on
the courts this time, too.

President Trump this month celebrated the confirmation of his [200th
lifetime
appointment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/trump-senate-judges-wilson.html)
to the federal bench, outpacing his predecessor by dozens through
three-and-a-half years.

Campaign supporters of Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the
Republican majority leader, [have been urged to buy
T-shirts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-mcconnell-campaigns-sell-back-to-back-supreme-court-champs-t-shirts/2019/08/12/29b3eb72-bd3f-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html)
saluting the two men as “Back-to-Back Supreme Court Champs,” their faces
rendered in white silhouette with “Gorsuch” and “Kavanaugh” etched on
the sleeves.

And four years after the battle over a court vacancy helped deliver Mr.
Trump to the White House, the president hopes to keep his job by playing
the hits: He has pledged to produce an updated roster of would-be
justices to galvanize the right before November,
[warning](https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2020/june/exclusive-interview-with-president-trump-running-against-joe-biden-and-record-number-of-pro-life-judges)
that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., would nominate “a
radical lefty” as a slate of major cases returns the judiciary to the
political fore.

“Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than
ever before,” Mr. Trump [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1273667868362768386).
“VOTE 2020\!”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That message arrived well before the court’s latest ruling to disappoint
conservatives on Monday: [a 5-4
decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/supreme-court-abortion-louisiana.html?action=click&module=Alert&pgtype=Homepage)
striking down a law restricting abortions in Louisiana.

By their own account, Democrats have long found themselves outmaneuvered
in electoral fights over the courts. [Exit
polls](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/29/17511088/scotus-2016-election-poll-trump-republicans-kennedy-retire)
from 2016 showed Mr. Trump winning by double digits among those who
called the Supreme Court the “most important factor” in their vote.

Most memorably, Mr. Trump made the novel choice to publish a list of
prospective nominees, shaped by leaders from conservative groups like
the Federalist Society, supplying specificity (at least on this subject)
from a candidate prone to ideological shape-shifting.

“It gave certainty to people who didn’t know the president — and I was
one of them,” said Penny Nance, the chief executive of Concerned Women
for America, a conservative Christian group. “It was probably the No. 1
issue when we looked at the polling of what brought conservatives to the
voting booth in 2016. I think it will be a top-of-mind issue, certainly,
in 2020.”

Trailing in the polls amid overlapping national crises that he has
strained to corral, Mr. Trump seems even more likely to place the
courts, an area of [unambiguous conservative
triumph](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html),
at the center of his case for re-election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whether Democrats can harness their own enthusiasm on this score is at
once uncertain and potentially critical to election fortunes this fall,
both in the presidential race and several competitive Senate contests
where the Republican incumbents’ Supreme Court votes might figure
prominently. (In Maine, Senator Susan Collins’s support for Justice
Brett M. Kavanaugh in 2018 attracted wide-scale scrutiny — and [millions
of dollars in
donations](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/6/17945900/susan-collins-speech-crowdpac-susan-rice)
against her — before she had an official
opponent.)

Recent years have produced no shortage of seminal moments to mobilize
Democrats around matters of the judiciary: the confirmation of Justice
Kavanaugh; the non-confirmation of Judge Merrick B. Garland; the Supreme
Court’s [refusal in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/supreme-court-voting-wisconsin-virus.html)
to extend the deadline for absentee voting in Wisconsin during a
pandemic.

Still, some in the party sense an asymmetry in how urgently many
Democratic voters think about the courts.

“I do think it has picked up in visibility, but I don’t think it moves
millions to the polls in the way that it really should,” said Senator
Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a close Biden ally. “That’s the
challenge that remains before us.”

Progressives have suggested that Mr. Biden, the former vice president,
could prompt excitement by releasing his own list of preferred judges.
Some activists have urged him to embrace a proposal to expand the size
of the Supreme Court.

Mr. Biden has done neither, though he has promised to nominate a black
woman to the court and said that the judiciary was “the single most
important reason” that his wife, Jill, wanted him to run in 2020.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

John Anzalone, a pollster and adviser for Mr. Biden, said that much of
the modern Democratic electorate plainly grasped the significance of the
courts. [A Suffolk University/USA Today
poll](https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2020/04/28/18/13/poll-shows-voters-want-federal-government-more-involved-in-the-coronavirus-health-response)
in April found that Democrats were slightly more likely than Republicans
to call the Supreme Court one of the most important issues affecting
their vote.

“I do think that women — college-educated women, suburban women — are
without a doubt a much bigger part of our coalition,” Mr. Anzalone said.
“And they’re much more awake to the ramifications of replacing a Ruth
Bader Ginsburg. That is real.”

Democrats had been bracing for possible disappointment in the Louisiana
abortion case, among other decisions pending before the end of this
court term.

But two high-profile rulings had already come as a pleasant surprise to
them: one holding that a landmark civil rights law [protects L.G.B.T.Q.
employees from workplace
discrimination](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/gay-transgender-workers-supreme-court.html)
and another preventing Mr. Trump from immediately proceeding with plans
[to end a program shielding young immigrants from
deportation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/trump-daca-supreme-court.html).

While welcoming the outcomes, activists have advised Democrats to beware
a conservative majority bearing gifts.

“The court’s not evil 100 percent of the time,” Meagan Hatcher-Mays, the
director of democracy policy at Indivisible, said before Monday’s
decision. “But they’re evil, like, 94 percent of the time.”

Such successes can, paradoxically, register as something of a narrative
complication for those arguing that the court is stacked against the
left.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a progressive
group, suggested that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. understood as
much — and was steering the court accordingly.

“These rulings are enough to convince a lot of people on the left that
they should continue to play within the system and not offend sitting
federal judges by calling them out as overly political,” he said. “In
some sense, that is the exact game that Roberts is playing: to side with
the liberals in just enough cases so the public misses the larger trend
of this court’s rightward swerve.”

The chief justice has nonetheless angered many Republicans who appraise
his tenure as a failure, recalling him [siding with the court’s liberal
wing](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html)
in cases challenging core provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In the
abortion ruling on Monday, he voted with the liberal justices but did
not adopt their reasoning, saying that deference to precedent compelled
him instead.

Some critics of Chief Justice Roberts hold high office: “Do you get the
impression that the Supreme Court doesn’t like me?” Mr. Trump wrote on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1273634152433188865)
this month.

Conservatives say that, if anything, the Roberts era has demonstrated
the need for Mr. Trump to fill vacancies for another four years.

“Frustration with the chief justice and concern about the direction the
courts were going was part of what galvanized conservatives in the first
place to elect someone like Trump,” said Carrie Severino, president of
the conservative Judicial Crisis Network.

By prizing “courage” in addition to credentials, Ms. Severino said, Mr.
Trump’s approach “is almost designed to avoid a future John Roberts,”
whom she accused of operating with politics in mind — in some ways
echoing the charge of his progressive skeptics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She also joined some liberal counterparts in calling for Mr. Biden to
release a list of potential nominees.

Many Biden supporters see little need for that step because, unlike Mr.
Trump in 2016, the former vice president has an exhaustive record on
judicial affairs, including an extended tenure as chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

Those close to Mr. Biden are rarely eager to dwell on [the treatment of
Anita
Hill](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html)
before his committee at the confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence
Thomas. But others cite [his
work](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/us/politics/joe-biden-bork-supreme-court.html)
to defeat the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork in 1987 as a towering
feat for Democrats — and a turning point for a chamber that had
previously been disinclined to reject a nominee for primarily
ideological reasons.

“I don’t think there’s ever been any president — assuming Biden’s
elected — who knows as much about or has been as involved in shaping the
Supreme Court as Joe Biden,” said Mark Gitenstein, who led Mr. Biden’s
Judiciary Committee staff during the Bork fight.

And those who have doubted Mr. Biden in 2020, he added, were hardly the
first.

“The irony of the Bork fight is it’s not unlike what you’re seeing now,”
Mr. Gitenstein said. “People totally underestimated Biden.”
