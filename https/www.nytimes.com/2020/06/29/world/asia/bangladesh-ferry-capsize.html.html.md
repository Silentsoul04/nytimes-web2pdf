NEW DELHI — At least 32 people, including three children, drowned on
Monday after the passenger boat they were on collided with a ferry and
capsized in Bangladesh’s capital city, the latest disaster for a country
haunted by maritime accidents.

The capsized ship, called the Morning Bird, had just completed an
hourlong journey to the Sadarghat river port in the city of Dhaka when
it collided with the other vessel, officials said. The boat was carrying
more than 50 passengers, including local government officers.

Commodore Golam Sadeq, an official of the Bangladesh Inland Water
Transport, said a four-member team would carry out an inquiry and submit
a report in 72 hours to determine the cause of the collision. Earlier,
Mr. Sadeq had said that the ship had sunk because of “carelessness” and
had not been overcrowded.

The authorities said that they had opened an investigation and seized
the ferry involved in the accident.

M.D. Selim, an official with the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport
Authority, told reporters, “After offloading some of the passengers at
one terminal, the Morning Bird was traveling backward when another
vessel crashed into it.”

He said that the Morning Bird had capsized and that divers from the
country’s navy and coast guard had immediately been deployed for a
rescue operation.

Several passengers were still listed as missing after rescuers recovered
32 bodies, including at least three children. Some of the passengers
swam to shore and were being treated at a nearby hospital.

“Rescuers from a number of units are still continuing the operation,”
said Abdul Ahad, an official at Shampur Fire Station, which also sent a
team to the spot.

After a number of deadly accidents, officials in the Bangladeshi
Department of Shipping have come under increasing pressure in recent
years to enact safety regulations, including ensuring that crews avoid
overcrowding.

[At least 15 people
drowned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/asia/rohingya-refugees-boat-bangladesh.html)
in February after an overcrowded boat carrying Rohingya refugees
capsized off the coast of Bangladesh.

And in one of the worst maritime accidents in the country in recent
decades, at least 100 people were left dead or missing when [an
overloaded ferry carrying over 300 passengers capsized
in 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/world/asia/bangladeshi-police-capture-owner-of-overloaded-ferry-that-sank.html).
