*Good morning.*

*(Here’s* [*the
sign-up*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today)*, if you
don’t already get California Today by email.)*

We all know
[California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)
had the nation’s first stay-at-home orders, and officials have
emphasized pre-emptive efforts to expand hospital capacity that have
largely allowed communities in the state to sidestep the horrific
effects of the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)
that have played out elsewhere.

[And yet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/coronavirus-today.html),
here we are, hurtling toward a holiday weekend, with case counts that
are threatening [to surge out of
control](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytnational),
increasing hospitalizations and an antsy population navigating a
constantly changing [patchwork of
restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-california-reopening-phases.html).

[More than 7,000 new
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?)
were announced across the state on Monday — the highest single-day total
of the pandemic.

As I told my colleagues who write The Times’s
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
newsletter — which you can [sign up for
here](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/coronavirus-briefing) —
leaders have pointed to a range of factors that are contributing to the
virus’s spread, but it’s difficult to pinpoint where we’re most at risk,
especially while [many
businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-oakland-reopening-bar.html?)
have been allowed to try to coax back customers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And while many local leaders have been unequivocal about the need to
wear masks in public, [some have
not](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-budget-crisis-gavin-newsom-face-mask-threaten-funds/).
For the average Californian, it’s confusing.

*\[“Our luck may have run out.” Read more about* [*California’s
exploding case
count*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytnational)*.\]*

On Monday, a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state [was
ordering bars to close in
seven](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Bar-Closure-Guidance.aspx)
of the state’s 58 counties, state officials explained in more detail how
and why some counties may need to reverse course on reopening.

Here’s what to know now about California’s “dimmer switch” approach to
reopening:

**What do you mean by “dimmer switch?”**

At this point, you’ve probably been thoroughly disabused of the notion
that the reopening of California’s economy would be as simple as
flipping back on a light switch. The “dimmer switch” idea is meant to
convey that the reopening process won’t move in one
direction.

</div>

Even before Mr. Newsom announced the state’s phased reopening plan [at
the end of
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/california-reopen-coronavirus.html),
[one of the criteria he cited for moving
forward](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-california-quarantine-end.html)
was the capacity to quickly reinstate stay-at-home orders or other
measures.

But [as we’ve seen in recent
weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytnational),
the implementation of those plans has resulted in counties essentially
steering their own reopenings with [state
guidance](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top) and little
enforcement. (Although that is shifting; Mr. Newsom has said some state
pandemic aid will be tied to counties’ enforcement of health orders.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One major challenge is tailoring responses to the huge variety of
conditions driving infections across the state, including a horrific
outbreak at [San Quentin State
Prison](https://www.marinij.com/2020/06/29/marin-asks-newsom-to-intervene-in-san-quentin-outbreak/)
and family gatherings where people forget not to hug their cousins and
grandparents.

**What is the state tracking now?**

The state has released a [“watch list” of 19
counties](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CountyMonitoringDataStep2.aspx)
— home to almost three-quarters of the state’s population — where the
state is providing “technical assistance” because they’re showing [signs
of elevated disease
transmission](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx)
or their hospitalizations are increasing too quickly. (You can see how
each county is faring [according to the various metrics
here](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx).)

State public health officials may either order or encourage those
counties to reinstate restrictions, as they did over the weekend when
they [ordered bars in seven counties to
close](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Bar-Closure-Guidance.aspx).

One number that has become more important for gauging where the virus is
spreading is the positivity rate.

**Don’t positivity rates depend on how many tests are conducted?**

Yes. In fact, more widely available testing is part of why the state’s
rising positivity rate is such a cause for concern.

As of Monday, [the state reported](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/) that
on average, 84,000 tests were conducted per day in California over the
past two weeks — well [above the 60,000-per-day
target](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/coronavirus-covid-get-antibody-testing.html)
public health officials laid out in April. On Sunday, the number of
tests over the 24-hour period reached almost 106,000.

At the same time, the percentage of those tests that have come back
positive has inched up to 5.5 percent on average over the past two
weeks. It was as low as 4.1 percent on May 24.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In any case, officials have said they would like to see even more tests
per day — particularly as residents o[f Los Angeles
County](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-24/why-is-it-still-so-hard-to-get-a-coronavirus-test),
the epicenter of the virus’s spread in California, have been unable to
get testing appointments.

**So is California closing again?**

Some of it is.

Most notably, in Los Angeles, officials said — sigh — that they [would
close beaches over the weekend and that fireworks displays would be
banned](https://twitter.com/lapublichealth/status/1277758362097037313),
so that residents will have fewer places to
gather.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Bars in L.A. County were among those that had to shutter. San Diego
County officials announced that [bars, wineries and
breweries](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/story/2020-06-29/bars-to-close-wednesday-as-county-health-department-responds-to-local-covid-surge)
would have to close on Wednesday, too.

[In Imperial
County](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/coronavirus-border-mexico-california-el-centro.html),
state officials have urged local leaders to reinstate a strict
stay-at-home order in response to overwhelmed hospitals there.

In other areas, [like the Bay
Area](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Coranivirus-cases-climb-Bay-Area-counties-pause-15375230.php),
plans to reopen have been paused.

So things may be confusing for a while longer; check your local public
health department.
