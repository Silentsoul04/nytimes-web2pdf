Tuesday: Businesses may have to close again. Also: Gov. Gavin Newsom
signs the budget; and an ending for the Golden State Killer cases.

\emph{Good morning.}

\emph{(Here's}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today}{\emph{the
sign-up}}\emph{, if you don't already get California Today by email.)}

We all know
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{California}
had the nation's first stay-at-home orders, and officials have
emphasized pre-emptive efforts to expand hospital capacity that have
largely allowed communities in the state to sidestep the horrific
effects of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{coronavirus}
that have played out elsewhere.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/coronavirus-today.html}{And
yet}, here we are, hurtling toward a holiday weekend, with case counts
that are threatening
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?smtyp=cur\&smid=tw-nytnational}{to
surge out of control}, increasing hospitalizations and an antsy
population navigating a constantly changing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-california-reopening-phases.html}{patchwork
of restrictions}.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?}{More
than 7,000 new cases} were announced across the state on Monday --- the
highest single-day total of the pandemic.

As I told my colleagues who write The Times's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html}{coronavirus}
newsletter --- which you can
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/coronavirus-briefing}{sign up
for here} --- leaders have pointed to a range of factors that are
contributing to the virus's spread, but it's difficult to pinpoint where
we're most at risk, especially while
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-oakland-reopening-bar.html?}{many
businesses} have been allowed to try to coax back customers.

And while many local leaders have been unequivocal about the need to
wear masks in public,
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-budget-crisis-gavin-newsom-face-mask-threaten-funds/}{some
have not}. For the average Californian, it's confusing.

\emph{{[}``Our luck may have run out.'' Read more about}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?smtyp=cur\&smid=tw-nytnational}{\emph{California's
exploding case count}}\emph{.{]}}

On Monday, a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Bar-Closure-Guidance.aspx}{was
ordering bars to close in seven} of the state's 58 counties, state
officials explained in more detail how and why some counties may need to
reverse course on reopening.

Here's what to know now about California's ``dimmer switch'' approach to
reopening:

\textbf{What do you mean by ``dimmer switch?''}

At this point, you've probably been thoroughly disabused of the notion
that the reopening of California's economy would be as simple as
flipping back on a light switch. The ``dimmer switch'' idea is meant to
convey that the reopening process won't move in one direction.

Even before Mr. Newsom announced the state's phased reopening plan
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/california-reopen-coronavirus.html}{at
the end of April},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-california-quarantine-end.html}{one
of the criteria he cited for moving forward} was the capacity to quickly
reinstate stay-at-home orders or other measures.

But
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?smtyp=cur\&smid=tw-nytnational}{as
we've seen in recent weeks}, the implementation of those plans has
resulted in counties essentially steering their own reopenings with
\href{https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/\#top}{state guidance}
and little enforcement. (Although that is shifting; Mr. Newsom has said
some state pandemic aid will be tied to counties' enforcement of health
orders.)

One major challenge is tailoring responses to the huge variety of
conditions driving infections across the state, including a horrific
outbreak at
\href{https://www.marinij.com/2020/06/29/marin-asks-newsom-to-intervene-in-san-quentin-outbreak/}{San
Quentin State Prison} and family gatherings where people forget not to
hug their cousins and grandparents.

\textbf{What is the state tracking now?}

The state has released a
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CountyMonitoringDataStep2.aspx}{``watch
list'' of 19 counties} --- home to almost three-quarters of the state's
population --- where the state is providing ``technical assistance''
because they're showing
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx}{signs
of elevated disease transmission} or their hospitalizations are
increasing too quickly. (You can see how each county is faring
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx}{according
to the various metrics here}.)

State public health officials may either order or encourage those
counties to reinstate restrictions, as they did over the weekend when
they
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Bar-Closure-Guidance.aspx}{ordered
bars in seven counties to close}.

One number that has become more important for gauging where the virus is
spreading is the positivity rate.

\textbf{Don't positivity rates depend on how many tests are conducted?}

Yes. In fact, more widely available testing is part of why the state's
rising positivity rate is such a cause for concern.

As of Monday, \href{https://update.covid19.ca.gov/}{the state reported}
that on average, 84,000 tests were conducted per day in California over
the past two weeks --- well
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/coronavirus-covid-get-antibody-testing.html}{above
the 60,000-per-day target} public health officials laid out in April. On
Sunday, the number of tests over the 24-hour period reached almost
106,000.

At the same time, the percentage of those tests that have come back
positive has inched up to 5.5 percent on average over the past two
weeks. It was as low as 4.1 percent on May 24.

In any case, officials have said they would like to see even more tests
per day --- particularly as residents
o\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-24/why-is-it-still-so-hard-to-get-a-coronavirus-test}{f
Los Angeles County}, the epicenter of the virus's spread in California,
have been unable to get testing appointments.

\textbf{So is California closing again?}

Some of it is.

Most notably, in Los Angeles, officials said --- sigh --- that they
\href{https://twitter.com/lapublichealth/status/1277758362097037313}{would
close beaches over the weekend and that fireworks displays would be
banned}, so that residents will have fewer places to gather.

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.
