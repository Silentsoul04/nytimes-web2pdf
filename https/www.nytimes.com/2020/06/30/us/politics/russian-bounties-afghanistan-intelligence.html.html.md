# Suspicions of Russian Bounties Were Bolstered by Data on Financial Transfers

</div>

Analysts have used other evidence to conclude that the transfers were
most likely part of an effort to offer payments to Taliban-linked
militants to kill American and coalition troops in Afghanistan.

American officials intercepted electronic data showing large financial
transfers from a bank account controlled by
[Russia’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/asia/russia-taliban-afghanistan.html)
military intelligence agency to a
[Taliban](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/asia/russia-taliban-afghanistan.html)-linked
account, evidence that supported their conclusion that [Russia covertly
offered
bounties](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/politics/trump-putin-bounties.html)
for killing U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan, according to three
officials familiar with the intelligence.

Though the United States has accused
[Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-taliban-bounty.html)
of providing general support to the Taliban before, analysts concluded
from other intelligence that the transfers were most likely part of a
bounty program that detainees described during interrogations.

Investigators also identified by name numerous
[Afghans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/world/asia/afghan-russia-bounty-middleman.html)
in a network linked to the suspected Russian operation, the officials
said — including, two of them added, a man believed to have served as an
intermediary for distributing some of the funds and who is now thought
to be in Russia.

The intercepts bolstered the findings gleaned from the interrogations,
helping reduce an earlier disagreement among intelligence analysts and
agencies over the reliability of the detainees. The disclosures further
undercut White House officials’ claim that the intelligence was too
uncertain to brief President Trump. In fact, the information [was
provided to
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/russian-bounty-trump.html)
in his daily written brief in late February, two officials have said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Afghan officials this week described a sequence of events that
dovetailed with the account of the intelligence. They said that several
businessmen who transfer money through the informal “hawala” system were
arrested in Afghanistan over the past six months and were suspected of
being part of a ring of middlemen who operated between the Russian
intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U., and Taliban-linked militants.
The businessmen were arrested in what the officials described as
sweeping raids in the north of Afghanistan as well as in Kabul.

A half-million dollars was seized from the home of one of the men, added
a provincial official. The New York Times had [previously
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/russian-bounties-warnings-trump.html)
that the recovery of an unusually large amount of cash in a raid was an
early piece in the puzzle that investigators put together.

The three American officials who described and confirmed details about
the basis for the intelligence assessment spoke on the condition of
anonymity amid swelling turmoil over the Trump administration’s failure
to authorize any response to Russia’s suspected proxy targeting of
American troops and playing down of the issue after it came to light
four days ago.

White House and National Security Council officials declined to comment,
as did the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, John
Ratcliffe. They pointed to statements late Monday from Mr. Ratcliffe;
the national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien; and the Pentagon’s top
spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman. All of them said that recent news reports
about Afghanistan remained unsubstantiated.

The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, berated The Times on
Tuesday after this article was published, saying that reports based on
“selective leaking” disrupt intelligence gathering. She did not
address or deny the facts about the intelligence assessment, saying she
would not disclose classified information.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday, the administration invited several House Republicans to the
White House to discuss the intelligence. The briefing was mostly carried
out by three Trump administration officials: Mr. Ratcliffe, Mr. O’Brien
and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff. Until recently, both
Mr. Meadows and Mr. Ratcliffe were Republican congressmen known for
being outspoken supporters of Mr.
Trump.

#### Why intelligence officials suspect Russia of paying militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: A Times investigation has revealed evidence of a secret
    Russian operation to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan — and the
    failure of the Trump administration to act on that evidence. I spoke
    with my colleague Eric Schmitt, one of the reporters who broke the
    original story, about what we know now.
    
    It’s Wednesday, July 1.
    
    Eric, how is it that the U.S. first learned that Russia was up to
    something in Afghanistan?

  - eric schmitt  
    So, Michael, about six months ago or so, U.S. commandos, working
    with Afghan allies, carry out a raid on a Taliban safehouse. And
    they made a remarkable discovery. They found some $500,000 in
    American money inside this safehouse. Now, to be sure, from time to
    time when they do these kind of raids, you find weapons and you find
    other kinds of things. Even some money. But the military sources
    that we’ve talked to said they’d never seen such a large haul. I
    mean, what would these guys be doing with $500,000? How did they get
    it, and what was it going to be used for? So this set off a lot of
    questions.
    
    And as they conduct other raids, the commandos, C.I.A., other
    authorities in Afghanistan, they seize the cell phones of different
    fighters — Taliban fighters — and they start exploiting that to see
    if there’s any clues in the cell phones that might lead them back to
    the source of this money. But perhaps one of most important things
    that happens is when they seize a couple of very important senior
    Taliban and Taliban-related figures. And of course, that’s one of
    the first things they want to ask these operatives is do you know
    anything about this money?

  - michael barbaro  
    And what do the militants say?

  - eric schmitt  
    They had a remarkable story to tell. That this was money that they
    had been paid. That they’d been paid by a secretive Russian military
    intelligence unit for the express purpose of killing American,
    British and other coalition forces in Afghanistan.
    
    But these investigators, they were searching around for other proof
    — how to link all this together because, of course, how do you
    assess that these Taliban guys weren’t telling lies or some kind of
    disinformation?
    
    And then investigators learned of something else that sealed the
    deal, that seemed to kind of be the glue that pieced all these
    disparate parts together. And that was intercepts. Basically
    electronic intercepts of the financial transactions themselves from
    this Russian military intelligence unit, down to the Afghans on the
    ground who are the intermediaries, who are basically managing this
    program for them there. And then onto the killers themselves before
    they were dispatched to target the American forces there.
    
    Essentially, it was an electronic paper trail, receipts if you will,
    for services asked and services rendered. This became a very
    compelling argument that the military C.I.A. and other authorities
    in Afghanistan started putting together.

  - michael barbaro  
    And a very serious conclusion, because from what you’re describing,
    U.S. intelligence officials are not just putting together a theory
    that this money was offered to Taliban fighters to go after
    Americans — to basically kill them for hire — but that money had
    actually been paid out to them, suggesting that such killings had
    occurred.

  - eric schmitt  
    That’s right. This wasn’t just in theory, but there was the idea
    that they’d actually recovered some of the proceeds that the
    Russians had paid the Afghans to carry out this mission. So
    obviously the next task was to figure out what deaths may have been
    actually the result of this campaign.

  - michael barbaro  
    And do we have an answer?

  - eric schmitt  
    So the military and the intelligence officers working with Afghan
    officials started looking back over different attacks to see which
    looked suspicious. And their attentions focused on one in
    particular: three Marines who were killed on a patrol just outside
    of Bagram Air Base. They were patrolling on a normal day when a
    large car bomb basically blew up. And this is something that the
    military is still determining, just what the links were, if any, to
    this program, this attack. But it was suspicious, and it may have
    had the hallmarks of this program and some of the receipts tying
    back to it.

  - michael barbaro  
    And, Eric, in the minds of these intelligence officials who are
    starting to piece this Russian bounty system together, why would
    Russia do this? I mean, why would they pay the Taliban to kill U.S.
    soldiers?

  - eric schmitt  
    Well, Michael, I think you have to go back in the history of the
    U.S. and Russia and Afghanistan, essentially to the very end of the
    Cold War, where in the late 1980s, the C.I.A. secretly armed the
    Mujahideen resistance against the Soviet Union, which had invaded
    and occupied Afghanistan for nearly a decade. And the United States
    helped accelerate the departure of Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.
    
    Fast forward to after 9/11 when it’s the U.S. that invades
    Afghanistan. Russians want a stable government there. They don’t
    like Al Qaeda any more than the United States does. And so for some
    years, there’s actually some cooperation between Moscow and
    Washington.
    
    Until a few years ago, when President Putin of Russia starts to
    become disillusioned with the U.S. plan in Afghanistan, doesn’t
    believe it’s going to work, and begins — behind the backs of the
    U.S. — to support the Taliban. To provide weapons, arms the Taliban,
    who are still fighting the United States. And so we start to see
    this break where Russia is basically looking for ways to inflict
    pain on the United States, and maybe even accelerate the U.S.
    departure from Afghanistan, just as decades before the U.S. had done
    to the Soviet Union.
    
    So if you put that framework, where Russia is now looking for a way
    to replace the United States as the power inside of Afghanistan, and
    humiliate the United States at the same time, this bounty program
    starts to make a little bit of sense. If this secretive military
    intelligence unit can put bounties on the heads of American
    soldiers, increase the number of casualties, presumably that would
    also stir unrest back in the United States — already war weary after
    two decades of conflict in Afghanistan. So the Russian theory is,
    why not just speed that departure along? We take the U.S.‘s place
    and we humiliate Washington and President Trump in the process.

  - michael barbaro  
    And I guess the reason why Russia would turn to a middleman, the
    Taliban, on this is because it would never want to attack U.S.
    soldiers on its own in Afghanistan, just the way the U.S. didn’t
    want to ever attack Russian soldiers directly in the 1980s.

  - eric schmitt  
    That’s right. You hire basically cutouts to do your dirty work, and
    it’s very hard for the other side to prove that you’re responsible.
    When it’s murky like this and you have Afghan intermediaries,
    criminals on the ground, and money’s passing back and forth,
    Russians would have plausible deniability to say, oh, perhaps we
    were just supporting them for other aims. There’s no evidence that
    we were behind this.

  - michael barbaro  
    But Eric, even so, even with a middleman cutout, as you just called
    it, I have to imagine that this kind of an operation by Russia is
    very risky and represents a pretty significant escalation by Russia.

  - eric schmitt  
    Absolutely, Michael. Any time you have a foreign power, much less
    one like Russia, targeting American service members — American
    troops on the ground — that is a very serious thing.

  - michael barbaro  
    Right because this is, in its own way, almost a kind of act of war.

  - eric schmitt  
    Absolutely. That’s the way many people would see it. Just because
    Russia might be using intermediaries or henchmen to do this, they’re
    the ones responsible. They’re the ones setting these killings in
    motion if they’ve happened. They’re the ones that are essentially
    bribing the killers to carry out the attacks, and that’s something
    that’s very, very serious. And the Pentagon and the White House
    would have to address it.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    So Eric, in your reporting on this Russian bounty operation, what do
    you learn about how the White House, how the Pentagon decides to
    respond to the conclusion of the intelligence agencies that this
    operation exists?

  - eric schmitt  
    So this assessment that’s been put together by the C.I.A. and the
    military special-operations forces in Afghanistan starts to make its
    way up the chain of command into Washington, sometime in late
    January, early February perhaps. And it’s very closely held. This is
    some of the most sensitive intelligence in the American government,
    both because of the ramifications if it’s true that Russia has put a
    bounty on American soldiers heads, and the political sensitivity
    that anything to do with Russia has with this administration and
    specifically this White House. And that assessment is serious enough
    that it makes its way into what’s called the presidential daily
    briefing. This is the compendium of top intelligence and news items.
    It’s put together every day for the president to read. President
    Trump is not known to read it very often, very much. He relies more
    on verbal briefings, oral briefings.
    
    But by February 27, our sources tell us, it was in that document.
    About a month later, at the end of March, the National Security
    Council, the national security arm of the White House, holds its
    first meeting to discuss the intelligence assessment. It’s
    representatives from the State Department, from the Pentagon, from
    the C.I.A., from around the government who can weigh in about the
    impact this might have, and most important, the options. How should
    the United States government respond to this? And the options that
    are discussed at this meeting in late March include everything from
    sending Moscow a stern letter — basically cease and desist or else —
    all the way up to sanctions, economic sanctions on top of those
    already imposed on Moscow that have been proven effective in
    damaging their economy.
    
    We don’t know if President Trump was briefed on any of these
    options. But we do know that his administration did not authorize
    any kind of action in response. Nothing has happened so far as a
    result of this assessment.
    
    So that’s the way things stood for many weeks, that this was very
    tightly held information at the most senior levels of the
    government, until late last week —

  - archived recording  
    This is sort of stunning. Here’s the lead.

eric schmitt

— when the Times published a major investigation that basically spelled
out everything we’ve just been discussing.

  - archived recording  
    A New York Times report alleges Russia offered bounties to the
    Taliban in exchange for killing U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

michael barbaro

And what was the immediate reaction to all that information?

  - archived recording  
    Well, look, I’m sick to my stomach over this.

eric schmitt

Well, the immediate reaction was one of stunned disbelief —

  - archived recording  
    Sick to my stomach as a member of Congress, a patriot, but also
    someone who served in Afghanistan —

  - archived recording (nancy pelosi)  
    This is as bad as it gets.

eric schmitt

— both by Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

  - archived recording (nancy pelosi)  
    And yet the president will not confront the Russians on this score.

  - archived recording  
    Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, he said, quote, “imperative
    Congress get to the bottom of recent media reports.”

  - archived recording (chuck schumer)  
    Where is President Trump? His number-one job is to protect American
    soldiers.

eric schmitt

There was outrage that if indeed this bounty program had existed, what
was the United States government doing about it? How were they
protecting their soldiers, first of all, in Afghanistan? And what steps
were being taken to punish the Russians?

  - archived recording (chuck schumer)  
    He should have a plan. What are we doing? And above all, go after
    Putin.

eric schmitt

Because this is at a time when President Trump has continued to carry
out conversations with President Putin. In fact, just a few weeks ago —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    The problem is many of the things that we talk about are about
    Putin.

eric schmitt

— he invited Russia to join the G8 conference in Washington —

— much to the disbelief of European allies and even some of his own
Republican supporters here in the United States.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    So we have a G7. He’s not there. Half of the meeting is devoted to
    Russia. And if he was there, it would be much easier to solve.

eric schmitt

So as this information breaks, it breaks against a backdrop of the
president continuing to enjoy, in his view, very warm relations with
Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

michael barbaro

And how does the White House explain this? I mean not only not
responding to this Russian bounty program, but actually growing closer
to Russia and to Vladimir Putin after our government had reached this
conclusion.

  - archived recording (kayleigh mcenany)  
    Hello, everyone.

eric schmitt

The White House’s immediate response is —

  - archived recording (kayleigh mcenany)  
    — The C.I.A. director, N.S.A., National Security Adviser, and the
    chief of staff can all confirm that neither the president nor the
    vice president were briefed on the alleged Russian bounty
    intelligence.

eric schmitt

— that President Trump was never briefed on this. He never had a
briefing from the C.I.A. director, from his national security adviser,
from his director of national intelligence, and thus how could he have
made any decision on it?

  - archived recording (kayleigh mcenany)  
    There is no consensus within the intelligence community on these
    allegations. And, in effect, there are dissenting opinions from some
    in the intelligence community with regards to the veracity of what’s
    being reported.

eric schmitt

The White House press secretary is saying that the reason he wasn’t
briefed was because there was no consensus among the intelligence
agencies on what to brief him about.

  - archived recording (adam schiff)  
    We need to get to the bottom of these reports. I’m going to be
    briefed at the White House tomorrow. I’m asking that my entire
    committee be briefed by the intel agencies and —

eric schmitt

Democrats and Republicans both demand briefings from the president’s top
advisers on what the intelligence report says.

  - archived recording (adam schiff)  
    But is this another situation where the president either was told
    and just rejects it —

eric schmitt

And what the president knew and when he knew it.

  - archived recording (adam schiff)  
    — or his people are too scared to tell him because it contradicts
    this narrative of Vladimir Putin being his buddy?

eric schmitt

What his aides knew and when they knew it. And if the president really
wasn’t briefed, why wasn’t he briefed?

michael barbaro

Right, because the thinking is that the president knowing and not acting
is extremely problematic. But the president not knowing is problematic
as well, because what would it say about an administration if the
president was somehow not told this information or did not digest it?

eric schmitt

That’s right. There’s no good answer for the White House in this. Either
the president was told and he doesn’t remember, he wasn’t told because
his aides feared what his reaction might be, or he was told and just
dismissed it, because he didn’t believe the intelligence because it
involved negative reporting on Russia. You have to remember this has
happened before. You think back to the allegations that Russia meddled
in the 2016 elections.

  - archived recording  
    Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the
    election interference in 2016.

eric schmitt

And when asked about this at a news conference in Helsinki —

  - archived recording  
    Would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin,
    would you denounce what happened in 2016, and would you warn him to
    never do it again?

eric schmitt

President Trump turned to President Putin.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I have President Putin. He just said it’s not Russia. I will say
    this. I don’t see any reason why it would be. But I really —

eric schmitt

He said, I believe him over my intelligence agencies. This has a
different feel to it though. So often we’ve seen the past about some of
the president’s utterances and judgments and tweets which have kind of
fallen into partisan camps, and people can say what he really meant or
not. This is something different. This is about soldiers’ lives in
Afghanistan. This is about somebody’s brother, somebody’s husband,
somebody’s daughter who are on the front lines in Afghanistan. And
Trump, as the commander in chief, doesn’t care enough to take the brief?
Doesn’t care enough to read the intelligence about this? Or his aides
don’t think he will? Something as sacrosanct as the American soldier in
harm’s way in the battlefields of Afghanistan, the White House doesn’t
have its back? The president doesn’t have their backs? That’s something
very, very troubling indeed, if true.

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

    Dr. Fauci, based on what you’re seeing now, how many Covid-19 deaths
    and infections should America expect before this is all over?

  - archived recording (anthony fauci)  
    I can’t make an accurate prediction, but it is going to be very
    disturbing. I will guarantee you that because when you have an
    outbreak —

michael barbaro

During his latest appearance before Congress on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony
Fauci warned lawmakers that the number of new infections in the U.S.
could more than double if current conditions persist.

  - archived recording (anthony fauci)  
    We can’t just focus on those areas that are having the surge. It
    puts the entire country at risk. We are now having 40-plus thousand
    new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a
    day if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned.

michael barbaro

His warning comes as a surge of infections in the South and West now
extend to the Midwest, where six states are recording higher infection
rates. Overall, U.S. infections have increased 80 percent over the past
two weeks.

And in a closely watched Senate primary in Kentucky, Amy McGrath, the
moderate choice of the Democratic Party establishment, has narrowly
defeated Charles Booker, a liberal challenger who harnessed growing
public anger over police brutality. McGrath will now face Republican
Senator Mitch McConnell in the fall. In its final weeks, the Kentucky
primary had become a referendum on the future of the Democratic Party,
and whether the outcry over race and policing could influence the
outcome of an election. Despite losing, Booker won nearly 43 percent of
the vote.

That briefing focused on<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>intelligence information that supported the conclusion that
[Russia was running a covert bounty
operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/podcasts/the-daily/russian-bounties-afghanistan.html)
and other information that did not support it, according to two people
familiar with the meeting. For example, the briefing focused in part on
the interrogated detainees’ accounts and the earlier analysts’
disagreement over it.

Both people said the intent of the briefing seemed to be to make the
point that the intelligence on the suspected Russian bounty plot was not
clear cut. For example, one of the people said, the White House also
cited some interrogations by Afghan intelligence officials of other
detainees, playing down their credibility by describing them as
low-level.

The administration officials did not mention anything in the House
Republican briefing about intercepted data tracking financial transfers,
both of the people familiar with it said.

Democrats and Senate Republicans were also separately briefed at the
White House on Tuesday morning. Democrats emerged saying that the issue
was clearly not, as Mr. Trump has suggested, a
“[hoax](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1277431695248183298?lang=en).”
They demanded to hear directly from intelligence officials, rather than
from Mr. Trump’s political appointees, but conceded they had not secured
a commitment for such a briefing.

Based on the intelligence they saw, the lawmakers said they were deeply
troubled by Mr. Trump’s insistence he did not know about the plot and
his subsequent obfuscation when it became public.

“I find it inexplicable in light of these very public allegations that
the president hasn’t come before the country and assured the American
people that he will get to the bottom of whether Russia is putting
bounties on American troops and that he will do everything in his power
to make sure that we protect American troops,” said Representative Adam
B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee.

He added: “I do not understand for a moment why the president is not
saying this to the American people right now and is relying on ‘I don’t
know,’ ‘I haven’t heard,’ ‘I haven’t been briefed.’ That is just not
excusable.”

Mr. Ratcliffe was scheduled to go to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet
privately with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, an official
familiar with the planning said.

The Times [reported last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
that intelligence officials believed that a unit of the G.R.U. had
offered and paid bounties for killing American troops and other
coalition forces and that the White House had not authorized a response
after the National Security Council convened an interagency meeting
about the problem in late March.

Investigators are said to be focused on at least two deadly attacks on
American soldiers in Afghanistan. One is an April 2019 bombing outside
Bagram Air Base that killed three Marines: [Staff Sgt. Christopher
Slutman](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/nyregion/fdny-firefighter-killed-afghanistan.html),
43, of Newark, Del.; Cpl. Robert A. Hendriks, 25, of Locust Valley,
N.Y.; and Sgt. Benjamin S. Hines, 31, of York, Pa.

On Monday, Felicia Arculeo, the mother of Corporal Hendriks, told
[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/mom-of-marine-killed-in-afghanistan-wants-russia-bounty-claim-investigated.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)
that she was upset to learn from news reports of the suspicions that her
son’s death arose from a Russian bounty operation. She said she wanted
an investigation, adding that “the parties who are responsible should be
held accountable, if that’s even possible.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officials did not say which other attack was under scrutiny.

In claiming that the information was not provided to him, Mr. Trump has
also dismissed the intelligence assessment as
“[so-called](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1277202159109537793?lang=en)”
and claimed he was told that it was “[not
credible](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1277431695248183298?lang=en).”
The White House subsequently issued statements in the names of several
subordinates denying that he had been briefed.

Ms. McEnany reiterated that claim on Monday and said that the
information had not been elevated to Mr. Trump because there was a
dissenting view about it within the intelligence community.

But she and other administration officials demurred when pressed to say
whether their denials encompassed the president’s daily written
briefing, a compendium of the most significant intelligence and analysis
that the intelligence community writes for presidents to read. Mr. Trump
is known to often neglect reading his written briefings.

Intelligence about the suspected Russian plot was included in the
President’s Daily Brief [in late
February](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/russian-bounty-trump.html),
according to two officials, contrasting [Mr. Trump’s claim on
Sunday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1277202159109537793)
that he was never “briefed or told” about the matter.

The information was also considered solid enough to be distributed to
the broader intelligence community in a May 4 article in the C.I.A.’s
World Intelligence Review, commonly called The Wire, according to
several officials.

A spokesman for the Taliban has denied that they accepted Russia-paid
bounties to carry out attacks on Americans and other coalition soldiers,
saying that the group needed no such encouragement for its operations.
But one American official said the focus had been on criminals closely
associated with the Taliban.

In a raid in Kunduz City in the north about six months ago, 13 people
were arrested in a joint operation by American forces and the Afghan
intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, according to
Safiullah Amiry, the deputy provincial council chief there. Two of the
main targets of the raid had already fled — one to Tajikistan and one to
Russia, Mr. Amiry said — but it was in the Kabul home of one of them
where security forces found a half-million dollars. He said the Afghan
intelligence agency had told him the raids were related to Russian money
being disbursed to militants.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two former Afghan officials said Monday that members of local criminal
networks had carried out attacks for the Taliban in the past — not
because they shared the Taliban’s ideology or goals, but in exchange for
money.

In Parwan Province, where Bagram Air Base is, the Taliban are known to
have hired local criminals as freelancers, said Gen. Zaman Mamozai, the
former police chief of the province. He said the Taliban’s commanders
are based in two districts of the province, Seyagird and Shinwari, and
that from there they coordinate a network that commissions criminals to
carry out attacks.

And Haseeba Efat, a former member of Parwan’s provincial council, also
said the Taliban have hired freelancers in Bagram District — including,
in one case, one of his own distant relatives.

“They agree with these criminals that they won’t have monthly salary,
but they will get paid for the work they do when the Taliban need them,”
Mr. Efat said.

Twenty American service members were killed in combat-related operations
in Afghanistan last year, the most since 2014.

Nicholas Fandos.
