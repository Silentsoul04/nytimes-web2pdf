# Trump Attacks a Suburban Housing Program. Critics See a Play for White Votes.

</div>

Proponents of the policy saw the move as an attempt to shore up the
president’s sagging support among white suburban voters by stoking
racial division.

WASHINGTON — President Trump has taken aim at an Obama-era program
intended to eliminate racial housing disparities in the
[suburbs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-white-voters-in-suburbs.html),
a move proponents of the policy see as an attempt to shore up his
sagging support among white suburban voters by stoking racial division.

In a Twitter post late Tuesday, Mr. Trump announced that he was
considering the elimination of a 2015 initiative known as [Affirmatively
Furthering Fair Housing](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/affh/),
which requires localities to identify and address patterns of racial
segregation outlawed under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 by creating
detailed corrective plans.

“At the request of many great Americans who live in the
[Suburbs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-white-voters-in-suburbs.html),
and others, I am studying the AFFH housing regulation that is having a
devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas,” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1278136326647406593),
adding, “Not fair to homeowners, I may END\!”

The tweet came just a day after Mr. Trump [posted a
video](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/trump-white-couple-protesters.html)
showing a pair of angry white homeowners pointing an assault rifle and
pistol in the direction of chanting protesters walking past their house
in St. Louis — part of a barrage of footage on social media capturing
white homeowners confronting Black bystanders, often their neighbors,
for simply standing on their streets.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development were
puzzled by the timing of Mr. Trump’s tweet; the housing rule has been in
limbo since Mr. Obama left office, tied up by litigation, lengthy
rule-making and exemption requests by local officials.

In January, HUD [posted a
notice](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/01/14/2020-00234/affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing)
saying it was considering weakening the original regulation by factoring
in “the unique needs and difficulties faced by individual jurisdictions”
in complying with a 92-item questionnaire that must be completed to
obtain funding from the department.

Mr. Trump’s claim that he might end the housing initiative was a
reference to the January proposal, not the announcement of a new policy,
a White House spokesman said.

The process may not have changed, but there has been a significant shift
in political sentiment prompted by the president’s response to the
coronavirus pandemic.

Mr. Trump and his campaign team, already concerned about his weakness in
battleground states, have become increasingly alarmed by internal
polling showing a softening of support among suburban voters, especially
women without college degrees, according to two Republican officials
close to the campaign.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They said Mr. Trump was also seeking to highlight a set of proposals,
put forward by the campaign of his presumptive Democratic rival, Joseph
R. Biden Jr., to reassess zoning laws relating to single-family homes, a
move some critics argue could turn suburbs into cities. “Corrupt Joe
Biden wants to make them MUCH WORSE,” [Mr. Trump
tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1278136326647406593).

Hours after Mr. Trump tweeted, his son Donald Trump Jr., [posted a
link](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1278313243996377095) to
a National Review article titled, [“Joe Biden and Democrats Are Set to
Abolish the
Suburbs.”](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/biden-and-dems-are-set-to-abolish-the-suburbs/)

Shaun Donovan, who as secretary of Housing and Urban Development created
the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing policy after pursuing fair
housing actions against<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Yonkers, N.Y., and other localities, said the messages had little
to do with housing policy, but were part of a campaign to stoke
long-simmering racial animosities for political purposes.

“Trump’s tweet is racist and wrong,” said Mr. Donovan, who established
the rule after months of consultation with civil rights groups. “He
would turn back the clock to the days when the federal government
perpetuated the lie that Black families’ moving to suburban
neighborhoods brings down property values.”

The core of the fair housing policy was “a recognition that outlawing
intentional discrimination is not enough for people of color to overcome
the consequences of centuries of oppression,” added Mr. Donovan, a
former New York City housing commissioner who [is now running for
mayor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/nyregion/shaun-donovan-mayor-nyc.html).

Whatever the motive, the tweet was a pointed reminder of just how firmly
Mr. Trump’s slashing style is rooted in the racially polarized conflicts
of his early days in Queens.

The president, fighting for survival at 74, is choosing to make a
political stand on a similar racial and political battlefield he first
stormed in 1973, when, at 27, he [vehemently fought a federal fair
housing
lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html)
accusing his father Fred Trump’s rental developments in boroughs outside
Manhattan of discriminating against Black applicants.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Diane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing
Coalition, an advocacy group based in Washington, questioned the timing
of the tweet — especially since Mr. Trump seldom weighs in on such
specific policy matters.

“It’s especially abhorrent for the president to threaten further
entrenchment of segregated communities now, during a time of reckoning
on racial injustices in our country,” Ms. Yentel said. “A direct line
connects America’s history of racist housing policies to today’s
overpolicing of Black and brown communities.”

It is unclear how the pandemic, economic swoon and local moratoriums on
rent payments will affect the proposed rule changes. Even before the
current crisis, [homelessness rates were on the
rise,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/us/politics/homelessness-trump-california.html)
especially on the West Coast. At the same time, Black homeownership
rates [have
dropped](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/five-point-strategy-reducing-black-homeownership-gap)
to levels not seen since the 1960s.

The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing policy was meant to replace
oversight of federal spending on housing that was widely seen as
ineffective, especially when it came to discrimination based on race,
disability, gender, age and sexual orientation.

The new rules, in theory, created stricter benchmarks for communities
receiving federal funding, but compliance proved difficult, and HUD was
still working on a tool kit that would have made it easier for
localities to file the necessary reports when Mr. Trump was elected, Mr.
Donovan said.

Opponents, including some local officials, viewed the new system as
onerous — and found a receptive audience for their complaints when Ben
Carson, a brain surgeon with no housing experience, was confirmed as Mr.
Trump’s housing secretary in 2017.

By 2018, Mr. Carson, a free-market conservative and the only Black
person in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, delayed[enactment of the
regulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/upshot/trump-delays-hud-fair-housing-obama-rule.html)
and signaled his intention to eliminate it altogether, [part of a larger
strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/ben-carson-hud-fair-housing-discrimination.html)
of slow-walking fair housing investigations and marginalizing department
officials who aggressively pursued cases.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Carson’s moves were part of a larger push to reduce housing
regulation led by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative think
tanks that worked closely with department officials and the White House
Domestic Policy Council.

Mr. Carson has also tried to roll back the Obama administration’s
attempt to more closely monitor the use of computer algorithms and other
methods that have historically been used to exclude minority applicants
from receiving housing loans.

In announcing the proposed rule changes, Mr. Carson [claimed the
Obama-era
initiative](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/us/politics/trump-housing-segregation.html)
was “actually suffocating investment in some of our most distressed
neighborhoods that need our investment the most.”
