Lingering
Questions}\label{did-a-mutation-help-the-coronavirus-spread-more-evidence-but-lingering-questions}}

Researchers claim that a predominating variant had a ``fitness
advantage.'' But many experts are not persuaded.

For months, scientists have debated whether a variant of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html}{coronavirus}
that has come to predominate in much of the world did so partly because
it is more transmissible than other viruses.

On Thursday, a team of researchers reported new evidence that is likely
to deepen the debate rather than settle it, experts said; too many
uncertainties remain, in a pandemic that changes shape by the day.

The \href{https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30820-5}{new
report}, posted by the journal Cell and led by investigators at Los
Alamos National Laboratory, suggested that the variant did have such an
advantage. Other researchers said the findings were not yet definitive.

The underlying question is as important as ever, both for understanding
the early phases of the pandemic and anticipating how it will progress
in the coming months. If the genetic glitch that defines the variant,
known as D614G, imparted even a slight increase in transmissibility, it
would help explain
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/world/asia/coronavirus-spread-where-why.html}{why
infections exploded in some regions} and not in others with similar
density and other attributes. Others experts argue that it is far more
likely that the variation
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html}{spread}
widely by chance, multiplying outward from explosive outbreaks in
Europe.

Last month, virologists at Scripps Research, Florida, found that viruses
with the D614G mutation were far more infectious than those without it,
at least in cell culture. Those differences are necessary for higher
transmission to occur in the real world, but hardly sufficient; there is
no evidence that the D614G variant makes people sicker.

The new paper, led by Bette Korber, a theoretical biologist, presents
evidence in the form of lab findings, tests of infected patients and a
broad statistical analysis of the pandemic as the D614G variant
repeatedly took over in cities, regions and countries. ``The consistency
of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that
the D614G variant may have a fitness advantage,'' the authors concluded.

In an interview, Dr. Korber said that the three lines of evidence ``all
support the idea this is quite likely to be a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html}{more
transmissible virus}'' than other variants. She added: ``It is the
dominant virus in the world, it only took about a month for that to
happen, and it's now the one we should be looking at.''

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The report also acknowledged that other alternate explanations were
possible, including so-called founder effects --- an advantage rooted in
chance, and in the dynamics of transmission in regions where the variant
first took off. Other research has found
\href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v4}{no
evidence of increased transmissibility} for D614G, and for many
scientists the question remains an open one.

``It's exciting to see a group take on the challenge of solving this,
and the differences they report are intriguing, particularly the
consistency across geography,'' said Dr. Marc Suchard, a biostatistician
at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine. ``But
this is an extraordinarily challenging problem, the evolution and
demography are complex, so there's much more work to be done.''

Dr. Korber helped focus scientists' attention on the D614G mutation in
early May, when she posted
\href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v2}{a
paper} arguing that ``when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes
the dominant form.'' The new report expands on the previous one, and Dr.
Korber said that her group intended to continue its investigation by
testing different variants in animals, to see if differences in
transmission are detectable.
