WAUKESHA, Wis. — If Wisconsin is the bellwether state for November’s
general election, then Waukesha County might be the most important area
of the most important state. Just outside the Democratic stronghold of
Milwaukee, it is a safe Republican area, but with many of the kinds of
voters [who have been souring on President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/upshot/poll-2020-biden-battlegrounds.html):
college-educated white moderates.

Hillary Clinton’s performance here — around a third of the vote — was
disastrous for her chances in the state. However, Senator Tammy Baldwin,
a progressive Democrat, picked up nearly 40 percent of the Waukesha vote
while cruising to re-election in 2018. Former Vice President Joe Biden
will need to be more like Ms. Baldwin if he wants to win Wisconsin.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Matt Lowe, the 29-year-old chairman of the Waukesha Democratic Party, is
working to pull that off. He says his target number for Mr. Biden in the
county is 40 percent, which would help erase the small margin Mrs.
Clinton lost the state by.

In an interview today at the county party’s office, Mr. Lowe explained
how he thought Mr. Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and
protests against racial injustice would hurt the president in the
all-important Midwestern suburbs. (As always, our conversation has been
edited and condensed.)

**What have you seen since 2016 that has changed in this community?**

It’s night and day. Whether it’s party organization, energy, enthusiasm,
financially — I mean, really almost any way you measure, we’re in a
better place now than we were then. When I took over, our membership was
in the low hundreds. We had maybe 10 or 15 people coming out for monthly
events. It was a very old crowd, not very active or organized. We relied
a lot on the state party and the national party to kind of drive
everything.

Today we have over 500 dues-paying members. Our last meeting before the
pandemic we had over 300 people show up. We have the youngest executive
board in the state of Wisconsin. We have the largest high school chapter
in the state of Wisconsin. The organization and the enthusiasm have been
radically different.

**Give me your diagnosis: What happened in this state, and more
specifically in this region, in 2016?**

I think everybody was complacent. We were just kind of like, “Trump is
this insane Republican outlier that no one’s going to back, and come
Election Day everyone is going to vote rational.” And come Election Day
we were dramatically surprised.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We probably knocked less doors. We put in a little less effort. People
who volunteered, they’d say instead of doing those five extra shifts,
I’m just going to take it easy and not worry about it. And we got
surprised.

**In terms of his appeal here, is there something about Joe Biden that
makes your job easier?**

I think Biden comes with this statesman appeal. Joe Biden is a guy who’s
devoted his entire life to serving this country. And he’s always spoken
his mind — for good or bad. He’s always been very true with who he is,
and you never really question his motives or where he’s coming from.

I think the biggest question most voters ask themselves is, “Who cares
about me?” And it’s stark: Who is going to put people like them at the
front of their mind, Joe Biden or Donald Trump?

**But there was so much talk in the primary, among your generation, of
structural, systemic change and how a nominee needs to embrace that to
excite the base. The Biden campaign says that he does the structural
stuff, but also that he has a different coalition that might not be
thrilling the young folks but can lead to success in places like
Wisconsin. Is that true?**

Conor Lamb \[a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania\] did an
interview recently talking about western Pennsylvania, a very
conservative part of a very Wisconsin-like state. And a lot of what he
said resonated with me here in Waukesha. You need somebody who’s
community first, who is very honest with their stances. And when they
disagree with you, they’re telling you why but making sure that you know
they’re putting their community first even in that disagreement.

I think Conor Lamb is a great model for what the Democratic Party is.
Because the Democratic Party is a big-tent coalition. We have the Conor
Lambs and the
[A.O.C.s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/aoc-facebook-ads.html)
\[Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\] in the same
party, fighting the same fights with radically different ideas. And we
welcome that debate.

**You’re 29. How does that view fit with your generation, which has many
progressives who have been more rigid about what constitutes a
Democrat?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I oftentimes have a hard time being this idealistic 29-year-old and a
pragmatic county party chair. In 2012, I was a paid Obama staffer and I
got my ballot and I wasn’t sure if I was going to vote for him because I
was so upset with seeing him govern as a moderate Democrat. And I talked
to my mentor at the time, and he told me that I can stand outside the
system and \[complain\], or I can jump in and make the party reflect
what I want it to.

I made my choice. I voted for Obama, I dove into the party. So the way I
talk to a lot of my friends is that if we want to continue seeing
progress, we can try to burn the system down and see what happens, or we
can take our steps and get the progressive progression we want. And I
think the best thing that we can do, and the best thing that I’ve sold a
lot of my younger folks on, is that we elect Joe Biden and we hold him
accountable to govern as progressive as we possibly want him to be. That
we continue to take safe Democratic seats where there’s maybe a moderate
and we put an A.O.C. in there. And we govern with the biggest coalition
that pushes our country as far progressive as we can.

**The Trump campaign tells reporters like me that the protests are going
to scare the Waukeshas of the world, that images of rioting and looting
are going to help them win people back. Is that possible?**

People are going to see the very limited amounts of rioting and the very
limited amounts of looting and weigh them against the thousands of
images of peaceful demonstrations. Even in our own county, we have had
dozens of peaceful, large demonstrations, over 100 people demonstrating
for Black Lives Matter. Yes, they’re going to see these images of fire
and looting, but they’re also going to remember driving through their
streets and seeing 100 people with masks and signs being super peaceful
and calm. More and more as we go along, the ads are becoming a little
less effective.

When you do six months of fearmongering, it’s not going to work.

This morning, the New York Times editorial board commemorated the July 4
weekend with [a rollout of the latest
chapter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/income-inequality-solutions.html)
in “[The America We
Need](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-inequality-america.html)”
series, a Times Opinion project on economic inequality. Throughout this
weekend, the board wrote, “we celebrate the creation of the United
States, though that project remains substantially incomplete.”

“This year of crises has underscored the distance between the lofty
rhetoric of our founding documents and the persistent inequalities of
American life,” the editorial says. “This nation began as a set of
promises that it has yet to keep.”

The board recommends “reversing the economic segregation of residential
life,” which compounds economic and social inequality, and “funding
schools based on the needs of the students, rather than the value of
parents’ homes.” It calls for measures like “reducing, and in some cases
eliminating, occupational licensing requirements” — and much more.

The essay acknowledges structural barriers that might prevent bold
reforms. Among them is the fact that the “connection between government
and the governed is being strained by the growing divide between the
distribution of the population and the distribution of senators.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, [the editorial
concludes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/income-inequality-solutions.html),
the country must recommit itself to the “difficult but essential work of
ensuring all Americans have the freedom to enjoy life and liberty, and
to pursue happiness.”
