52}\label{tuxe2nio-mendonuxe7a-brazilian-carnaval-samba-composer-dies-at-52}}

Carnaval.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

The refrain of Tânio Mendonça's final samba song was definitely of the
moment. It called on people to maintain distance, wash their hands and
be patient.

In stark contrast to the Carnaval marches he normally composed for
80-piece drum batteries and a legion of singers, the song had the
spareness of a recording made at home. His soft crooning and the
syncopated beat he drummed out evoked the isolation of quarantine
brought on by the coronavirus, which would claim his life just weeks
later.

Mr. Mendonca died at 52 on May 23 in a Rio de Janeiro hospital. His
wife, Karina Oliveira, said the cause was Covid-19. He was one of 23
people from his Carnaval group to die from the disease, which has
ravaged the working-class neighborhoods that gave birth to samba.

A composer and director for Mocidade Independente, one of Rio's
top-flight samba schools, Mr. Mendonça lived for Carnaval. The so-called
schools are
actually\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/02/brazil-carnival-2020-photos/607075/}{thousands-strong
parade groups} from Rio's poor neighborhoods, and each year they mount
over-the-top
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ztLCSwg6k0}{spectacles}, in the
Sambadrome parade area, that have helped give Rio's Carnaval its fame.

For months leading up to that pre-Lenten bash, composers like Mr.
Mendonça compete to have one of their songs selected as the school's
annual theme. It's not easy. Since he joined Mocidade in 1996, his
sambas have made it only as far as the finals.

Still, he worked selflessly to train a new generation of composers while
playing percussion in the rhythm section. He was the sole composer for
Estica Marimba, one of the dozens of smaller Carnaval groups that crowd
Rio's streets when the main parade is not taking place.

Tânio Perreira de Mendonça was born on March 2, 1968, in São João de
Meriti, on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, to Arnaldo Perreira de
Mendonça, a Navy captain, and Paraguassu Henrique, who tended to the
couple's eight children.

Mr. Mendonça was a teenager when his father died, and as the oldest
child he assumed his place at the head of the family. He worked in a
series of jobs, from street vendor to office administrator, to keep the
family afloat amid grinding poverty. But he worked just as tirelessly on
samba.

In addition to his wife, he is survived by four sisters and two
children, Márcio and Vitoria, from earlier marriages.

Mr. Mendonça's sister Adriana remembered him as a man who, despite the
hardships, never left his family wanting.

``When we were young and I woke up hungry,'' she said, ``he would go
out, and I'd have to wait until he'd sold his first pair of flip-flops
so he could buy me a piece of bread for breakfast.''
