Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of President Trump’s eldest son and a
top fund-raising official for the Trump re-election campaign, tested
positive for the coronavirus on Friday before a Fourth of July event at
Mount Rushmore, a person familiar with her condition said.

Ms. Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump
Jr., in anticipation of attending a huge fireworks display [where the
president was set to
speak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mount-rushmore.html).
They did not travel aboard Air Force One, according to the person
familiar with her condition, and she was the only person in the group
who tested positive.

As a routine precaution, people [who come in close contact with Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/coronavirus-testing-senate-white-house.html)
are screened for the virus.

Ms. Guilfoyle is [the third person in possible proximity to Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/us/politics/white-house-coronavirus-trump.html)
known to have contracted the virus. A [personal
valet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/coronavirus-white-house-military-aide.html)
who served Mr. Trump his food and [the press secretary for Vice
President Mike
Pence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/us/politics/white-house-coronavirus-safety.html)
[tested
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/us/politics/white-house-coronavirus-safety.html)
for the virus in May.

Ms. Guilfoyle was not experiencing symptoms, the person familiar with
her condition said. She and the younger Mr. Trump never met up with the
president’s entourage, the person said. Out of caution, the couple plans
to drive back from South Dakota to the East Coast, the person said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, that another person who was expected to be near Mr. Trump tested
positive — and someone who most staff aides consider a member of the
Trump family — is likely to renew attention around potential risks to
the president.

Ms. Guilfoyle attended Mr. Trump’s indoor rally last month in Tulsa,
Okla. Before and since then, some campaign staff and Secret Service
personnel have tested positive for the coronavirus. Herman Cain, a
former Republican presidential candidate who was also at the rally,
[said this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/herman-cain-coronavirus.html)
that he had been hospitalized with the virus.

Sergio Gor, the chief of staff for the Trump Victory Finance Committee,
said in a statement that Ms. Guilfoyle “was immediately isolated to
limit any exposure.” He added, “She’s doing well, and will be retested
to ensure the diagnosis is correct since she’s asymptomatic, but as a
precaution will cancel all upcoming events.” The younger Mr. Trump,
despite testing negative, was self-isolating and canceling public events
as a precaution, Mr. Gor said.

Even as outbreaks have emerged in the South and West and as states
across the country report a record number of cases each day, White House
officials — and Mr. Trump in particular — [have minimized their
focus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
on the virus in public appearances. In an interview on Wednesday, the
president indicated that he believed the virus was “going to sort of
just disappear.”

The president’s aides [recently modified
protocols](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/white-house-coronavirus-restrictions.html)
for people entering the White House grounds, abandoning routine
temperature checks, for instance. They have counseled people
experiencing symptoms typical of the coronavirus to stay away.

But people who come in proximity to Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence are still
tested for the coronavirus.
