# Trump Uses Mount Rushmore Speech to Deliver Divisive Culture War Message

</div>

Down in the polls and failing to control a raging pandemic, the
president cast himself as waging battle against a “new far-left fascism”
that imperils American values and seeks to erase history.

WASHINGTON — Standing in a packed amphitheater in front of Mount
Rushmore for an Independence Day celebration, President Trump delivered
a dark and divisive speech on Friday that cast his struggling effort to
win a second term as a battle against a “new far-left fascism” seeking
to wipe out the nation’s values and history.

With the coronavirus pandemic raging and his campaign faltering in the
polls, his appearance amounted to a fiery reboot of his re-election
effort, using the holiday and an official presidential address to mount
a full-on culture war against a straw-man version of the left that he
portrayed as inciting mayhem and moving the country toward
totalitarianism.

“Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history,
defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,” Mr.
Trump said, addressing a packed crowd of sign-waving supporters, few of
whom wore masks. “Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our
founders, deface our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent
crime in our cities.”

Mr. Trump barely mentioned the frightening resurgence of the pandemic,
even as the country surpassed 53,000 new cases Friday and health
officials across the nation [urged Americans to scale
back](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-fourth-of-july.html)
their Fourth of July plans.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Instead, appealing unabashedly to his base with ominous language and
imagery, he railed against what he described as a dangerous “cancel
culture” intent on toppling monuments and framed himself as a strong
leader who would protect the Second Amendment, law enforcement and the
country’s heritage.

The scene at Mount Rushmore was the latest sign of how Mr. Trump
appears, by design or default, increasingly disconnected from the
intense concern among Americans about the health crisis gripping the
country. More than just a partisan rally, it underscored the extent to
which Mr. Trump is appealing to a subset of Americans to [carry him to a
second
term](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/podcasts/the-daily/trump-mount-rushmore-speech.html)
by changing the subject and appealing to fear and
division.

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: ‘Their Goal Is the End of America’

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Rachel Quester and Luke Vander Ploeg, with help from Asthaa Chaturvedi; and edited by M.J. Davis Lin and Lisa Chow

#### What President Trump’s divisive speech at Mount Rushmore reveals about his re-election campaign.

</div>

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: In a major speech at Mount Rushmore, President Trump said
    that the goal of nationwide protests is not, quote, “a better
    America.” Their goal, he said, is the end of America. Maggie
    Haberman on what that speech reveals about the president’s
    re-election campaign.
    
    It’s Tuesday July 7.
    
    Maggie, heading into this July 4 weekend, what was our understanding
    of what this Mount Rushmore speech from President Trump, what it was
    for, what it was intended to do?

  - maggie haberman  
    So Michael, the month of June was pretty calamitous for President
    Trump politically and in terms of his legacy. It began with the
    federal government having protesters forcibly cleared using chemical
    irritants from Lafayette Park across from the White House, so that
    the president could then take a photo op. To mass protests across
    the country. To a huge spike in coronavirus cases in areas of the
    country where it really had not been that prevalent, and where the
    governors in those states were looking toward reopening.
    
    So the president tried for a reboot of his campaign with a rally in
    Tulsa on June 20. That rally was sparsely attended compared to what
    they had advertised as their likely attendance. And so Mount
    Rushmore and this event was supposed to be the reboot of the failed
    reboot. This was going to be an effort by the president to show he
    was in charge and trying to look toward the general election.

  - michael barbaro  
    And from your reporting, what was this reboot of the reboot going to
    look like in a speech?

  - maggie haberman  
    So the president needs an enemy to fight against. In 2018 during the
    midterms, you saw the president try to galvanize support against a
    looming threat, as he put it, of a caravan that was headed across
    the southern border with Mexico. And this was basically a threat of
    a foreign invasion. And he talked about this a lot and he tweeted
    about it a lot. And the main enemy that the U.S. is dealing with
    right now is the coronavirus, which is spreading rapidly. That’s an
    issue on which his polling is pretty bad. And his advisers know it.
    And another force that the country is dealing with right now is
    police brutality. Neither of those are issues that Donald Trump is
    seen as particularly strong on, or areas where he has shown he wants
    to lead.
    
    So instead, looking for this enemy, aides described in his speech he
    was going to go after a left-wing culture coming after people who
    don’t agree with it. Now the threat is other Americans. The threat
    is people who don’t think like you.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Well, thank you very much. And Governor Noem, Secretary Bernhardt,
    we very much appreciate it. Members of Congress, distinguished
    guests, and a very special hello to South Dakota.

michael barbaro

OK, let’s talk about how this speech actually unfolds. I watched it. I
know you did as well. So I want us to walk through it and pick out a few
key passages that illuminate what he’s actually up to here, kind of a
close reading of this speech. So where do you think we should start?

maggie haberman

I would start just understanding what it looked like. He was standing at
this podium, surrounded by flags, in front of this historic monument.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    There could be no better place to celebrate America’s independence
    than beneath this magnificent, incredible, majestic mountain
    monument to the greatest Americans who have ever lived.

maggie haberman

And that was supposed to underscore this current conversation about
monuments and statues around the country.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and
    before the world, this monument will never be desecrated. These
    heroes will never be defaced. Their legacy will never, ever be
    destroyed. Their achievements will never be forgotten. And Mount
    Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers
    and to our freedom.

maggie haberman

Much of the conversation has been around Confederate totems, Confederate
statues, the Confederate flag. The president has resisted those
conversations. But even members of his own party have said that it is
time to remove some of those monuments. Where he is drawing the line is
when the conversation moves to George Washington or Thomas Jefferson.
Those are two of the faces on Mount Rushmore. And that’s part of why
he’s choosing to have this conversation there.

michael barbaro

And what is he saying about that debate around statues to presidents
like that?

maggie haberman

What he is suggesting is that the political left is trying to rewrite
history —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    1776 represented the culmination of thousands of years of Western
    civilization and the triumph of not only spirit, but of wisdom,
    philosophy and reason. And yet —

maggie haberman

— by calling into question those men, by suggesting that their legacies
need to be thought about again.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    As we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens
    every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled. They
    bled to secure —

maggie haberman

And the reason that people are saying that their legacies need to be
reconsidered is because they were slaveholders, and that you can’t have
an honest conversation about race if you do not acknowledge that.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our
    history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our
    children.

maggie haberman

What he’s really trying to do is convince Republicans who are feeling
shaky about him — and he hopes some independent voters — that the
protests around the country have gone too far. He is trying to get them
to see it the way he sees it, which is, this isn’t just a movement about
the Confederacy. They’re coming for our whole history — “our.” They are
coming for the history of white America.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface
    our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our
    cities.

maggie haberman

It is in keeping with what President Trump has done for many, many years
now, which is an ‘us versus them’ approach to his base of older, white
voters.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    But no, the American people are strong and proud. And they will not
    allow our country and all of its values, history and culture to be
    taken from them.

michael barbaro

OK, what stands out next to you in this speech?

maggie haberman

So the president very quickly went on to talk about how a, quote
unquote, political weapon of the Americans he is talking about in this
speech is —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Cancel culture.

maggie haberman

— so-called “cancel culture.”

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters and demanding
    total submission from anyone who disagrees.

maggie haberman

He is describing it as anyone who disagrees with certain folks are going
to get chased out of polite society. And that’s not really what this.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    This is the very definition of totalitarianism. And it is completely
    alien to our culture and to our values. And it has absolutely no
    place in the United States of America.

maggie haberman

So in part, this is appealing to a longstanding sense among
conservatives that they are being attacked by the left for their
beliefs. Also notice his emphasis on our values and our culture. He has
used the words culture and values repeatedly to appeal to his base since
2017. This is the thing that he shares with his voters. It certainly is
not geography — in many cases they’re in the Deep South. And he is a man
from Queens. But this sense of our way of life is being taken over is
what he has used time and again to appeal to people.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty, must be
    stopped. And it will be stopped very quickly.
    
    We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation’s
    children, end this radical assault and preserve our beloved American
    way of life. In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate
    boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute
    allegiance. If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals,
    recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be
    censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished. It’s not
    going to happen to us.

michael barbaro

So Maggie, what is the next passage in this speech that strikes you?

maggie haberman

Sure. So keeping up with these themes, the president went on and said —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    This left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the
    American Revolution.

maggie haberman

— “This left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the
American Revolution.” And then he went on a little bit later to say
their goal is not a better America. Their goal is the end of America.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    In so doing, they would destroy the very civilization that rescued
    billions from poverty, disease, violence and hunger, and that lifted
    humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery and progress.

maggie haberman

You would think that he was talking about the British the way that he’s
describing this —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    In its place, they want power for themselves.

maggie haberman

— as opposed to talking about primarily Black people in this country,
but not only, who have been trying to right historic wrongs. He is
making it sound, once again, as if something is being taken from him and
his supporters.

michael barbaro

In this case, American civilization?

maggie haberman

Yes. And he is trying to drive that home with everything he says.

michael barbaro

I mean, this feels like race baiting.

maggie haberman

I think it more than feels that way, Michael. I would argue it is race
baiting. Look, I don’t think that Donald Trump is suddenly a different
person. I think this is who he has been for a very, very long time,
going back decades. But I do think he is getting explicit in what he is
saying, both as protests are growing in the country and as his own poll
numbers are sinking.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    But just as patriots did in centuries past, the American people will
    stand in their way. And we will win, and win quickly and with great
    dignity.

maggie haberman

He is not explicitly using the words black and white. But he is
explicitly describing one version of America versus another. And that, I
think, is different, along with the fact that we have really not seen a
president before use an Independence Day speech to be so divisive and to
pit Americans in two, the way he is here.

michael barbaro

So Maggie, how does this speech end?

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Americans must never lose sight of this miraculous story.

maggie haberman

So the president concludes this speech by saying he wants to build —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I am signing an executive order to establish the National Garden of
    American Heroes.

maggie haberman

— a garden of statues.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    A vast, outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest
    Americans to ever live.

maggie haberman

And in this garden, he wants to put a variety of American figures —
presidents, artists, sports figures.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    From this night —

maggie haberman

And with that —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    — and from this magnificent place —

maggie haberman

— the president applauded for himself and for the crowd.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    — God bless your families. God bless our great military. And God
    bless America. Thank you very much.

maggie haberman

And there was a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Maggie, what most surprises me about this speech, and the fact that it
is supposed to be a reset of a presidential campaign, is that the
message seems to fly in the face of polling that shows Americans don’t
agree with this version of how to deal with race.

And I want to read a question that The Times asked voters in six swing
states about these protests. And here was the question: Would you rather
have a candidate who says that we need to be tough on protests that go
too far, or whether they would rather have a candidate who says we need
to focus on the cause of those protests, even when they go too far?

And voters told The Times in those swing states by a 40 percent margin
that they would rather have a candidate who focuses on a cause of the
protests, even when they go too far. So doesn’t that suggest that the
president, this speech, this message is profoundly out of sync with the
electorate?

maggie haberman

Look, Michael, you read the polls. I read the polls. They all make clear
that the president is wildly out of step with where the majority of
voters are right now, where conservative voters are, where independent
voters are, where a broad spectrum of voters are. This is a president
who likes to do things his own way. He has ideas that he wants to put
out there, regardless of how much it upsets his advisers, regardless of
how scared senators are about losing their seats because his rhetoric is
making things very hard for them. But he is not where the majority of
Americans are in those polls.

michael barbaro

So Maggie, what is the thinking here? If the president’s re-election
campaign has seen those polls that you and I have all seen, do they see
something that we’re not seeing? Do they have a theory that extends
beyond these poll numbers?

maggie haberman

Many of the people in the president’s campaign believe the direction
that the polls are taking, even if they argue with some of the margins.
Some of the people around the president share with him a belief or
theory, or whatever you want to call it, that people are not being
honest with the pollsters when they talk about how much support they
have for these protests, and that the numbers will come around in
President Trump’s favor when we get to the fall.

michael barbaro

And help me understand that. When they say that they don’t think the
polls reflect the real support for this movement, what do they mean?

maggie haberman

They think that people are inclined to lie to pollsters on matters of
race. Now there have been campaigns where that has happened. The margins
that we’re talking about are so large that it would be really hard to
fathom that. But that is the bet that some of his advisers are making.
Now are they making that on science? Not necessarily. Are they making
that on political research? Only on the margins. For the most part, this
is wishcasting that the president is not doing himself the damage he
seems to be doing.

michael barbaro

Maggie, campaigns tend to be defined by debates in their ranks about
what is the right approach to a moment. So I have to imagine that inside
the Trump campaign there is a debate about whether this is the right
approach to this moment. Is that your sense?

maggie haberman

No, Michael. I don’t think there’s much of a debate going on.

michael barbaro

Why not?

maggie haberman

Because there’s the way the president wants to campaign. And they try to
shape it around that. This is what Donald J. Trump thinks his campaign
message should be. Now, there are areas where his advisers have gotten
him to stick to that script that was written out and say things that
they consider to be less potentially divisive. So for instance, he spoke
broadly about culture and history. But he did not explicitly give a
defense of Confederate statues, which really turns off suburban voters,
in particular suburban women. And his advisers were very pleased with
that, that he stuck to the script and didn’t say Confederate.

But then on Monday morning, he tweets support of the Confederate flag
being aired at NASCAR events. So it undoes a lot of what had taken place
before.

michael barbaro

Maggie, when you talk to people in the Trump campaign and you present
them with what seems like a pretty significant dilemma here — a
president with a message and a national mood that seems very out of sync
with it — what do they say?

maggie haberman

There is no evidence that this message is going to help the president
win again. There is no evidence that this is a successful approach to
the voters he needs in order to win. But advisers are pretty candid that
he thinks this is how he won last time. And he is convinced he can do it
again.

michael barbaro

Right, so what you’re saying is the president is assuming that the
country is more or less exactly where it was in 2016, and that this will
all work out the same way and yield the same result — an electoral
college victory based on white voters supporting him?

maggie haberman

Correct. The president is of the opinion — and again, this is not his
campaign. There are people in the campaign who understand this is not
the same electorate. But the president has convinced himself that
nothing has changed, that he can turn Joe Biden into Hillary Clinton.
And so far there is no reason to believe that either of those things is
true.

michael barbaro

So Maggie, at this point, is this the message that you expect the Trump
campaign to be using between now and November? A message of the left
being the enemy and white America needing to be afraid of this movement
seeking racial equality.

maggie haberman

The campaign itself, I think, would like to be delivering a less blunt
instrument version of what the president is saying. But because the
president is able to speak only the way he’s comfortable, he will not
change. And so yes, I think this is what you will see for the next few
months.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Maggie.

maggie haberman

Thank you, Michael.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. A Times analysis found that
Black and Latino Americans have been three times as likely to become
infected with the coronavirus as white Americans, and have been nearly
twice as likely to die from it. The analysis was based on 640,000
infections across nearly 1,000 counties, making it the most far-reaching
study yet of the pandemic’s racial disparities. In explaining the higher
infection rate, experts said that Black and Latino people are more
likely to have frontline jobs, rely on public transportation or live in
multigenerational homes, raising the risk of exposure.

And the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states can require members
of the Electoral College to vote for the presidential candidate that
they had promised to support. 32 states and the District of Columbia
have laws requiring electors to abide by the pledges that they take on
Election Day. But a lower court in Colorado had ruled that they may
disregard those pledges when they actually cast ballots a few weeks
later. The Supreme Court’s decision curbs the independence of electors
and limits a potential source of uncertainty in the upcoming
presidential election.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

“Most presidents in history have understood that when they appear at a
national monument, it’s usually a moment to act as a unifying chief of
state, not a partisan divider,” Michael Beschloss, the presidential
historian, said before the speech.

Mr. Trump planned to follow up his trip with a “Salute to America”
celebration on Saturday on the South Lawn at the White House, marked by
a military flyover and the launch of 10,000 fireworks on the National
Mall.

Most politicians, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
the presumptive Democratic nominee, this year were forgoing any of the
traditional holiday parades and flag-waving appearances. The [vast
majority of fireworks
displays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/business/fourth-of-july-fireworks-displays.html)
in big cities and small rural towns have been canceled as new cases
reported in the United States have increased by 90 percent in the past
two weeks.

Mr. Trump’s itinerary Friday and Saturday, however, had a different
message: The sparkly, booming show must go on at all costs in the
service of the divisive message and powerful images he wants to promote.

“We will not be tyrannized, we will not be demeaned, and we will not be
intimidated by bad, evil people,” Mr. Trump said, referring to his
political opponents and their supporters.

In response to Mr. Trump’s event in South Dakota, Andrew Bates, a
spokesman for Mr. Biden’s campaign, said in a statement, “Our whole
country is suffering through the excruciating costs of having a
negligent, divisive president who doesn’t give a damn about anything but
his own gain — not the sick, not the jobless, not our constitution, and
not our troops in harm’s way.”

Under [the granite
gaze](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/mount-rushmore.html) of
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Trump
announced plans to establish what he described as a “vast outdoor park
that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live,”
an apparent repudiation of the growing pressure to remove statues tied
to slavery or colonialism.

As he arrived, Air Force One performed a flyover of Mount Rushmore. His
campaign promoted the stunt online, calling him [“the coolest president
ever.”](https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1279219853790978053)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

In the amphitheater below, few in the packed crowd practiced any social
distancing as people waved signs that referred to CNN as the “Communist
News Network.” As he observed a flyover by the Navy’s Blue Angels, Mr.
Trump sat on a packed dais with the first lady, Melania Trump, the
national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and Mark Meadows, the White
House chief of staff, none of whom wore masks.

As the president departed Washington for South Dakota on Friday, at
least five states — Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, North Carolina and South
Carolina — reported their highest single day of cases yet. Newly
reported cases of the virus were rising in all but a handful of states,
and many large cities, including Houston, Dallas, Jacksonville and Los
Angeles, were seeing alarming
growth.

Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has tried to bend events to his
will, often using social media to drive home his alternate version of
reality and, thanks to the power of repetition and the loyal support of
his base, sometimes succeeding. But the president’s attempt to drive
deeper into the culture wars around a national holiday, during an
intensifying health crisis that will not yield to his tactics, risked
coming across as out of sync with the concerned mood of the country at a
moment when [his re-election campaign is struggling and
unfocused](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/trump-2020-campaign-problems.html).

“I don’t think it will work, because what he is trying to do is pretend
that the situation is better than it is,” Mr. Beschloss said.

Mr. Beschloss compared Mr. Trump to Woodrow Wilson, who presided over
the influenza pandemic in 1918 by trying to pretend it was not
happening, and to Herbert Hoover, who in 1932 tried to project that the
Great Depression was not as bad as people were saying.

“People voted him out because they felt he did not understand the
suffering,” Mr. Beschloss said, referring to Hoover.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump [has consistently played
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
the concerns over spikes in new cases, even as many cities and states
have had to slow or reverse their reopenings, claiming that young people
[“get better much easier and
faster](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1278897430378041344),”
that the death rate is declining and that the virus will [“just
disappear.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-he-thinks-coronavirus-will-just-disappear-despite-rising-n1232709)

On Thursday, he lauded his administration’s response, referred to the
surge in new cases as “temporary hot spots” and focused instead on what
he said was evidence of the economy bouncing back.

“A lot of people would have wilted,” [Mr. Trump said at a news
conference](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-jobs-numbers-report-2/)
where he praised the latest job numbers. “We didn’t wilt. Our country
didn’t wilt.”

Despite his rosy outlook, the coronavirus on Friday for the first time
infiltrated Mr. Trump’s family circle. The president’s elder son, Donald
Trump Jr., and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, had traveled to South
Dakota separately with plans to meet up with the president. But they
left before Mr. Trump’s arrival once [Ms. Guilfoyle tested
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/kimberly-guilfoyle-trump-campaign-coronavirus.html)
for the virus and said they planned to cancel all coming events.

Mr. Trump’s show, however, went on without missing a beat. In South
Dakota, Mr. Trump enjoys the backing of Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican,
who had invited him to make the trip, which amounted to a second attempt
to get his campaign back on track after the [disappointing turnout at a
rally last month in Tulsa,
Okla.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html)

In recent weeks, South Dakota has had one of the country’s [most
encouraging trend
lines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/south-dakota-coronavirus-cases.html).
The state has averaged a few dozen new cases each day, including 85
announced Friday. There has not been a day with more than 100 new cases
in South Dakota since late May. Ms. Noem said Friday night that many
attendees at Mr. Trump’s Fourth of July spectacle had traveled from out
of state to attend.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Washington, however, officials remain adamantly opposed to the
celebration planned for Saturday, which White House officials defended
as a gathering people could enjoy safely. Administration officials noted
that the celebration in Washington was scaled back from last year’s
event, [when Mr. Trump turned the holiday into a salute to the
military](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/trump-tanks.html),
with tanks on the streets of the capital and flyovers from Air Force One
as well as aircraft from each branch of the armed forces, as he
delivered remarks from the Lincoln Memorial.

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said this week that
Mr. Trump had recommended following guidelines set by local authorities
only on wearing masks — not on social distancing overall. “The C.D.C.
guidelines, I’d also note, say ‘recommended,’ but not required,” she
said. “We are very much looking forward to the Fourth of July
celebration.”

This year, the National Park Service said it was taking extra safety
precautions on the National Mall, installing more than 100 hand-washing
stations throughout the area, up from 15 last year. Officials also said
they had 300,000 cloth facial coverings on hand to distribute.

“We are committed to providing the American people with a safe and
spectacular celebration of our nation’s birthday in Washington D.C.,
which will honor our military with music, flyovers and fireworks,” a
spokesman for the park service said. “We are doing so consistent with
our mission and historical practices, and we hope everyone enjoys the
day’s festivities.”

On Friday, Mr. Trump spent the day at his golf course in Sterling, Va.,
before he departed for South Dakota, and White House officials said they
had no safety concerns about the trip.

But the virus had already shown it can infiltrate the administration,
and the White House has experienced the dangers of staging large
gatherings as the pandemic rages. Vice President Mike Pence [postponed a
planned
trip](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/pence-covid.html)
this week to Arizona after Secret Service agents set to accompany him
tested positive for the coronavirus or showed symptoms. And at least
eight campaign staff members who helped plan Mr. Trump’s indoor rally
last month in Tulsa, [have tested
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-campaign-coronavirus-tulsa.html),
either before the rally or after attending.

Before the president left for South Dakota on Friday, Trump campaign
aides were circulating on social media [a doctored
image](https://twitter.com/abigailmarone/status/1279044148184694787) of
Mount Rushmore, featuring Mr. Trump’s face carved into the stone next to
some of the nation’s most revered presidents.
