*\[****Update****:* [*Trump abruptly cancels Republican Convention in
Jacksonville*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html)*.\]*

WASHINGTON — The abrupt uprooting of the [Republican National
Convention](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/republican-convention-jacksonville-virus-outdoors.html)
from Charlotte to Jacksonville has created a tangled financial
predicament for party officials as they effectively try to pay for two
big events instead of one.

Tens of millions of dollars have already been spent in a city that will
now host little more than a G.O.P. business meeting, and donors are wary
of opening their wallets again to bankroll a Jacksonville gathering
thrown into uncertainty by a surge in coronavirus cases.

Organizers are trying to assuage vexed Republicans who collectively gave
millions of dollars for a Charlotte event that has mostly been scrapped.
The host committee there has spent virtually all of the $38 million it
raised before the convention was moved, leaving almost nothing to return
to donors, or to pass on to the new host city.

In Jacksonville, fund-raisers are describing the process as the most
difficult they have ever confronted: Florida has been setting daily
records for new virus cases, freezing money as donors wait and worry
about the safety risks of the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I don’t want to encourage people getting sick,” said Stanley S.
Hubbard, a Minnesota billionaire who has donated more than $2 million to
help Republicans, including President Trump, since the beginning of the
2016 election.

Mr. Hubbard, who donated $25,000 to the R.N.C.’s convention account in
2018, is hesitant to give to the Jacksonville host committee because he
thinks it is ill advised to hold the convention in the midst of a
pandemic. “Unless this thing goes away, I think it’s a bad choice,” he
said.

The threat of the virus and the complicated financial entanglements are
just the latest problems to beset an event that Mr. Trump upended last
month, after [concluding that Charlotte could not
guarantee](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/republican-national-convention-jacksonville-florida.html)the
celebratory coronation he covets. The sudden acrimonious split with
Charlotte — and the scramble in Jacksonville to organize in weeks an
event that typically takes years — has produced mounting confusion about
what the convention will look like and who will pay to help stage it.

Organizers are not holding their breath for generous contributions from
big donors, like Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino owner, who has
given to host committees in the past but has not indicated he plans to
support the Jacksonville event. Instead, they are working down long
lists of donors who might be willing to give smaller amounts.

But the virus has proved a debilitating impediment for Jacksonville.
Florida had recorded almost 180,000 total coronavirus cases through
Friday, but[the surge in the last month has been
dramatic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html).
After reporting 667 new cases on June 1, the state has had more than
5,000 every day since June 24, including more than 10,000 on Thursday.
Hospitals across the state have started to sound the alarm about
becoming overburdened.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump shunned Charlotte because North Carolina’s Democratic
governor, Roy Cooper, would not promise to forgo safety measures like
distancing and mask-wearing. In Florida, lawmakers had seemed intent on
offering him as unfettered a convention as possible, though in recent
days the city of Jacksonville [began
requiring](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html)
masks in indoor public settings, a stipulation that will presumably
apply at the
convention.

Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor who has helped raise money for Mr.
Trump in the past, said the Jacksonville convention was “a tough sell,”
noting that “many donors’ businesses are severely impacted by the virus
and large corporations have pulled in their horns on spending.”

Mr. Eberhart is planning to attend the convention, and said he had been
approached by the Jacksonville host committee about donating, but hasn’t
decided whether to do so. “There are so many variables right now,” he
said.

By the time [Mr. Trump decided to move the
convention](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/politics/republican-convention-charlotte-2020.html),
almost all of the money raised by the Charlotte host committee had been
spent on things like salaries, insurance, prepayments on contracts, and
other expenses.

“It’s certainly a challenge,” said Edward E. Burr, a real estate
developer and member of the Jacksonville host committee.

Mr. Burr said it was still far from clear exactly what the final run of
show will look like, or how many people will attend Mr. Trump’s
renominating speech, which is scheduled for Aug. 27. Even some members
of the host committee in Jacksonville are privately wondering if the
city and the R.N.C. have a Plan B — actually, a Plan C — as they watch
the number of coronavirus cases in their state rise.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This path is a twisty path,” Mr. Burr said. “A lot of things continue
to change.”

“I’ve got plenty of friends who said this is a bad thing to do,” he
added, “but we are doing it.”

Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, which
supervises the convention, said in a statement that her team “will be
providing a safe, first-rate experience for convention goers, and we
have a highly-skilled team working around the clock to make that
happen.”

And Republican officials compared the mad cash dash to a special
election, when a condensed time frame creates anxiety, but ultimately
the money comes through.

Brian Ballard, the top Republican lobbyist in Florida and one of the
party’s major fund-raisers, has been leading the fund-raising operation,
along with Katie Walsh, an adviser to the R.N.C. who also helped oversee
fund-raising for Charlotte, and Jeff Miller, a leading fund-raiser for
Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.

Big corporate donors who typically make $1 million contributions do so
because they want to capitalize on social and branding opportunities at
an event that draws lawmakers, lobbyists and business leaders. But right
now, it’s not clear to them what the Jacksonville proceedings will look
like.

As they start from scratch, fund-raisers are also being delicate about
asking Charlotte donors to give again for the Jacksonville run. In an
effort to smooth over raw feelings, donors who have already contributed
will be able to use any of the perks that came with their donations —
like V.I.P. access and reserved hotel rooms — in Jacksonville.

“There’s deep frustration,” said Tariq Bokhari, a Republican City
Council member in Charlotte, describing exasperation among prominent
local donors. “There are people who’ve put hundreds of thousands if not
millions into this. They care that their investment comes to fruition,
that our city hosts a major convention and our businesses and
hospitality workers get the benefits.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Organizers in Jacksonville are expecting — hoping — that 15,000 people
attend, enough to fill the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, which cost
about $150,000 for the week (a fraction of the cost of the arena in
Charlotte). Still, many delegates remain noncommittal about attending,
potentially diminishing the economic boost Jacksonville was counting on.

Perhaps taking that into account — and working on a far tighter
timetable — Jacksonville organizers have expressed more modest
fund-raising goals, aspiring to raise a fraction of the $70 million
Charlotte officials aimed for.

The Democratic National Convention, scheduled for mid-August in
Milwaukee, has already scaled back its ambitions: Organizers have
[relocated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee-coronavirus.html)
the event to a smaller venue, and state delegations have been urged not
to travel in light of the virus.

In 2016, organizers of the Republican convention in Cleveland spent more
than $1 million on national fund-raising consultants as they sought to
hit their donation goals; they wound up raising about $60 million.

“It was all based on the contract signed two years out that we had spent
months negotiating, and months before that understanding what the
obligation would be for Cleveland,” said David Gilbert, who organized
the 2016 Republican
gathering.

Some Republican donors said that, like Mr. Trump, they blamed Mr.
Cooper, North Carolina’s governor, for foiling the plans for Charlotte.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“You see the convention go to another state and you know they’re going
to reap the benefits, and we desperately needed that,” said Elaine
Wordsworth, whose husband, Steve Wordsworth, is a North Carolina
businessman who has donated generously to Mr. Trump’s re-election fund.

Indeed, when Jacksonville was selected as the host city for the
convention in June, the news was seen by leaders there as a huge
financial shot in the arm for a second-tier city that would never have
been considered for such a role under normal circumstances. The average
economic impact of hosting a convention for the local economy is about
$200 million, and officials in Jacksonville initially estimated that
even a hurried version of the Republican event would bring in at least
half of that.

But now, many of the people involved in the process in Jacksonville are
beginning to feel like the dog that caught the car. About 58 percent of
registered voters in Duval County, which encompasses Jacksonville, say
they are opposed to the city hosting the mass gathering, [according to a
new poll from the University of North
Florida](https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/JaxSpeaks0620.pdf),
which also showed that 71 percent of voters said they were at least
somewhat concerned about transmission of coronavirus.

For Republican officials, untangling the financial knot from the
Charlotte convention remains a work in progress. Given the contracts
that had been signed and the many parties around the table — including
the local host committee, the R.N.C. and the city itself, among others —
concerns about potential legal action have figured into managing the
fallout, several people connected to the process said.

Patrick Baker, Charlotte’s city attorney, said in an interview that the
city itself had spent roughly $14 million preparing for the convention.
Much of that went toward insurance and security costs, he said, and the
city expected to be reimbursed in full through a federal grant from the
Justice Department.

“The focus of the City Council has been to make sure, at a minimum, that
we’re made whole and not left holding the bag,” Mr. Baker said.

The Charlotte program has been scaled back to the bare minimum. Only the
168 national committeemen are expected to visit Charlotte. While there,
they will attend meetings at one hotel and then take a bus together to
the airport, where they will board a chartered plane and fly to
Jacksonville for the remainder of the convention, according to someone
briefed on the plans.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s not clear that Charlotte has gotten the message that the party has
fully moved to Jacksonville. The web address
[2020venues.com](http://2020venues.com/) still reflects a full Charlotte
program, referring visitors to an array of destinations and assisting
them with details for booking.

“The economic benefit that comes with all the visitor spending,
obviously we’re not going to get that, but with the virus we weren’t
going to get it anyway,” Mr. Baker said. “I’m glad it’s not my job to
put on a
convention.”
