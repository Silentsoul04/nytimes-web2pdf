# Caribbean, Struggling in the Pandemic, Braces for Hurricane Season

</div>

Scientists predict this hurricane season will be severe. But countries
in the region, with economies burdened by the pandemic and the
devastation of past hurricanes, have not been able to fully prepare.

MEXICO CITY — Houses with no roofs. Neighborhoods lacking electricity.
Residents who fled still in exile.

Ten months after Hurricane Dorian [pulverized the northern
Bahamas](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/world/americas/hurricane-dorian-bahamas.html),
those islands are still struggling to recover, even as this year’s
[hurricane
season](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/hurricane-douglas-hawaii.html)
begins. But rebuilding, [always a slow
process](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/world/americas/hurricane-irma-saint-martin.html),
has been slowed even further this year by a disaster of another sort:
the coronavirus pandemic.

“That brought rebuilding efforts to a complete halt,” said Stafford
Symonette, an evangelical pastor whose house on Great Abaco Island was
[severely
damaged](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/world/americas/bahamas-abaco-hurricane-damage.html)
during the hurricane — and remains that way.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“You still have a lot of people in tents and temporary shelters,” he
said.

The Bahamas — like other hurricane-prone countries in the Caribbean and
North Atlantic — find themselves at the dramatic convergence of a
devastating pandemic and an Atlantic
[hurricane](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/25/us/hurricane-hanna-tracker-map.html)
season that is expected to be more active than normal.

The pandemic has profoundly affected all aspects of hurricane
preparedness and response, and left nations even more vulnerable to the
impacts of storms.

It has complicated rebuilding efforts from past hurricane seasons. It
has crippled national economies in the region, [many of which depend
heavily on
tourism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/americas/virus-tourism-caribbean.html).
It has forced the reallocation of diminished government resources —
money and personnel that otherwise might have been used for
hurricane-related work — to deal with the public health crisis.

And it has meant that, in the event of a major storm, evacuation centers
and shelters could now turn into dangerous vectors of coronavirus
contagion, driving governments and relief agencies to figure out new
protocols to keep evacuees safe.

These mounting challenges have overwhelmed many of the region’s
governments and relief agencies, which are scrambling to prepare for the
next big storm.

“Are we prepared for this hurricane season?” said Ronald Sanders,
ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States and to the
Organization of American States. “The answer is: no. And I don’t care
who tells you we are. We haven’t been able to dedicate any funds toward
hurricane preparedness this
year.”

Weather scientists from the American government [have
predicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/climate/hurricane-season-2020-noaa.html?searchResultPosition=2)
that during this Atlantic storm season, which began on June 1 and runs
through Nov. 30, there will be as many as 19 named storms, with as many
as six growing to major hurricane status. An average hurricane season
has 12 named storms and three major hurricanes.

The season has gotten off to a quick start, with four named storms so
far.

The region started the season at a severe economic disadvantage. The
pandemic crushed the tourism industry, a main economic engine for much
of the Caribbean. Hotels were shuttered, cruise ships remained docked,
airplanes were grounded. The Caribbean Development Bank estimated that
regional economic activity may contract by as much as 20 percent this
year.

Mr. Sanders said he worried about what would happen should the region
suffer a repeat of 2017, when [several major
hurricanes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/world/americas/caribbean-islands-hurricane-irma-st-martin-barbuda-anguilla.html)
[plowed through the
Caribbean](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/world/americas/hurricane-maria-caribbean.html).

“If that were to happen again this year,” he said, “well, I think these
economies will go into complete
collapse.”

The pandemic has also presented a range of public health challenges for
governments and relief groups preparing for hurricanes, including the
need to ensure adequate social distancing during evacuations and in
shelters, and a sufficient supply of personal protective gear for
emergency workers and evacuees.

Health officials are also trying to stockpile medicine and other
supplies and prepare for possible coronavirus outbreaks among evacuees.

“Without a doubt, once we have a natural hazard such as a hurricane,
there will be a greater rate of infection, particularly with respect to
Covid-19, among other diseases that could arise,” Dr. Laura-Lee Boodram,
an official with the Caribbean Public Health Agency, warned during a
recent panel discussion organized by the Caribbean Tourism Organization.

The Bahamas has been at a particular disadvantage in its efforts to get
out ahead of this year’s hurricane threat.

The coronavirus pandemic swept into the region only a few months after
Dorian, [one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on
record](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/world/americas/hurricane-dorian-bahamas.html),
made landfall on Sept. 1, 2019, [killing scores of
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/world/americas/bahamas-dead-dorian.html)
in the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island, destroying thousands of
structures and [causing billions of dollars in
damage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/world/americas/bahamas-hurricane-dorian-relief.html).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and

        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Recovery efforts were fully underway by the time the country recorded
its first coronavirus case on March 16. But less than two weeks later,
with the number of infections mounting, the government had closed the
nation’s borders and had begun imposing a series of restrictions on
movement, including curfews, 24-hour lockdowns and a ban on travel
between the archipelago’s
islands.

While the measures helped curb the spread of the virus — the Bahamas has
only 104 confirmed cases so far — they slowed recovery, delayed
preparations for the new hurricane season and, combined with the global
halt of the tourism industry, further plunged the country into economic
distress.

The Bahamian government said it expects to incur a $1.3 billion deficit
this fiscal year, equivalent to about 11.6 percent of gross domestic
product and the largest in the history of the Bahamas.

“Any significant storm damage this year would put us in a very serious
spot in terms of our fiscal projections,” Peter Turnquest, the Bahamas’
deputy prime minister and finance minister, said in an interview this
week.

Among emergency officials’ greatest concerns as the hurricane season
unfolds is the insufficient number of storm shelters in parts of the
Bahamas. Many that were damaged during Dorian have yet to be repaired.

The International Organization for Migration said in a report in May
that only 13 of the 25 official shelters on the Abaco Islands and Grand
Bahama were “usable” and had only enough capacity for about 2 percent of
the population.

“We certainly pray that there are no storms this year,” Mr. Turnquest
said.

Adding to the uncertainty, the government is now poised to reopen the
country’s borders to international visitors. The decision has sowed
anxiety among many Bahamians who fear that it might spur a second wave
of infections across the islands, triggering more lockdowns and border
closures, and further complicating hurricane preparedness and response.

“People are nervous,” said Steve Pedican, whose house on Great Abaco
Island was severely damaged in the hurricane. “People don’t know what to
expect now.”

When asked what might happen should a major hurricane make landfall on
Great Abaco in the coming months, Mr. Symonette, the evangelical pastor,
went silent for a while, mulling the implications.

“I don’t know how we would cope with it if we get another one this
year,” he finally said. “Praise God, that he be merciful to us.”
