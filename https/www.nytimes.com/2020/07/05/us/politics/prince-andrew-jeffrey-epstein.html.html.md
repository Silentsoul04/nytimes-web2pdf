</div>

Lawyers for the prince consulted a lobbyist with connections in Trump
foreign policy circles. No deal was struck.

WASHINGTON — Prince Andrew’s lawyers had discussions with a Washington
lobbyist with ties to the Trump administration about the possibility of
assisting the prince with fallout from his relationship with the
disgraced financier [Jeffrey
Epstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-address-homes.html).

Lawyers from the London-based firm Blackfords consulted the lobbyist,
Robert Stryk, who represents international figures with sensitive legal
or diplomatic issues, in recent weeks about Prince Andrew’s situation,
according to a person familiar with the circumstances.

Mr. Stryk has a history of taking on clients with unsavory reputations.
But he expressed discomfort about the possibility of assisting Prince
Andrew, and talks about the potential representation appear to have
fizzled, according to the person familiar with the situation.

It is not clear precisely what type of assistance Blackfords might have
been seeking from Mr. Stryk, who is not a lawyer, or what he could do to
help Prince Andrew. Nor is it clear whether Blackfords has reached out
to other Washington lobbyists or consultants about the possibility of
working on the issue.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Neither Mr. Stryk nor any other American consultant is listed as having
registered with the Justice Department to represent Prince Andrew, which
could be required under the [Foreign Agents Registration
Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/fara-task-force-justice-department.html)
if a consulting arrangement had been reached involving lobbying or
public relations.

Blackfords has been representing Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, in a
[contentious
back-and-forth](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew.html)
with federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating allegations
of sex trafficking and other crimes by Mr. Epstein and his associates.

Prince Andrew, 60, has not been charged in the case.

But in August, [Virginia Roberts Giuffre accused the
prince](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/world/europe/prince-andrews-Virginia-Roberts-Giuffre-bbc.html)
of having sex with her three times when she was 17 years old after she
was connected to him by Mr. Epstein.

The prince denied her claim in [an interview with the
BBC](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/world/europe/prince-andrew-epstein.html)
in August and sought to minimize his long friendship with Mr. Epstein,
who [killed
himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-suicide.html)
last summer at a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex
trafficking and conspiracy charges. He had met Mr. Epstein through
Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and Mr. Epstein’s onetime
girlfriend, who was [arrested on
Thursday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-arrest-jeffrey-epstein.html)
and charged with luring multiple underage girls into Mr. Epstein’s
orbit.

Prince Andrew had indicated a willingness to help American law
enforcement officials with their investigations late last year. But
since then, prosecutors in New York have publicly criticized him on
multiple occasions for offering “[zero
cooperation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew.html)”
and for
[stonewalling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The prince’s lawyers at Blackfords shot back in a statement issued early
last month. They accused Geoffrey S. Berman, who had served as the
United States attorney in Manhattan until [being fired late last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html),
of making “inaccurate” statements about Prince Andrew, suggesting that
the prosecutor and his colleagues were “perhaps seeking publicity rather
than accepting the assistance proffered.”

Blackfords did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Stryk declined
to comment.

Mr. Stryk, who is [well connected in Trump administration foreign policy
circles](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/magazine/how-to-get-rich-in-trumps-washington.html),
owns a company called Sonoran Policy Group, which casts itself as
“global private diplomacy” firm. He has developed a reputation in
recent years for taking on clients other Washington lobbyists and
consultants shy away from.

This year alone, his firm has signed contracts to [represent a jailed
Saudi
prince](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/jailed-saudis-crown-prince-mbs.html)
who had fallen out of favor with his country’s powerful de facto leader,
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as the administration of
President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, which the Trump administration
considers illegitimate.

Mr. Stryk represents Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola’s former
president who is accused of [embezzling millions of
dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/africa/angola-santos-embezzlement.html)
from a state oil company she once headed. And he had represented the
government of the former Congolese president Joseph Kabila, which had
faced American
[sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/world/africa/congo-officials-sanctioned.html)
for [human rights
abuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/world/africa/congo-protest-joseph-kabila.html)
and corruption.
