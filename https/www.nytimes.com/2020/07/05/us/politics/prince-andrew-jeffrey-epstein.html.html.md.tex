WASHINGTON --- Prince Andrew's lawyers had discussions with a Washington
lobbyist with ties to the Trump administration about the possibility of
assisting the prince with fallout from his relationship with the
disgraced financier
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-address-homes.html}{Jeffrey
Epstein}.

Lawyers from the London-based firm Blackfords consulted the lobbyist,
Robert Stryk, who represents international figures with sensitive legal
or diplomatic issues, in recent weeks about Prince Andrew's situation,
according to a person familiar with the circumstances.

Mr. Stryk has a history of taking on clients with unsavory reputations.
But he expressed discomfort about the possibility of assisting Prince
Andrew, and talks about the potential representation appear to have
fizzled, according to the person familiar with the situation.

It is not clear precisely what type of assistance Blackfords might have
been seeking from Mr. Stryk, who is not a lawyer, or what he could do to
help Prince Andrew. Nor is it clear whether Blackfords has reached out
to other Washington lobbyists or consultants about the possibility of
working on the issue.

Neither Mr. Stryk nor any other American consultant is listed as having
registered with the Justice Department to represent Prince Andrew, which
could be required under the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/fara-task-force-justice-department.html}{Foreign
Agents Registration Act} if a consulting arrangement had been reached
involving lobbying or public relations.

Blackfords has been representing Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, in a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew.html}{contentious
back-and-forth} with federal prosecutors in New York who are
investigating allegations of sex trafficking and other crimes by Mr.
Epstein and his associates.

Prince Andrew, 60, has not been charged in the case.

But in August,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/world/europe/prince-andrews-Virginia-Roberts-Giuffre-bbc.html}{Virginia
Roberts Giuffre accused the prince} of having sex with her three times
when she was 17 years old after she was connected to him by Mr. Epstein.

The prince denied her claim in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/world/europe/prince-andrew-epstein.html}{an
interview with the BBC} in August and sought to minimize his long
friendship with Mr. Epstein, who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-suicide.html}{killed
himself} last summer at a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial
on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He had met Mr. Epstein
through Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and Mr. Epstein's onetime
girlfriend, who was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-arrest-jeffrey-epstein.html}{arrested
on Thursday} and charged with luring multiple underage girls into Mr.
Epstein's orbit.

Prince Andrew had indicated a willingness to help American law
enforcement officials with their investigations late last year. But
since then, prosecutors in New York have publicly criticized him on
multiple occasions for offering
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew.html}{zero
cooperation}'' and for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew.html}{stonewalling}.

The prince's lawyers at Blackfords shot back in a statement issued early
last month. They accused Geoffrey S. Berman, who had served as the
United States attorney in Manhattan until
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html}{being
fired late last month}, of making ``inaccurate'' statements about Prince
Andrew, suggesting that the prosecutor and his colleagues were ``perhaps
seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.''

Blackfords did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Stryk declined
to comment.

Mr. Stryk, who is
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/magazine/how-to-get-rich-in-trumps-washington.html}{well
connected in Trump administration foreign policy circles}, owns a
company called Sonoran Policy Group, which casts itself as ``global
private diplomacy'' firm. He has developed a reputation in recent years
for taking on clients other Washington lobbyists and consultants shy
away from.

This year alone, his firm has signed contracts to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/jailed-saudis-crown-prince-mbs.html}{represent
a jailed Saudi prince} who had fallen out of favor with his country's
powerful de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as
the administration of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, which the
Trump administration considers illegitimate.

Mr. Stryk represents Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's former
president who is accused of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/africa/angola-santos-embezzlement.html}{embezzling
millions of dollars} from a state oil company she once headed. And he
had represented the government of the former Congolese president Joseph
Kabila, which had faced American
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/world/africa/congo-officials-sanctioned.html}{sanctions}
for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/world/africa/congo-protest-joseph-kabila.html}{human
rights abuses} and corruption.
