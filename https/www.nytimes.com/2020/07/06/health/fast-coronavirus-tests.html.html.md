# A New Generation of Fast Coronavirus Tests Is Coming

New technologies, like the gene-editing tool Crispr, can spot the virus
in less than an hour. But it will likely be months before these tests
hit clinics.

Researchers around the world are working on the next generation of
[coronavirus
tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html)
that give answers in less than an hour, without onerous equipment or
highly trained personnel.

The latest so-called point-of-care tests, which could be done in a
doctor’s office or even at home, would be a welcome upgrade from today’s
status quo: uncomfortable swabs that snake up the nose and can take
several days to produce results.

The handful of point-of-care devices now on the market are [frequently
inaccurate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-testing-white-house.html).
The up-and-coming
[tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html)
could yield more reliable results, researchers say, potentially leading
to on-the-spot testing nationwide. But most of the new contenders are
still in early stages, and won’t be available in clinics for months.

Some of the tests in development swap brain-tickling swabs for plastic
tubes that collect spit. Others dunk patient samples into chemical
cocktails that light up when they detect coronavirus genes. Another type
of test identifies
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html)
proteins in minutes, using a cheap device that’s easy to produce in bulk
and deploy in low-resource settings.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“To combat this virus, we need to test widely and frequently, and get
the results back quickly,” said Dr. Zev Williams at Columbia University,
who is developing a [coronavirus spit
test](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20129841v1.full.pdf)
that can run in about 30 minutes. “That requires a genuine paradigm
shift in the way we go about testing for it.”

Once scaled up and distributed, faster tests could be used in hospitals
to quickly screen emergency room patients. Schools and workplaces could
buy them to monitor the health of children and employees. With
additional tinkering, some tests could even be developed to work as
simply as a pregnancy test, yielding a clean-cut positive or negative
result in the comfort of a person’s home.

“The quicker and easier tests can be done,” the more ubiquitous they can
be, said Dr. Amesh Adalja at the Johns Hopkins University Center for
Health Security. “That’s going to help people get back to some semblance
of normalcy.”

Most diagnostic tests on the market now hunt for bits of genetic
material specific to the coronavirus. (This distinguishes diagnostic
tests from antibody tests, which sample the blood and show if a person
has been exposed to the virus in the past.)

The gold-standard method involves funneling a long, absorbent swab a few
inches into the nose until it hits the nasopharynx, the part of the
airway where the nasal passage meets the throat and a common target of
the
coronavirus.

“The moment you see the swab, you’re like, ‘Oh no, my face isn’t that
deep,’” said Fernanda Ferreira, a virologist at Harvard University who
took a nasopharyngeal swab test in April. “Turns out it is.”

The virus’s genes must be extracted from the sample with a specific
suite of chemicals. The material is then processed through a laboratory
technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, in which a machine
cycles through several temperature changes to amplify genetic material.
This step is key to these tests’ success: Copying genetic material over
and over means that even tiny amounts of the virus can be spotted.

But the process can bog down at multiple points. Swabs and chemicals
necessary for processing are [often in short
supply](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-test-shortages-face-masks-swabs.html),
and invasive sampling requires trained health care workers who quickly
drain precious supplies of gowns, gloves and masks. Additionally, many
community testing centers lack PCR machines and must outsource their
samples to large laboratories, leading to delays of days or even weeks.

Rachel Coker, the director of research advancement at Binghamton
University — one of many institutions nationwide that have begun to
reopen — had to wait 10 days for her results after being sampled at a
drive-through testing site.

Researchers are attempting to streamline every part of the diagnostic
pipeline. One timesaving tactic that’s already been rolled out
nationwide involves sampling areas other than the nasopharynx, such as
swabbing the nostrils or throat, or collecting gobs of saliva.

These tests are painless, and avoid putting health care workers in
harm’s way. But they [aren’t always
accurate](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/comparative-accuracy-of-oropharyngeal-and-nasopharyngeal-swabs-for-diagnosis-of-covid-19/).
“Unfortunately, this virus doesn’t hang around in the nose or throat so
much,” said Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the
University of Cambridge.

To avoid mistakenly declaring infected people virus-free, Dr. Gupta and
his colleagues are developing a point-of-care test that can
[simultaneously screen patients for the coronavirus and antibodies that
recognize
it](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133157v3.full.pdf).
Antibodies often start to appear by the second week of infection.

At the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Ma., another team of researchers is
tackling the next plodding step in the work flow: amplifying the sample.
In the lab, the scientists use a technique that, unlike PCR, can copy
genetic material at a single temperature. If the virus is present, [a
gene-editing tool called
Crispr](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.119131v1.full.pdf)
will make the tube’s contents glow at a wavelength detectable by a
smartphone. The entire procedure takes less than an hour, and [correctly
identifies active infections about 90 percent of the
time](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.119131v1.full.pdf).

Laboratory experiments that use Crispr are [thought to be very
precise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915479/),
potentially giving these tests a low rate of false positives, said
Catherine Freije, one of the scientists developing the Crispr test. The
molecular machinery in the test is specific to the new coronavirus, and
doesn’t react to its close viral relatives.

The test cooked up by Columbia University’s Dr. Williams and his
colleagues might be simpler still: Spit is added to a premixed slew of
chemicals, which then gets incubated at 145 degrees Fahrenheit for half
an hour. If the tube turns yellow, the test is positive; if it’s red,
negative. The test can detect even tiny amounts of virus, making it more
sensitive than similar tests, and [gives false negatives less than 5
percent of the
time](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20129841v1.full.pdf),
according to a study that has not yet been published in a scientific
journal. Dr. Williams and his team are seeking authorization from the
F.D.A.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In May, a swab-based point-of-care test called Abbott ID Now [made
headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/12/us/coronavirus-testing-white-house.html)
when an analysis found that it might miss infections up to 48 percent of
the time, despite being promoted by President Trump as “highly
accurate.”

Sensitivity issues also plague antigen tests, which detect pieces of
proteins made by the virus, rather than its genes. Antigen tests have
been used to detect other airway infections, such as the flu, in less
than an hour, and are easy to manufacture en masse. But the convenience
comes at a cost: Unlike genetic material, antigens can’t be amplified
easily. Some antigen tests, including a few that search for [influenza
viruses](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm),
fail to pick up on active infections [around 50 percent of the
time](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm).

“If a Covid antigen test performs like an influenza antigen test, I
don’t think they will have much utility,” said Dr. David Alland, the
director of the Center for Emerging Pathogens at Rutgers New Jersey
Medical School. Still, he noted, “if improved, they could be very
promising.”

Even imprecise tests have their place in this pandemic, as long as
they’re easy to use and distributed widely enough. Should a test “miss
someone on Monday, maybe you’ll get them a day or two later,” Dr. Wyllie
said.

So far, only two companies have received emergency
[authorization](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-antigen-test-help-rapid-detection-virus-causes)
from the F.D.A. for coronavirus antigen tests. One is
[Quidel](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html),
which is, according to a representative, producing millions of tests
each month, many of which have been distributed to urgent care centers
and medical clinics in the United States. On Monday, a second firm,
Becton Dickinson & Company, also entered the fray with a point-of-care
antigen test that can reportedly [produce results in 15
minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/06/us/06reuters-health-coronavirus-becton-dickinson.html).
While speedy, both Quidel’s and BD’s tests may produce false negatives
[between 15](https://investors.bd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bd-launches-portable-rapid-point-care-antigen-test-detect-sars)
[and 20
percent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong)
of the time.

Other antigen tests have made headway overseas, and experts estimated
that several more will likely seek clearance in the United States in
coming months.

One will likely come from medical device manufacturer OraSure, which has
made antigen tests for H.I.V. and Ebola. Stephen Tang, OraSure’s
president and chief executive officer, said his team is brewing up a
“secret sauce” that will make their coronavirus test highly accurate,
while still producing results within half an hour, but declined to
specify details.

Until these experimental tests are widely available, many people will
still need the nasty nasal swab.

“For any kind of normal life to resume, I think all of us need to get
this idea that we’re going to have to get tested all the time,”
Binghamton’s Ms. Coker said.

A faster, less invasive test would be nice. But even an unpleasant test
is better than no test at all, she said. “If it’s this painful one, so
be it.”
