## Four New Insights About the Coronavirus

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by by Alexandra Leigh Young and Austin Mitchell, and edited by Larissa Anderson

#### A look at what scientists have learned about how the virus takes hold in the body and where the risk of infection is highest.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: As infection rates break new records across the U.S. this
    July 4 weekend, four new insights into the virus from my colleague,
    science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. It’s Monday, July 6.
    
    Let me start by, Donald, saying happy 4th of July.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you.

  - michael barbaro  
    How did you spend it?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Saturday, I played softball in the morning — socially distant
    softball.

  - michael barbaro  
    Softball?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah.

  - michael barbaro  
    In New York City?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    In New York City. Yeah, Riverside Park. And then we went to dinner
    last night in a friend’s backyard on Long Island, where we all sat
    as couples together, but six feet apart from each other, and sort of
    took turns going up to the table to get to the food, and sat, and
    had a really nice time.

  - michael barbaro  
    I have to imagine that even a socially distanced meal with you is
    challenging, in that I think I would feel quite seen and judged,
    given your role.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Why?

  - \[laughter\]

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I mean, I do tend to say six feet, six feet, six feet, a lot at
    people.

  - michael barbaro  
    See?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Because masks give people a false sense of security. I mean, this is
    a big thing on the softball field, is that people would both put on
    masks and they’d sit next to each other in the dugout, making up the
    batting order and stuff like that. And I’d go, no\! Air leaks out of
    the side of your masks. And you’re not always wearing masks.
    Sometimes you’re wearing it as a sort of a Captain Ahab blue beard
    under your chin. So it’s better to stay six feet apart. That way if
    your mask —

  - michael barbaro  
    Do your remember a couple seconds ago how you asked me why it might
    be challenging to have a —

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - michael barbaro  
    — a meal with you?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    All right. \[LAUGHTER\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Ask and —

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    All right, touche, touche.

  - michael barbaro  
    So everything you just described, of course, is occurring in New
    York, where the infection rate has been generally declining or at
    least stabilizing. So let’s talk about the state of the pandemic in
    the rest of the country. I wonder if you can give us a quick status
    update on this end of July 4 weekend.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK. I think it’s 39 states now have cases going up. And it’s hitting
    hardest in the South and in the West. Texas, Florida, Arizona,
    California, a number of other states. And it’s exactly what was
    predicted back in May when states were debating opening by Memorial
    Day. All public health experts said, if you open up when your case
    counts are rising, they’re going to continue rising and start rising
    even faster. And now we’re seeing that.
    
    For example, in Houston, doctors who knew the situation in New York
    are saying that what’s happening there looks like what happened in
    New York in early April. Finding new beds, finding ventilators, lots
    of patients who were sick, patients who were on oxygen. Not as many
    dying yet, but with people on oxygen and on ventilators they may
    find themselves in the situation where they have to park
    refrigerated trucks behind hospitals to hold the bodies, as they did
    in New York.

  - michael barbaro  
    So Donald, correct me if I’m wrong. I think the U.S. is at about
    50,000 infections a day right now. Dr. Anthony Fauci said we could
    get up to 100,000. And if that’s the case, what do we expect the
    attendant death count to start to look like in the U.S.? I assume
    that’s going to catch up with that.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, it’ll catch up with it. I mean, but there’s no reason to
    believe that 100,000 is the upper limit. It all depends on how much
    social distancing we practice. I mean, this is the dance. And do you
    close bars and restaurants? Do you open or close schools? Do you
    wear masks? How much attention do people pay to the directions you
    give them? How much do they practice good social distancing. That
    very much affects the rate of spread of the virus.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, with that in mind, those big questions of kind of how we
    proceed through the rest of this pandemic, you have been doing a lot
    of reporting about the latest learnings and insights into the virus
    that will very much guide how we answer those questions. And we want
    to talk through those with you. So where do you think we should
    start?

  - \[music\]

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Some of these insights are really more theories with some evidence
    to them. And some there’s quite a bit of confidence in. So we
    probably ought to start with something that there’s a pretty high
    degree of confidence in among doctors.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what is that?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    When this all started, we thought of it as a lung disease, a
    respiratory disease, because the first cases we heard about, people
    got pneumonia. And that of course reminded us that the model for
    this disease was the 1918 influenza epidemic. But we’re learning
    that this coronavirus is very different from an influenza virus.
    
    The influenza viruses attach to receptors in the lungs and the
    airway. This gets into the body through the airway, through the
    lungs. But it really attaches to the insides of the blood vessels.
    And so that makes it a vascular disease, a blood vessel disease.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what are the implications of a virus like this being a vascular
    disease, a blood vessel disease, and not just a respiratory disease?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    It means it affects every organ in the body that has lots of fine
    blood vessels in it, and not even just organs.
    
    I mean, so it affects the lungs, which are the filter where the air
    gets into the blood, and you have lots of little fine blood vessels
    surrounding the little sacs at the ends of your breathing tubes. It
    attacks the kidneys, because that’s the filter where the urine comes
    out of the blood. So you have very fine networks of blood vessels
    there. It attacks the gut, because you have a network of blood
    vessels in your gut where food gets into your body. It attacks the
    brain, because you have lots of fine blood vessels in the brain. It
    doesn’t attack the nerve cells in the brain, which most of the brain
    is made of. It doesn’t attack the muscle cells in the heart. But it
    attacks the blood vessels that go through all those other parts.
    
    And so when they do autopsies they find thousands of tiny little
    blood clots all over the body. We have lots of people who have
    strokes. And as those blood clots clot up blood vessels to small
    areas of the brain, you may get dementia or disorientation. And then
    in kids, when you have ‘Covid toes’ in teenagers and young adults,
    this is the little capillaries in the hands and feet getting
    blocked, and getting this inflamed, painful, red or purple toe and
    finger syndrome. So it’s more complicated to deal with a disease
    that can travel to any organ in the body.

  - michael barbaro  
    So how does this new insight about the coronavirus, how does it
    change the way we are going to approach the pandemic?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Before, the main thing you’re looking for when you’re looking to see
    if somebody is having a problem is their blood oxygen level. Because
    you’re assuming that their problem is going to be pneumonia. But if
    you realize that the problem could be kidney damage, heart damage,
    you do a whole different battery of blood tests.

  - michael barbaro  
    So what you’re saying is that doctors who previously were diagnosing
    Covid-19 through a set of well-established symptoms now need to
    expand that set of symptoms pretty broadly. Because it turns out
    this is looking to be vascular, not respiratory.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, that’s right. It means that virtually anybody who comes into a
    doctor’s office feeling sick might have the coronavirus. If they
    come in with symptoms of a stroke, it might be Covid. If they come
    in with symptoms of a heart attack, it might be Covid. If they come
    in with what seems like arthritis in their feet, it might be Covid
    toe.
    
    And because we often don’t have enough tests, or it takes a long
    time to get test results, the patient’s at a real disadvantage.
    Because if you don’t know your patient has coronavirus, whatever
    symptom they’ve got now might become greater, might spread to other
    organs. So the problem in your toes might literally spread to your
    kidneys or your brain. And you want to know that that patient has a
    disease that can spread throughout the body.

  - michael barbaro  
    In other words, more testing, fast testing becomes more imperative
    once we have learned that so many symptoms may actually be a sign of
    Covid-19.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Absolutely.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. So what is the next big new insight we have into the
    coronavirus?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, people are always asking, is the virus mutating? Is it
    becoming different? And the answer is yes. This virus always
    mutates. It makes one mutation about every two weeks.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    The question is are any of those mutations important. And most of
    them aren’t. Most of them don’t change the function of the virus at
    all. But there has been one mutation that has become the object of a
    great deal of interest. We know for sure that there are sort of two
    general clades of the virus, the Wuhan strain and the other one
    called the Italian strain or sometimes a European strain. Now, the
    Wuhan strain is obviously the original one. That’s where the virus
    started. But it went around Asia. Then it went to Iran. Then it went
    to Italy. And in Italy sometime in February, presumably, this
    mutation took place. Now, it has definitely not made the virus more
    dangerous, more lethal, more likely to kill you. But it appears to
    have made it more transmissible.

  - michael barbaro  
    How so?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, it appears that it transmits between people five to 10 times
    more easily. Now, this is in dispute. But there’s been work done in
    cells in the laboratory where they infected them with the two
    different strains. And the mutation in the Italian strain seems to
    make the spikes on the outside of the virus — the spikes of the
    corona — more stable. Better able to infect. And so that they appear
    to be five to 10 times more capable at infecting cells as the old
    Wuhan version.

  - michael barbaro  
    So the strain of this virus that has a better spike — the Italian
    strain — and is therefore more transmissible, is crowding out the
    previous strain, because it’s just doing a better, more effective
    job of infecting people.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, that’s right. It’s the natural progression for a virus. It’s
    the way they tend to go.

  - michael barbaro  
    What do you mean?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, viruses, over the course of infecting lots of hosts, tend to
    become less lethal to those hosts and more transmissible. Like, for
    example, if I have the virus and it mutates inside me, and it turns
    into a more deadly strain, I’ve now got two strains. And I pass on
    that virus to two people, the person who gets the more deadly strain
    is more likely to go home, go to bed and die. Whereas the person who
    gets the less lethal, more transmissible strain is going to go out
    to a disco and infect 40 people.
    
    And if you do that enough times in the course of the virus, the
    virus always sort of naturally moves in the direction of the more
    transmissible, less lethal one, because that’s the one that spreads
    whenever it’s given that kind of fork in the road.
    
    And so this is what happened in 1918. The virus started off
    extremely deadly. It blew through an enormous chunk of the
    population, probably 60 to 70 percent of all the people in the
    world. And then it disappeared for a while. Then it turned up in
    pigs, and it was a pig virus for a while. And then when enough
    humans who’d never had the virus were born, it reappeared in people.
    But it reappeared as the H1N1 seasonal flu, the one that we know
    about as one of the seasonal flus every year. But that became less
    lethal and more transmissible. And basically all viruses do that.
    And we might be beginning to see the very first hints of that
    happening with this virus.

  - michael barbaro  
    So if I’m in Texas or Arizona right now and I’m testing positive for
    Covid-19, it sounds quite likely that I’ve gotten the Italian
    mutation of this virus, right? And that means I’m quite likely to
    spread it to somebody else and not have the most horrible symptoms.
    So does that partly help explain why infection rates are rising so
    rapidly in the U.S.?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, infection rates are rising rapidly in the U.S. more because of
    human behavior than because of any changes in the virus. I think
    it’s wishful thinking to think that this virus is not dangerous.
    It’s really dangerous, and it’s highly transmissible.

  - michael barbaro  
    But because the Italian version of the virus spreads more
    effectively, that does suggest that the virus is becoming better at
    doing the thing it was designed to do, which is to infect lots and
    lots of people.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. But I mean, the Italian version versus the Wuhan version isn’t
    the dead end. There are going to be many more mutations. It mutates
    every two weeks. There may be other mutations turning up in the
    virus that turn out to be important. And we may call those the Texas
    strain or the California strain, or whatever.
    
    But we don’t know them yet. There’s a lot of disagreement about this
    among scientists as to whether or not it really is more
    transmissible. And there’s zero agreement that it — not even really
    any thought that it’s less dangerous. That completely remains to be
    seen.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    So Donald, what is the next big new understanding we have into the
    virus at this point?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, there’s more and more confirmation that you are much safer
    outdoors than you are indoors. There’s a study in China that looked
    at 318 clusters of transmission. And only one case involved outdoor
    transmission. And that was between two neighbors who had a long
    conversation with each other. And there’s recently been another
    study from Japan that suggests that your chances of getting the
    virus indoors are 20 times as high as it would be outdoors.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what are these studies finding about why exactly that is? I
    think we all have some understanding that when you’re outside the
    virus is just going to disperse and become more diffuse. Is that as
    complicated as it is?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, there’s always a little bit of wind outside. Humidity also
    makes droplets fall out of the air. But mostly it’s the wind. And
    when people talk within a few feet of each other, especially when
    they talk loud, or when they laugh, or when they sing or shout or do
    anything like that, you put out this kind of invisible mist of
    little tiny droplets that spews out of your mouth and sort of hangs
    around your head. But it also drifts towards the other person. And
    so you’re sitting inside each other’s droplet cloud. And those
    little tiny droplets, even if you’re not feeling the other person in
    effect spitting on your face, that droplet cloud can hold enough
    virus to transmit the disease from one person to the other.
    
    And indoors when there’s no windows open, it can sort of drift
    through the room, more or less at head level, and go past one person
    after another at a cocktail party or inside a bar like that. And
    each person inhaling a little bit of that droplet cloud, until the
    disease has spread to 20, 30, 40 people. Whereas outdoors, the
    breeze just blows that away. So standing six feet away outdoors,
    even without masks, is considered safe.

  - michael barbaro  
    This is the idea that the virus becomes aerosolized. And you’re
    saying that indoors, that poses a very significant danger. Outdoors,
    because of wind, nowhere near as much.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, that’s right.

  - michael barbaro  
    So if being outdoors is less risky, and it’s now been clinically
    shown, I wonder if that explains something you mentioned the last
    time that we spoke, which is that you did not have a tremendous
    amount of fear that these protests that have occurred all over the
    United States over race and policing, that they would be a major
    source of infection. And is that because they occurred outdoors? And
    is it so far the case that they haven’t led to a meaningful spike in
    infections?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    We have not seen any big spike in infections in the cities where
    most of the protests took place. So it looks like they didn’t lead
    to a lot of transmission. That doesn’t imply that everything is safe
    just because it’s outdoors. The important thing is how far apart
    people are when they’re outdoors. So sitting right next to somebody
    else in front of a stage at Mount Rushmore, for example, where the
    chairs are zip tied together, is not safe. Masks or no masks, you
    still really want to try to keep six feet distance.

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, a couple of moments ago you mentioned the danger of being
    indoors because of this aerosolized virus mist that is not as great
    a danger outdoors. But I want to linger on this question of the
    indoors for a moment. Because the more we think about it, that
    aerosolized mist would seem to make any indoor activity inherently
    dangerous. I wonder if that’s an accurate assessment?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. I mean, we’ve seen transmission of virus to large numbers of
    people in funerals, in choir practices, at birthday parties, inside
    bars, in business meetings. Virtually any kind of indoor environment
    you can imagine, there have been super spreader events. There may be
    ways to eventually make indoor spaces safer. There’s going to be no
    way to make them completely safe.
    
    And all this talk about what’s safe to do indoors brings us to
    really the most important question, which is the most important
    indoor space we want to get functioning again, which is schools. Can
    kids go to school safely? And again, the science isn’t firm yet. But
    there are more and more hints that it may be safe, or pretty safe,
    to open the schools in the fall, especially for very young kids.
    
    There’s growing evidence that kids are not big transmitters of the
    virus to adults. Denmark opened its schools in April. Did not see a
    big spike up in cases. Finland opened its schools in May. Did not
    see a big spike up in cases. Even from the beginning in China, the
    Chinese said, every time they looked at clusters in families, almost
    never did they see a case where the child, particularly the youngest
    child, was the one who introduced the virus into the family. Usually
    it was parent infecting the kids, not the other way around.
    
    We know that kids are big transmitters of flu viruses. And they do
    it because they cough and sneeze like crazy. But if the biggest
    symptom that they’re getting is inflammation, rather than coughing
    and sneezing, — and that’s the case; kids tend to get more sort of
    cranky, inflammatory, unpleasant manifestations of the disease,
    rather than something that looks like a cold. Then it would make
    sense that that might be a reason why they’re not big transmitters.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what is this new insight about kids being less likely to
    transmit mean for the teachers who are going to stand or sit in
    front of them all day? Does it mean that an adult teacher in a
    school is pretty safe teaching? Or does it not mean that at all?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I don’t think we know the answer to that yet. I mean, schools —
    you’re bringing together a lot of kids. But schools also bring
    together a lot of adults. Teachers, staff, parents picking up the
    kids, things like that. So schools are not going to be completely
    safe under any circumstances.
    
    But opening schools is so important to society, much more important
    than opening restaurants, much more important than opening movie
    theaters. It probably needs to be done really carefully. Not just
    all back into the classroom, 30 kids to a classroom, at all. But it
    looks like it could be done. And that’s really important. Because
    it’s important for the kids, for their development, for their
    feeding, for their socialization. And it’s also important for the
    parents. Parents can’t go back to work if they’re stuck at home with
    their kids. So it’s a crucial part of getting both the economy going
    and just the health of kids and health of parents.

  - michael barbaro  
    So of all the insights that you have shared today, this one seems
    like the silver lining. That reopening schools may be a somewhat
    safe undertaking.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. And that would be very good news for us.

  - michael barbaro  
    Because if I’m being candid, everything else you have said sounds
    pretty bad, right? I mean, it seems to be vascular, not respiratory.
    So it’s going to be easy to miss symptoms. It seems it’s becoming
    more transmissible through mutations. And the indoors presents very
    significant threats for non-kids because of this aerosolized mist.
    And once the temperature drops, which it will do in a few months,
    and tens of millions of us are suddenly stuck indoors, then we’re in
    for a lot of trouble.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, and the number of cases per day could rise well over 100,000
    if we’re not careful. So yeah, I guess, it’s mostly bad news.

  - \[laughter\]  
    Sorry. I’m hoping that the fact that the virus is becoming more
    transmissible also means that it will become less lethal, which
    would be good news. But it hasn’t done that yet. So more
    transmission of a virus that’s already bad is not a good thing. No
    question about it.

  - michael barbaro  
    And all these things that we have just talked about would also seem
    to reinforce the need, not just for social distancing, but for these
    government-mandated lockdowns. I mean, specific requirements that
    say, don’t go to a bar. Don’t go to a restaurant. And those will
    become even more urgent as the warm weather yields to cold weather.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. We have to realize we are just in the opening phases of this
    pandemic. I mean, this is the second inning. And there’s still —
    there’s more than 120,000 people dead. So we are doing the dance in,
    dance out of various forms of lockdown. But we need to get to the
    point where we’re all basically dancing to the same music. Where all
    governors accept the notion that when they have a problem that’s
    getting out of control in their state, they react quickly.
    
    And if they do that, they will save lives of their own citizens. And
    I think we’re beginning to see that.
    
    In places like Texas, places like Arizona, places like Florida the
    governors have made major about-faces in the last couple of weeks.
    And they’re getting the science that the thing you do today doesn’t
    produce good effects until a month from today, because the people
    who got infected yesterday are the ones who are going to be in your
    hospital three weeks from now. So they’re beginning to catch on.
    
    But we need to arrive at sort of a common understanding that we
    don’t all have to move in lockstep as a nation, but at the crucial
    moments we need to take similar steps to save lives.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Thank you, Donald. We appreciate it.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you. I was glad to be here.

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there
    is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance.

michael barbaro

In a pair of back-to-back speeches over the weekend, President Trump
delivered harsh attacks against what he called the radical far-left
forces who are protesting police brutality and tearing down monuments to
America’s racist past, describing them as a threat to American values
and heritage.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its
    mantras and follow its commandments, then you will be censored,
    banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished. It’s not going to
    happen to us.

michael barbaro

The Times reports that the speeches, delivered in front of Mount
Rushmore and the White House, signaled that Trump would seek, once
again, to exploit racial and cultural divisions in an effort to win
re-election.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and
    before the world this monument will never be desecrated. These
    heroes will never be defaced. Their legacy will never, ever be
    destroyed. Their achievements will never be forgotten. And Mount
    Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers
    and to our freedom.

michael barbaro

Neither event enforced social distancing rules. And both were held
despite pleas from public health officials that they be canceled to
avoid spreading the coronavirus.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you
tomorrow.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: As infection rates break new records across the U.S. this
    July 4 weekend, four new insights into the virus from my colleague,
    science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. It’s Monday, July 6.
    
    Let me start by, Donald, saying happy 4th of July.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you.

  - michael barbaro  
    How did you spend it?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Saturday, I played softball in the morning — socially distant
    softball.

  - michael barbaro  
    Softball?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah.

  - michael barbaro  
    In New York City?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    In New York City. Yeah, Riverside Park. And then we went to dinner
    last night in a friend’s backyard on Long Island, where we all sat
    as couples together, but six feet apart from each other, and sort of
    took turns going up to the table to get to the food, and sat, and
    had a really nice time.

  - michael barbaro  
    I have to imagine that even a socially distanced meal with you is
    challenging, in that I think I would feel quite seen and judged,
    given your role.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Why?

  - \[laughter\]

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I mean, I do tend to say six feet, six feet, six feet, a lot at
    people.

  - michael barbaro  
    See?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Because masks give people a false sense of security. I mean, this is
    a big thing on the softball field, is that people would both put on
    masks and they’d sit next to each other in the dugout, making up the
    batting order and stuff like that. And I’d go, no\! Air leaks out of
    the side of your masks. And you’re not always wearing masks.
    Sometimes you’re wearing it as a sort of a Captain Ahab blue beard
    under your chin. So it’s better to stay six feet apart. That way if
    your mask —

  - michael barbaro  
    Do your remember a couple seconds ago how you asked me why it might
    be challenging to have a —

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - michael barbaro  
    — a meal with you?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    All right. \[LAUGHTER\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Ask and —

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    All right, touche, touche.

  - michael barbaro  
    So everything you just described, of course, is occurring in New
    York, where the infection rate has been generally declining or at
    least stabilizing. So let’s talk about the state of the pandemic in
    the rest of the country. I wonder if you can give us a quick status
    update on this end of July 4 weekend.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK. I think it’s 39 states now have cases going up. And it’s hitting
    hardest in the South and in the West. Texas, Florida, Arizona,
    California, a number of other states. And it’s exactly what was
    predicted back in May when states were debating opening by Memorial
    Day. All public health experts said, if you open up when your case
    counts are rising, they’re going to continue rising and start rising
    even faster. And now we’re seeing that.
    
    For example, in Houston, doctors who knew the situation in New York
    are saying that what’s happening there looks like what happened in
    New York in early April. Finding new beds, finding ventilators, lots
    of patients who were sick, patients who were on oxygen. Not as many
    dying yet, but with people on oxygen and on ventilators they may
    find themselves in the situation where they have to park
    refrigerated trucks behind hospitals to hold the bodies, as they did
    in New York.

  - michael barbaro  
    So Donald, correct me if I’m wrong. I think the U.S. is at about
    50,000 infections a day right now. Dr. Anthony Fauci said we could
    get up to 100,000. And if that’s the case, what do we expect the
    attendant death count to start to look like in the U.S.? I assume
    that’s going to catch up with that.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, it’ll catch up with it. I mean, but there’s no reason to
    believe that 100,000 is the upper limit. It all depends on how much
    social distancing we practice. I mean, this is the dance. And do you
    close bars and restaurants? Do you open or close schools? Do you
    wear masks? How much attention do people pay to the directions you
    give them? How much do they practice good social distancing. That
    very much affects the rate of spread of the virus.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, with that in mind, those big questions of kind of how we
    proceed through the rest of this pandemic, you have been doing a lot
    of reporting about the latest learnings and insights into the virus
    that will very much guide how we answer those questions. And we want
    to talk through those with you. So where do you think we should
    start?

  - \[music\]

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Some of these insights are really more theories with some evidence
    to them. And some there’s quite a bit of confidence in. So we
    probably ought to start with something that there’s a pretty high
    degree of confidence in among doctors.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what is that?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    When this all started, we thought of it as a lung disease, a
    respiratory disease, because the first cases we heard about, people
    got pneumonia. And that of course reminded us that the model for
    this disease was the 1918 influenza epidemic. But we’re learning
    that this coronavirus is very different from an influenza virus.
    
    The influenza viruses attach to receptors in the lungs and the
    airway. This gets into the body through the airway, through the
    lungs. But it really attaches to the insides of the blood vessels.
    And so that makes it a vascular disease, a blood vessel disease.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what are the implications of a virus like this being a vascular
    disease, a blood vessel disease, and not just a respiratory disease?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    It means it affects every organ in the body that has lots of fine
    blood vessels in it, and not even just organs.
    
    I mean, so it affects the lungs, which are the filter where the air
    gets into the blood, and you have lots of little fine blood vessels
    surrounding the little sacs at the ends of your breathing tubes. It
    attacks the kidneys, because that’s the filter where the urine comes
    out of the blood. So you have very fine networks of blood vessels
    there. It attacks the gut, because you have a network of blood
    vessels in your gut where food gets into your body. It attacks the
    brain, because you have lots of fine blood vessels in the brain. It
    doesn’t attack the nerve cells in the brain, which most of the brain
    is made of. It doesn’t attack the muscle cells in the heart. But it
    attacks the blood vessels that go through all those other parts.
    
    And so when they do autopsies they find thousands of tiny little
    blood clots all over the body. We have lots of people who have
    strokes. And as those blood clots clot up blood vessels to small
    areas of the brain, you may get dementia or disorientation. And then
    in kids, when you have ‘Covid toes’ in teenagers and young adults,
    this is the little capillaries in the hands and feet getting
    blocked, and getting this inflamed, painful, red or purple toe and
    finger syndrome. So it’s more complicated to deal with a disease
    that can travel to any organ in the body.

  - michael barbaro  
    So how does this new insight about the coronavirus, how does it
    change the way we are going to approach the pandemic?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Before, the main thing you’re looking for when you’re looking to see
    if somebody is having a problem is their blood oxygen level. Because
    you’re assuming that their problem is going to be pneumonia. But if
    you realize that the problem could be kidney damage, heart damage,
    you do a whole different battery of blood tests.

  - michael barbaro  
    So what you’re saying is that doctors who previously were diagnosing
    Covid-19 through a set of well-established symptoms now need to
    expand that set of symptoms pretty broadly. Because it turns out
    this is looking to be vascular, not respiratory.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, that’s right. It means that virtually anybody who comes into a
    doctor’s office feeling sick might have the coronavirus. If they
    come in with symptoms of a stroke, it might be Covid. If they come
    in with symptoms of a heart attack, it might be Covid. If they come
    in with what seems like arthritis in their feet, it might be Covid
    toe.
    
    And because we often don’t have enough tests, or it takes a long
    time to get test results, the patient’s at a real disadvantage.
    Because if you don’t know your patient has coronavirus, whatever
    symptom they’ve got now might become greater, might spread to other
    organs. So the problem in your toes might literally spread to your
    kidneys or your brain. And you want to know that that patient has a
    disease that can spread throughout the body.

  - michael barbaro  
    In other words, more testing, fast testing becomes more imperative
    once we have learned that so many symptoms may actually be a sign of
    Covid-19.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Absolutely.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. So what is the next big new insight we have into the
    coronavirus?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, people are always asking, is the virus mutating? Is it
    becoming different? And the answer is yes. This virus always
    mutates. It makes one mutation about every two weeks.

  - michael barbaro  
    Wow.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    The question is are any of those mutations important. And most of
    them aren’t. Most of them don’t change the function of the virus at
    all. But there has been one mutation that has become the object of a
    great deal of interest. We know for sure that there are sort of two
    general clades of the virus, the Wuhan strain and the other one
    called the Italian strain or sometimes a European strain. Now, the
    Wuhan strain is obviously the original one. That’s where the virus
    started. But it went around Asia. Then it went to Iran. Then it went
    to Italy. And in Italy sometime in February, presumably, this
    mutation took place. Now, it has definitely not made the virus more
    dangerous, more lethal, more likely to kill you. But it appears to
    have made it more transmissible.

  - michael barbaro  
    How so?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, it appears that it transmits between people five to 10 times
    more easily. Now, this is in dispute. But there’s been work done in
    cells in the laboratory where they infected them with the two
    different strains. And the mutation in the Italian strain seems to
    make the spikes on the outside of the virus — the spikes of the
    corona — more stable. Better able to infect. And so that they appear
    to be five to 10 times more capable at infecting cells as the old
    Wuhan version.

  - michael barbaro  
    So the strain of this virus that has a better spike — the Italian
    strain — and is therefore more transmissible, is crowding out the
    previous strain, because it’s just doing a better, more effective
    job of infecting people.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, that’s right. It’s the natural progression for a virus. It’s
    the way they tend to go.

  - michael barbaro  
    What do you mean?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, viruses, over the course of infecting lots of hosts, tend to
    become less lethal to those hosts and more transmissible. Like, for
    example, if I have the virus and it mutates inside me, and it turns
    into a more deadly strain, I’ve now got two strains. And I pass on
    that virus to two people, the person who gets the more deadly strain
    is more likely to go home, go to bed and die. Whereas the person who
    gets the less lethal, more transmissible strain is going to go out
    to a disco and infect 40 people.
    
    And if you do that enough times in the course of the virus, the
    virus always sort of naturally moves in the direction of the more
    transmissible, less lethal one, because that’s the one that spreads
    whenever it’s given that kind of fork in the road.
    
    And so this is what happened in 1918. The virus started off
    extremely deadly. It blew through an enormous chunk of the
    population, probably 60 to 70 percent of all the people in the
    world. And then it disappeared for a while. Then it turned up in
    pigs, and it was a pig virus for a while. And then when enough
    humans who’d never had the virus were born, it reappeared in people.
    But it reappeared as the H1N1 seasonal flu, the one that we know
    about as one of the seasonal flus every year. But that became less
    lethal and more transmissible. And basically all viruses do that.
    And we might be beginning to see the very first hints of that
    happening with this virus.

  - michael barbaro  
    So if I’m in Texas or Arizona right now and I’m testing positive for
    Covid-19, it sounds quite likely that I’ve gotten the Italian
    mutation of this virus, right? And that means I’m quite likely to
    spread it to somebody else and not have the most horrible symptoms.
    So does that partly help explain why infection rates are rising so
    rapidly in the U.S.?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, infection rates are rising rapidly in the U.S. more because of
    human behavior than because of any changes in the virus. I think
    it’s wishful thinking to think that this virus is not dangerous.
    It’s really dangerous, and it’s highly transmissible.

  - michael barbaro  
    But because the Italian version of the virus spreads more
    effectively, that does suggest that the virus is becoming better at
    doing the thing it was designed to do, which is to infect lots and
    lots of people.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. But I mean, the Italian version versus the Wuhan version isn’t
    the dead end. There are going to be many more mutations. It mutates
    every two weeks. There may be other mutations turning up in the
    virus that turn out to be important. And we may call those the Texas
    strain or the California strain, or whatever.
    
    But we don’t know them yet. There’s a lot of disagreement about this
    among scientists as to whether or not it really is more
    transmissible. And there’s zero agreement that it — not even really
    any thought that it’s less dangerous. That completely remains to be
    seen.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    So Donald, what is the next big new understanding we have into the
    virus at this point?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, there’s more and more confirmation that you are much safer
    outdoors than you are indoors. There’s a study in China that looked
    at 318 clusters of transmission. And only one case involved outdoor
    transmission. And that was between two neighbors who had a long
    conversation with each other. And there’s recently been another
    study from Japan that suggests that your chances of getting the
    virus indoors are 20 times as high as it would be outdoors.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what are these studies finding about why exactly that is? I
    think we all have some understanding that when you’re outside the
    virus is just going to disperse and become more diffuse. Is that as
    complicated as it is?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, there’s always a little bit of wind outside. Humidity also
    makes droplets fall out of the air. But mostly it’s the wind. And
    when people talk within a few feet of each other, especially when
    they talk loud, or when they laugh, or when they sing or shout or do
    anything like that, you put out this kind of invisible mist of
    little tiny droplets that spews out of your mouth and sort of hangs
    around your head. But it also drifts towards the other person. And
    so you’re sitting inside each other’s droplet cloud. And those
    little tiny droplets, even if you’re not feeling the other person in
    effect spitting on your face, that droplet cloud can hold enough
    virus to transmit the disease from one person to the other.
    
    And indoors when there’s no windows open, it can sort of drift
    through the room, more or less at head level, and go past one person
    after another at a cocktail party or inside a bar like that. And
    each person inhaling a little bit of that droplet cloud, until the
    disease has spread to 20, 30, 40 people. Whereas outdoors, the
    breeze just blows that away. So standing six feet away outdoors,
    even without masks, is considered safe.

  - michael barbaro  
    This is the idea that the virus becomes aerosolized. And you’re
    saying that indoors, that poses a very significant danger. Outdoors,
    because of wind, nowhere near as much.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, that’s right.

  - michael barbaro  
    So if being outdoors is less risky, and it’s now been clinically
    shown, I wonder if that explains something you mentioned the last
    time that we spoke, which is that you did not have a tremendous
    amount of fear that these protests that have occurred all over the
    United States over race and policing, that they would be a major
    source of infection. And is that because they occurred outdoors? And
    is it so far the case that they haven’t led to a meaningful spike in
    infections?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    We have not seen any big spike in infections in the cities where
    most of the protests took place. So it looks like they didn’t lead
    to a lot of transmission. That doesn’t imply that everything is safe
    just because it’s outdoors. The important thing is how far apart
    people are when they’re outdoors. So sitting right next to somebody
    else in front of a stage at Mount Rushmore, for example, where the
    chairs are zip tied together, is not safe. Masks or no masks, you
    still really want to try to keep six feet distance.

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, a couple of moments ago you mentioned the danger of being
    indoors because of this aerosolized virus mist that is not as great
    a danger outdoors. But I want to linger on this question of the
    indoors for a moment. Because the more we think about it, that
    aerosolized mist would seem to make any indoor activity inherently
    dangerous. I wonder if that’s an accurate assessment?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. I mean, we’ve seen transmission of virus to large numbers of
    people in funerals, in choir practices, at birthday parties, inside
    bars, in business meetings. Virtually any kind of indoor environment
    you can imagine, there have been super spreader events. There may be
    ways to eventually make indoor spaces safer. There’s going to be no
    way to make them completely safe.
    
    And all this talk about what’s safe to do indoors brings us to
    really the most important question, which is the most important
    indoor space we want to get functioning again, which is schools. Can
    kids go to school safely? And again, the science isn’t firm yet. But
    there are more and more hints that it may be safe, or pretty safe,
    to open the schools in the fall, especially for very young kids.
    
    There’s growing evidence that kids are not big transmitters of the
    virus to adults. Denmark opened its schools in April. Did not see a
    big spike up in cases. Finland opened its schools in May. Did not
    see a big spike up in cases. Even from the beginning in China, the
    Chinese said, every time they looked at clusters in families, almost
    never did they see a case where the child, particularly the youngest
    child, was the one who introduced the virus into the family. Usually
    it was parent infecting the kids, not the other way around.
    
    We know that kids are big transmitters of flu viruses. And they do
    it because they cough and sneeze like crazy. But if the biggest
    symptom that they’re getting is inflammation, rather than coughing
    and sneezing, — and that’s the case; kids tend to get more sort of
    cranky, inflammatory, unpleasant manifestations of the disease,
    rather than something that looks like a cold. Then it would make
    sense that that might be a reason why they’re not big transmitters.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what is this new insight about kids being less likely to
    transmit mean for the teachers who are going to stand or sit in
    front of them all day? Does it mean that an adult teacher in a
    school is pretty safe teaching? Or does it not mean that at all?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I don’t think we know the answer to that yet. I mean, schools —
    you’re bringing together a lot of kids. But schools also bring
    together a lot of adults. Teachers, staff, parents picking up the
    kids, things like that. So schools are not going to be completely
    safe under any circumstances.
    
    But opening schools is so important to society, much more important
    than opening restaurants, much more important than opening movie
    theaters. It probably needs to be done really carefully. Not just
    all back into the classroom, 30 kids to a classroom, at all. But it
    looks like it could be done. And that’s really important. Because
    it’s important for the kids, for their development, for their
    feeding, for their socialization. And it’s also important for the
    parents. Parents can’t go back to work if they’re stuck at home with
    their kids. So it’s a crucial part of getting both the economy going
    and just the health of kids and health of parents.

  - michael barbaro  
    So of all the insights that you have shared today, this one seems
    like the silver lining. That reopening schools may be a somewhat
    safe undertaking.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. And that would be very good news for us.

  - michael barbaro  
    Because if I’m being candid, everything else you have said sounds
    pretty bad, right? I mean, it seems to be vascular, not respiratory.
    So it’s going to be easy to miss symptoms. It seems it’s becoming
    more transmissible through mutations. And the indoors presents very
    significant threats for non-kids because of this aerosolized mist.
    And once the temperature drops, which it will do in a few months,
    and tens of millions of us are suddenly stuck indoors, then we’re in
    for a lot of trouble.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah, and the number of cases per day could rise well over 100,000
    if we’re not careful. So yeah, I guess, it’s mostly bad news.

  - \[laughter\]  
    Sorry. I’m hoping that the fact that the virus is becoming more
    transmissible also means that it will become less lethal, which
    would be good news. But it hasn’t done that yet. So more
    transmission of a virus that’s already bad is not a good thing. No
    question about it.

  - michael barbaro  
    And all these things that we have just talked about would also seem
    to reinforce the need, not just for social distancing, but for these
    government-mandated lockdowns. I mean, specific requirements that
    say, don’t go to a bar. Don’t go to a restaurant. And those will
    become even more urgent as the warm weather yields to cold weather.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. We have to realize we are just in the opening phases of this
    pandemic. I mean, this is the second inning. And there’s still —
    there’s more than 120,000 people dead. So we are doing the dance in,
    dance out of various forms of lockdown. But we need to get to the
    point where we’re all basically dancing to the same music. Where all
    governors accept the notion that when they have a problem that’s
    getting out of control in their state, they react quickly.
    
    And if they do that, they will save lives of their own citizens. And
    I think we’re beginning to see that.
    
    In places like Texas, places like Arizona, places like Florida the
    governors have made major about-faces in the last couple of weeks.
    And they’re getting the science that the thing you do today doesn’t
    produce good effects until a month from today, because the people
    who got infected yesterday are the ones who are going to be in your
    hospital three weeks from now. So they’re beginning to catch on.
    
    But we need to arrive at sort of a common understanding that we
    don’t all have to move in lockstep as a nation, but at the crucial
    moments we need to take similar steps to save lives.

  - michael barbaro  
    Thank you, Donald. We appreciate it.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you. I was glad to be here.

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there
    is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance.

michael barbaro

In a pair of back-to-back speeches over the weekend, President Trump
delivered harsh attacks against what he called the radical far-left
forces who are protesting police brutality and tearing down monuments to
America’s racist past, describing them as a threat to American values
and heritage.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its
    mantras and follow its commandments, then you will be censored,
    banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished. It’s not going to
    happen to us.

michael barbaro

The Times reports that the speeches, delivered in front of Mount
Rushmore and the White House, signaled that Trump would seek, once
again, to exploit racial and cultural divisions in an effort to win
re-election.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and
    before the world this monument will never be desecrated. These
    heroes will never be defaced. Their legacy will never, ever be
    destroyed. Their achievements will never be forgotten. And Mount
    Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers
    and to our freedom.

michael barbaro

Neither event enforced social distancing rules. And both were held
despite pleas from public health officials that they be canceled to
avoid spreading the coronavirus.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

Infection rates broke records across the United States over the holiday
weekend, with many of the most severe surges in areas that reopened
fastest. One thing that seems to have played a factor: transmission
indoors, such as in restaurants and bars. We break down the risk, and
look at what else scientists have learned about the coronavirus and how
it spreads.

**Background reading:**

  - Many scientists have been saying for months that [the coronavirus
    lingers in the air
    indoors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html),
    infecting those nearby. But the World Health Organization has been
    slow to agree.

  - Black and Latino residents of the United States are nearly twice as
    likely to die from Covid-19 as their white neighbors, [according to
    new
    data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)
    that provides the most comprehensive look yet at coronavirus
    patients in America.
