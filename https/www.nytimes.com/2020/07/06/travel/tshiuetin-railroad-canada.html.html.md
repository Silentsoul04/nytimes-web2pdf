In 2015, as I drove through my hometown, Toronto, a radio documentary
came on the air describing a remote railway, the Tshiuetin line, that
runs through rural Quebec.

Named after the [Innu](https://www.innu.ca/) word for “wind of the

learn, is about 15 hours east of Toronto by car.

Canada was built by rail. The country’s early railway system was a vital
tool for economic growth, but it also abetted Canada’s colonial mission.
In addition to carrying goods and services, trains in Canada
disseminated disease among the Indigenous communities on whose land this
country was built. And while the country’s railroads offered the
possibility of expansion to some, for others they were harbingers of
forced
relocation.

Schefferville was built by the Iron Ore Company of Canada to facilitate
mining in the 1950s. After the closure of the area’s I.O.C. mines in the
1980s, the company had no use for the northern portion of its railway.
Since 2005, it has been run by the three First Nations that it connects:
the Innu nations of Uashat Mak Mani-utenam and Matimekush-Lac John, and
the Naskapi nation of Kawawachikamach. With a mandated 85 percent
Indigenous work force, Tshiuetin is now a symbol of reclamation and
defiance for those it
serves.

The combined population of Schefferville and Matimekush-Lac John is
around 800, and the Tshiuetin line plays a central role in the
community. The passenger train normally completes its round-trip journey
twice a week, with its estimated arrival times announced on the local
Schefferville radio. (Since the town lies outside the country’s
provincial road network, a costly plane trip is the only alternative way
in or out.)

During the coronavirus pandemic, the frequency of trips has been
limited, and restrictions have been placed on passengers’ reasons for
travel.
