# Colleges Plan to Reopen Campuses, but for Just Some Students at a Time

</div>

To provide some semblance of the campus experience during a pandemic,
colleges say large chunks of the student body will have to stay away and
study remotely for all or part of the year.

With the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/sports/coronavirus-stanford-cuts.html)
still raging and the fall semester approaching, colleges and
universities are telling large segments of their student populations to
stay home. Those who are allowed on campus, they say, will be living in
a world where parties are banned, where everyone is frequently tested
for the coronavirus and — perhaps most draconian of all — where students
attend many if not all their courses remotely, from their dorm rooms.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In order to achieve social distancing, many colleges are saying they
will allow only 40 to 60 percent of their students to return to campus
and live in the college residence halls at any one time, often divided
by class
year.

[Stanford](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/sports/coronavirus-stanford-cuts.html)
has said freshmen and sophomores will be on campus when classes start in
the fall, while juniors and seniors study remotely from home. Harvard
announced on Monday that it will mainly be first-year students and some
students in special circumstances who will be there in the fall; in the
spring, freshmen will leave and it will be seniors’ turn.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same time, very few colleges are offering tuition discounts, even
for those students being forced to take classes from home.

Professors, students and parents all seem to be conflicted over how
these plans will work out.

Pascale Bradley, a senior studying English and French literature at
Yale, is just looking forward to seeing some classmates again. Yale is
allowing first-year students, juniors and seniors on campus in the fall,
but nearly all classes will be taught remotely.

“It won’t be the same social life,” she said. “Not that students are
upset there might not be big parties. People are just looking forward to
daily small interactions, being able to sit and study with someone and
have a meal with
someone.”

Her father, Kirby Bradley, is less forgiving. “This just seems to be the
worst of all worlds,” said Mr. Bradley, who owns a video production
company. “They are exposing the kids to increased virus risk, something
that is arguably justifiable in exchange for in-person learning, which
everyone agrees is better than online. But no, the kids will do remote
learning, from campus\! At full tuition\!”

College administrators say they are in a bind and doing the best they
can to bring students back to campus to get at least some of the social
and academic benefits of being surrounded by their peers.

“This pandemic is among the worst crises ever to hit Princeton, or
college education more broadly,” Christopher L. Eisgruber, president of
Princeton, said in his reopening announcement. “Princeton’s preferred
model of education emphasizes in-person engagement, but in-person
engagement is what spreads this terrible virus.”

Princeton is one of the few universities that has said it would offer a
tuition discount this fall because of the limitations. Students, whether
on campus or learning remotely, will be charged 10 percent less
— $48,501 for the coming year, instead of $53,890, according to a
spokesman, Ben Chang. It was unclear how students receiving financial
aid — who account for more than 60 percent of undergraduates — would be
affected.

Princeton said it was instituting the policy because most undergraduates
would be on campus only half the year — freshmen and juniors in the
fall, sophomores and seniors in the spring.

Harvard University announced on Monday that no more than 40 percent of
its undergraduates would be allowed on campus at a time during the next
academic year, but that tuition would remain the same. All first-year
students would be allowed in the fall semester, along with some students
in other years whose home environments are not conducive to learning;
the freshmen would leave in the spring to make space for seniors to
finish and graduate on campus.

At Harvard, all classes will be held online, even for students living on
campus. While it is not discounting its tuition and fees — about $54,000
for the year — the university said it would offer a summer term next
year of two tuition-free courses for all students who had to study away
from campus for the full academic year.

Cutting down the number of students on campus will allow many colleges
to offer everyone a single or double dormitory bedroom. Students are
being told they will have to eat takeout meals from dining halls in
their rooms, or perhaps make a reservation to eat.

Many universities are requiring behavioral contracts in which students
agree to wear face masks in public, to be tested regularly for the
coronavirus, and to limit travel and socializing. If they break the
rules, they can be disciplined.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Universities say they are keeping a tight rein on students because the
trajectory of the virus is still uncertain. Several universities cited
the recent surge in virus cases in some states as justification for
keeping classes virtual, even for students living on campus.

[Faculty members are also
worried](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-college-professors.html).
More than 850 members of the Georgia Tech faculty have signed a letter
opposing the school’s reopening plans for the fall, which say that
wearing face masks on campus would not be mandatory, just “strongly
encouraged.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The Montana University System is also facing pushback from the faculty
over its mask policy.

International students may have the hardest time of all. Many have
returned to their home countries and will not be able to re-enter the
United States because of travel and visa restrictions.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement on Monday
that student visas would not be issued to people enrolled in schools or
programs that are fully online for the fall semester. Students in such
programs will not be permitted to enter the country, and those already
in the United States “must depart the country or take other measures,
such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction, to remain
in lawful status.”

Under pressure both to return to normal — [President Trump wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280209946085339136?s=20)
on Monday that “Schools must open in the fall\!\!\!” — and to keep
students and faculty safe, universities are fighting back against the
perception that virtual classes are inferior.

[A video touts the
sophistication](https://vimeo.com/johnshopkins/review/433786130/1ed867a018)
of a studio system of creating and recording virtual lecture classes at
Johns Hopkins, where first- and second-year students are being invited
to apply for housing.

The video shows professors delivering their lectures in a large bright
studio, almost as if they were actors onstage, while the eager faces of
students look back at them from oversize video screens.

Many universities are bracing for the possibility that upperclassmen
will request leaves of absence until things return to normal. The
schools are warning students that if they do, there may not be dormitory
housing for them in a year or two when they come back.

Cornell University is bucking the trend and allowing all its students
back to campus, with a mixture of in-person and online instruction.
Cornell said it based its decision on an
[analysis](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/COVID_19_Modeling_Jun15.pdf)
that found that conducting a semester entirely remotely could result in
far more students becoming infected — up to 10 times as many — compared
with reopening the campus. That is because of the likelihood that even
if classes were conducted remotely, many Cornell students would return
to off-campus housing in Ithaca, N.Y., and the university would not be
able to enforce virus testing requirements or restrictions on their
behavior.

Rutgers University said on Monday that its fall semester would combine a
majority of remotely delivered courses with a limited number of
in-person classes.

“We have wanted very fervently to be able to resume some version of a
normal semester,” Jonathan Holloway, the university’s president, said in
a [message to the Rutgers
community](http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=B7qRmy9MCgTfwcglnVfMK-2BAqVl42XzZJ6qWfrpNErMSbHn5Lc2TGqnqiYYEklxHMPmyRbN2vlvYM-2Ba4MJ05tkw-3D-3DByuE_hL7TmydlaMnATh3nUjJggvIFksBL8YdYIW6OdNBg50LtPVULmxBnuqXyyhYlYbSAfyXTCD3A7tmCA0yK8Sc2xQ1ELtNEQ-2FAeZKeeT-2FIVbyaVOW2-2FrzGsXCh8jBDZ4nJlbA7akhdGAu92-2F6x3g2iYXSIFoo-2Bf-2BYpfP399Su8omi3TYwAf3DUtypSNMAVPURTwCu2WEK3ej70cx-2F3euc8hcssOKCmXa2e1K5hFMsU3DXneL8DhASpYjb7lMr53rteDHYpfkK5SoFsB93XaAS0K7ecGaEu6fLUheBJNFjcuGT62Cw7jtQFdC-2FMPC0xoeqCgla-2F0-2BNDm2k-2Fk1E-2B2bzDFjwJ5hXPBPI9weC4Dsihb33qx6xXPOX55uldfzM7GbX0ymSuBOG6DXLCRPiqN-2BD7uxg-3D-3D).

The University of Pennsylvania is also pursuing a “hybrid model” in the
fall, with classroom instruction “where it can be provided safely and
when it is essential to the academic needs of the course curriculum,”
while other courses like large lecture classes are held online.

Many schools [suspended their usual grading
policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/coronavirus-college-pass-fail.html)
amid the chaos of the spring term, substituting a pass/fail system
instead. Now they say they are planning to restore normal grading
policies.
