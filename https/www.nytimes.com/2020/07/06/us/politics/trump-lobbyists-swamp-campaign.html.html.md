# Trump Vowed to ‘Drain the Swamp,’ but Lobbyists Are Helping Run His Campaign

</div>

Lobbyists like David Urban, whose connections start at the very top, are
thriving as they help the president’s re-election effort while aiding
corporate clients.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The chief executive of the arms maker Raytheon, under
pressure to overcome a congressional hold on major sales in the fall of
2018, wanted to sit down with one of the few people who could solve the
problem — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

But the State Department would not schedule the meeting. So Raytheon
turned for help to David Urban, perhaps the best-connected lobbyist in
President Trump’s Washington.

Mr. Urban was a classmate at West Point of Mr. Pompeo and of Mark Esper,
now the defense secretary, and was influential in recommending both men
for administration posts.

He has close ties to Mr. Trump, who credits him with having helped
deliver a pivotal Election Day victory in Pennsylvania in 2016 and
recently invited Mr. Urban to [fly on Marine One with
him](https://twitter.com/rep_stevewomack/status/1271805658275418115) to
West Point. He has a long roster of blue-chip clients, including
military contractors like Raytheon, whose chief executive got the
meeting he wanted with Mr. Pompeo after Mr. Urban intervened on his
behalf.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The meeting was requested by Mr. Urban more than two weeks before the
State Department [issued an emergency
waiver](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)
in May 2019 that circumvented the congressional hold on the arms deals,
allowing billions of dollars in Raytheon missiles and bombs to be sold
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The meeting took place in
June several weeks after the issuance of the waiver, the State
Department said. It is not known what Mr. Pompeo and the Raytheon
executive discussed.

The department did not deny that Mr. Urban arranged the meeting but said
the emergency waiver — now the subject of
[congressional](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/trump-congress-arms-sales.html)
and [inspector general
investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/pompeo-trump-linick-inspector-general-firing.html)
— was consistent with American national security objectives.

The story behind Mr. Pompeo’s meeting with Raytheon, which has not been
previously reported, is emblematic of the outsize influence wielded in
Washington by Mr. Urban and a small group of other lobbyists and
operatives who backed Mr. Trump when most of the K Street establishment
was keeping its distance. Those relationships became lucrative after Mr.
Trump won a surprise victory on Election Day and rewarded early
loyalists with key posts, continued access or both.

With Mr. Trump lagging in the polls, the lobbyists are seeking to
protect that mutually beneficial relationship by working to re-elect
him, underscoring the mix of politics and policy that has served them —
and their clients — so well over the last three and a half years.

Consider the examples of eight lobbyists and operatives with ties to
lobbying firms, including Mr. Urban, who are now assisting Mr. Trump’s
campaign in various paid and unpaid capacities, like fund-raising and
strategy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those eight have been paid a total of nearly $120 million through their
firms to influence the United States government from the beginning of
2017, as Mr. Trump prepared to take office, to the end of March,
according to an analysis of congressional and Justice Department
filings.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The scale of those revenues is especially striking given that several of
the lobbyists — including two of the top three earners, Brian Ballard, a
veteran lobbyist from Florida, and Jeff Miller, an operative from Texas
— had not lobbied at the federal level before Mr. Trump’s election.
Mr. Ballard’s firm was paid nearly $65 million and Mr. Miller’s more
than $18 million by interests for which the two men had registered to
lobby through the end of March, the most recent period for which
comprehensive data is available.

And while Mr. Urban has been a registered lobbyist at the federal level
since 2002, his federal lobbying revenues have nearly tripled in the
Trump era — rising to more than $25 million in the roughly 40 months
after his swearing-in from less than $9 million in the roughly 40 months
before Mr. Trump became
president.

The mutually beneficial relationships between the president and the
lobbyists is the latest evidence of the [hollowness of Mr. Trump’s 2016
campaign
pledge](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-recording-donors.html)
to “[drain the
swamp](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/trump-government.html)”
by taking on the special interests, lobbyists and donors who had “rigged
the system against everyday Americans.”

Mr. Trump’s political kitchen cabinet is stocked with people who are
thriving in that swamp.

They include [Corey
Lewandowski](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-donald-trump.html),
Mr. Trump’s initial campaign manager in 2016. Mr. Lewandowski has not
registered as a lobbyist, despite [advising
companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-trump.html)
with issues before the administration and also [reports that he has
worked with a lobbying
firm](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/ryan-zinke-lobbying-firm-1168926)
founded in part by Jason Osborne, a former Trump 2016 campaign aide who
has [raised at least
$360,000](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00618389/1379377/sa/3L)
for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.

Also recently added to the campaign team was Jason Miller, who [set up
meetings](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6609688-DOL-Records-Regarding-the-Conflict-of-Interest.html#p1048)
in 2017 for [Wall Street
executives](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5686950-Treasury-Secretary-Mnuchin-s-Calendars.html#p844)
with cabinet officials, and briefly [registered this year as a
lobbyist](https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=40FA8A43-199A-402B-AA00-78B0CF699DFB&filingTypeID=1)
for [other
companies](https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=85E787FA-E2D7-4FD9-B739-E5BF9A5781F0&filingTypeID=1)
before joining the campaign’s payroll.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Urban and Mr. Lewandowski, who have not been paid by the re-election
campaign committee, joined Mr. Miller in a campaign brain trust meeting
last month, [first reported by
Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-campaign-internal-polling-f022697e-03cc-4fe0-8aab-cbffd1f74a0c.html).

Beyond the strategic advice, Mr. Trump’s campaign has also benefited
from financial assistance from lobbyists who are top volunteer
fund-raisers, including Mr. Ballard, Jeff Miller, Roy Bailey, David
Tamasi and Kent R. Hance of Texas, a former Democratic representative
who [switched to the Republican
Party](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/04/us/in-blow-to-texas-democrats-ex-rep-hance-joins-republicans.html)
in 1985 after leaving Congress.

They have been credited with raising a total of nearly $8 million since
the beginning of 2019 for Mr. Trump’s re-election committees and the
Republican National Committee, according to campaign finance filings,
though they most likely accounted for far more cash raised to help Mr.
Trump, since the filings only count certain kinds of
donations.

There is a long tradition of Washington lobbyists and consultants in
both parties assisting campaigns, which helps ensure their continued
access to the corridors of power.

Mr. Trump, however, was a Washington outsider with few connections to
traditional K Street power brokers, and most kept their distance from
him. That has heightened the earning power of the relatively few
lobbyists who publicly backed the president, whose support in some cases
has won them entree into the inner circles of the Trump administration
and campaign.

“This is by far the smallest number of lobbyists supporting a president
in decades,” said Mr. Tamasi, a K Street veteran who began raising money
for Mr. Trump in June 2016, and has raised more than $230,000 for his
re-election effort and the Republican National Committee. “The market
sees that limited pool of K Street support and makes advocacy business
decisions accordingly.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bailey, who had not registered to lobby the federal government
before Mr. Trump took office, highlighted his fund-raising for Mr.
Trump’s campaign and inauguration in an email [seeking
access](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6958438-Seeking-a-Meeting-at-the-E-P-A-Lobbyist-Touts.html)
to Scott Pruitt, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, for a biotechnology company known at the time as Intrexon. The
company paid Mr. Bailey [$180,000 in lobbying
fees](https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=340EDCB1-9935-4424-BBEE-DCC81397D937&filingTypeID=78).

Mr. Ballard, who has known Mr. Trump for 30 years and had lobbied for
the Trump Organization in Florida, has been hired by a host of major
companies seeking to deal with scrutiny from Mr. Trump or his
administration, including [General
Motors](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/gm-auto-trump.html),
[Boeing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/business/boeing-flights-grounded.html),
[Amazon](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html)
and the Turkish state-owned bank
[Halkbank](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/halkbank-turkey-iran-indictment.html).

Mr. Ballard was a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and
then for his inauguration. He is a regional vice chairman for the
Republican National Committee’s fund-raising operation, and was [tapped
last month as a co-chairman of the
committee](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Meet-the-Jacksonville-2020-Host-Committee.html?soid=1134390131943&aid=AA68sNTVjXE)
raising funds for the [recently relocated Republican National
Convention](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/trump-jacksonville-rnc-speech.html)
in Jacksonville, Fla.

Jeff Miller, who is not related to Jason Miller, had run the 2016
presidential campaign of Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas Mr.
Trump later nominated as energy secretary. He helped Mr. Perry navigate
the confirmation process, and registered to lobby for his first clients
in Washington — including an [energy
company](https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=34C32AFE-4ABB-4101-A6D5-4E0B93A86FEF&filingTypeID=1)
— one day before Mr. Perry was [confirmed and sworn into
office](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/senate-confirms-rick-perry-as-energy-secretary.html),
then
[facilitated](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4779334-Energy-Secretary-Rick-Perry-Calendars-for-March.html#p405)
meetings for
[clients](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4779334-Energy-Secretary-Rick-Perry-Calendars-for-March.html#p152)
with Mr. Perry.

Mr. Miller has raised about $4 million for Mr. Trump’s re-election and
the Republican National Committee from the beginning of last year to the
end of March.

But few lobbyists consistently have more influence than Mr. Urban, who
is known as the master of the subtle nudge, often delivered in private
discussions. Mr. Urban declined to comment.

Mr. Trump has called Mr. Urban “one of my good friends.” And a month
after the election, during which Mr. Urban ran Mr. Trump’s winning
campaign in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, the pair were
photographed watching the annual Army-Navy football game together [in
Mr. Urban’s private
suite](https://www.wptv.com/news/national/trump-cheered-by-fans-at-annual-army-navy-game).

Mr. Urban had played football at West Point and, to this day, he carries
an olive-drab green Army surplus backpack instead of a briefcase to many
meetings. Last year, Mr. Trump [appointed Mr. Urban to a
position](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-appoint-individuals-key-administration-posts-15/)
at his alma mater. The public displays of support from the president,
which have included multiple flights aboard Air Force One and one last
month aboard Marine One, bolstered Mr. Urban’s reputation as
well-connected and raised his earning power on K
Street.

The two friends he helped place in the Trump administration’s cabinet —
Mr. Pompeo, who initially served as C.I.A. director before becoming
secretary of state, and Mr. Esper, [a former Raytheon
lobbyist](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/mark-esper-acting-defense-secretary.html)
who served as Army secretary before becoming defense secretary — are now
in positions to oversee issues of key importance to Mr. Urban’s military
contractor clients.

Mr. Pompeo invited Mr. Urban, as well as the chief executives of two
companies for which Mr. Urban lobbies — Raytheon and the convenience
store chain 7-Eleven — to exclusive dinners in the State Department’s
Diplomatic Reception Rooms.

Mr. Urban’s private conversations with Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Esper tend to
focus on politics, rather than foreign affairs or national security,
according to people familiar with the relationships. One of the people
said Mr. Esper, in particular, has relied on Mr. Urban as a Trump
whisperer, who helps interpret the president’s moods and rants.

When Mr. Trump became upset with [Mr. Esper’s opposition last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/esper-milley-trump-protest.html)
to his threat to send the military to quell unrest in American cities,
Mr. Urban expressed support for his former classmate, which played an
important role in Mr. Trump’s decision not to remove the defense
secretary, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

Other lobbyists say Mr. Urban has further raised his profile with both
his clients and Mr. Trump through his platform as a paid contributor for
CNN, which appears to have started regularly [identifying him as a
lobbyist](https://twitter.com/mmfa/status/1145335186315497473) during
his appearances on its programs after [drawing
scrutiny](https://www.thedailybeast.com/david-urban-why-is-cnn-paying-a-trump-campaign-adviser)
for consistently failing to do so.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

During a segment on the network last year, Mr. Urban suggested the
possibility of [a proportional military response against
Iran](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1906/20/cg.02.html) in
retaliation for the country’s downing of a crewless American drone. “If
I were a betting man, I’d bet that there’d be some sort of a Tomahawk
missile strike on the site that launched this,” Mr. Urban said,
referring to one of Raytheon’s products. Mr. Trump [had approved a
retaliatory strike against
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html)
in that case but pulled back at the last minute.

And during an appearance this year, after [praising Mr. Trump’s
hard-line against
Iran](https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2020/01/08/intv-amanpour-david-urban-trump-iran.cnn),
Mr. Urban was asked by a CNN host whether a move against Iran might
represent “an opportunity for your companies.” Mr. Urban rejected the
question, praising the president for being “incredibly restrained with
the use of force,” and adding “no one is looking to profiteer here.”

Members of Congress from both parties opposed the Raytheon arms sales to
the Saudis, in part because of Saudi Arabia’s leading role in the [Yemen
war](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-yemen.html),
which has left [thousands of civilians dead and millions suffering from
famine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/20/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-invisible-war-yemen.html?module=inline),
and later because of the grisly killing by Saudi agents of the
journalist [Jamal
Khashoggi](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-prince.html).

By late summer 2018, Raytheon executives were under increasing pressure
to close the stalled deals. At least one of the contracts called for
onerous penalties if the company did not deliver, and executives had
also already booked the sales as expected revenue, according to current
and former government officials.

Thomas A. Kennedy, then the company’s chief executive and now its
executive chairman, sought a meeting with Mr. Pompeo that fall, but Mr.
Pompeo pushed it to lower-level officials, who met with subordinates of
Mr. Kennedy that September, the officials said.

After Mr. Urban later sought the meeting for Raytheon, the State
Department issued the emergency declaration overriding the congressional
block and the arms sales proceeded. The meeting happened weeks later.
Mr. Urban did not attend.

The State Department played down the meeting, noting in a statement from
a spokeswoman that Mr. Pompeo meets with corporate executives “with
great frequency” and has an entire bureau at the department dedicated to
working with the private sector on national security matters.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The secretary’s decisions with respect to arms sales — as with all of
his actions — are made to keep America safe and undergo a full legal
review and approval process,” the statement said.

The congressional and inspector general
[investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/pompeo-trump-linick-inspector-general-firing.html)
into the emergency waiver and the related arms sales have put scrutiny
on Mr. Pompeo. But Mr. Urban’s clout appears to remain intact.

The State Department spokeswoman said Mr. Pompeo “has known David Urban
for over three decades and knows him to be an American patriot.”

Kenneth P. Vogel and Hailey Fuchs reported from Washington, D.C., and
Michael LaForgia from Spokane, Wash. Eric Schmitt and Edward Wong
contributed reporting from Washington,
D.C.
