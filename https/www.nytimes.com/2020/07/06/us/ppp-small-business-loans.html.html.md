WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, [under
pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/politics/coronavirus-ppp-trump-congress.html)
to reveal which companies received loans from a $660 billion program
intended to keep small businesses afloat, on Monday [released
data](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1052) showing that
restaurants, medical offices and car dealerships ranked high among the
top loan recipients.

The detailed information from the Paycheck Protection Program was
confined to companies that received loans of more than $150,000. The
administration said 86.5 percent of the loans were for less than that
amount, so the snapshot captured only one sliver of businesses that
tapped funds. So far, banks have made about 4.9 million loans through
the program, with an average size of $107,000.

Nearly 5,000 businesses received individual loans between $5 million and
$10 million, according to the data. The administration included ranges
for the amounts, not specific figures.

And the figures did not include details on the roughly $30 billion in
loans that were returned as companies [realized that they were not
eligible](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html)
for the program, worried that they couldn’t meet program requirements or
reacted to a [public
outcry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-treasury-payment-protection-program.html)
about big firms getting funds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Restaurants, medical offices and car dealerships were the top recipients
of large loans from the program. More than 40,000 full- or
limited-service restaurants received loans worth as much as $32 billion,
according to the ranges provided by the government.

Sprinkled among the beneficiaries were businesses that are likely to
attract scrutiny, including a fancy sushi restaurant at the Trump
International Hotel in Washington; Kanye West’s company, Yeezy; and
President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer.

Washington lobbying shops, high-priced law firms and special-interest
groups also received big loans, according to the administration, the
latest indication of how the government’s centerpiece effort to shore up
mom-and-pop shops set off a race by organizations far afield from Main
Street to secure federal money. The disclosure could [further fuel
outrage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-treasury-payment-protection-program.html)
toward the program, which has been complicated by revelations that
large, publicly traded companies were taking big loans and concerns that
it might leave borrowers saddled with debt.

“My 1,000-foot takeaway is that the government was handing out free
money and the line went around the corner,” said Aaron Klein, a fellow
in economic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “This is
not your mom-and-pop shop on Main Street.”

The administration said the Paycheck Protection Program had helped to
support more than 50 million jobs. The share of overall small-business
payroll supported per state ranged from 72 percent in Virginia to 96
percent in Florida, according to the Treasury Department.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The program provides forgivable loans to companies that have 500 or
fewer employees and meet certain requirements, such as using the bulk of
the money to keep workers on the payroll. Lenders are responsible for
reviewing recipients’ forgiveness applications to verify that they
complied with the program’s rules.

More than 100 law firms received loans ranging from $1 million to $10
million, the data showed. The list included well-known names like Boies
Schiller Flexner, the high-priced law firm run by David Boies, which
received between $5 million and $10 million. “We don’t comment on our
financials,” the firm said.

Kasowitz Benson Torres, founded and run by Mr. Trump’s longtime personal
lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, received a loan for between $5 million and $10
million. The firm represented Mr. Trump for over a decade before he was
elected president, both in his business dealings and in other matters,
such as helping him keep [divorce records
sealed](https://www.kasowitz.com/evidence/media/kasowitz-successfully-defends-donald-trump-keeping-divorce-records-sealed).
Mr. Kasowitz and the firm also
[represented](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-lawyers-digenova.html)
Mr. Trump during Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian
interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Trump later [diminished the role of Mr.
Kasowitz](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/us/politics/trump-legal-team-lawyers.html)
in his dealings with Mr. Mueller’s investigators. A spokeswoman for
Kasowitz Benson Torres said the loan, along with cost-cutting, “enabled
us to preserve the jobs of our hundreds of employees at full salary and
benefits without interruption.”

The president also appears to have benefited from government support, at
least indirectly. While the Trump Organization did not apply for loans
under the program, the data showed that dozens of tenants at buildings
owned by Mr. Trump or managed by his companies received funds.

One reported recipient was a hair salon in the president’s hotel in
Chicago. More than 20 businesses listed at 40 Wall Street, an office
building near the New York Stock Exchange that Mr. Trump has owned since
the mid-1990s, also reportedly received government loans totaling at
least $20 million. Among the recipients were law offices, financial
service firms and nonprofit organizations.

Sushi Nakazawa, a restaurant at the Trump International Hotel in
Washington, received a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000. The
company did not respond to a request for comment about how it planned to
use the funds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some loan recipients are connected to the president’s son-in-law and
senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The data show that a loan of between
$350,000 and $1 million was made to Esplanade Livingston, a Kushner
family entity that owns the land in Livingston, N.J., where the family’s
Westminster Hotel is. In 2018, Mr. Kushner divested his stake in the
entity, from which he once derived income generated by that hotel.

Princeton Forrestal, a real estate entity owned by various members of
the Kushner family not including Mr. Kushner, received a loan of between
$1 million and $2 million.

“Several of our hotels have applied for federal loans, in accordance
with all guidelines, with a vast majority of funds going to furloughed
employees,” said Pete Febo, Kushner Companies’ chief operating officer.

The Paycheck Protection Program, which was included in the $2 trillion
stimulus bill passed by lawmakers in March, also benefited several
members of Congress.

Car dealerships connected to Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of
Pennsylvania, received three loans, each between $150,000 and $350,000.
Mr. Kelly, a multimillionaire, owns Mike Kelly Automotive Group, Mike
Kelly Automotive L.P.; and Mike Kelly Hyundai, all of which accepted
loans.

Andrew Eisenberger, spokesman for Mr. Kelly, said that the congressman
had properly followed the rules of the disaster aid program and that the
money would be used “to sustain the income of workers who would
otherwise have been without pay or employment at no fault of their own
during the coronavirus pandemic.”

Businesses associated with other members of Congress or their relatives,
both Democrats and Republicans, received similar disaster aid. They
included a farm and other businesses owned by Representative Vicky
Harzler, Republican of Missouri, and her husband. Ms. Harzler [cited the
need](https://hartzler.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hartzler-small-business-among-47000-missouri-companies-utilize-paycheck)
“to ensure the continued ability to maintain the employment of all team
members during this time.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A New York shipping business owned by the family of Transportation
Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch
McConnell, received at least $350,000, according to the data. A person
familiar with the company, [Foremost
Group](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/us/politics/elaine-chao-house-investigation.html),
said that the loan was for less than $500,000 and that no employees had
been laid off during the pandemic. Ms. Chao has no formal affiliation or
stake in the business. In 2008, she and Mr. McConnell received millions
of dollars in gifts from her father, James, who ran the company until
2018.

Many of the biggest and most influential lobbying and political
consulting firms received money — despite prohibitions intended to
restrict access — most likely qualifying by highlighting lines of
business that fell outside the restrictions.

Wiley Rein, which has a large lobbying practice focusing on trade
issues, received between $5 million and $10 million, according to the
data. Van Ness Feldman and Beveridge & Diamond, two law firms that focus
on helping energy industry clients push their agendas in Washington,
received loans between $2 million and $5 million, according to the
administration.

A firm that raises money for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign and the
Republican National Committee received a loan of more than $1 million,
according to the data set, while a company that produces Mr. Trump’s
political advertisements received between $350,000 and $1 million. So
did a consulting firm started by President Barack Obama’s former
campaign manager Jim Messina and one that Hillary Clinton’s 2008
campaign paid for communications consulting.

Several firms that advise companies on how to deal with the government,
but are not officially registered to lobby, were also said to have
received loans. They include companies run by former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who served in the Clinton administration.

The administration listed loans worth between $350,000 and $1 million to
a consulting firm started by former Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine
Republican who also served in the Clinton administration as the
secretary of defense, and one run by a homeland security secretary in
the Bush administration, Michael Chertoff. And DCI Group AZ, a prominent
political and corporate consulting firm, collected as much as $5
million.

An affiliate of Americans for Tax Reform, the influential conservative
group that has been a vocal critic of government spending, received
between $150,000 and $350,000, according to the government’s data. In a
statement, the group said the foundation “was badly hurt by the
government shutdown” and “does not engage in lobbying.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A number of prominent private schools were listed as loan recipients,
despite [the
controversy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/prep-schools-coronavirus-loans.html)
over whether such institutions should take the money.

In New York City, St. Ann’s School took a loan valued between $5 million
and $10 million. Kent Place School, a private school in New Jersey, was
reported to have received a loan worth between $1 million and $2
million.

Schools with political ties in the Washington area also received loans.
Sidwell Friends, which has educated the children of presidents, received
a loan worth between $5 million and $10 million, based on the data.
Georgetown Preparatory School, which the Supreme Court justices Brett
Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch attended, received a loan worth between $2
million and $5 million.

Georgetown Preparatory’s president, the Rev. James R. Van Dyke, said,
“We remain committed to doing all that we can to retain our immensely
talented faculty and staff,” adding that many of them accept salaries
and wages “lower than what they might earn in the for-profit sector or
the public school system.”

St. Andrew’s Episcopal School, where Mr. Trump’s youngest son is a
student, also received a loan.

Touring companies for rock bands also turned to the government for help
as concert venues around the country went dark to prevent the spread of
the virus.

A limited liability company called Eagles Touring Company II Foreign
received a loan between $350,000 and $1 million. Documents filed in
California show that the entity shares an agent with a similarly named
company whose president is Don Henley, a founding member of the Eagles,
the rock band that had to postpone its tour this spring.

Lil’ Jon Touring and [Nickelback
Touring 2](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusinesssearch.sos.ca.gov%2FDocument%2FRetrievePDF%3FId%3D02813188-11505402),
among other acts, received loans between $150,000 and $350,000. Lil
Jon’s publicist, Tamar Juda, said that the artist had canceled over 75
shows since the beginning of the pandemic and that the funds allowed his
core touring staff to remain employed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yeezy, which California [business
filings](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201613910148-27294586)
show is a holding company registered to Mr. West, received between $2
million and $5 million to support 106 jobs, based on the disclosures.
The holding company appears to be linked to Mr. West’s apparel brand,
having [recently
filed](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn90023673&docId=APP20200630084733#docIndex=1&page=1)
to trademark the phrase “West Day Ever” for use on clothing. Public
relations firms that have worked for Yeezy did not respond to emailed
requests for comment.

There was no apparent link between the amount of economic damage
suffered by states and how successful the small businesses in them were
at getting the loans from the program.

North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas all saw loan approvals
of at least 90 percent of their eligible small-business payroll, even
though they rank among the [least-affected
states](https://taxfoundation.org/unemployment-insurance-claims/) in
terms of unemployment claims during the crisis. Two of the hardest-hit
states for claims, New York and California, saw loan approvals equal to
about three-quarters of their eligible payrolls; by that measure,
California companies would have received billions more from the program
if they had seen approvals at the same rate as the Plains states.

Reporting was contributed by Kenneth P. Vogel, Eric Lipton, David
McCabe, Steve Eder, Ben Protess, Stacy Cowley and Noam Scheiber.
