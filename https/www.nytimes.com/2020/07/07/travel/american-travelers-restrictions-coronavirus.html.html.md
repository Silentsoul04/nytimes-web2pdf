Even as many countries remain off-limits to American visitors because of
the high rate of coronavirus within the United States, others have
started to welcome, and in some cases woo, U.S. citizens to come spend
their tourist dollars. Still, would-be
[vacationers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/travel/virus-vacation.html)
generally face a host of conditions and a lot of traveler beware.

The U.S. State Department continues its [Global Level 4 Health
Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html),
which cautions against international travel because of the pandemic.
However, it is also posting country-specific information as restrictions
loosen.

*\[Have an update for this list? Email us at*
[*travelrestrictions@nytimes.com*](mailto:travelrestrictions@nytimes.com)*.\]*

Getting there is only part of the equation. Countries have their own
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/travel/virus-vacation.html)
mitigation measures that might include curfews or curtailed activities
and services; most standard travel insurance policies won’t cover
medical or travel expenses related to the coronavirus; and borders can
close and flights be canceled with little warning, stranding people in
foreign countries. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention
[advises](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html)
Americans to avoid contact with others for 14 days after they return
from international travel.

Albania reopened its borders in early June with enhanced screening and
quarantine measures in place. However, because the number of coronavirus
cases in the country has been increasing, the U.S. Embassy in Albania
has suspended all but emergency
services.

Travelers must provide a certificate of a negative Covid-19 test taken
within seven days of arrival. Without proof, the government can require
visitors to quarantine or to be tested and pick up the $100 expense.
Temperatures will be checked at the airport and people are asked to
register with the Ministry of Health, Wellness and the Environment.
Visitors must have a mask and wear it in public or face a possible fine
of $5,000 or up to 6 months in jail. “Persons traveling to Antigua and
Barbuda from countries where there are outbreaks of Covid-19,” may be
required to quarantine, according to the Antigua Barbuda Tourism
Authority.

### [ARUBA](https://www.aruba.com/us/traveler-health-requirements)

Aruba first opened to Canada, Europe and most other Caribbean countries
on July 1, with U.S. travelers admitted as of July 10, under certain
conditions.

Residents from nearly half the states are considered to be at higher
risk of Covid-19, and must upload proof of a negative test taken between
12 and 72 hours before flying or they won’t be allowed to board their
flight. Residents of the other states have the option of uploading a
test or having one taken at the airport in Oranjestad. The airport tests
are done at the expense of travelers, who must quarantine at their
lodging for up to 24 hours while awaiting results.

Island guests must purchase mandatory Aruba Visitors Insurance to cover
up to $75,000 in expenses should they test positive for Covid-19 during
their stay. According to an [online
calculator](https://www.arubavisitorsinsurance.com/calculator), the
premium for most visitors over age 15 who are staying for a week would
be just over $100, and about $10 for those under 15.

Masks are mandatory on the flight for anyone over age 15 and in the
airport, but not elsewhere.

### [THE BAHAMAS](https://opm.gov.bs/national-address/)

[The
Bahamas](https://www.bahamas.com/pressroom/bahamas-ministry-tourism-aviation-statement-executive-order-amid-rising-covid-19-cases)
has been wrestling with how to contain the coronavirus after the
nation’s [reopening](https://www.bahamas.com/tourism-reopening) led to
a spike in cases. As of late July, the country is again open to
commercial flights from the United States, but travelers must quarantine
for 14 days upon arrival and all inter-island travel is halted.

Despite the quarantine requirement, anyone over age 10 arriving in the
country must still upload proof of a negative test for the virus taken
within 10 day of their travel date. All visitors must also have an
approved Health Visa, which should be filled out at least 72 hours
before departure.

In addition, weekend lockdowns are in effect and a daily curfew will
confine tourists to their hotel property between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. All
public and private beaches and parks are closed, including those at
hotels and resorts.

Travelers are expected to have the results of a negative Covid-19 test
performed no more than 72 hours before arrival. If not, one will be
taken upon landing or at a testing center at a designated hotel, and the
person will need to quarantine while awaiting results.

Visitors also undergo a temperature check; need to complete an
embarkation/disembarkation card that will ask personal health questions
related to Covid-19; and must wear a mask at the airport.

Travelers from high risk settings may be monitored daily for possible
symptoms with a follow-up coronavirus test on day seven. If the
follow-up test is negative, the monitoring is discontinued. If a second
test is not done, the monitoring will continue for 14 days. Travelers
from moderate risk countries will be monitored for seven
days.

### [BELARUS](https://by.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/)

Travelers arriving in Belarus from the United States do not have to
self-quarantine. Temperature screening will be done at Minsk National
Airport. Different travel requirements may be in place for countries
that travelers transit en route from the United States.

The U.S. Embassy in Belarus
[advises](https://by.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/):
“Due to border closures and flight cancellations, options for departing
Belarus are increasingly limited. Those wishing to depart Belarus should
immediately take advantage of remaining
flights.”

Belize has scheduled an Aug. 15 reopening. Arriving guests who have
proof of a negative Covid-19 test within the previous three days can use
a “fast track” entry lane, while others will have to pay for and undergo
testing at the airport. Anyone testing positive won’t be allowed to
leave the country, but instead must isolate for at least 14 days at the
passenger’s expense.

Visitors must stay at a “Tourism Gold Standard” hotel, which can offer
full services, thereby lessening the interaction with locals. No rental
cars will be available at first, and parks and tourist sites will only
be accessible with an approved tour operator. Face masks are required in
public.

Bermuda has an extensive screening process in place and requires a $75
fee to cover the cost of mandatory in-country Covid-19 tests given at
the airport and again on day three, seven and 14 of a traveler’s stay.
Visitors are also asked to bring a thermometer and a face mask.

In addition to being tested at the airport, anyone 10 and older is asked
to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within three days
of their flight to Bermuda (although tests taken within five days will
be accepted). Those with proof of a negative test still must quarantine
at their hotel for about eight hours pending the results of their
airport test. Those arriving without proof of a negative test are
confined to their accommodation for three days.

All travelers must complete an online travel authorization form within
48 hours of their flight, then take and record their temperature twice a
day for the first 14 days of their visit. Face masks are also required.

within the previous 48 hours. If they have an older test result, the
person can enter, but must self-quarantine until they can show another
negative test, which would be taken at their own expense. Those without
negative results must self-quarantine for 14
days.

### [DOMINICAN REPUBLIC](https://www.godominicanrepublic.com/newsroom/coronavirus/)

The Dominican Republic reopened to tourists on July 1. Visitors must
complete a Health Affidavit that attests that they haven’t experienced
any Covid-19 symptoms in the past 72 hours. A temperature check will be
taken at the airport. Anyone with a fever or other coronavirus symptoms
will be tested. Hotels are also required to check a guest’s temperature
when they arrive, as are operators of water excursions. Curfews are in
effect in many
places.

### [ECUADOR](https://ec.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information-ecu-2/)

The United States is continuing to help repatriate Americans who stayed
in Ecuador when the pandemic closed down travel. [Those wanting to visit
the country](https://ec.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information-ecu-2/) need
to quarantine for 14 days in government-designated temporary housing or
hotels. In addition, all arriving passengers must have proof of a
negative Covid-19 test within the previous seven days, or agree to
undergo a test in the country. The government has restricted movement
throughout the country and there are curfews
imposed.

### [EGYPT](https://eg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/)

Egypt has restarted international flights. It is unclear what
restrictions, if any, have been put in place. [The State Department
website](https://eg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/)
says that Egypt has a 14-day quarantine period, but [media
reports](https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/travel/travelling-to-egypt-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-1.1042458)

Tourists age 12 and older arriving from New York, Florida, Arizona and
Texas must upload a negative Covid-19 test that was taken within 10 days
of their arrival date. All passengers must complete a Travel
Authorization screening form within 72 hours of their trip and present
it at the airport or they will not be allowed to board their flight.

Arriving passengers will have their temperatures taken and be asked
screening questions. If they are considered at high risk, they may be
required to take a Covid-19 test. Anyone tested must quarantine at their
accommodation until the results are available, generally within 48
hours. Those who test positive must isolate at their hotel or at a
government facility.

All tourists staying at hotels, villas or guesthouses must remain within
a designated tourist corridor, where operators have been trained in
Covid-19 protocols. Masks must be worn in all common areas.

Visitors staying at a private residence are required to quarantine there
for 14 days, leaving only once per day to get necessities.

Kosovo is reportedly open to visitors with no restrictions for Covid-19.
However, the U.S. Embassy in Kosovo says that some U.S. citizens are
being denied boarding in the United States because they cannot prove
they are residents or citizens of Kosovo. For the latest information,
the embassy recommends checking with it or with the airline before a
flight.

### [LEBANON](https://lb.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/)

Visitors must show negative results for a coronavirus test taken in the
previous four days, and, if they are staying for more than a week,
submit to another test given at the airport at the airline’s expense. If
they arrive without a test result, they will be tested at the airport
and retested 72 hours later. The passenger must self-quarantine while
awaiting the results of the second test, which is at the traveler’s
expense. Foreigners must also have proof of insurance that would cover
any costs associated with the
coronavirus.

Many Mexican states are open only for essential services, while others

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

### [PUERTO RICO](https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/info/travel-advisory)

Puerto Rico has postponed its reopening to tourists from outside the
territory.

When planning a future trip, travelers must have evidence of a negative
test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival and complete an online
travel declaration form. If the test result is pending, they must
quarantine until it is available. If the result comes back positive, or
if it doesn’t arrive, the person must quarantine for 14 days. Those
arriving without a test must have one done on the island at their own
expense, and must quarantine while awaiting the result. Anyone not
taking a test must quarantine for 14
days.

Visitors must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within the
past seven days, unless they are coming from a country within a
Caribbean “bubble.” Arriving passengers must have completed a travel
registration and they will be screened and their temperatures taken.
Anyone showing symptoms of the coronavirus will be tested, and if the
results are positive, the person will be transferred to a hospital for
treatment at their expense.

Visitors must have confirmed reservations at a Covid-19 certified
accommodation provider for the duration of their stay. For at least the
month of July, it will be more difficult to explore the island as there
are no rental cars and only a small number of tours will be available to
book through the hotels. Masks are required in
public.

### [ST. MAARTEN](https://stmaartenupdates.com)

St. Maarten plans to start welcoming tourists from the United States on
Aug. 1, having already opened up to those from Canada and Europe.

Before arrival, visitors must complete an online health declaration and
receive a reply giving them permission to visit. Those over age 10 from
a country identified as high or moderate risk for transmission of the
coronavirus must show proof of a negative test taken within 72 hours of
boarding their flights. Only those from low-risk countries are exempt,
unless they visited a higher-risk country in the two weeks before their
trip to St. Maarten. In that case, they, too, must show proof of a
negative test.

Travelers from moderate and high-risk countries need to bring a
thermometer, and they must upload daily information about their body
temperature and any flu-like symptoms. Those from moderate-risk
countries must comply for eight days, while those from high-risk
countries must comply for 14 day.

Travel insurance that will cover any coronavirus-related expenses is
also
mandatory.

Under protocols in place for the month of July, visitors will be given a
Covid-19 test and must quarantine at their hotel for 24 hours while
awaiting the results, unless they have proof of a negative test for the
virus taken within the previous 48 hours, or a positive antibody test
taken within the previous five days. Anyone who tests positive must
isolate in an approved facility for 14 days at their own expense.

Those exempt from the airport test must monitor their temperature for
two weeks and report any changes to health authorities.

After Aug. 1, plans call for testing to be done based on the traveler’s
country of
origin.

All coronavirus-related entry restrictions have been lifted for Serbia.
However, some hospitals have been overwhelmed with coronavirus patients
in recent days and troops this month set up an emergency [500-bed field
hospital near
Belgrade](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/europe/serbia-military-sets-up-field-hospital-for-virus.html).

A state of emergency was declared in the capital last month as the

### [UKRAINE](https://ua.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/)

U.S. citizens can enter Ukraine if they can show they have medical
insurance covering all expenses related to possible Covid-19 treatment.
Ukraine currently classifies the United States as a country with a high
incidence of coronavirus, which means that U.S. travelers should be
prepared to self-quarantine for two weeks at their own expense or take a
test upon arrival. Test results are emailed within 24 hours, and
passengers should follow the self-quarantine protocol until the results
are sent to health authorities.

The government is using a four-color scale (green, yellow, orange and
red) to identify the virus risk in each region, and quarantine orders
may differ by
color.

### [UNITED ARAB EMIRATES](https://ae.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/)

Travelers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 96
hours of their flight in order to board a commercial aircraft to the
country. Many passengers are also tested upon arrival, and some may need
to self quarantine or may be sent to a quarantine facility. The U.S.
embassy says all people arriving in the U.A.E. are urged to self
quarantine for 14 days. International health insurance is also required.

While Dubai is open, those wanting to enter Abu Dhabi must show proof of

Fines for violators can range from $250 to more than
$27,000.

### [UNITED KINGDOM](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control)

The list of “travel corridor” countries — countries whose residents are
allowed into England with few restrictions — is growing, but the United
States is still not on it. As a result, anyone arriving from the United
States must be prepared to isolate for 14 days, or face a penalty of up
to $1,250. Passengers transiting in an airport are exempt, as are those
going directly from one port to another; for instance, from Heathrow to
Eurostar.
