*First, Thomas Fuller with an update on the virus.*

Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that the state had stepped up a crackdown
on businesses flouting coronavirus-related restrictions, inspecting
nearly 6,000 businesses over the holiday weekend.

More than 50 businesses were cited, the governor said. “The overwhelming
majority of people were doing the right thing,” Mr. Newsom said.

With infections surging in the state, the governor last week reversed
his reopening plan, closing down indoor operations of many businesses in
the hardest-hit counties.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The number of counties on a state “watchlist” of rising cases has
increased to 23 from 19 last week, the governor said Monday.

Testing has increased to more than 100,000 a day but the overall
positivity rate of those tested has also increased by more than a third,
reaching an average of 7.2 percent positive tests over the past week,
according to state data.

Hospitalizations are up by 50 percent in California over the past two
weeks, and hospitals are at capacity in some southern counties. But over
all California is using just 8 percent of its hospital beds for
coronavirus
patients.

“We still have ample hospital capacity in our system,” Mr. Newsom said.

The California Capitol building was closed Monday as a number of people,
including one lawmaker, were confirmed to have contracted the
coronavirus. Autumn Burke, an assemblywoman representing Los Angeles,
[reported on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/autumnrburke/status/1280191365976952832?s=20)
that she tested positive for the virus on Saturday and had no symptoms.
The decision to close the Capitol was made a day earlier, when the
leadership of the Legislature learned that two other people who work in
the building were confirmed to have the virus.

Katie Talbot, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, said
the Capitol would be cleaned and sanitized during the closure.
“Additionally, to help protect health and safety at the Capitol,
legislative recess has been extended until further notice,” she said.

### Los Angeles Board of Education Votes to Cut Police Budget

*Will Wright fills us in on a debating roiling the Los Angeles Board of
Education.*

Members of the Los Angeles Board of Education who voted last week to cut
33 percent of the district’s police budget last week thought they had
reached a compromise.

But not everyone agreed.

A day after the vote, the chief resigned after less than a year on the
job, calling the $25 million cut “potentially life-threatening” for
students and staff members. George McKenna, the only Black person on the
seven-member board, said those who voted for it were more interested in
appeasing the calls of activists than protecting students.

“It is extreme and unnecessary,” Mr. McKenna said. “I’ve never seen
anything so ill-conceived and carried out with so much enthusiasm by
elected officials.”

The budget amendment, which passed in a 4-3 vote, will force the school
district’s Police Department to lay off about 65 of its roughly 330
sworn officers, according to a spokesman for the department.

New rules for police officers will also, at least temporarily, bar them
from patrolling campuses and wearing the traditional blue uniform.

Some Black Lives Matter activists said the cuts did not go far enough.
But board members who voted for the policy changes say they are an
important first step in [reimagining the role of the police on school
grounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/schools-police-resource-officers.html).

“I’m thrilled to see us finally addressing the institutional racism in
how police departments were set up originally,” said Jackie Goldberg, a
board member who voted in favor of the changes. “It’s time to have these
discussions.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to the amendment, the $25 million will be redirected primarily
to schools with the highest proportion of Black students. The money will
allow those schools to hire social workers, counselors and safety aides
who can, in theory, reduce the need for police officers by preventing
violence before it happens.

“This is a big issue and it deserves big thinking, and one of the things
you do to get people to think big is you incentivize them,” Ms. Goldberg
said. “Removing some of the budget is a big
incentive.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Sgt. Rudy Perez, a spokesman for [the school district’s Police
Department](https://achieve.lausd.net/laspd), said the department would
have to reduce its presence at sporting events, as well as the number of
officers who [specialize in mental health
emergencies](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/health/police-mental-illness-crisis-intervention.html).

“That’s a massive hit for us,” Sergeant Perez said.

Sergeant Perez said the department had already focused much of its
resources on prevention while responding to serious threats to student
safety. During the 2019-20 school year, officers responded to more than
115,000 calls, including 95 robberies, 466 assaults and 155
mass-shooting threats.

“It’s not like we’re fighting to go out there and catch bad guys,”
Sergeant Perez said. “All we want to do is protect kids.”

Nick Melvoin, a board member who voted in favor of the amendment, said
that the district had “the best school police force in the nation,” but
that the changes were necessary to address systemic racism within the
district.

He also said that the Police Department — which represents about 0.8
percent of the school district’s roughly $8 billion budget — is one
small piece of a very large puzzle.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If the district wants to be serious about dismantling systemic racism
and supporting Black lives, we need to look at that other 99.2 percent,”
Mr. Melvoin said. “The focus on school police in particular is
important, but is insufficient.”

  - California has ample hospital beds, **Governor Newsom** said Monday.
    But some of the state’s worst outbreaks are occurring in counties
    with limited medical resources. **Imperial County,** on the Mexican
    border, has the state’s highest rate of Covid-19 cases. It has also
    sent at least 500 patients to hospitals outside its county lines, as
    far north as San Francisco and Sacramento.

  - The Broadway actor **Nick Cordero** was admitted to a hospital in
    Los Angeles on March 30 with the coronavirus. Mr. Cordero, 41, had
    no known pre-existing conditions. He died on Sunday. As more data
    emerges, serious cases of younger, healthy people like him are
    becoming less of an anomaly, doctors say. \[[The New York
    Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-nick-cordero-underlying-conditions.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)\]

  - What’s the definition of outdoor dining? **Dave Fansler**, the owner
    of **Pismo’s Coastal Grill** in Fresno, keeps the windows open in
    the restaurant and says he should qualify to stay open. The
    authorities disagree, saying it violates the governor’s orders, and
    have issued five citations. An employee at the restaurant tested
    positive for the virus but Mr. Fansler said “for sure” he did not
    catch it inside the restaurant. \[[Fresno

  - **Sara Cody**, the chief medical officer of **Santa Clara** County,
    proposed a reopening plan that would have allowed businesses like
    nail salons and gyms to reopen provided they followed a consistent
    set of rules around mask wearing and limits on the number of people
    allowed in indoor spaces at once. The state government nixed the
    plan. “They’ve granted variances to basically every other county
    that’s applied and they deny ours,” said **Jeff Smith**, Santa Clara
    County’s chief executive. “It makes no sense.” \[[Mercury

  - What do **Kanye West** and **Governor Newsom** have in common? Both
    have stakes in companies that received pandemic bailout assistance
    from the federal government. \[[S.F.
    Chronicle](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Latest-Treasury-identifies-recipients-of-15388720.php)\]

  - **Primex Farms** processes more than 60 million pounds of nuts at
    its plant in Wasco, in the San Joaquin Valley. One-fifth of the
    staff, around 80 workers, have been infected with Covid-19, along
    with 34 family members, including children, according to the
    **United Farm Workers**. The company says pistachio production was
    considered critical infrastructure.

  - Beach closures in **Los Angeles** and **Ventura** Counties sent some
    beachgoers south to **San Diego** County over the holiday weekend.
    But a San Diego lifeguard said crowds were lighter than previous
    years. “It wasn’t by any means record-setting crowds,” said **Lt.
    Rick Romero**. \[[San Diego
    Union-Tribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/local/story/2020-07-05/lifeguards-holiday-crowds-were-comparable-to-previous-fourth-of-july-weekends)\]

  - The **Sacramento** City Code requirement is spelled out plainly:
    “The song, ‘The Star-Spangled Banner,’ is recognized as the
    national anthem of the United States. When this music is played on a
    proper occasion during ceremonials, at the close of concerts,
    theatres, etc., all present shall stand at attention, facing the
    flag, or, if no flag is displayed, facing the music, and shall
    render the salute to the flag.” **Jack Lipeles**, a Long Beach
    jeweler, is challenging the law. \[[Sacramento
