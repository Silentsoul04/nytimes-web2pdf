\emph{First, Thomas Fuller with an update on the virus.}

Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that the state had stepped up a crackdown
on businesses flouting coronavirus-related restrictions, inspecting
nearly 6,000 businesses over the holiday weekend.

More than 50 businesses were cited, the governor said. ``The
overwhelming majority of people were doing the right thing,'' Mr. Newsom
said.

With infections surging in the state, the governor last week reversed
his reopening plan, closing down indoor operations of many businesses in
the hardest-hit counties.

The number of counties on a state ``watchlist'' of rising cases has
increased to 23 from 19 last week, the governor said Monday.

Testing has increased to more than 100,000 a day but the overall
positivity rate of those tested has also increased by more than a third,
reaching an average of 7.2 percent positive tests over the past week,
according to state data.

Hospitalizations are up by 50 percent in California over the past two
weeks, and hospitals are at capacity in some southern counties. But over
all California is using just 8 percent of its hospital beds for
coronavirus patients.

``We still have ample hospital capacity in our system,'' Mr. Newsom
said.

The California Capitol building was closed Monday as a number of people,
including one lawmaker, were confirmed to have contracted the
coronavirus. Autumn Burke, an assemblywoman representing Los Angeles,
\href{https://twitter.com/autumnrburke/status/1280191365976952832?s=20}{reported
on Twitter} that she tested positive for the virus on Saturday and had
no symptoms. The decision to close the Capitol was made a day earlier,
when the leadership of the Legislature learned that two other people who
work in the building were confirmed to have the virus.

Katie Talbot, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, said
the Capitol would be cleaned and sanitized during the closure.
``Additionally, to help protect health and safety at the Capitol,
legislative recess has been extended until further notice,'' she said.

\subsubsection{Los Angeles Board of Education Votes to Cut Police
Budget}\label{los-angeles-board-of-education-votes-to-cut-police-budget}}

\emph{Will Wright fills us in on a debating roiling the Los Angeles
Board of Education.}

Members of the Los Angeles Board of Education who voted last week to cut
33 percent of the district's police budget last week thought they had
reached a compromise.

But not everyone agreed.

A day after the vote, the chief resigned after less than a year on the
job, calling the \$25 million cut ``potentially life-threatening'' for
students and staff members. George McKenna, the only Black person on the
seven-member board, said those who voted for it were more interested in
appeasing the calls of activists than protecting students.

``It is extreme and unnecessary,'' Mr. McKenna said. ``I've never seen
anything so ill-conceived and carried out with so much enthusiasm by
elected officials.''

The budget amendment, which passed in a 4-3 vote, will force the school
district's Police Department to lay off about 65 of its roughly 330
sworn officers, according to a spokesman for the department.

New rules for police officers will also, at least temporarily, bar them
from patrolling campuses and wearing the traditional blue uniform.

Some Black Lives Matter activists said the cuts did not go far enough.
But board members who voted for the policy changes say they are an
important first step in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/schools-police-resource-officers.html}{reimagining
the role of the police on school grounds}.

``I'm thrilled to see us finally addressing the institutional racism in
how police departments were set up originally,'' said Jackie Goldberg, a
board member who voted in favor of the changes. ``It's time to have
these discussions.''

According to the amendment, the \$25 million will be redirected
primarily to schools with the highest proportion of Black students. The
money will allow those schools to hire social workers, counselors and
safety aides who can, in theory, reduce the need for police officers by
preventing violence before it happens.

``This is a big issue and it deserves big thinking, and one of the
things you do to get people to think big is you incentivize them,'' Ms.
Goldberg said. ``Removing some of the budget is a big incentive.''

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited

    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Sgt. Rudy Perez, a spokesman for
\href{https://achieve.lausd.net/laspd}{the school district's Police
Department}, said the department would have to reduce its presence at
sporting events, as well as the number of officers who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/health/police-mental-illness-crisis-intervention.html}{specialize
in mental health emergencies}.

``That's a massive hit for us,'' Sergeant Perez said.

Sergeant Perez said the department had already focused much of its
resources on prevention while responding to serious threats to student
safety. During the 2019-20 school year, officers responded to more than
115,000 calls, including 95 robberies, 466 assaults and 155
mass-shooting threats.

``It's not like we're fighting to go out there and catch bad guys,''
Sergeant Perez said. ``All we want to do is protect kids.''

Nick Melvoin, a board member who voted in favor of the amendment, said
that the district had ``the best school police force in the nation,''
but that the changes were necessary to address systemic racism within
the district.

He also said that the Police Department --- which represents about 0.8
percent of the school district's roughly \$8 billion budget --- is one
small piece of a very large puzzle.

``If the district wants to be serious about dismantling systemic racism
and supporting Black lives, we need to look at that other 99.2
percent,'' Mr. Melvoin said. ``The focus on school police in particular
is important, but is insufficient.''
