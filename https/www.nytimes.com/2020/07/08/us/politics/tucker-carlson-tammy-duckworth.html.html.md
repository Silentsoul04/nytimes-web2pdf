# Tammy Duckworth Confronts Nativist Smears From Tucker Carlson

</div>

Ms. Duckworth, an Illinois senator who is Thai-American and lost both
legs fighting in Iraq, has been the target of two nights of attacks from
the Fox News host; some were amplified by President Trump.

[Senator Tammy
Duckworth](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-vice-president-joe-biden.html)
of Illinois, a Thai-American Democrat who lost both of her legs fighting
in the Iraq war and is now a potential vice-presidential nominee, was
targeted with nativist smears for the second night in a row on Tuesday
by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson.

Mr. Carlson, whose broadsides have been amplified on Twitter by
[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html),<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>attacked Ms. Duckworth in his monologue for suggesting during a
Sunday interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” that it was worth
discussing the value of removing monuments of George Washington, the
nation’s slave-owning first president.

On Tuesday night Mr. Carlson labeled both Ms. Duckworth, [who was born
in Thailand to a Thai mother of Chinese descent and a white American
veteran
father](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-vice-president-joe-biden.html),
and the Somali-born Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, “vandals”
who hate the United States because they have called attention to its
historical racism and inequities.

“There are many of us here who do like this country,” Mr. Carlson said,
as a graphic on the screen read, “We have to fight to preserve our
nation & heritage.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We live here,” he said. Then, [adopting language used for a century by
those aiming to restrict the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/sunday-review/coronavirus-asian-racism.html)
to people of Northern and Western European ancestry, he added: “We don’t
want to destroy it. We have every right to fight to preserve our nation
and our heritage and our
culture.

“And when vandals like Tammy Duckworth and Ilhan Omar tell us that we’re

Mr. Carlson also called Ms. Duckworth a “moron” on Tuesday night, saying
that to people like her, “Washington is just some old white guy who
needs to be erased.”

He added: “Let’s tear down our statues, rename our capital city Sharpton
or Mandela and let the revolution continue. Tammy Duckworth is not a
child, at least not technically; she is a sitting United States
senator.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Duckworth’s ancestors served in the military as far back as the
American Revolution, a fact that is [supported by genealogical
records](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-dig-tammy-duckworths-family-has-served-in-the-military-for-centuries)
and that [she pointed out in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/TammyforIL/status/1280595475079598085)
responding to the Trump campaign, which had echoed Mr. Carlson’s attacks
in a statement.

“My family fought for our nation’s independence alongside George
Washington & I’m a proud member of
[@TodaysDAR](https://twitter.com/TodaysDAR),” she said, referring to the
Daughters of the American Revolution. She urged the president to “focus
on ending
[\#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click) &
standing up to Putin instead of wasting time trying to distract people
from your failures.”

And VoteVets, the liberal veterans organization that has pushed for Mr.
Biden to choose Ms. Duckworth as his running mate, on Wednesday morning
[posted a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rml8P9pXmXw) calling
Ms. Duckworth “tough as hell” and accusing Mr. Trump of being scared to
run against her.

“He sicced Tucker Carlson on a suicide mission to take her down,” the
video’s narrator says.

Mr. Carlson’s comments in recent months have drawn growing criticism
even as his ratings have remained strong — the best on his network in
June. Advertisers, under pressure to disassociate themselves from his
show, [have fled to other Fox News
programming](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/media/tucker-carlson-advertisers-ratings.html).

Nativist attacks on Democratic women of color in Congress are hardly new
for Mr. Carlson and Mr. Trump. Ms. Omar was one of four Democratic women
who were the target of “[send her
back](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/trump-send-her-back-ilhan-omar.html)”
chants at a Trump rally in North Carolina nearly a year ago. She is
also, along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,
featured in scores of Republican television ads and political mailers as
examples of what the party’s candidates are fighting against.

Former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
who is weighing adding Ms. Duckworth to his presidential ticket,
defended her during an online fund-raising event with her Tuesday night.

Apparently referring to Mr. Trump’s sharing the clip of Mr. Carlson’s
Monday night monologue, Mr. Biden said: “I can’t tell you how I felt
today when I heard the president of the United States, Donald Trump,
questioning your patriotism. I found it virtually disgusting,
sickening.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He added, “It’s a reflection of the depravity of what’s going on in the
White House right now.”

Ms. Duckworth did not address Mr. Carlson during the Biden fund-raiser,
but on Twitter on Monday night [she invited
him](https://twitter.com/SenDuckworth/status/1280313123887603712) to
“walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not I love
America.”
