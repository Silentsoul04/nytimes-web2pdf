The racial justice protests that have spread across the United States
(and the world) in recent weeks have had
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/arts/music/fivio-foreign-big-drip-brooklyn-drill.html}{many
soundtracks}. But what's striking about Run the Jewels' music is how it
can feel like it anticipated the current moment.

The partnership of Killer Mike and El-P has been active for just under a
decade. Since its 2013 debut album, Run the Jewels has been making heady
hip-hop that's paranoiac, dystopian, anti-government and pro-justice.
Its fourth album, ``RTJ4,'' was released in early June.

On this week's Popcast, a play-by-play of how Run the Jewels went from
an idiosyncratic late-career lark to the most politically timely hip-hop
act of the day, and how the freedoms of middle age can be even more
powerful than the freedoms of youth.
