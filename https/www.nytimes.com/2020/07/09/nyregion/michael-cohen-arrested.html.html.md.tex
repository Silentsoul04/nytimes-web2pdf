Book}\label{michael-cohen-returned-to-jail-in-dispute-over-trump-book}}

President Trump's former personal lawyer balked at signing an agreement
not to publish a book while serving his sentence at home, his legal
adviser said.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-book.html}{Michael
D. Cohen}, President Trump's onetime lawyer and fixer, was in good
spirits on Thursday when he arrived at a Manhattan federal courthouse,
where he expected to complete routine paperwork related to his home
confinement amid the coronavirus pandemic.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/nyregion/michael-cohen-donald-trump-prison.html}{Mr.
Cohen}, who was released from prison in May on a medical furlough, was
stunned when probation officers asked him to sign a document that would
have barred him from speaking to reporters or publishing a book during
the rest of his sentence, his legal adviser said.

Mr. Cohen, believing the agreement violated his First Amendment rights,
refused to sign it, the adviser, Lanny Davis, said. Less than two hours
later, federal marshals stepped out of an elevator with handcuffs and
took Mr. Cohen back into custody.

Mr. Cohen's return to jail was the latest twist in a case whose dizzying
ups and downs have prolonged the legal woes of a man who once said he
would take a bullet for Mr. Trump and later implicated the president in
federal crimes.

In a statement, the federal Bureau of Prisons said that Mr. Cohen had
been returned to jail after he ``refused the conditions of his home
confinement.''

As a federal inmate, the bureau said in a separate statement, Mr. Cohen
must comply with bureau policies, including requirements that he consent
to electronic monitoring and obtain approval for any media interviews.

Last week, Mr. Cohen said on Twitter that he anticipated releasing a
book in late September. Mr. Davis said on Thursday that the book was
ready for publication and would recount Mr. Cohen's experiences working
for Mr. Trump for years.

Mr. Cohen
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{testified
before Congress last year} that he had previously turned down a deal
worth around \$750,000 to sell a book about his time working for Mr.
Trump that was tentatively titled, ``Trump Revolution, From the Tower to
the White House, Understanding Donald J. Trump.''

As part of his home confinement, probation officers asked Mr. Cohen on
Thursday to agree to eight conditions, including ``no engagement of any
kind with the media, including print, TV, film, books, or any other form
of media/news,'' according to a copy of the document obtained by The New
York Times.

The purpose of the prohibition, the document said, was to ``avoid
glamorizing or bringing publicity to your status as a sentenced inmate
serving a custodial term in the community.''

Mr. Cohen pointed out to the officers that he had spoken to reporters
while he was in prison, Mr. Davis said.

After Mr. Cohen refused to sign the agreement, the probation officers
said they would try to work out a resolution, Mr. Davis said.

Mr. Cohen and another of his lawyers, Jeffrey Levine, waited about 90
minutes, Mr. Davis said. Three federal marshals then arrived and,
without warning, began to take Mr. Cohen into custody.

``He had the rug pulled out from under him,'' Mr. Levine said in an
interview.

At that point, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Cohen relented and agreed to sign the
document to avoid returning to jail. The marshals continued to take him
into custody anyway, Mr. Davis said, with one of them saying, ``It's out
of our hands.''

A spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service did not immediately respond to
a request for comment.

Mr. Cohen was brought to a federal detention facility in the city,
according to two people briefed on his legal status.

Mr. Cohen, who
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes.com\%2F2018\%2F08\%2F21\%2Fnyregion\%2Fmichael-cohen-guilty-plea-trump-takeaways.html}{pleaded
guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes}, was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/nyregion/michael-cohen-coronavirus-prison-release.html}{released
from federal prison on May 20 on a medical furlough} and allowed to
return to his home. He had asked to be released because, he said, he had
medical conditions that might be worsened by the virus's spread in
prison.

It was expected that after finishing the medical furlough, he would
serve the balance of his sentence under home confinement, abiding by a
strict set of rules. But a final decision on that had not been made,
officials said.

Before his release, Mr. Cohen had been serving a three-year sentence at
a minimum-security camp next to a federal prison and detention center in
Otisville, N.Y., about 75 miles northwest of New York City. He was
scheduled to complete his sentence in November 2021, according to the
prisons bureau.

The federal crimes that Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to were connected to a
scheme to pay hush money to two women --- a former adult film actress
and a former Playboy model --- who claimed they had affairs with Mr.
Trump before he was president.

During his guilty plea in August 2018, Mr. Cohen pointed the finger at
the president, telling the court that Mr. Trump had directed him to make
the hush payments for the purpose of influencing the 2016 election. Mr.
Trump has denied the allegations.

During his furlough from prison, Mr. Cohen was photographed on July 2
having dinner at a sidewalk table outside Le Bilboquet, a French
restaurant near his Park Avenue apartment, according to The New York
Post,
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/07/03/michael-cohen-eating-at-nyc-restaurant-could-land-him-back-in-prison/}{which
published the photograph.}

The authorities did not contact Mr. Cohen after the episode and he did
not believe it violated the terms of his release, Mr. Davis said.

Ben Protess and Benjamin Weiser contributed reporting.
