As coronavirus lockdowns crept across the globe this winter and spring,
an unusual sound fell over the world’s metropolises: the hush of streets
that were suddenly, blessedly free of cars. City dwellers reported
hearing [bird song, wind and the rustling of
leaves](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/22/upshot/coronavirus-quiet-city-noise.html).
(Along with, in New York City, the intermittent screams of sirens.)

You could smell the absence of cars, too. From [New
York](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-corionavirus-environmental-benefit-unlikely-to-last-20200406-vx5v3dn6evhbhdjdmarcyihleu-story.html)
to [Los Angeles](https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/air-quality-covid/)
to New Delhi, air pollution plummeted, and the soupy, exhaust-choked
haze over the world’s dirtiest cities [lifted to reveal brilliant blue
skies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/11/positively-alpine-disbelief-air-pollution-falls-lockdown-coronavirus).

Cars took a break from killing people, too. [About 10
pedestrians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/nyregion/nyc-deaths-pedestrian-cycling.html)
die on New York City’s streets in an ordinary month. Under lockdown, the
city went a record [two months without a single pedestrian
fatality](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/us/new-york-city-pedestrian-deaths/index.html).
In California, vehicle collisions plummeted 50 percent, reducing
accidents resulting in injuries or death by [about 6,000 per

As the roads became freer of cars, they grew full of possibility.
[Rollerblading](https://www.ktvu.com/news/rollerskaters-rejoice-throwback-activity-has-revival-during-pandemic)
and
[skateboarding](https://shop-eat-surf.com/2020/03/skateboard-sales-jump-during-crisis/)
have come back into fashion. Sales of
[bicycles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/bike-shortage-coronavirus.html)
and [electric
bikes](https://electrek.co/2020/05/01/electric-bike-sales-skyrocket-during-lockdown/)
have skyrocketed.

But there is a catch: Cities are beginning to cautiously open back up
again, and people are wondering how they’re going to get in to work.
Many are worried about the spread of the virus on public transit. Are
cars our only option? How will we find space for all of them?

In much of Manhattan, the average speed of traffic before the pandemic
had fallen to 7 miles per hour. In Midtown, it was less than 5 m.p.h.
That’s only slightly faster than walking and slower than riding a bike.
Will traffic soon be worse than ever?

Not if we choose another path.  

Rather than stumble back into car dependency, cities can begin to undo
[their worst
mistake](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/02/29/the-car-century-was-a-mistake-its-time-to-move-on/):
[giving
up](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/was-the-automotive-era-a-terrible-mistake)
so much of their land to the automobile.

The pandemic should not stop us. There is [little
evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/fear-transit-bad-cities/612979/)
that public transit is responsible for the spread of the coronavirus in
New York or elsewhere; some cities with heavily used transit systems,
including Hong Kong, have been able to avoid terrible tolls from the
virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If riders wear face masks — and if there are enough subway cars, buses,
bike lanes and pedestrian paths for people to avoid intense overcrowding
— transit might be no less safe than cars, in terms of the risk of the
spread of disease. [In all other measures of
safety,](https://mobilitylab.org/2016/09/08/transit-10-times-safer-driving-makes-communities-safer-says-new-apta-report/)
transit is far safer than cars.

What’s that you say? There *aren’t* enough buses in your city to avoid
overcrowding, and they’re too slow, anyway? Pedestrian space is
*already* hard to find? Well, right. That’s car dependency. And it’s
exactly why cities need to plan for a future of fewer cars, a future in
which owning an automobile, even an electric one, is neither the only
way nor the best way to get around town.

A few weeks ago, I began talking to Vishaan Chakrabarti, a former New
York City urban-planning official and the founder of Practice for
Architecture and Urbanism, a Manhattan-based architecture firm. Like
[other
urbanists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/opinion/pandemic-automobile-cities.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage),
Chakrabarti believes that the pandemic has created an opportunity for
New York and other cities to reduce their reliance on cars.

Manhattan, already one of the most car-free places in the country, is
the best place to start. Chakrabarti’s firm, known as PAU, had been
working on an intricate proposal to show what it might look and feel
like to live in a city liberated from cars, to show how much better life
in New York might be with one simple change: Most cars would be banished
from Manhattan.

PAU’s proposal would not ban all motor vehicles, just privately owned
cars. There would still be delivery trucks, paratransit, emergency
vehicles, and taxicabs and rideshare cars, if you needed them.

But private cars account for so many of Manhattan’s vehicles that
banning them would instantly improve life for just about everyone who
lives and works in New York.

You already know what’s terrible about cars: They’re dirty. They’re
dangerous. They’re expensive to buy and maintain, and environmentally
hazardous to produce and operate. Automobiles kill around 90,000
Americans every year
— [about 40,000](https://ohsonline.com/articles/2019/02/18/nsc-motor-vehicle-deaths.aspx#:~:text=National%20Safety%20Council.-,NSC%20estimates%20that%20in%202018%2C%2040%2C000%20people%20died%20in%20car,percent%20decrease%20from%202017%20figures.)
in car accidents, and an estimated 50,000 more from long-term exposure
to [air pollution emitted by
cars](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231013004548).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Chakrabarti is among a group of urbanists who’ve been calling
attention to a less-discussed problem with cars. Automobiles are not
just dangerous and bad for the environment; they are also profoundly
wasteful of the land around us, taking up way too much physical space to
transport too few people. It’s geometry.

In most American cities, wherever you look, you will see [a landscape
constructed primarily for the movement and storage of
automobiles](https://oldurbanist.blogspot.com/2011/12/we-are-25-looking-at-street-area.html),
not for the enjoyment of people: endless wide boulevards and freeways
for cars to move swiftly; each road lined with parking spaces for cars
at rest; retail establishments ringed with spots for cars; houses built
around garages for cars; and a gas station, for cars to feed, on every
other corner.

In the most car-dependent cities, the amount of space devoted to
automobiles reaches truly ridiculous levels. In Los Angeles, for
instance, land for parking [exceeds the entire land area of
Manhattan](https://la.curbed.com/2018/11/30/18119646/los-angeles-parking-lots-total-size-development),
enough space to house almost a million more people at Los Angeles’s
prevailing density.

This isn’t a big deal in the parts of America where space is seemingly
endless. But in the most populated cities, physical space is just about
the most precious resource there is. The land value of Manhattan alone
is [estimated to top $1.7
trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/manhattan-s-land-value-is-an-incredible-1-74-trillion).
Why are we giving so much of it to cars?

Without cars, Manhattan’s streets could give priority to more equitable
and accessible ways of getting around, including an extensive system of
bike “superhighways” and [bus rapid
transit](https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/)
— a bus system with dedicated lanes in the roadway, creating a service
that approaches the capacity, speed and efficiency of the subway, at a
fraction of the cost.

Eliminating most cars in Manhattan would also significantly clean up the
air for the entire region. It would free up space for new housing and
create hundreds of acres of new parks and pedestrian promenades,
improving the fundamental health, beauty and livability of America’s
largest metropolis.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There have been
[several](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/banning-cars-from-manhattan)
[proposals](https://ny.curbed.com/2019/10/3/20896837/nyc-traffic-history-pedestrian-cars)
to ban cars in Manhattan, and the city has been working on a system to
impose a toll on cars south of 60th Street. (This congestion-pricing
project was scheduled to start early next year, but it has been [delayed
by the
pandemic](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-congestion-pricing-on-hold-20200422-idyclofw4nbnnbc3ftbhjpjfpm-story.html).)

What distinguishes PAU’s proposal is its visual appeal. Chakrabarti says
his firm aimed to show, at a street level, how much better life without
cars might be for most New Yorkers. “This is an amazing way to live,” he
said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Any proposal to ban cars had better look amazing, because in America,
the automobile has never been just a way of getting from A to B. More
than a century of car ads and a good deal of hagiographic cultural
propaganda has done a job on a lot of us. For many Americans, cars are
not just a consumer product but a rite of passage, a symbol of national
pride, and an expression of liberty nearly as fundamental as anything
promised in the Bill of Rights.

I know, because I, too, have long loved cars. I love them viscerally,
the way a dog loves a bone, or an Instagrammer loves a sunset, and I am
as surprised as anyone to be calling for their eradication from cities.

As a teenager growing up in Southern California, America’s center of car
culture, I spent endless hours lusting after the vehicles in car
magazines; these days my appetites are whetted digitally, with
[ridiculously detailed car-review
videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsqjHFMB_JYTaEnf_vmTNqg) on
YouTube. My current ride is a car that only European automobile nerds
would appreciate: an apple-red Volkswagen Golf R, a “hot hatch” that
does 0 to 60 [in under five environmentally disastrous
seconds](https://youtu.be/meSVfbFEwH8), which I bought only because
driving it very fast touched me in unmentionable places.

Yet when I got my speedy ride, I quickly realized it was kind of
pointless, because most of the time there’s too much traffic where I
live to go any faster than a golf cart. This is the drab reality of
driving you’ll never see in car ads — a daily, rage-inducing grind of
traffic, parking and shelling out to fill up; an option that many people
choose not for any love affair with cars, but often because driving is
the least-inconvenient way of getting around where they live and work.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I was receptive to Chakrabarti’s proposal because in the last few years,
I’ve grown increasingly disillusioned about America’s tolerance for the
public health and environmental damage caused by cars, not to mention
the frustrations of commuting by car. And I’m losing hope that the car
industry will be able to fix the damage anytime soon.

I’ve spent much of the last decade watching Silicon Valley take on that
industry, and I once had great expectations that techies would soon make
cars substantially cleaner, safer, more efficient, more convenient and
cheaper to operate.

But many of their innovations are turning into a bust — or, at the very
least, are not making enough of a difference. Uber and Lyft once
promised to reduce traffic through car-pooling. In fact, [ride-hailing
services have greatly worsened
traffic](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756945/uber-lyft-tnc-vmt-traffic-congestion-study-fehr-peers)
in many big cities.

Tesla turned the electric car into a mainstream object of lust — but
most of the rest of the auto industry is struggling [to get consumers to
switch
over](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-competitors-find-that-going-electric-has-its-own-set-of-problems-2019-11-04)
from gas, so it could take [15 years or
more](http://energyfuse.org/americas-aging-vehicles-delay-rate-fleet-turnover/)
to electrify America’s entire fleet. The largest automakers still make
[most of their
profits](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/business/suv-sedan-detroit-fight.html)
from
[dangerous](https://www.curbed.com/2018/9/27/17909270/pedestrian-deaths-suv-car-design),
gas-guzzling S.U.V.s that will be on the roads for [years to
come](http://energyfuse.org/americas-aging-vehicles-delay-rate-fleet-turnover/),
and automakers continue to [mount aggressive legal and lobbying
campaigns](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-31/epa-trump-emissions-lawsuit)
against mileage standards.

Electric cars are no environmental panacea — they are more efficient
than gas-powered cars, but they still consume [a lot of resources to
produce](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-electric-car-cobalt-battery-20180222-story.html),
and if they result in people driving more, [they may not greatly reduce
overall
emissions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-23/electric-vehicles-alone-won-t-stop-climate-change).

Then there’s the accident-free, self-driving car — the auto industry’s
holy grail. Don’t hold your breath: The dream is [proving to be far
trickier](https://www.investors.com/news/self-driving-cars-hit-delays-driverless-cars-timeline/)
than many carmakers imagined, and [cars will remain reliably
deadly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/04/opinion/self-driving-cars-safety.html)
for years to come.

When he wanted to underscore the unexpected nature of invention, Steve
Jobs was fond of using a version of a line widely attributed to Henry
Ford: “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me,
‘A faster horse\!’” Silicon Valley’s collective quest for a better car
has begun to look similarly narrow: What if Ubers and Teslas are just
faster horses — and what if the real way to revolutionize transportation
is to think beyond the car entirely?

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A more straightforward campaign against the automobile has been winning
results around the world. This is a movement by urban planners,
community groups and far-thinking elected officials to reduce the amount
of land cars occupy.

The effort has resulted in the wresting of major tracts of land away
from cars in some of the world’s largest cities. Late in Michael
Bloomberg’s tenure as mayor, [Janette
Sadik-Khan](http://www.jsadikkhan.com/), the transportation
commissioner, pedestrianized large sections of New York City, [including
Times
Square](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/19/15358234/times-square-snohetta-before-after-photos),
and created [hundreds of miles of new bike
lanes](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20006501/this-woman-built-400-miles-of-bike-lanes-in-new-york-city/).
Last year, the city banned cars from part of 14th Street in Manhattan,
resulting in [faster crosstown bus
service](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2019/10/18/14th-street-busway-is-making-trips-faster--encouraging-more-trips).

[Market Street in San Francisco has been turned into a car-free
promenade](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Car-free-Market-What-happens-to-the-side-14999923.php).
And in Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo has made taking away land from cars the
centerpiece of her politics, and it’s working. Traffic in Paris has
fallen by [40 percent in the last
decade](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-19/how-paris-shifted-away-from-the-car);
last month, [Hidalgo handily won

It’s good urban policy, but it’s also a matter of equity and justice.
Chakrabarti often refers to a concept he calls “[street
equity](https://twitter.com/vishaannyca/status/1180833269367136264).”

Imagine you’d like to transport 50 people from one end of Manhattan to
the other. If you were to send them by bus, you could stuff everyone in
a single bus car — taking up around 450 square feet of road space, about
the size of a tiny studio apartment. But if you were going to send 50
people by automobile, you’d need a lot more road. For 50 people, each
driving alone, you’d need 2,750 square feet of space
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>basically a McMansion of
roadway to transport 50 fat cats.

And cars take up space even while they’re not in use. They need to be
parked, which consumes yet more space on the sides of streets or in
garages. Cars take up a lot of space even when they’re just

Add it all up and you get a huge number: In addition to the 2,450 acres
of roadway in Manhattan, nearly 1,000 more acres — an area about the
size of Central Park — is occupied by parking garages, gas stations,
carwashes, car dealerships and auto repair shops. There is three times
more roadway for cars on Manhattan as there is for bikes. There’s more
road for cars than there is sidewalk for pedestrians.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The amount of space devoted to cars in Manhattan is not just wasteful,
but, in a deeper sense, also unfair to the millions of New Yorkers who
have no need for cars.

[More than
half](http://blog.tstc.org/2017/04/21/car-free-new-york-city/) of the
city’s households do not own a car, and of those who do, most do not use
them for commuting. Of the 1.6 million commuters who come into Manhattan
every weekday (or, who did, before the virus), more than 80 percent make
the trip via public transit, mostly trains and buses, or by walking or
biking. Only around 12 percent of daily commuters get to the island by
car.

“It really does feel like there is a silent majority that doesn’t get
any real say in how the public space is used,” Chakrabarti told me.

New York’s drivers are essentially being given enormous tracts of land
for their own pleasure and convenience. To add to the overall misery of
the situation, though, even the drivers are not especially happy about
the whole deal, because despite all the roadway they’ve been given,
they’re still stuck in gridlock.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And they most likely will be forever, because cars are not just greedy
for physical space, they’re insatiable. There is even a term for the
phenomenon: “induced demand,” which holds that [the more land you give
to cars, the more attractive driving becomes, leading to more
traffic](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/),
leading to more roads — an unwinnable cycle that ends with every inch of
our cities paved over.

In that sense, even drivers should have an interest in fostering
alternatives to driving.

“The one thing we know for sure, because we understand geometry, is that
if everyone drives, nobody moves,” Brent Toderian, the former chief
planner for the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, told me. Even if
you’re a committed daily driver, “it’s in your best interest for
walking, biking and public transit to be as attractive as possible for
everyone else — because that means you’re going to be able to drive
easier.”

Indeed, PAU’s plan bears this out. Banning private cars on Manhattan
would reduce traffic by as much as 20 percent on routes that start and
end within New York’s other boroughs — that is, in places where cars
would still be allowed — according to an analysis by traffic engineers
at Buro Happold, a consulting firm that studied PAU’s plan.

How would people get around in a Manhattan without private cars?

Mostly on foot, by bus or by subway; often on a bicycle, e-bike,
scooter, or some future light, battery-powered “micromobility” device
(things like [one-wheeled, self-balancing
skateboards](https://www.wired.com/story/one-wheeled-vehicles-micromobility/));
and sometimes, in a pinch, in a taxi or Uber.

Some of these may not sound like your cup of tea. Buses are slow,
bicycles are dangerous, and you wouldn’t be caught dead on a scooter,
let alone a one-wheeled skateboard. But that’s only because you’re
imagining these other ways of getting around as they exist today, in the
world of cars.

Cars make every other form of transportation a little bit terrible. The
absence of cars, then, exerts its own kind of magic — take private cars
away, and every other way of getting around gets much better.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Under PAU’s plan, road traffic in a car-free Manhattan would fall by
about 60 percent. The absence of cars would allow pedestrians, buses and
bikes to race across New York at unheard-of speeds. Today, a bus trip
from uptown to downtown — for instance, from Harlem to City Hall — takes
an hour and 48 minutes. With the sort of rapid bus system PAU imagines,
and without cars in the way, the same trek would take 35 minutes.

On the Manhattan Bridge, for example, there are seven lanes for cars.

A new layout would replace four of them with bus lanes, paths for

ride-share vehicles. The middle lane of traffic would switch direction

The public health effects would ripple across the region, too. The most
polluted air in New York [hangs over the Bronx and
Queens](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2019/06/Inequitable-Exposure-to-Vehicle-Pollution-NY.pdf),
in communities largely populated by immigrants and people of color. New
York City has some of the dirtiest air in the nation, estimated to
[cause 3,000 premature
deaths](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/eode/eode-air-quality-impact.pdf)
annually.

Among other ailments, long-term exposure to polluted air is thought to
[increase the deadliness of
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html).
Much of the unhealthy air is caused by traffic sitting idle on the roads
leading to Manhattan. Buro Happold estimates that PAU’s plan would lead
to a 50 percent reduction in toxic air pollution in Manhattan, and a 20
percent reduction in the other boroughs.

Given how completely automobiles rule most cities, calling for their
outright banishment can sound almost ludicrous. (We can’t even get some
people to agree to wear masks to stop the spread of a devastating
pandemic.)

Instead of fighting a war on cars, Toderian told me, urbanists should
fight a war on car *dependency* — on cities that leave residents with
few choices other than cars. Alleviating car dependency can improve
commutes for everyone in a city.

Chakrabarti acknowledges the political risks of trying to ban private
cars. But Manhattan, he points out, is a special place. With a
population that is already quite used to getting along without cars, the
island is just about the only place in the country where you could even
consider calling for the banishment of cars. Manhattan could be a place
for all of America to witness how reducing an urban area’s reliance on
cars can lead to a better life.

At the moment, many of the most intractable challenges faced by
America’s urban centers stem from the same cause — a lack of
accessible physical space. We live in a time of epidemic homelessness.
There’s a national housing affordability crisis caused by an extreme
shortage of places to live. And now there’s a contagion that thrives on
indoor overcrowding.

Given these threats, how can American cities continue to justify wasting
such enormous tracts of land on death machines?
