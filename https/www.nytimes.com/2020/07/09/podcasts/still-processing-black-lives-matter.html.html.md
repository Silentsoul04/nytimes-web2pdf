## So Y’all Finally Get It

### Hosted by Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham. Produced by Hans Buetow and edited by Sara Sarasohn.

#### America just won’t let us rest.

Thursday, July 9th, 2020

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Look, I know that we said we were on break until the fall. But —

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    — so much happened, we just had to reunite and talk about it. So the
    first thing we did was a live event for New York Times Events. And
    we did it over video call a few weeks ago. And we wanted to share an
    excerpt of that conversation with our listeners, for those who might
    have missed it.

  - wesley morris  
    Right. And that day we were talking about empathy and hope. And
    those are still things that we’re going to continue to talk about,
    and things we’ve always talked about. And a lot of what we were
    doing with each other was the actual real time working out of our
    thoughts and our feelings. So it’s going to sound like we’re
    unplugged, basically, and just thinking through this without the —
    you know, all of the bells and whistles of a regular episode.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s — we were where we were. And because we’re us, we realize
    there’s more to do. So good news, I guess? I don’t know. We’ve got
    two more episodes coming in the next two weeks. We dive into our
    thoughts, our feelings, and continue to process everything that’s
    happening in America right now.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, that is great news. It’s great news\!

  - jenna wortham  
    (LAUGHS) Yeah. So please enjoy the first part of our midsummer
    trilogy, and stay tuned for more.

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, thank you to everyone for joining us today. I’m Jenna Wortham.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m Wesley Morris. We’re two New York Times writers, stuck in our
    houses.

  - jenna wortham  
    And this is “Still Processing.”

\[laughter\]

\[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, we’re here today — we’re gathered here today —

  - wesley morris  
    Oh my goodness.

  - jenna wortham  
    — because this country won’t quit. It really won’t quit. I mean, I’m
    — listen. I was in the park today having lunch and with a friend,
    socially distant, and just taking a break offline. One of my
    meditation healer friends — we were just really taking in the air.
    And, you know, it’s in New York now — it’s as common as hearing a
    siren or anything else. You hear the cheers of “Black lives matter.”
    And it brings me to tears. I was running a little late for this. I
    stopped to watch the procession, and it was actually children. It
    was a a ton right in the middle of Bed-Stuy saying “Black kids
    matter.” And I was just openly weeping. That symbolism — I mean,
    that’s not symbolism. That’s, like, policy in action. You know?
    That, to me, is a political action that’s so important. And I’m
    like, yes, this is what it means to be alive right now in this
    moment in 2020. But I don’t trust it just because you’ve taped up a
    Black power fist onto the front or your business or on the front of
    your home. It’s got to look more — it just has to look more dynamic
    than that. Y’all got to show us more. And it needs to be more than
    this because this is a global problem. And it’s not just enough to
    put a banner on it. The banner is not a Band-Aid.

  - wesley morris  
    Right. Now, I agree. But OK, so what do you think — because I
    actually — I’ve been thinking a lot about what — the question is
    always, where do we go from here? There are some of America’s great
    thinkers wrestling with this question. And there’s no answer. Right?
    I mean, there’s no one answer. But I think we should ask for
    everything. There’s not a thing we shouldn’t be asking for.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, shoot the moon? I want to shoot Saturn. This is the moment
    where there is no crazy thing to ask. Because if you know anything
    about what’s happened in this country, everything that’s led to this
    moment is the crazy thing.

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And asking to undo it is the only sane thing we can do. And I feel
    like asking for, asking for as much as we can get. Because, I’ve
    said this to you, and I’m just going to — I’m going to float this
    out here. I don’t know. This is not really truly tested material.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, OK.

  - wesley morris  
    But it is really important to think about what it means to treat all
    Americans like Black people. And white people, either seeing or
    experiencing what it’s like to be at the police — at the hands of
    the police, at the whims of the police in some cases —

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. That’s right.

  - wesley morris  
    — I think that the — let everybody go to a crappy public school or
    an underfunded public school in this country that is actively,
    actively starved of resources, actively neglected. The problem in
    this entire situation has always been a matter of empathy. It’s
    always been not being able to imagine that the people undergoing all
    this unequal treatment were actual people or that they didn’t
    deserve that.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    Because what was happening with these other shootings before?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right. Right.

  - wesley morris  
    There would always be somebody who would have some extenuating
    circumstances they didn’t know anything about. And I think there’s —
    
    one of the things that’s been happening the whole time was the
    extenuating circumstance or extenuating excuse: “Well, they must
    have done something.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Right. Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Michael Brown must have done something. Eric Garner must have done
    something. But that question of what they did is immediately —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — the cost can’t be their life for selling loose cigarettes.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. So it’s like, the next question is, so what? Right?

  - wesley morris  
    Right.

  - jenna wortham  
    So what? It doesn’t give the police free license just to kill
    people, right, just to shoot people at will or all the other things
    they do. But, yeah, I agree. I’m listening.

  - wesley morris  
    So I’m saying that what we’ve got right now is the closing of an
    empathy gap. And some of that is just pure empirical experience on
    behalf of some of these people who were marching alongside Black
    people.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    And it’s the experience of understanding — and I don’t know —
    there’s no way to quantify this, but I wonder how far out the
    empathy goes. Right? And this is why I’m saying there’s no thing
    that should not be demanded right now, in some ways.

  - jenna wortham  
    But my asterisk, to your point, is that there is an empathy gap
    that’s being closed. And I think I’m really urging for
    watchfulness around how much empathy there is, and kind of where
    it’s being directed. Right? Because the world and the country is
    outraged about George Floyd. And that same vector of outrage and
    anger is not being directed towards what happened to Breonna Taylor,
    what happened to Tony McDade. And so what is interesting to me right
    now, and what I’m really thinking through, is how do we make this
    moment as intersectional as possible and remind everyone that all
    Black lives matter? Right? Women matter. Queer people matter. Trans
    Black people matter. You know? And I think that it’s been tough
    because it’s mixed. Right? There is a lot of empathy around Mr.
    Floyd. But is that empathy being shared for Miss Taylor? Right? Is
    that empathy being shared for Miss Dior, who was attacked in
    Minneapolis as well? And so it needs to be inclusive. It has to be
    inclusive. Because, if not, then we’re just perpetuating the same
    systemic, misogynistic, patriarchical problems.
    
    There has to be enough empathy for all of us. It cannot just be
    about cis Black men, right, who are suffering at the hands of state
    violence. It has to be about everybody. So that’s kind of where I
    get a little bit tripped up. But I do want to say — OK, so as you’ve
    been talking I’ve been thinking. And something that is meaningful
    for me that I’ve seen, because I do think that cultural — cultural
    shifts do shape societal shifts. I mean, absolutely. And so small
    shifts like Legos, right, saying we’re not going to do any more
    police officer Legos — “COPS” coming off the air — although, I think
    that damage has been done. That’s a long overdue thing. Yeah. I
    think that it will be really interesting to see, well, how are
    police officers represented on all the “S.V.U.” shows going forward?
    How are police officers represented from here on out? I think that’s
    actually more interesting, to me. But the fact that those shifts are
    starting to happen feel important. Because, like you say, it’s like,
    we do get these — we get these images about what law and order mean
    imprinted into our minds. And to sort of start having some of that
    untangling happen in real time feels — I do think that’s what I feel
    strongly about.

  - wesley morris  
    I guess the reason I’m exasperated by some of these things is
    because they’re not even symbolic. They’re merely cosmetic. Right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And I think NASCAR vowing to purge its races of Confederate flag
    imagery is an interesting and meaningful symbolic change that I
    don’t see being enforced. To the degree that I’m a journalist at
    all —

  - jenna wortham  
    (LAUGHS)

  - wesley morris  
    — there’s a little tiny part of me that wants to put on a little
    disguise and just go down and just check things out. You can purge
    all the Confederate flags you want. You know what you can’t purge?
    My fear of going into a NASCAR race at Talladega.

  - jenna wortham  
    That very valid fear, my friend. Don’t you dare go. I will not let
    you go. But that’s the thing. It’s like, I don’t like how we’re
    being asked to gauge the sincerity of these decisions. And it feels
    like unfair labor that I have to do. It doesn’t feel valid or
    sincere at all to me.

  - wesley morris  
    But you and I went on the “CBS Morning Show” after — I don’t know if
    you remember this.

  - jenna wortham  
    Are you kidding me? Of course. Anyway, go on. Yes, we went on “CBS
    This Morning” after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. The question was, what kind of work do we need to do to get
    these things to stop? And we both almost said in unison, not our
    job. We’ve been doing it.

  - jenna wortham  
    Not on us. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    We’ve done it. But I really believe that. And I think that we have
    given, I mean, bread crumbs, blueprints, instruction manuals. It’s
    all already out there. And I think that one of the things that’s
    important about this moment that’s really interesting to think about
    is like, there are concrete — the ways in which now is different
    from five years ago is that Black Lives Matter was repeatedly dogged
    for not like, “What do y’all want? What do you want? What do you
    stand for?”

  - jenna wortham  
    You’re disorganized.

  - wesley morris  
    “What do you believe?”

  - jenna wortham  
    And I have to say, I think that’s why the question of empathy haunts
    me. Right? I don’t know what that means. And I’ve been revisiting
    Angela Davis and Kwame Ture. If you haven’t listened to — I think
    it’s his 1966 speech where Kwame Ture, who at the time, was
    Stokely Carmichael, gives this this speech about this idea of Black
    power, right at Berkeley, and is talking about you can’t just have
    empathy for Black people you’ve decided are good or OK. Because
    that, in itself, like, a type of Black life worth fighting for — is
    a — is a function of racism. And that’s something that I struggle
    with because I think, even being in Brooklyn, what does it mean to
    see a procession of people walking through Fort Greene, Flatbush,
    Bed-Stuy, saying Black life matters, and you’re white? Does it
    matter to you? Because, from where I’m sitting, you seem like you
    have no problem \[INAUDIBLE\] Black people out of this city, pushing
    Black people into different neighborhoods, pushing them out of their
    historically Black — I don’t know. So I think there is this kind of
    cognitive dissonance to this moment, too, of like, well, what — and
    I think that’s what I keep coming back to. It’s like, I can hold the
    enormity and the magnitude and tears. I was crying into the sunset
    last night, just really thinking about this kind of recognition
    that’s happening. And at the same time, this sort of deep
    reckoning and recognition that I don’t trust is happening on a
    cellular level, right, because of all of these ways in which the
    history of this country and the history of Black people in this
    world you know have not been treated as mattering. And so the idea —
    there’s a learning curve. There’s a curve. And so for this question
    of who — how do we get empathy, right, I think the empathy is there.
    But I think it’s still at a comfortable level. And I’m really
    interested in the discomforting empathy. Right? When you’re being
    asked to care about not just Black life when it involves our death,
    but when you’re being asked to care about Black life at every single
    level. Right? Like, Black life having the same access to housing as
    you. People having the same job opportunities — I mean, we’re seeing
    this racial reckoning happening online right now where all these
    people are coming out about experiencing macro aggressions and
    racism in different professions and fields. From the food industry,
    to media, to writing, to television, to — and it’s unearthing all of
    these ways in which people have felt marginalized, and not in a way
    that they were called, hey, you’re the n-word. Right? But like, oh,
    you’re not qualified. And all of these subliminal ways that racism
    manifests to keep Black people from having things that white people
    have \[INAUDIBLE\]. You know? I don’t know. So I, I just don’t —
    that’s the part — I just want to say that that’s the part, for me,
    that I don’t think is our work. I think white people really need to
    look inside themselves and think about how they really feel about
    Black people, and face their own anti-Blackness. Because, listen,
    growing up in America I had to face my own anti-Blackness. That’s
    work I had to do because I grew up in a culture steeped in it. So I
    had to do that work for myself. So I don’t believe that you don’t
    have it, too. Last thing I just want to say really quickly is that —

  - wesley morris  
    Last thing you want to say? This is your show\! You can say whatever
    you want.

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m sorry. I know\! But I feel like you were — I can see you and I
    know you so well that I know you want to say something. So that’s
    why I was just like, trying to rewind —

  - wesley morris  
    Not anymore. I’m in the choir, baby. Go on.

  - jenna wortham  
    I forgot, actually. It’ll come back to me.

  - wesley morris  
    (LAUGHS)

  - jenna wortham  
    Go ahead. After all that, I know. (LAUGHS) I keep lighting my palo
    santo because this conversation is making me so worked up. I’m like,
    I got to cleanse the air while we’re talking because it’s really
    heavy. But you said you were going to speak, so you speak. And then
    I’ll remember.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, no. I mean, what you were talking about was — you were sort of
    addressing all of the ways in which things would need to change in
    order for this to have achieved all that it has the potential to,
    right, and all of the ways in which Black Americans have been
    historically disserved. But it’s funny to talk about history.
    Because history is —
    
    it’s the present. Right? I mean, George Floyd’s death. That is a
    21st century death. It is a 20th century death. It’s a 19th century
    death. It’s an 18th century death. He died a death that’s been died
    for centuries. And so this idea of history is a really — I mean,
    we’ve been talking a lot since the pandemic hit, people have been
    joking about time. And I’ve been joking about time, knowing what day
    is what. I feel like there’s something about what’s happening right
    now that is beyond us.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    It is cosmic.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. Speak.

  - wesley morris  
    And it is like somebody dialed for help in 1619 and somebody finally
    picked up the phone in 2020.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    And I feel like the cosmic story that’s unfolding right now is, a
    call that got placed 401 years ago is finally being answered.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right.

  - wesley morris  
    And we’ll see what resources show up. These things have been ready
    to be toppled the whole time. It just needed more bodies, more
    force, more belief, more time to think about what it means to
    topple, and what you put in its place. And we’re in the middle of
    thinking about all of these things and thinking about them
    collectively, and understanding that the stakes are so high that to
    get it wrong — I don’t know what getting it wrong looks like. I
    guess getting it wrong looks like doing nothing. But this is why I’m
    really a big believer in just asking or demanding — demanding the
    most.

  - jenna wortham  
    You know and you — I’m so happy we’re processing this right now
    because you do always kind of push my thinking forward. And I feel
    like I do start to knit together the pieces of what you’re saying,
    and kind of integrate it into my own thinking while we’re talking.
    So thanks for just sharing so freely and vulnerably. What I was
    going to say earlier that I lost my train on was, in terms of the
    question of empathy, like getting white people to understand how
    deep the anti-Blackness goes, that’s not my job. I also am not
    leaving it to you guys to fix the world even though you broke it
    because I don’t trust that. I don’t trust y’all to fix what you
    broke\!

  - wesley morris  
    (LAUGHS)

  - jenna wortham  
    So I do think there is this incredible opportunity. I’ve seen people
    be like, not my problem. Like, it’s y’all’s to fix. And I’m like, do
    we trust that, though? Come on. Y’all saw “Get Out.” No\!

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I agree.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. So I’m just getting to the questions. There is a question from
    somebody named Chase. Thank you for your question, Chase. Where is
    your hope coming from? What helps you access the hope and not just
    feel despair?

    That this is different. This is fundamentally different. Every elder
    that I’ve spoken to recognizes that it’s different. A lot of older
    people feel hope. I mean, you know, John Lewis — there’s a
    documentary about the congressman and civil rights hero, John Lewis.
    And I’ve been thinking a lot about what — I’m praying for him every
    day, by the way, and his health. But what must it be like to be a
    John Lewis-level person, a Jesse Jackson-level person, and see what
    is happening right now, and to know that there is something
    different about what’s going on. And I think that that is a thing
    that — but I think hope is important. I think hope is — we are a
    people of hope, even when it doesn’t seem like we should have any or
    should be hopeful at all. We have it. We keep it. It’s a little
    pilot light that keeps us going, a lot of us.
    
    I don’t want to be at hope yet. I want to be at observance. I want
    to still be mad. I still want to be in awe of what is happening. I’m
    not — hope is kind of always there for me. But for people who are
    despairing, there’s hope to be found in all that chaos.

  - jenna wortham  
    Well put. Beautifully said.

  - wesley morris  
    What’s our next question?

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, there is one last question, which I think we can answer, which
    is, what are you grateful for right now?
    
    My gosh. I mean, I’m grateful to be alive. I’m grateful to be able
    to use this platform. I’m grateful to hold space. I feel very called
    to this work that you and I do. And I think that it is important and
    it is dire. And I’m grateful that I feel prepared. I feel prepared
    for right now.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s — oh, interesting.

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t think I was ready — I wasn’t ready —

  - wesley morris  
    That’s interesting.

  - jenna wortham  
    — in 2012, 2013, ‘14. Pick a year. It was so painful. I didn’t have
    the tools to really allow myself to feel the deep grief, and the
    anger, and the rage, and the fatigue. And I’ve been working on
    myself to really get to a place where I can hold so much emotion and
    not be afraid of it. Because to face the unfairness and cruelty that
    Black people face in this country is to face your own obsolescence,
    in a way. It’s like, to really sit with what it means to — we are
    living under a government that does not value Black life, and will —
    has no problem showing us over and over again how little it cares.

  - wesley morris  
    It doesn’t value anybody’s life, really.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. But I’m just going to keep it centered on —

  - wesley morris  
    I know. I know. I just — (LAUGHS)

  - jenna wortham  
    I guess what I’m really trying to say, though, is that to be a Black
    person in America is to face existential despair. Because how do you
    grapple with the depths of disregard and lack of care, and still get
    up in the morning? You know? And so I think I’m really grateful that
    I have the tools for myself, and I’m also in a position to share
    them with others. So, I don’t know, it’s hard. I feel equipped and I
    feel ready.

  - wesley morris  
    I feel like — that’s powerful. Like, the readiness — the readiness.
    I feel that is part of what this moment is for me, too. I’m ready.
    And I think so many of us are ready.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    We’ve been ready. But this is the moment for all that previous work.

  - jenna wortham  
    I agree.

  - wesley morris  
    We’re ready.

\[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    That feels like a good note to end on. I mean, thank you to
    everybody who tuned in. Thank you to everybody who follows our work.

  - wesley morris

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Look, I know that we said we were on break until the fall. But —

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    — so much happened, we just had to reunite and talk about it. So the
    first thing we did was a live event for New York Times Events. And
    we did it over video call a few weeks ago. And we wanted to share an
    excerpt of that conversation with our listeners, for those who might
    have missed it.

  - wesley morris  
    Right. And that day we were talking about empathy and hope. And
    those are still things that we’re going to continue to talk about,
    and things we’ve always talked about. And a lot of what we were
    doing with each other was the actual real time working out of our
    thoughts and our feelings. So it’s going to sound like we’re
    unplugged, basically, and just thinking through this without the —
    you know, all of the bells and whistles of a regular episode.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s — we were where we were. And because we’re us, we realize
    there’s more to do. So good news, I guess? I don’t know. We’ve got
    two more episodes coming in the next two weeks. We dive into our
    thoughts, our feelings, and continue to process everything that’s
    happening in America right now.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, that is great news. It’s great news\!

  - jenna wortham  
    (LAUGHS) Yeah. So please enjoy the first part of our midsummer
    trilogy, and stay tuned for more.

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, thank you to everyone for joining us today. I’m Jenna Wortham.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m Wesley Morris. We’re two New York Times writers, stuck in our
    houses.

  - jenna wortham  
    And this is “Still Processing.”

\[laughter\]

\[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, we’re here today — we’re gathered here today —

  - wesley morris  
    Oh my goodness.

  - jenna wortham  
    — because this country won’t quit. It really won’t quit. I mean, I’m
    — listen. I was in the park today having lunch and with a friend,
    socially distant, and just taking a break offline. One of my
    meditation healer friends — we were just really taking in the air.
    And, you know, it’s in New York now — it’s as common as hearing a
    siren or anything else. You hear the cheers of “Black lives matter.”
    And it brings me to tears. I was running a little late for this. I
    stopped to watch the procession, and it was actually children. It
    was a a ton right in the middle of Bed-Stuy saying “Black kids
    matter.” And I was just openly weeping. That symbolism — I mean,
    that’s not symbolism. That’s, like, policy in action. You know?
    That, to me, is a political action that’s so important. And I’m
    like, yes, this is what it means to be alive right now in this
    moment in 2020. But I don’t trust it just because you’ve taped up a
    Black power fist onto the front or your business or on the front of
    your home. It’s got to look more — it just has to look more dynamic
    than that. Y’all got to show us more. And it needs to be more than
    this because this is a global problem. And it’s not just enough to
    put a banner on it. The banner is not a Band-Aid.

  - wesley morris  
    Right. Now, I agree. But OK, so what do you think — because I
    actually — I’ve been thinking a lot about what — the question is
    always, where do we go from here? There are some of America’s great
    thinkers wrestling with this question. And there’s no answer. Right?
    I mean, there’s no one answer. But I think we should ask for
    everything. There’s not a thing we shouldn’t be asking for.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, shoot the moon? I want to shoot Saturn. This is the moment
    where there is no crazy thing to ask. Because if you know anything
    about what’s happened in this country, everything that’s led to this
    moment is the crazy thing.

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And asking to undo it is the only sane thing we can do. And I feel
    like asking for, asking for as much as we can get. Because, I’ve
    said this to you, and I’m just going to — I’m going to float this
    out here. I don’t know. This is not really truly tested material.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, OK.

  - wesley morris  
    But it is really important to think about what it means to treat all
    Americans like Black people. And white people, either seeing or
    experiencing what it’s like to be at the police — at the hands of
    the police, at the whims of the police in some cases —

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. That’s right.

  - wesley morris  
    — I think that the — let everybody go to a crappy public school or
    an underfunded public school in this country that is actively,
    actively starved of resources, actively neglected. The problem in
    this entire situation has always been a matter of empathy. It’s
    always been not being able to imagine that the people undergoing all
    this unequal treatment were actual people or that they didn’t
    deserve that.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    Because what was happening with these other shootings before?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right. Right.

  - wesley morris  
    There would always be somebody who would have some extenuating
    circumstances they didn’t know anything about. And I think there’s —
    
    one of the things that’s been happening the whole time was the
    extenuating circumstance or extenuating excuse: “Well, they must
    have done something.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Right. Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Michael Brown must have done something. Eric Garner must have done
    something. But that question of what they did is immediately —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — the cost can’t be their life for selling loose cigarettes.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. So it’s like, the next question is, so what? Right?

  - wesley morris  
    Right.

  - jenna wortham  
    So what? It doesn’t give the police free license just to kill
    people, right, just to shoot people at will or all the other things
    they do. But, yeah, I agree. I’m listening.

  - wesley morris  
    So I’m saying that what we’ve got right now is the closing of an
    empathy gap. And some of that is just pure empirical experience on
    behalf of some of these people who were marching alongside Black
    people.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    And it’s the experience of understanding — and I don’t know —
    there’s no way to quantify this, but I wonder how far out the
    empathy goes. Right? And this is why I’m saying there’s no thing
    that should not be demanded right now, in some ways.

  - jenna wortham  
    But my asterisk, to your point, is that there is an empathy gap
    that’s being closed. And I think I’m really urging for
    watchfulness around how much empathy there is, and kind of where
    it’s being directed. Right? Because the world and the country is
    outraged about George Floyd. And that same vector of outrage and
    anger is not being directed towards what happened to Breonna Taylor,
    what happened to Tony McDade. And so what is interesting to me right
    now, and what I’m really thinking through, is how do we make this
    moment as intersectional as possible and remind everyone that all
    Black lives matter? Right? Women matter. Queer people matter. Trans
    Black people matter. You know? And I think that it’s been tough
    because it’s mixed. Right? There is a lot of empathy around Mr.
    Floyd. But is that empathy being shared for Miss Taylor? Right? Is
    that empathy being shared for Miss Dior, who was attacked in
    Minneapolis as well? And so it needs to be inclusive. It has to be
    inclusive. Because, if not, then we’re just perpetuating the same
    systemic, misogynistic, patriarchical problems.
    
    There has to be enough empathy for all of us. It cannot just be
    about cis Black men, right, who are suffering at the hands of state
    violence. It has to be about everybody. So that’s kind of where I
    get a little bit tripped up. But I do want to say — OK, so as you’ve
    been talking I’ve been thinking. And something that is meaningful
    for me that I’ve seen, because I do think that cultural — cultural
    shifts do shape societal shifts. I mean, absolutely. And so small
    shifts like Legos, right, saying we’re not going to do any more
    police officer Legos — “COPS” coming off the air — although, I think
    that damage has been done. That’s a long overdue thing. Yeah. I
    think that it will be really interesting to see, well, how are
    police officers represented on all the “S.V.U.” shows going forward?
    How are police officers represented from here on out? I think that’s
    actually more interesting, to me. But the fact that those shifts are
    starting to happen feel important. Because, like you say, it’s like,
    we do get these — we get these images about what law and order mean
    imprinted into our minds. And to sort of start having some of that
    untangling happen in real time feels — I do think that’s what I feel
    strongly about.

  - wesley morris  
    I guess the reason I’m exasperated by some of these things is
    because they’re not even symbolic. They’re merely cosmetic. Right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And I think NASCAR vowing to purge its races of Confederate flag
    imagery is an interesting and meaningful symbolic change that I
    don’t see being enforced. To the degree that I’m a journalist at
    all —

  - jenna wortham  
    (LAUGHS)

  - wesley morris  
    — there’s a little tiny part of me that wants to put on a little
    disguise and just go down and just check things out. You can purge
    all the Confederate flags you want. You know what you can’t purge?
    My fear of going into a NASCAR race at Talladega.

  - jenna wortham  
    That very valid fear, my friend. Don’t you dare go. I will not let
    you go. But that’s the thing. It’s like, I don’t like how we’re
    being asked to gauge the sincerity of these decisions. And it feels
    like unfair labor that I have to do. It doesn’t feel valid or
    sincere at all to me.

  - wesley morris  
    But you and I went on the “CBS Morning Show” after — I don’t know if
    you remember this.

  - jenna wortham  
    Are you kidding me? Of course. Anyway, go on. Yes, we went on “CBS
    This Morning” after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. The question was, what kind of work do we need to do to get
    these things to stop? And we both almost said in unison, not our
    job. We’ve been doing it.

  - jenna wortham  
    Not on us. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    We’ve done it. But I really believe that. And I think that we have
    given, I mean, bread crumbs, blueprints, instruction manuals. It’s
    all already out there. And I think that one of the things that’s
    important about this moment that’s really interesting to think about
    is like, there are concrete — the ways in which now is different
    from five years ago is that Black Lives Matter was repeatedly dogged
    for not like, “What do y’all want? What do you want? What do you
    stand for?”

  - jenna wortham  
    You’re disorganized.

  - wesley morris  
    “What do you believe?”

  - jenna wortham  
    And I have to say, I think that’s why the question of empathy haunts
    me. Right? I don’t know what that means. And I’ve been revisiting
    Angela Davis and Kwame Ture. If you haven’t listened to — I think
    it’s his 1966 speech where Kwame Ture, who at the time, was
    Stokely Carmichael, gives this this speech about this idea of Black
    power, right at Berkeley, and is talking about you can’t just have
    empathy for Black people you’ve decided are good or OK. Because
    that, in itself, like, a type of Black life worth fighting for — is
    a — is a function of racism. And that’s something that I struggle
    with because I think, even being in Brooklyn, what does it mean to
    see a procession of people walking through Fort Greene, Flatbush,
    Bed-Stuy, saying Black life matters, and you’re white? Does it
    matter to you? Because, from where I’m sitting, you seem like you
    have no problem \[INAUDIBLE\] Black people out of this city, pushing
    Black people into different neighborhoods, pushing them out of their
    historically Black — I don’t know. So I think there is this kind of
    cognitive dissonance to this moment, too, of like, well, what — and
    I think that’s what I keep coming back to. It’s like, I can hold the
    enormity and the magnitude and tears. I was crying into the sunset
    last night, just really thinking about this kind of recognition
    that’s happening. And at the same time, this sort of deep
    reckoning and recognition that I don’t trust is happening on a
    cellular level, right, because of all of these ways in which the
    history of this country and the history of Black people in this
    world you know have not been treated as mattering. And so the idea —
    there’s a learning curve. There’s a curve. And so for this question
    of who — how do we get empathy, right, I think the empathy is there.
    But I think it’s still at a comfortable level. And I’m really
    interested in the discomforting empathy. Right? When you’re being
    asked to care about not just Black life when it involves our death,
    but when you’re being asked to care about Black life at every single
    level. Right? Like, Black life having the same access to housing as
    you. People having the same job opportunities — I mean, we’re seeing
    this racial reckoning happening online right now where all these
    people are coming out about experiencing macro aggressions and
    racism in different professions and fields. From the food industry,
    to media, to writing, to television, to — and it’s unearthing all of
    these ways in which people have felt marginalized, and not in a way
    that they were called, hey, you’re the n-word. Right? But like, oh,
    you’re not qualified. And all of these subliminal ways that racism
    manifests to keep Black people from having things that white people
    have \[INAUDIBLE\]. You know? I don’t know. So I, I just don’t —
    that’s the part — I just want to say that that’s the part, for me,
    that I don’t think is our work. I think white people really need to
    look inside themselves and think about how they really feel about
    Black people, and face their own anti-Blackness. Because, listen,
    growing up in America I had to face my own anti-Blackness. That’s
    work I had to do because I grew up in a culture steeped in it. So I
    had to do that work for myself. So I don’t believe that you don’t
    have it, too. Last thing I just want to say really quickly is that —

  - wesley morris  
    Last thing you want to say? This is your show\! You can say whatever
    you want.

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m sorry. I know\! But I feel like you were — I can see you and I
    know you so well that I know you want to say something. So that’s
    why I was just like, trying to rewind —

  - wesley morris  
    Not anymore. I’m in the choir, baby. Go on.

  - jenna wortham  
    I forgot, actually. It’ll come back to me.

  - wesley morris  
    (LAUGHS)

  - jenna wortham  
    Go ahead. After all that, I know. (LAUGHS) I keep lighting my palo
    santo because this conversation is making me so worked up. I’m like,
    I got to cleanse the air while we’re talking because it’s really
    heavy. But you said you were going to speak, so you speak. And then
    I’ll remember.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, no. I mean, what you were talking about was — you were sort of
    addressing all of the ways in which things would need to change in
    order for this to have achieved all that it has the potential to,
    right, and all of the ways in which Black Americans have been
    historically disserved. But it’s funny to talk about history.
    Because history is —
    
    it’s the present. Right? I mean, George Floyd’s death. That is a
    21st century death. It is a 20th century death. It’s a 19th century
    death. It’s an 18th century death. He died a death that’s been died
    for centuries. And so this idea of history is a really — I mean,
    we’ve been talking a lot since the pandemic hit, people have been
    joking about time. And I’ve been joking about time, knowing what day
    is what. I feel like there’s something about what’s happening right
    now that is beyond us.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    It is cosmic.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. Speak.

  - wesley morris  
    And it is like somebody dialed for help in 1619 and somebody finally
    picked up the phone in 2020.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    And I feel like the cosmic story that’s unfolding right now is, a
    call that got placed 401 years ago is finally being answered.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right.

  - wesley morris  
    And we’ll see what resources show up. These things have been ready
    to be toppled the whole time. It just needed more bodies, more
    force, more belief, more time to think about what it means to
    topple, and what you put in its place. And we’re in the middle of
    thinking about all of these things and thinking about them
    collectively, and understanding that the stakes are so high that to
    get it wrong — I don’t know what getting it wrong looks like. I
    guess getting it wrong looks like doing nothing. But this is why I’m
    really a big believer in just asking or demanding — demanding the
    most.

  - jenna wortham  
    You know and you — I’m so happy we’re processing this right now
    because you do always kind of push my thinking forward. And I feel
    like I do start to knit together the pieces of what you’re saying,
    and kind of integrate it into my own thinking while we’re talking.
    So thanks for just sharing so freely and vulnerably. What I was
    going to say earlier that I lost my train on was, in terms of the
    question of empathy, like getting white people to understand how
    deep the anti-Blackness goes, that’s not my job. I also am not
    leaving it to you guys to fix the world even though you broke it
    because I don’t trust that. I don’t trust y’all to fix what you
    broke\!

  - wesley morris  
    (LAUGHS)

  - jenna wortham  
    So I do think there is this incredible opportunity. I’ve seen people
    be like, not my problem. Like, it’s y’all’s to fix. And I’m like, do
    we trust that, though? Come on. Y’all saw “Get Out.” No\!

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I agree.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. So I’m just getting to the questions. There is a question from
    somebody named Chase. Thank you for your question, Chase. Where is
    your hope coming from? What helps you access the hope and not just
    feel despair?

  - wesley morris  
    That this is different. This is fundamentally different. Every elder
    that I’ve spoken to recognizes that it’s different. A lot of older
    people feel hope. I mean, you know, John Lewis — there’s a
    documentary about the congressman and civil rights hero, John Lewis.
    And I’ve been thinking a lot about what — I’m praying for him every
    day, by the way, and his health. But what must it be like to be a
    John Lewis-level person, a Jesse Jackson-level person, and see what
    is happening right now, and to know that there is something
    different about what’s going on. And I think that that is a thing
    that — but I think hope is important. I think hope is — we are a
    people of hope, even when it doesn’t seem like we should have any or
    should be hopeful at all. We have it. We keep it. It’s a little
    pilot light that keeps us going, a lot of us.
    
    I don’t want to be at hope yet. I want to be at observance. I want
    to still be mad. I still want to be in awe of what is happening. I’m
    not — hope is kind of always there for me. But for people who are
    despairing, there’s hope to be found in all that chaos.

  - jenna wortham  
    Well put. Beautifully said.

  - wesley morris  
    What’s our next question?

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, there is one last question, which I think we can answer, which
    is, what are you grateful for right now?
    
    My gosh. I mean, I’m grateful to be alive. I’m grateful to be able
    to use this platform. I’m grateful to hold space. I feel very called
    to this work that you and I do. And I think that it is important and
    it is dire. And I’m grateful that I feel prepared. I feel prepared
    for right now.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s — oh, interesting.

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t think I was ready — I wasn’t ready —

  - wesley morris  
    That’s interesting.

  - jenna wortham  
    — in 2012, 2013, ‘14. Pick a year. It was so painful. I didn’t have
    the tools to really allow myself to feel the deep grief, and the
    anger, and the rage, and the fatigue. And I’ve been working on
    myself to really get to a place where I can hold so much emotion and
    not be afraid of it. Because to face the unfairness and cruelty that
    Black people face in this country is to face your own obsolescence,
    in a way. It’s like, to really sit with what it means to — we are
    living under a government that does not value Black life, and will —
    has no problem showing us over and over again how little it cares.

  - wesley morris  
    It doesn’t value anybody’s life, really.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. But I’m just going to keep it centered on —

  - wesley morris  
    I know. I know. I just — (LAUGHS)

  - jenna wortham  
    I guess what I’m really trying to say, though, is that to be a Black
    person in America is to face existential despair. Because how do you
    grapple with the depths of disregard and lack of care, and still get
    up in the morning? You know? And so I think I’m really grateful that
    I have the tools for myself, and I’m also in a position to share
    them with others. So, I don’t know, it’s hard. I feel equipped and I
    feel ready.

  - wesley morris  
    I feel like — that’s powerful. Like, the readiness — the readiness.
    I feel that is part of what this moment is for me, too. I’m ready.
    And I think so many of us are ready.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    We’ve been ready. But this is the moment for all that previous work.

  - jenna wortham  
    I agree.

  - wesley morris  
    We’re ready.

\[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    That feels like a good note to end on. I mean, thank you to
    everybody who tuned in. Thank you to everybody who follows our work.

  - wesley morris  
    Thanks, everybody. And we’ll be back. We’re going to get back. We’ll
    be recording soon.
