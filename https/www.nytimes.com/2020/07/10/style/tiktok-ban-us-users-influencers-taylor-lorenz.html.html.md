# What if the U.S. Bans TikTok?

</div>

Gen Z and millennial users have found community on the app, particularly
during the coronavirus pandemic. And for some of them, it’s their
livelihood.

Since Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Monday that the
United States was [considering banning
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
over national security concerns, a sentiment echoed by [President Donald
Trump in an interview on
Tuesday](https://www.fullcourtgreta.com/2020/07/07/gray-televisions-greta-van-susteren-interview-with-president-donald-j-trump/),
TikTok users have been scrambling.

Some have engaged in open revolt, retaliating by posting negative
reviews of President Trump’s 2020 campaign app. The app received more
than 700 negative reviews on Wednesday and only 26 positive ones,
according to data from the analytics firm [Sensor
Tower](https://sensortower.com/ios/US/donaldjtrump-for-president/app/official-trump-2020-app/1135325440/overview).
It currently has a [one-star
rating](https://sensortower.com/ios/US/donaldjtrump-for-president/app/official-trump-2020-app/1135325440/overview).

“For Gen Z and millennials, TikTok is our clubhouse, and Trump
threatened it,” Yori Blacc, a 19-year-old TikTok user in California,
told
[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-09/tiktok-teens-try-to-trick-trump-campaign-again)
in an interview about the app ratings. “If you’re going to mess with us,
we will mess with you.”

Suspicion of TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has
come from the private sector, too. On Friday, Amazon [asked its
employees to delete
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/technology/tiktok-amazon-security-risk.html)
from any phone that can “access company email,” according to a memo
obtained by The New York Times. Several Amazon employees expressed
disappointment at the request on Twitter. (Hours later, the company
backtracked and said the email had been sent in error.)

Beneath the users’ frustration, though, there is anxiety.

For many young people, TikTok has been an outlet for creative expression
and human connection, especially throughout months of distance learning
and social
isolation.

“If TikTok did shut down, it would be like losing a bunch of really
close friends I made, losing all the progress and work I did to get a
big following,” said Ashleigh Hunniford, 17, who has more than 400,000
followers on the app. “It’s a big part of who I’ve become as a teenager.
Losing it would be like losing a little bit of me.”

There are also those for whom TikTok is their livelihood. “It has put
food on our table,” said Hootie Hurley, 21, who has more than 1.1
million followers on the app. He said that a TikTok ban would be
particularly devastating right now.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“TikTok has been such a big part of everyone’s quarantine and helping
everyone get through this pandemic,” he said.

Influencers who watched the fall of Vine, another popular short-form
video app, in 2016 learned the importance of diversifying one’s audience
across platforms. But even for TikTok’s biggest stars, moving an
audience from one platform to another is a huge undertaking.

“I have 7 million followers on TikTok, but it doesn’t translate to every
platform,” said Nick Austin, 20. “I only have 3 million on Instagram and
500,000 on YouTube. No matter what it’s going to be hard to transfer all
the people I have on TikTok.”

Some of TikTok’s biggest stars have already successfully migrated to
YouTube. Members of the [Sway
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/style/sway-house-neighbors-tiktok.html),
like [Bryce
Hall](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7IxRdZIn9G0cOUwiozhjw), have
quickly become stars there. Other TikTok influencers, such as [Charli
D’Amelio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi3OE-aN09WOcN9d2stCvPg)
and [Josh
Richards](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhyesTXP5MZO7l2cxv9xKw) are
also already in the millions.

“When Vine ended, all the Viners took over YouTube,” Mr. Hurley said.
“If TikTok gets banned, TikTokers are taking over YouTube. TikTokers
are the ones in the headlines right now. TikTokers are the talk right
now. If TikTok gets taken away, these people aren’t just going to
disappear.”

Ellie Zeiler, 16, said that a [glitch on Thursday
afternoon](https://www.distractify.com/p/why-does-tiktok-have-0-views)
where TikTok temporarily showed zero views on videos across the app led
some users to believe that the ban could be imminent. She said she saw
hundreds of users going live, saying goodbye to their followers and
urging people to follow them elsewhere. “I was like no, this can’t be
it,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to giving young people a place to meet and entertain each
other, TikTok has also been a platform for political and social justice
issues.

“I think this will drastically affect political commentary among
teenagers,” Ms. Hunniford said. “TikTok is an outlet for a lot of
protest and activism and people talking about their political beliefs.
Banning that would not carry well among people my age.”

While the Trump administration’s statements have upended the TikTok
community, they have been a boon for other apps. Byte, a short-form
video app created by one of the Vine founders, Dom Hoffman, briefly shot
to the top of the app store after news of TikTok’s ban. The influencer
Elijah Daniel [encouraged his followers to download the
app](https://www.tiktok.com/@elijahdaniel/video/6847322887607651590) on
Thursday.

“Literally nobody uses Byte, a.k.a. Vine 2.0, because the gays aren’t on
there,” he said in a TikTok video. “So obviously it’s not worth it.
However, just to be safe, I made a Byte profile. Let’s take over Byte
and make it a gay app before anyone else has a chance.”

Many Byte users posted welcome videos to TikTokers on the app on
Thursday in which they gave new users a lay of the land.

“The Byte community is being swamped with TikTokers coming in,” said
Kyle Harris, 29, an avid Byte user. “A lot of TikTokers have been coming
in very confused about how to use it. People expect it to be a TikTok
clone, but it’s not at all. It’s not a TikTok competitor and it’s not
supposed to be.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dubsmash, an app that functions very similarly to TikTok, has also seen
a large influx of users. Barrie Segal, the head of content at Dubsmash,
has been working overtime to make the new users feel welcome without
alienating its current stars.

“We have tons of new users coming into the app right now, and that’s why
we’re making sure that no one feels like it’s a takeover. That’s the key
thing,” she said.

Ms. Segal has appointed 40 popular Dubsmashers to act as “ambassadors”
to new users with big followings. “It was a bit of a culture clash in
the last couple days, but now everyone is understanding each other
more,” she said.

Max Levine, the C.O.O. of Amp Studios, an incubator for social media
talent, said that the 10 TikTok creators who work with his company are
all investing heavily in Snapchat. The platform recently verified them,
and they have found success with the app’s Discover page.

Still, many people say TikTok is irreplaceable for them.

“I’ve heard of Dubsmash. I’ve heard of Byte, but it’s just not TikTok,”
said Q Shamar Stenline, 21, who has 4.4 million followers on TikTok.
He’s not immediately looking to jump to another short-form video app.
He’d rather focus his time on YouTube, which he sees as more stable.
“YouTube will be around,” he said. “These other apps come and
go.”
