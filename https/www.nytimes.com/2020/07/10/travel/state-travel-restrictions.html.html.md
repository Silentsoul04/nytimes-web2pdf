*This list will be updated as states continue to announce changes to
their travel advisories. Are we missing an update? Email us at*
[*travelrestrictions@nytimes.com*](mailto:travelrestrictions@nytimes.com)*.*

In the United States, [gas prices are
down](https://gasprices.aaa.com/national-average-decreases-as-gas-demand-remains-low/)
while the number of coronavirus cases are up, making the decision of how
to vacation during this unprecedented summer a complex one. Meanwhile,
state restrictions on travelers are constantly evolving, with some
requiring mandatory testing and others imposing [quarantine
requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is continuing to caution
against travel, both internationally and within the United States. For
those who do take a trip, [the C.D.C.
recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html)
people wear a face mask in public, wash hands frequently, avoid touching
their face, keep six feet from others, cover coughs and sneezes, and use
drive-through service and curbside pickup at restaurants and stores.

Here is a summary of current restrictions in the United States for
leisure travelers, although some people are exempt if they are simply
passing through or not remaining in the state for more than 24 hours.
Many states also have exemptions for essential workers who are on the
job, including health care workers, members of the military and others,
but even [they are subject to some
restrictions](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/covid-19-essential-workers-in-the-states.aspx).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

and agree to one of the following conditions:

    must take another test between seven and 14 days after arrival, and
    minimize interactions with others until they receive those new
    results.

  - Tourists with a negative result from a test taken in the five days
    before their trip agree to take a second test at the airport upon
    arrival, and then a third test seven to 14 days later. They also
    agree to minimize interaction with others until the third test is
    back.

  - People can also receive a test upon arrival, if one is available,

        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury

        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Visitors from counties in Northeastern states that have similar active
coronavirus rates to Vermont (defined as less than 400 active cases per
million residents) and who travel in a private vehicle do not have to
quarantine. The same is true for Vermont residents who visit those
regions when they return home.

are in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

Most other travelers need to self-quarantine upon arrival in Vermont,
but the state gives travelers a few options. People may self-quarantine
out of state before traveling to Vermont as long as their trip is in a
private vehicle and they make only necessary stops, while wearing a face
mask, social distancing and washing their hands frequently. Those opting
to self-quarantine before their visit to Vermont can either do it for 14
days, or they can shorten it to seven days if they then get a negative
test result.
