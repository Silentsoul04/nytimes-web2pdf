# As Universities Seek to Block Visa Rules, Trump Threatens Tax Status

Harvard and M.I.T. want a court to protect foreign students taking
online classes. After a hearing, President Trump said he was ordering a
review of universities’ tax-exempt status.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A battle between the Trump administration and some of America’s top
universities escalated on Friday, with Harvard and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology [seeking a court
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/harvard-mit-trump-ice-students.html)
to protect foreign students from losing their visas, and the president
threatening the tax-exempt status of institutions that he claimed
indoctrinate students.

After a brief virtual hearing, a federal judge in Boston put off a
decision Friday on the universities’ challenge to new federal rules that
would [revoke the visas of foreign
students](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/international-students-visa-reaction.html)
studying entirely online this fall, and set another hearing for Tuesday.

Lawyers for the two universities argued in court papers that the new
rules from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which require students
to take at least one in-person class for their F-1 student visas to
remain valid, would cruelly and recklessly upend the lives of tens of
thousands of international students and threaten public health.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rules were issued Monday, after many if not most colleges and
universities across the country [announced reopening
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-universities-colleges-reopening.html)
that had been months in the making. Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and
universities in California have also sued the administration, and
several others have indicated that they intend to support the legal
efforts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The president is using foreign students as pawns to keep all schools
open, no matter the cost to the health and well-being of these students
and their communities,” said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with Public
Counsel, a legal aid organization in Los Angeles that filed a lawsuit
Friday on behalf of graduate students at three California universities.
“It’s temper-tantrum policymaking.”

William F. Lee, the lawyer for Harvard and M.I.T., told the judge in the
case that it was important to have a decision by Wednesday, because that
is when the government is requiring schools to certify that students are
taking in-person classes to meet the visa requirements — “nine days
after the change was announced,” the universities’ court papers
note.

Shortly after the hearing, [President Trump
tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1281616586273468416)
that he was ordering the Treasury Department to re-examine the
tax-exempt status and funding of universities, saying too many “are
about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Federal law prohibits the Internal Revenue Service, part of the Treasury
Department, from scrutinizing tax-exempt organizations “based on their
ideological beliefs.”

In recent days, Mr. Trump has shown mounting displeasure with both K-12
schools and universities, pushing them to hold in-person classes as
usual this fall and even [threatening to withhold federal
money](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/schools-reopening-trump.html)
if they do not, although he has little power to do so.

In the hearing Friday, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the United States
District Court for Massachusetts said the idea that the students could
be irreparably harmed, as well as the interests of society in the
outcome, were fairly clear, leaving her basically to consider legal
arguments on how likely the case was to succeed when deciding whether to
issue a restraining order.

She said she was waiting to hear the government’s arguments on those
legal arguments, and she asked other parties that might be filing briefs
in support of the universities to keep their arguments short.

“My gut on it is that the big-ticket item here is going to be a
likelihood of success on the merits,” said Judge Burroughs, who was
nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama.

The universities noted in court papers that the national emergency that
President Trump declared on March 13 for the pandemic was still in
effect, with the number of coronavirus cases in the United States having
passed three million this week.

The administration directive on visas, the university lawyers argued,
“has the hallmarks of a politically motivated maneuver” to force
universities to hold in-person classes “without regard to the public
health judgment of the schools and experts about whether that is safe
for students, faculty and staff.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Harvard and M.I.T. want to welcome students back to campus, the court
papers said, but had determined that “it is not yet prudent to do so.”
Harvard announced Monday that its undergraduate courses would be
entirely online, although some students would be invited back to campus.
M.I.T. has said that most of its courses would be taught online.

“Because higher education institutions do not exist in a vacuum, an
outbreak at one poses a threat to the health and safety of everyone in
the surrounding community,” the universities said in court papers.

Although the government has not yet responded in court, the White House
press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, defended the administration’s actions
at a news conference earlier this week.

“You don’t get a visa for taking online classes from, let’s say,
University of Phoenix. So why would you if you were just taking online
classes, generally?” she told reporters, adding, “Perhaps the better
lawsuit would be coming from students who have to pay full tuition with
no access to in-person classes to
attend.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Some one million international students study in the United States each
year. Immigrant advocates say that together with delays in processing
visas as a result of the pandemic, the new visa rules, which must still
be finalized this month, might discourage many overseas students from
attending American universities, where they often pay full tuition.

Between them, Harvard and M.I.T. have 9,000 international students, some
of whom come from countries like Syria, “where civil war and an ongoing
humanitarian crisis make internet access and study all but impossible,”
the universities said in their request for a court order. Others come
from Ethiopia, “where the government has a practice of suspending all
internet access for extended periods, including presently.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If the government rules are enforced, the universities said,
international students “must abandon housing arrangements they have
made, breach leases, pay exorbitant airfares and risk Covid-19 infection
on transoceanic flights. And if their departure is not timely, they risk
detention by immigration authorities and formal removal from the country
that may bar their return to the United States for 10 years.”

The universities noted that the Trump administration was reversing an
earlier emergency decision, issued in March as the coronavirus outbreak
forced the closure of campuses across the country. Then, ICE said
students holding F-1 visas could attend remote classes while retaining
their visa status, and made clear that this arrangement was “in effect
for the duration of the emergency,” the universities said.

The Massachusetts attorney general said this week that she would support
Harvard and M.I.T.’s efforts to overturn the government’s new rules, and
other universities, immigrant advocate groups and state attorneys
general also said they planned to get involved, either filing briefings
in support of Harvard and M.I.T. or their own lawsuits.

Late Thursday, California filed its own lawsuit seeking a preliminary
injunction against the Trump rules from the U.S. District Court for
Northern California. The state, home to the largest population of
international students in the country, called the administration’s
policy change “cruel” and “absurd” and said that the government had
failed to follow the legal procedure for notice and comment required
before implementing new rules.

About 185,000 international students are enrolled in California’s public
and state universities.

“Shame on the Trump administration for risking not only the education
opportunities for students who earned the chance to go to college, but
now their health and well-being as well,” said the state’s attorney
general, Xavier Becerra.

On Friday, Johns Hopkins also filed suit, saying that the administration
was undercutting the university’s ability to protect “the health and
safety of its students, faculty, and staff according to its own best
judgment, as informed by its up-to-the-minute, world-leading expertise
and data.”
