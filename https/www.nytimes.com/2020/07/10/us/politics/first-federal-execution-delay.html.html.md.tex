The Justice Department immediately appealed the injunction, issued after
family members of the victims of the crime argued that the coronavirus
made it unsafe for them to travel to witness the execution.

WASHINGTON --- With the Justice Department scheduled on Monday to carry
out the death penalty for the first time in 17 years, a federal judge in
Indiana temporarily suspended the plan on Friday after family members of
the victims sought a delay, saying they could not safely travel to
witness the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html}{execution}
because of the coronavirus.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html}{Daniel
Lewis Lee}, 47, is
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/federal-executions-pandemic.html}{set
to be executed on Monday} for his part in the 1996 murder of a family of
three, bringing an end to an informal federal moratorium on carrying out
the death penalty. But this week, family members of his victims filed a
lawsuit, asking the Justice Department to hold off until the risk of the
pandemic had subsided.

Jane E. Magnus-Stinson, the chief judge for the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
\href{https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.insd.184466/gov.uscourts.insd.184466.20.0.pdf}{issued
a preliminary injunction on Friday,} arguing that the needs of the
victims' family outweighed the need for a speedy execution.

The Justice Department immediately filed an emergency appeal to allow
the execution to be conducted as planned.

One of the family members, Earlene Branch Peterson, 81, who lost her
daughter and granddaughter to Mr. Lee's crimes, has congestive heart
failure, among other underlying conditions. Monica Veillette, 43, a
niece and cousin to the victims, is asthmatic, and Ms. Veillette's
mother, 61, has underlying health conditions that predispose her to the
virus, they said in their suit.

They argued that traveling hundreds of miles from their homes in
Arkansas and Washington State and entering the federal penitentiary in
Terre Haute, Ind., where the execution is to be carried out, would make
it dangerous for them to attend.

``I can't understand why in the face of a roaring national pandemic the
government would seek to put the people who have the right to be there''
in harm's way, said Baker Kurrus, the family's lawyer.

Many states have postponed executions during the pandemic. But
\href{https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/executions-scheduled-four-federal-inmates-convicted-murdering-children}{Attorney
General William P. Barr announced last month} that the Justice
Department intended to proceed with four federal executions, with Mr.
Lee's being the first.

Until recently, lawyers for the inmates scheduled to die were unable to
see their clients in the months leading up to their scheduled execution
dates because the prison barred visits from outsiders for health
reasons. The lawyers said the restrictions impeded their ability to
defend their clients.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/arkansas-federal-death-penalty.html}{Some
family members of Mr. Lee's victims,} including those now seeking the
delay, have long opposed his execution, but they had still planned to
attend.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Last-minute attempts to halt scheduled executions are common among
inmates on death row. Now, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago must decide whether to maintain the lower court's injunction or
allow the execution to proceed.

Two other executions are scheduled for next week. In both cases,
spiritual advisers for the death row inmates have filed similar
complaints seeking delays, citing their own pre-existing health
conditions and the risks of traveling to the prison during the pandemic.

Ms. Veillette said the federal government had already booked airline
tickets and hotel rooms for her family's stay near the federal
penitentiary in Terre Haute. But Friday's decision meant that those
reservations may no longer be necessary.

She said she celebrated the delay outside in her garden, tending to her
flowers.

``We can breathe and not worry about having to choose being at risk or
not being there,'' she said, acknowledging that the decision was not yet
final. ``We can breathe and put some flowers in the ground.''
