WASHINGTON — President Trump [commuted the
sentence](https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-pardons-commutations.html)
of his longtime friend [Roger J. Stone
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/politics/roger-stone-mo-kelly-slur.html)
on seven felony crimes on Friday, using the power of his office to spare
a former campaign adviser days before Mr. Stone was to report to a
federal prison to serve a 40-month term.

In [a lengthy written
statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grant-clemency-roger-stone-jr/)
punctuated by the sort of inflammatory language and angry grievances
characteristic of the president’s Twitter feed, the White House
denounced the “overzealous prosecutors” who convicted Mr. Stone on
“process-based charges” stemming from the “witch hunts” and “Russia
hoax” investigation.

The statement did not assert that Mr. Stone was innocent of the false
statements and obstruction counts, only that he should not have been
pursued because prosecutors ultimately filed no charges of an underlying
conspiracy between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. “Roger Stone has
already suffered greatly,” it said. “He was treated very unfairly, as
were many others in this case. Roger Stone is now a free man\!”

The commutation, announced late on a Friday, when potentially damaging
news is often released, was the latest action by the Trump
administration upending the justice system to help the president’s
convicted friends. The Justice Department moved in May [to dismiss its
own criminal
case](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/michael-flynn-case-dropped.html)
against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn,
who had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. And last month, [Mr. Trump
fired Geoffrey S.
Berman](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html),
the United States attorney whose office prosecuted Michael D. Cohen, the
president’s former personal lawyer, and has been investigating Rudolph
W. Giuliani, another of his lawyers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Democrats quickly condemned the president’s decision, characterizing it
as an abuse of the rule of law. “With this commutation, Trump makes
clear that there are two systems of justice in America: one for his
criminal friends, and one for everyone else,” said Representative Adam
B. Schiff, Democrat of California and a leader of the drive to impeach
Mr. Trump last year for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate his domestic
rivals.

Two House committee chairmen quickly announced that they would
investigate the circumstances of the commutation, suggesting that it was
a reward for Mr. Stone’s silence protecting the president. “No other
president has exercised the clemency power for such a patently personal
and self-serving purpose,” said a statement issued by Representatives
Jerrold Nadler and Carolyn B. Maloney, both New York Democrats.

Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, called the commutation
[“Unprecedented, historic
corruption”](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/1281937795616067586)
in a tweet.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Stone, 67, a longtime Republican operative, [was
convicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html)
of obstructing a congressional investigation into Mr. Trump’s 2016
campaign and possible ties to Russia. Prosecutors convinced jurors that
he lied under oath, withheld a trove of documents and threatened an
associate with harm if he cooperated with congressional investigators.
Mr. Stone maintained his innocence and claimed prosecutors wanted him to
offer information about Mr. Trump that he said did not exist.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As his time to report to prison neared, Mr. Stone openly lobbied for
clemency, maintaining that he could die in prison and emphasizing that
he had stayed loyal to the president rather than help investigators.

“He knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him,” [Mr. Stone told
the journalist Howard
Fineman](https://twitter.com/howardfineman/status/1281681337351626752)
on Friday shortly before the announcement. “It would have eased my
situation considerably. But I didn’t.”

In an interview with Fox News this week, he characterized himself as
collateral damage in the quest to target Mr. Trump. “He is aware that
the people trying to destroy Michael Flynn, now trying to destroy me,
are the people trying to destroy him,” Mr. Stone said.

In an appearance on Fox last month, Mr. Stone even suggested that he
wanted to help Mr. Trump win in November, saying his biggest fear of
going to prison other than his health was “that I may not be free to do
everything within my power to re-elect this president.”

While it was not clear when the two last spoke before the decision, Mr.
Trump called Mr. Stone on Friday to deliver the news of his clemency
personally, according to an official briefed on the conversation.

The president has used his power to [issue pardons or
commutations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/politics/trump-pardon-blagojevich-debartolo.html)
to a variety of political allies, supporters or people with connections
to his own circle, like the former New York police commissioner [Bernard
B.
Kerik](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/politics/trump-pardons.html),
the financier [Michael R.
Milken](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/business/michael-milken-case-lessons.html)
and former Gov. [Rod R.
Blagojevich](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/rod-blagojevich-chicago.html)
of Illinois.

But Mr. Stone is the first figure directly connected to the president’s
campaign to benefit from his clemency power. While Mr. Trump has
publicly dangled pardons for associates targeted by investigators, that
was a line he had been wary of crossing until now amid warnings from
advisers concerned about the possible political damage.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The debate over clemency for Mr. Stone has raged within the White House
for months. Among those who advocated on behalf of it from outside the
building were Tucker Carlson, the influential Fox News anchor, and
Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, according to people
familiar with the discussions.

Within the White House, Mr. Stone had few allies. Many Trump aides who
knew him from the campaign did not like him, were envious of his long
relationship with Mr. Trump or thought clemency would be bad politics.

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, expressed concern about
potential political consequences, according to two people familiar with
the discussions, although he has left people with different impressions
about where he stands. The same is true of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s
son-in-law and senior adviser, who has been involved in most of the
clemency discussions throughout the past three years.

Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, was concerned about
intervening on Mr. Stone’s behalf, according to the people close to the
discussions. One of the few within the White House who backed clemency
was Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser and an old friend
of Mr. Stone’s. Mr. Kudlow spends more time with Mr. Trump than many
other advisers.

“Mr. Stone is incredibly honored that President Trump used his awesome
and unique power under the Constitution of the United States for this
act of mercy,” Grant Smith, Mr. Stone’s lawyer, said after the
announcement. “Mr. and Mrs. Stone appreciate all the consideration the
president gave to this matter.”

Mr. Stone has been one of the most flamboyant rogues in American
politics for decades, maintaining a wardrobe of more than 100 suits,
bleaching his hair, posing for photographs half-naked and cheerfully
engaging in dirty tricks that others would disavow. He made political
contributions to a Republican challenger to President Richard M. Nixon
in 1972 under the name of the Young Socialist Alliance and hired an
operative to try to infiltrate the campaign of George McGovern, the
Democratic candidate.

He was accused of leaving a threatening, profanity-laced voice mail
message for the father of Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York, resulting in
Mr. Stone’s resignation. But he later got his revenge on Mr. Spitzer by
claiming credit for spreading the rumor that the governor wore black
dress socks during sexual escapades with prostitutes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

An unapologetic admirer of Mr. Nixon who even had the disgraced
president’s face tattooed on his back, Mr. Stone also worked for other
major Republican candidates, including President Ronald Reagan, Gov.
Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey and Senator Bob Dole, the party’s 1996
nominee for president.

Mr. Stone’s history of scandals and dirty tricks did not trouble Mr.
Trump. Mr. Stone is not only Mr. Trump’s longest-serving political
adviser, but has been integral to most of his political activities over
the past three decades.

He was there when the celebrity real estate developer first wrote “The
Art of the Deal” in 1987 and a makeshift effort in New Hampshire was
made to draft Mr. Trump to run for president. He helped organize Mr.
Trump’s speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011
when he declared himself against abortion rights. And he helped map out
the first days of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign before quitting over its
direction. The falling out was sour, part of a roller-coaster,
feud-and-friends relationship between the two men that played out over
the years. At one point, Mr. Trump called Mr. Stone a “stone-cold
loser,” and aides later said the president viewed him as a
self-promoter.

But after Mr. Stone was indicted, the president repeatedly assailed the
prosecutors, judge and even jury forewoman, hinting at a possible
pardon. “Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly,” Mr. Trump
said after the sentencing in February. “This has not been a fair
process.”

Mr. Stone was sentenced against a backdrop of upheaval at the Justice
Department not seen for decades. Four career prosecutors recommended
that he be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison, citing advisory
sentencing guidelines. After Mr. Trump attacked the recommendation on
Twitter, [Attorney General William P. Barr overruled
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/roger-stone-sentencing.html).
Mr. Trump then publicly applauded him for doing so, even though the
attorney general said he made the decision on his own and criticized the
president on television for undercutting his credibility.

The prosecutors [withdrew from the
case](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/roger-stone-sentencing.html)
in protest, and one quit the department entirely. At Mr. Stone’s
sentencing hearing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia called the situation
“unprecedented.” Without naming him, [she
suggested](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/roger-stone-40-months-sentencing-verdict.html)
that the president had tried to influence the course of justice by
publicly attacking her, the jurors and the Justice Department lawyers.

“The dismay and disgust at any attempt to interfere with the efforts of
prosecutors and members of the judiciary to fulfill their duty should
transcend party,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[In an interview with ABC
News](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/attorney-general-william-barr-defends-justice-department-claims/story%3fid=71680447)
this week, Mr. Barr defended both the original prosecution of Mr. Stone
as well as his own intervention to reduce the punishment, saying the
case itself was “righteous” but the sentencing recommendation
“excessive.”

Mr. Stone, who lives in Florida, had been ordered earlier to report to
the Bureau of Prisons by June 30 to begin serving his sentence. He
sought a two-month delay, citing the coronavirus pandemic sweeping
through federal prisons, but Judge Jackson [granted him only a two-week
reprieve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/roger-stone-prison.html),
noting that the prison he was to report to was “unaffected” by the
outbreak.

Two other former aides to Mr. Trump who were convicted of federal crimes
were released from prison to serve out their sentences under home arrest
because of the pandemic.

Mr. Cohen, who broke with Mr. Trump and publicly accused him of vast
wrongdoing, [was
released](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/nyregion/michael-cohen-coronavirus-prison-release.html)
from a federal prison camp in May, but [taken back into
custody](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/nyregion/michael-cohen-arrested.html)
this week after refusing to agree to terms of his home confinement that
would have forced him to scrub a tell-all book he planned to publish in
September. He was serving a [three-year sentence
for](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html)
campaign finance violations and other crimes related to a scheme to pay
hush money during the 2016 race to two women who said they had affairs
with Mr. Trump, which the president has denied.

Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, [was also
released](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-released-coronavirus.html)
in May from a central Pennsylvania prison, where he was serving a
seven-and-a-half year sentence for bank and tax fraud. He is now
confined at home.

Mr. Trump has suggested he might issue clemency to other associates, and
the extended statement released by the White House on Friday night
sought to make the case that the Russia investigation was so
illegitimate that charges resulting from it were themselves invalid.

“These charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and
malice,” the statement said. “This is why the out-of-control Mueller
prosecutors, desperate for splashy headlines to compensate for a failed
investigation, set their sights on Mr. Stone.”

Peter Baker and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Maggie
Haberman from New York.
