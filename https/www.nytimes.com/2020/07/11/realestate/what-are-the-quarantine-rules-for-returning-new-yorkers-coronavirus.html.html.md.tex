Those coming from a restricted state must isolate, but you can't be
barred from entering your own building.

\textbf{Q: I have been staying in Florida during the pandemic, but am
now planning to return to my Manhattan co-op. Do the quarantine
restrictions apply to New York residents? If I inform my co-op that I've
been in Florida, could they keep me from coming back to my apartment, or
stop me from leaving if I need to go out to get groceries?}

\textbf{A:}\href{https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory}{The
travel restrictions} apply to anyone coming into New York from an
affected state who will be staying for more than 24 hours, with
exceptions for essential workers. So, yes, the rules include New York
residents. As of July 7, the restrictions affected 19 states that are
hot spots around the country. Travelers are expected to self-quarantine,
following Department of Health guidelines. Violate the rules and you
could be subject to fines up to \$10,000 or imprisonment up to 15 days.

Your co-op cannot prohibit you from entering your own apartment
building. But state reopening guidelines give building management wide
latitude for visitors, so the board may be able to prohibit a guest
coming from an affected state.

``I dealt with a shareholder who had their son and his girlfriend coming
up from Florida,'' said Steven D. Sladkus, a real estate lawyer and a
partner at the Manhattan law firm Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg
Atlas. ``We had management contact the shareholder and say that they
were more than welcome to stay if they properly quarantined. But if they
can't, they cannot stay here.'' The couple subsequently left.

You should tell building management that you were recently in Florida
and need to self-quarantine, as the building will need to make
arrangements to collect your trash and deliver food and essentials to
your door. Management does not want you walking down the hall to the
trash chute, or passing in and out of the lobby to go to the grocery
store.

``You certainly have a moral and ethical obligation and so far as a
legal one too, to disclose the fact that you have just returned from a
hot-spot state,'' Mr. Sladkus said.

The
\href{https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/nys-covid-travel-advisory-faq.pdf}{self-quarantine
rules} require you to stay in your apartment during the entire 14 days.
If there are other members of your household who were not in Florida
with you, you would need to stay away from them, in an enclosed room
with a bathroom that you do not share. If you leave your apartment
during the time, building staff or a neighbor could report you to the
city Health Department by calling 311 or file a complaint with the state
\href{https://mylicense.custhelp.com/app/ask}{online} or by calling
833-789-0470.
