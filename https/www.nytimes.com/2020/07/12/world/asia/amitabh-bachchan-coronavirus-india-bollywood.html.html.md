NEW DELHI — When this country’s biggest film star, Amitabh Bachchan,
announced Saturday night that he had contracted the coronavirus, a loud
alarm bell rang across India.

Mr. Bachchan, known as Big B, is not simply an enormously successful
actor. He is one of India’s most revered figures. His face and rich,
avuncular voice, dripping with gravitas, are everywhere, deployed in ads
for household products, voice-overs at museums and countless public
service campaigns. He was recently roped into doing a campaign on — what
else? — the coronavirus.

The worry was that if Big B could catch the virus, anybody could, and
with India getting walloped by Covid-19, Mr. Bachchan, 77, [said on
Twitter on
Saturday](https://twitter.com/SrBachchan/status/1282002456063295490):
“All that have been in close proximity to me in the last 10 days are
requested to please get themselves tested\!”

India is now racking up more new reported infections each day — about
30,000 — than any other country except the United States and Brazil —
and it is rapidly catching up to Brazil. India now has the third-highest
total cases after the United States and Brazil.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The authorities in several big Indian cities and states are reinstating
quarantines after attempting to loosen things up to stimulate a
critically wounded economy. The borders between states are again being
rigorously patrolled, with visitors shunted off to isolation centers.

International travel is still blocked. Hospitals are overflowing with
the sick. Even emergencies are being turned away. [One pregnant woman
was left to
die](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/world/asia/coronavirus-india-hospitals-pregnant.html)
in the back of an ambulance a few weeks ago after being rejected from
eight hospitals in 15 hours.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to lift spirits by saying
in televised speeches that India is still doing better than richer
countries, especially when it comes to the death rate. India has
reported about 16 coronavirus-related deaths per million people, while
the United States, Brazil, Spain and Italy have all lost hundreds per
million.

Experts think this might be for a few reasons. India’s average age,
around 28, is younger than that of other countries. Obesity is less
prevalent, too, and many doctors believe that obesity creates a greater
vulnerability to the coronavirus. Some medical professionals also
believe that Indians have strong immune systems because of [their
constant exposure to
microbes](http://www.pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=126323&sid=1),
living in cities that are not as clean as cities in the West.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another explanation, though, might simply be testing — or the lack of
it. India has performed far fewer coronavirus tests per capita than many
other countries
have.

Either way, the Indian authorities keep coming up with innovative ways
to fight the virus. At airports, for instance, video cameras have been
installed that enable security officers to check passengers’ boarding
passes remotely to minimize face-to-face contact. The officers who use
electromagnetic wands to screen passengers now use wands attached to
four-foot rubber poles to maintain distance. And many Indians, even the
poorest, have been wearing face masks for months.

India’s biggest enemy is the density of its population. This country has
dozens of cities with more than a million people. Even in smaller towns
and villages, many families live in cramped quarters, eight or even 10
people to a room, which makes a highly contagious illness like the
coronavirus very hard to stop.

In many of these areas, it is impossible to maintain social distancing.
In recent weeks, Mumbai, one of India’s most-packed cities and home to
Mr. Bachchan, the movie star, has especially struggled.

The virus started out in Mumbai’s wealthier neighborhoods among the
jet-setter crowd. Then it [swept through the
slums](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/world/asia/mumbai-lockdown-coronavirus.html).
Now it is gnawing through the entire city, home to 20 million.

On Saturday night, [Mr. Bachchan announced via
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SrBachchan/status/1282002456063295490) —
where he has 43.2 million followers — that he had tested positive. He
was soon admitted to Nanavati Hospital, near the exclusive Juhu
neighborhood in Mumbai where he lives, overlooking the Arabian Sea.

It appears that several of his family members have fallen sick as well.

His son, Abhishek Bachchan, also an actor, disclosed that he had
contracted the coronavirus. Abhishek’s wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, an
actress and model, tested positive, as did their 8-year-old daughter,
Aaradhya.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All seemed to have mild symptoms, officials said.

The illness in the illustrious Bachchan clan was such big news that the
health minister of Maharashtra State issued a Twitter post about it at
4:30 a.m.
Sunday.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

It is hard to overstate how big Big B really is. Walk through just about
any city in India, and there is his handsome, gray-bearded face staring
down from a billboard or a railway bridge, advertising a new phone app
or chocolate bar or public health campaign.

The son of a renowned poet, Mr. Bachchan is celebrated for his mastery
of language and diction. He has acted in more than 200 films over the
past 50 years — and he is still working and drawing admirers. Until the
coronavirus lockdown brought life to a screeching halt this spring,
thousands of fans would camp out in front of his Mumbai mansion nearly
every Sunday, hoping to get a glimpse of him. Mr. Bachchan would step
out from his gates for a few minutes and stand on a stool and graciously
wave.

“He’s like god,” said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a filmmaker who has
worked with Mr. Bachchan. “I’ve never seen a star having such power,
such credibility. He’s the biggest superstar this country has ever, ever
seen.”

Part of Mr. Bachchan’s appeal, Mr. Dungarpur said, was that, for half a
century, Mr. Bachchan has carefully chosen roles where he is fighting
against all odds, taking on the system, getting justice for the common
man. He is also very civically minded and has helped out with many
real-life causes.

Mr. Dungarpur, who runs a [film preservation
foundation](https://filmheritagefoundation.co.in/) to save heritage
films across South Asia, said Mr. Bachchan had helped him immensely,
serving as the foundation’s brand ambassador.

His contracting of the coronavirus might create more fear across India.
But it could also help take away some of the stigma that infected
Indians have endured, evidenced by people kicked out of their
neighborhoods and a [few even driven to
suicide](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/illness-triggers-social-stigma-and-suicide-in-southern-tamil-nadu-11586884992752.html).

Mr. Dungarpur predicted that a lot of Indians would find his struggle
inspiring and say to themselves, “If Amitabh Bachchan can fight this, so
can we.”
