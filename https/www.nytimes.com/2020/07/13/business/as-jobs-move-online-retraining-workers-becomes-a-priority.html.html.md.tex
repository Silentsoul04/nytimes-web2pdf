Economists, business leaders and labor experts have warned for years
that a coming wave of automation and digital technology would upend the
work force, destroying some jobs while altering how and where work is
done for nearly everyone.

In the past four months,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus}{the coronavirus
pandemic} has transformed some of those predictions into reality. By
May, half of Americans were working from home, tethered to their
employers via laptops and Wi-Fi, up from 15 percent pre-pandemic,
according to \href{https://www.brynjolfsson.com/remotework/}{a recent
study}.

The rapid change is leading to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/business/coronavirus-retraining-workers.html}{mounting
demands} for training programs for millions of workers. On their own,
some of the proposals are modest. But combined they could cost tens of
billions of dollars, in what would be one of the most ambitious
retraining efforts in generations.

A group of mainly corporate executives and educators advising the Trump
administration on work force policy called for
\href{https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/AWPABCalltoActionFINAL051520.pdf}{``immediate
and unprecedented investments in American workers,''}both for training
and help in finding jobs. And even before the pandemic, former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
\href{https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1183170484269174784}{had
proposed investing \$50 billion} in work force training.

In Congress, there is
\href{https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/5/klobuchar-sasse-booker-scott-introduce-legislation-to-help-unemployed-american-workers-access-skills-training-programs-during-coronavirus-pandemic}{bipartisan
support} for giving jobless workers a \$4,000 training credit.

``This is the moment when we should make a significant public
investment,'' said David Autor, a labor economist at M.I.T., ``when we
should have a Marshall Plan for ourselves.''
