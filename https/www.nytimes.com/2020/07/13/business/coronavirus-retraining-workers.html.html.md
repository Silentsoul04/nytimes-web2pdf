Economists, business leaders and labor experts have warned for years
that a coming wave of automation and digital technology would upend the
work force, destroying some jobs while altering how and where work is
done for nearly everyone.

In the past four months, [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) has
transformed some of those predictions into reality. By May, half of
Americans were working from home, tethered to their employers via
laptops and Wi-Fi, up from 15 percent before the pandemic, according to
[a recent study](https://www.brynjolfsson.com/remotework/).

The rapid change is leading to mounting demands — including from
typically opposing groups, like Republicans and Democrats, and business
executives and labor leaders — for training programs for millions of
workers. On their own, some of the proposals are modest. But combined
they could cost tens of billions of dollars, in what would be one of the
most ambitious retraining efforts in generations.

“This is the moment when we should make a significant public
investment,” said David Autor, a labor economist at M.I.T., “when we
should have a Marshall Plan for ourselves.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A group of mainly corporate executives and educators advising the Trump
administration on work force policy called for [“immediate and
unprecedented investments in American
workers,”](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/AWPABCalltoActionFINAL051520.pdf)both
for training and help in finding jobs. And even before the pandemic,
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. [had proposed investing $50
billion](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1183170484269174784) in
work force training.

In Congress, there is [bipartisan
support](https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/5/klobuchar-sasse-booker-scott-introduce-legislation-to-help-unemployed-american-workers-access-skills-training-programs-during-coronavirus-pandemic)
for giving jobless workers a $4,000 training credit.

The Markle Foundation has proposed [federally funded “opportunity
accounts](https://www.markle.org/stimulus-american-opportunity)” of up
to $15,000 for workers to spend on training. Union leaders have helped
the administration in an effort to expand federal apprenticeship
programs to a wide range of industries.

Past downturns have brought increased government aid for workers and
training programs. But labor experts say they have tended to be policies
that recede once the economy recovers, as happened after the 2008
financial crisis, rather than becoming national priorities.

“The Great Recession was a lost opportunity,” said Lawrence Katz, an
economist at Harvard University. “Now, are we going to take this moment
to help low-wage workers move into the middle class and give them skills
to thrive? Or are they just going to go back to low-wage jobs that are
dead ends?”

In the coronavirus economy, companies are adopting more automation, as
they seek to cut costs and increase efficiency. There is debate about
which jobs are most at risk and how soon. But climbing up the skills
ladder is the best way to stay ahead of the automation wave.

Middle-class jobs in today’s economy often require some digital skills
but are not considered tech jobs. Data scientists at LinkedIn, a
Microsoft subsidiary, recently mined millions of job listings to
identify [10 occupations most in
demand](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/30/microsoft-launches-initiative-to-help-25-million-people-worldwide-acquire-the-digital-skills-needed-in-a-covid-19-economy/)
in recent years and likely to remain so. The list included project
manager, sales representative, customer service specialist and graphic
designer — nontech jobs that have been transformed by
technology.

Researchers at the Markle Foundation, in [a report published last
year,](https://www.markle.org/digitalblindspot) studied the pace of
digital tools moving into occupations during the previous decade. The
fastest rates of digitization were in jobs in retail, warehouses and
health care. So a training path might be to help a home health worker
acquire the skills to become a medical technician.

Job training in America has often been ineffective, with programs shaped
by local politics and money spent according to the number of people in
courses rather than hiring outcomes. The United States also spends less
than other nations on government employment, training and other labor
services. As a percentage of economic activity, Canada spends three
times as much, Germany about six times more and Scandinavian countries
up to more than 12 times as much, according to the [Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development](https://data.oecd.org/socialexp/public-spending-on-labour-markets.htm).

But there are encouraging pockets of success in America. Some are
nonprofit programs like [Year Up](https://www.yearup.org/), [Per
Scholas](https://perscholas.org/) and [Project
Quest](https://questsa.org/), which prepare low-income adults for
higher-paying careers in technology, health care, advanced manufacturing
or business. In recent months, these programs have quickly changed to
online teaching and coaching from in-person programming.

In addition, online training on learning networks like
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) and at digital-only institutions
like the [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/), experts
say, can be engines for upgrading the skills of many workers in America.

Two years ago, Tony Boswell, 50, decided it was time for a career change
after 14 years as a long-haul trucker. He held $100,000 in loans on his
truck and trailer, and then his engine blew and he put the $23,000
repair bill on his credit card.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I figured I had to do something else,” Mr. Boswell recalled.

At home in Kansas City, Mo., when his truck engine was being rebuilt, he
applied for a Google scholarship to pay for a three-month course in
software development on Udacity. Mr. Boswell got the scholarship and
then another one for a six-month Udacity program to become a website
programmer, saving him the $1,800 cost of the courses.

Through days and nights of effort, Mr. Boswell mastered the digital
tools of his new field. Today he works for a software development
company in Kansas City. He makes nearly $60,000 a year, substantially
more than he netted most years as a truck driver. “I have a life now,”
he said, “and a
future.”

Nearly 15 percent of people earning bachelor’s degrees in nursing in the
United States last year graduated from Western Governors University, an
online nonprofit university focused on working adults who want to learn
new skills. Sarah Williams was one of them.

For Ms. Williams, a 38-year-old working mother of three, the online
program was the only realistic option.

Wrestling with college-level statistics and organic chemistry was
daunting. But she made it through in eight months, with frequent
encouragement and help from her mentor. “No way I could have done it
alone,” Ms. Williams said.

The vital role of human assistance, delivered in person or online, by a
mentor or coach is a common thread in skills-building success stories.
Another essential element is employers being engaged as participants in
worker training.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump administration is an enthusiastic proponent of expanding the
apprenticeship concept beyond the construction and building trades. In
March, the Labor Department announced [Industry Recognized
Apprenticeship
Programs](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200310) to
foster apprenticeships in sectors like technology and health care. As a
first step, it has called on businesses to form standards-setting bodies
for apprenticeships in their industries.

Ivanka Trump, a chair of the administration’s [American Workforce Policy
Advisory
Board](https://www.commerce.gov/americanworker/american-workforce-policy-advisory-board),
is an advocate for broadening apprenticeship opportunities and making
Pell grants, for low-income students, available for noncollege skills
training and job certification programs.

The administration sees the government’s role as working with the
business community and ensuring that the public system of state and
local work force boards, which receive federal funding, are attuned to
hiring demands of the private sector.

“Re-skilling very much needs to come from business,” said John Pallasch,
assistant secretary for employment and training at the Labor Department.

Companies, labor experts say, will need to increase their investment in
enhancing the skills of their own workers. Analysts say the overall
trend has been stagnant or declining for years.

The companies that have increased spending recognize training as a
competitive necessity. [Exelon](https://www.exeloncorp.com/), a utility
holding company, whose operations serve 10 million customers in the
Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, decided it needed to make better use of
all of the data streaming off its power generators and grid.

In 2018, Exelon began an in-house education program for its managers and
engineers. The goal was to use data to cut costs, improve energy
efficiency and curb pollution. By now, 1,200 Exelon employees have
participated in the program for general knowledge, while more than 100
have gone on to acquire new technical skills.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jeffrey Swiatek, 41, altered his career path after years as a
maintenance engineer at Exelon. “The engineering paradigm has shifted,”
said Mr. Swiatek, who had been trained as a mechanical engineer. “We
have all this data
now.”

Over several months, Mr. Swiatek took seven courses on Coursera,
learning the coding language Python, as well as the basics of machine
learning and data visualization. He got a half-day off each week, but
still had his regular job. Mostly, he did the coursework on nights and
weekends.

Mr. Swiatek has used his new skills to write software that can help
predict when equipment needs maintenance — technology that is projected
to save the company $1 million over eight years. In December, Mr.
Swiatek became a principal quantitative engineer, a promotion with a
raise, broader responsibilities and brighter career prospects.

Exelon calls its approach to training “co-investing” — the company
contributes, but the employee acquires new skills largely on his or her
own time. If Mr. Swiatek departs for another company in a few years, the
investment still probably pays off for Exelon.

But the mobile labor force is one of the central issues in corporate
training: The company that invests in a worker’s training may not reap
the benefit. To offset that risk, one proposal is to offer tax credits
to companies for money spent to upgrade the skills of their workers.

“There are various ways to do it, but ultimately you are going to need
public investment,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of
the Digital Economy Lab at Stanford University. “Training is not
something that can be just left to the private sector.”
