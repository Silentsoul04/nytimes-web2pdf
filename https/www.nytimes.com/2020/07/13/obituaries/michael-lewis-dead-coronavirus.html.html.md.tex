65}\label{michael-lewis-who-forged-a-new-life-after-prison-dies-at-65}}

Mr. Lewis counseled newly released inmates on how to adjust to life on
the outside, using a simple orange bag to make his point. He died of the
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

After her father, Michael W. Lewis, died of the coronavirus on May 14 in
Fort Worth, Tamara Griffin was sorting through the belongings in his
home. One discovery puzzled her.

``As I'm cleaning up his things, I see all these backpacks,'' she said
in a phone interview. ``And I thought, `Why are these backpacks here?'
And you'd open it up and see food and toothpaste.''

One of his friends explained the mystery.

``He would ride around and give these backpacks to homeless people,''
said Ms. Griffin, who confirmed his death.

That man distributing backpacks to the less fortunate had come a long
way from the father Ms. Griffin knew --- or, often, didn't know --- when
she was growing up. He frequently wasn't around because he was in
prison.

``He spent several decades in and out,'' Ms. Griffin said, ``and I know
this to be true because he was in and out of my life.''

But in recent years Mr. Lewis, who was 65 at his death, had turned
things around. In addition to his personal backpack project, he had for
some six years been volunteering with
\href{https://www.facebook.com/WelcomeBackTC/}{Welcome Back Tarrant
County}, a nonprofit organization that helps newly released inmates
readjust to life outside prison.

Jerry Cabluck, founder and director of that group, said Welcome Back had
helped Mr. Lewis when he was released from his latest prison stay, at
Huntsville, Texas. The organization found a bicycle for him so that he
could get to work, and soon Mr. Lewis completed a long-interrupted
college degree at Tarrant County College. And he became a volunteer at
Welcome Home, counseling others coming out of prison.

``We saw 2,000, 2,500 a year, and this man was the exception,'' Mr.
Cabluck said in a phone interview. ``He became a role model.''

Michael Wayne Lewis was born on July 24, 1954, and grew up in Oklahoma
City. Ms. Griffin said he had fallen in with the wrong crowd there and
had first gone to prison on a minor drug charge. That began a cycle of
repeated incarcerations that continued until, she said, he made a
conscious decision to break it.

``He honestly said he didn't want to die in jail,'' she said.

After completing his degree he worked as a mental health resource
assistant. He also had a business selling and delivering smoked meats as
well as a lawn-care business.

``He was a hard worker and wasn't afraid of a little dirt,'' Ms. Griffin
said.

Mr. Cabluck said Mr. Lewis had made a particularly strong impression
when he spoke to groups of the newly released because of a keepsake of
sorts that he had retained from his own incarceration.

``Upon release, they give you an orange bag,'' Mr. Cabluck said,
something to hold an inmate's few belongings. ``He kept that, and he
would always use that. He'd be talking to a group of 20, 30, 40 men, and
he'd pull that bag out, and he'd say: `Do you want this bag again? Do
you want to go back? Do you want to go through all the drudgery of being
incarcerated?'

``And that got their attention. Most of the guys, they threw that bag
away.''

In 2016, when Welcome Back
\href{https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/news/2016_vol_gov_awards/welcome_back_tarrant_county.html}{received
a state award} for its work, Mr. Lewis was among the volunteers and
staff members who traveled to Austin to accept it.

Ms. Griffin summed up her father's life.

``It's not how you start the race,'' she said, ``it's how you finish the
race.''
