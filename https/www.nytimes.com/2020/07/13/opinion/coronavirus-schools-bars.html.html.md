A brief history of the past four months in America:

Experts: Don’t rush to reopen, this isn’t over.

Donald Trump: LIBERATE\!

Covid-19: Wheee\!

Trump officials: Here’s our [opposition
research](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/fauci-trump-coronavirus.html)
on Anthony Fauci.

And we’re now faced with an agonizing choice: Do we reopen schools,
creating risks of a further viral explosion, or do we keep children
home, with severe negative effects on their learning?

None of this had to happen. Other countries stuck with their lockdowns
long enough to reduce infections to rates much lower than those
prevailing here; Covid-19 death rates per capita in the [European
Union](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1282656106762952705) are
only a 10th those in the United States — and falling — while ours are
rising fast. As a result, they’re in a position to reopen schools fairly
safely.

<div class="css-1q1hscp">

<div id="PK">

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the experience of the Northeast, the first major epicenter of the
U.S. pandemic, shows that we could have achieved something similar here.
Death rates are [way
down](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-deaths), although
still higher than in Europe; on Saturday, for the first time since
March, New York City reported
[zero](https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/july-11-was-nycs-first-day-without-a-covid-19-death-in-four-months/)
Covid-19 deaths.

Would a longer lockdown have been economically sustainable? Yes.

It’s true that strong social distancing requirements led to high
unemployment and hurt many businesses. But even America, with its
ramshackle social safety net, was able to provide enough disaster relief
— don’t call it stimulus\! — to protect most of its citizens from severe
hardship.

Thanks largely to expanded unemployment benefits, poverty didn’t soar
during the lockdown. By some measures it may even have [gone
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty.html).

True, there were holes in that safety net, and many people did suffer.
But we could have patched those holes. Yes, emergency relief costs a lot
of money, but we can afford it: The federal government has been
borrowing huge sums, but interest rates have remained near historical
lows.

Put it this way: At its most severe, the lockdown seems to have reduced
G.D.P. by a [little over 10
percent](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/weekly-economic-index).
During World War II, America spent more than 30 percent of G.D.P. on
[defense](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/),
for more than three years. Why couldn’t we absorb a much smaller cost
for a few months?

So doing what was necessary to bring the coronavirus under control would
have been annoying, but entirely feasible.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak

#### Back to School

Updated Aug. 8, 2020

The latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.

  -   - Health experts say New York State schools are [in a good
        position to
        reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/health/coronavirus-ny-schools-reopen.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup),
        and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has [cleared the
        way](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup).
      - Many schools spent the summer focused on reopening classrooms.
        What if they had [focused on improving remote
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/remote-learning-fall-2020.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)
        instead?
      - A mother in Germany describes how her family [coped with the
        anxiety and
        uncertainty](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/parenting/germany-schools-reopening-children.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)
        of going back to school there.
      - A high school freshman tested positive after two days in class.
        A yearbook editor worries about access to sporting events. We
        spoke to students about [what school is like in the age of
        Covid-19.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-students.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)

But that was the road not taken. Instead, many states not only rushed to
reopen, they reopened stupidly. Instead of being treated as a cheap,
effective way to fight contagion, face masks became a front in the
culture war. Activities that posed an obvious risk of feeding the
pandemic went unchecked: Large gatherings were permitted, bars reopened.

And the cost of those parties and open bars extends beyond the thousands
of Americans who will be killed or suffer permanent health damage as a
result of Covid-19’s resurgence. The botched reopening has also
endangered something that, unlike drinking in groups, can’t be suspended
without doing long-run damage: in-person education.

Some activities hold up fairly well when moved online. I suspect that
there will be a lot fewer people flying cross-country to stare at
PowerPoints than there were pre-Covid, even once we finally beat this
virus.

Education isn’t one of those activities. We now have overwhelming
confirmation of something we already suspected: For many, perhaps most
students there is no substitute for actually being in a classroom.

But rooms full of students are potential Petri dishes, even if the young
are less likely to die from Covid-19 than the old. Other countries have
managed to reopen schools [relatively
safely](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/health/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html)
— but they did so with much lower infection rates than currently prevail
in America, and with adequate testing, which we still [don’t
have](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/13-states-now-report-coronavirus-testing-issues-echo/story?id=71698974)
in many hot spots.

So we’re now facing a terrible, unnecessary dilemma. If we reopen
in-person education, we risk feeding an out-of-control pandemic. If we
don’t, we impair the development of millions of American students,
inflicting long-term damage on their lives and careers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the reason we’re in this position is that states, cheered on by the
Trump administration, rushed to allow large parties and reopen bars. In
a real sense America drank away its children’s future.

Now what? At this point there are probably as many [infected
Americans](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1282028088658976768) as
there were in March. So what we should be doing is admitting that we
blew it, and doing a severe lockdown all over again — and this time
listening to the experts before reopening. Unfortunately, it’s now too
late to avoid disrupting education, but the sooner we deal with this the
sooner we can get our society back on track.

But we don’t have the kind of leaders we need. Instead, we have the
likes of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, politicians
who refuse to listen to experts and never admit having been wrong.

So while there have been a few grudging policy adjustments, the main
response we’re seeing to colossal policy failure is a hysterical attempt
to shift the blame. Some officials are trying to besmirch Dr. Fauci’s
reputation; others are diving into unhinged [conspiracy
theories](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1282343525103939586).

As a result, the outlook is grim. This pandemic is going to get worse
before it gets better, and the nation will suffer permanent damage.
