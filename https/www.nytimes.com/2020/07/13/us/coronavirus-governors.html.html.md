HOUSTON — Governors have always been judged on their disaster responses,
but the coronavirus wreaking havoc across the country these days does
not recede like floodwaters and cannot be tamed by calling out the
National Guard.

The states’ chief executives have been tested for the very virus that
keeps testing them — politically, personally, logistically. And they
have been forced onto the national and global stage in a way few
governors have ever endured — an unending and very public test on a
highly scientific and ever-shifting subject with the lives of their
constituents, the economies of their states and their political careers
at stake.

Tate Reeves has been the governor of Mississippi for just under six
months. During that time, he has had a very full plate: [deadly
tornadoes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/tornado-storm-south.html),
[the flooding of the capital city of
Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/16/us/mississippi-flood-jackson.html),
[violence in the state
prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/us/mississippi-prisons.html),
[a vote to take down the
flag](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/mississippi-confederate-flag.html)
with the Confederate battle emblem.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the coronavirus has eclipsed all of that, and in recent days, the
virus was threatening the Statehouse and his own house a few blocks
away.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Reeves, 46, was tested for the virus, as were his wife and three
daughters. The tests came back negative, but many of his colleagues at
the Mississippi State Capitol were not as lucky — the virus has infected
26 lawmakers, including the lieutenant governor and the House speaker.
Cases have surged statewide — the state has averaged more than 700 new
cases daily — and intensive care units at many of the state’s largest
hospitals are near capacity.

“I have taken to replacing sleeping with praying,” Mr. Reeves, an
accountant before he got into politics, told reporters.

The pandemic has put Mr. Reeves, a Republican, and many of America’s
governors of both parties under a spotlight for which none of their
aides and consultants have a playbook. Interviews with aides, advisers
and others involved in the coronavirus response efforts of seven
governors revealed just how much the crisis has upended their offices,
their lives, and how they approach the job. For some, it has magnified
their weaknesses and drawn out tensions even within their own parties.

The crisis reached a boiling point this month for some governors, as the
virus spread and deaths increased in a swath of states that governors
had reopened. By this week, the outbreak was growing across 39 states,
from hot spots across the Sun Belt to new surges emerging in the
nation’s middle. Florida reported the highest single-day total of new
virus cases of any state — more than 15,000 — since the start of the
pandemic. And leaders in some places, including one county in Texas,
have been calling for a return of stay-at-home orders amid surges of new
virus cases.

Reversing course — a practice governors prefer not to be seen doing —
has become routine in the age of coronavirus on policies around masks,

Mr. Reeves had once been eager to lift the restrictions stalling
Mississippi’s economy, hoping to have the whole state open by July 1.
Now, he has been warning residents of a “slow-moving disaster” and made
masks mandatory in 13 of the hardest-hit counties.

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, was adamant for weeks that
government could not mandate masks. Just before the Fourth of July
weekend, as cases and hospitalizations skyrocketed, he swiftly reversed,
ordering all Texans to cover their faces in most
situations.

Minutes before the announcement, he held a conference call with
lawmakers, many of them irate Republicans who have grown weary of his
mandates, flip-flops and rushed, behind-the-scenes calls.

“He is doing all this on his own, as far as I can tell, with little to
no input,” said State Representative Jonathan Stickland, a conservative
from the Fort Worth suburbs who was on the call and said lawmakers were
not permitted to ask any questions. “It’s a one-way conversation. The
last time I checked we didn’t elect a king in Texas.”

The seven governors whose crisis moments were reviewed by The New York
Times — Mr. Reeves of Mississippi; Mr. Abbott of Texas; Gov. Jay Inslee
of Washington State; Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida; Gov. Gavin Newsom of
California; Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas; and Gov. David Ige of Hawaii —
have been scrambling in ways large and small, in manners seen and unseen
by the public.  
  
Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, managed the crisis without the guidance of some
members of his staff on various days last week, including his chief of
staff. They had to take a day off for furloughs — a requirement as the
state grapples with financial shortfalls caused by the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Abbott has had his deputy chief of staff talk to the head of the
Texas Restaurant Association to relay the latest developments, but Mr.
DeSantis in Florida — whose wife, Casey, gave birth in late March to
their third child — often gets on the line himself.

“I don’t get a heads up from the governor that he’s going to call, he
just calls,” said David M. Kerner, the mayor of Palm Beach County. “At
first it caught me off guard.”

Ms. Kelly, the Democratic governor of Kansas, has kept her circle of
pandemic advisers small, relying largely on the expertise of her top
health official.

Hawaii’s Democratic governor, Mr. Ige, was criticized, according to
local news reports, for keeping his inner circle too small by excluding
the lieutenant governor, who happened to be a practicing emergency room
physician. Early in the pandemic, Mr. Ige’s administration was reluctant
to expand testing, but Lt. Gov. Josh Green wanted an aggressive
expansion. In an interview, Mr. Ige attributed the tension to
“misunderstanding and miscommunication,” and said the lieutenant
governor had been continuously involved in the
response.

This is a crisis that governors are managing remotely.

On Thursday morning, Mr. Inslee settled at a kitchen table inside the
governor’s mansion in Olympia, Wash., for a series of videoconference
meetings. To get the tablet screen up to eye level, the governor placed
it on top of a book — “A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White
House.” He used an album, Judy Collins’s “Strangers Again,” to prop it
at an angle that worked. On the couch nearby, Mr. Inslee’s wife, Trudi,
read a copy of The Seattle Times.

Such are the coronavirus war rooms of state chief executives.

Mr. DeSantis, who has been criticized for reopening Florida too fast and
for not issuing a statewide mask mandate, was perhaps the most mobile of
the seven governors, leaving home frequently to attend public events. He
held three news conferences in three cities in a single week, often
wearing a mask that he slipped off when he spoke at the microphone. Mr.
Inslee, by comparison, has taken to wearing his mask even during video
news conferences, his voice muffled as a
result.

Without a coordinated federal response, governors find themselves in an
awkward role, appearing to wield much of the decision-making around
managing the crisis, but also expected to hear out and satisfy the
wishes of mayors, restaurant owners, emergency medical workers and
everyone else. The result: all sorts of new coronavirus committees and
task forces — and bureaucratic
snarls.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Even with so much advice, governors seemed to be making it up as they
go.

Dr. Lee A. Norman, the secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment and a colonel in the Kansas Army National Guard, said the
coronavirus crisis reminded him of his deployments in the Middle East in
that he and Governor Kelly have had to make decisions without as much
data as they would like. Kansas has averaged more than 400 cases per day
over the past week, its highest numbers yet. Infections have risen
around Wichita, Topeka and the Kansas City suburbs.

“This very much has that same feel,” he said of his experience in the
military and with the virus. “We’re making decisions before we have
complete information and we have to use our best data and judgment and
make bold decisions.”

In California, Mr. Newsom awakens early with his children on most days
and starts emailing his staff by 6 a.m. He dons a mask and works not out
of the domed Capitol in Sacramento, but out of the California Office of
Emergency Services command center, a complex in the suburb of
Carmichael, Calif., where he and his family
live.

Mornings are for meetings and prep for the noon livestream news
conference that Mr. Newsom has done almost daily since the start of the
pandemic. The Capitol press corps calls the news conferences “Newsom at
Noon” and for a while some swapped bingo cards with his go-to phrases:
“Bend the curve.” “Meet the moment.” “Localism is determinative.”

California acted early to impose a stay-at-home order but the virus,
after appearing under control, is on the upswing. That is no surprise to
Mr. Newsom, who says that the early shutdown helped the state prepare.

“It bought us time to build out our health care delivery system,” Mr.
Newsom said in an interview this month. The state has wrestled with a
surge in cases; Los Angeles County alone has been averaging more than
2,600 cases per day.

For Mr. Reeves in Mississippi, who was sworn in on Jan. 14, one of his
challenges has been in publicly shifting his pandemic posture, from
being eager to reopen the economy to urging caution and toughening
restrictions.

He has spent much of his time in recent days ringing alarm bells he had
ignored for weeks, telling reporters on Wednesday that the “situation
that we have feared is upon us” and urging people to wear a mask and
stay home as much as possible.

“He’s dealt with more emergencies than most elected officials deal with
in their entire time in office, and this has been like no other,” said
Pat Fontaine, who is the executive director of the Mississippi
Hospitality and Restaurant Association and who has been in regular
contact with the governor’s
office.

At some daily briefings, Mr. Reeves has wished a happy birthday to
Mississippians: Alex, Brianna, Alana, Mariah, Asher and Billy. One day,
he pointed out that one boy was a green belt in karate. And then he came
to Ian Sylvester.

“Ian Sylvester loves his dog Happy,” Mr. Reeves said, after looking up
from his notes. “Everyone these days needs a dog named Happy.”

Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, Rick Rojas from Jackson, Miss.,
Shawn Hubler from Sacramento, and Mike Baker from Seattle. Contributing
reporting were Frances Robles from Key West, Fla., Simon Romero from
Albuquerque, and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York.
