A Trump administration effort to force foreign college students to take
in-person classes in the fall or lose their visas has prompted a
high-stakes legal battle between the White House and some of America’s
top universities, with 17 states and the District of Columbia joining
the fray on Monday in a lawsuit that calls the policy “senseless and
cruel.”

The visa guidelines, issued a week ago, would upend months of careful
planning by colleges and universities and could force many students to
return to their home countries during the pandemic, where their ability
to study would be severely compromised.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The confrontation comes as the White House is pushing colleges and K-12
schools to throw open their doors to students, even as a growing number
[decide that it’s not
safe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html).
Many universities have chosen to allow a limited number of students on
campus but to [teach most classes
virtually](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-universities-colleges-reopening.html)
— a decision that President Trump has derided as “ridiculous.” Late last
week, as his annoyance with universities grew, Mr. Trump [threatened
their nonprofit
status](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1281616586273468416).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both of which
plan mostly online classes, were the first to challenge the new visa
rules in court, saying they were hastily implemented in violation of
federal procedures. Their lawsuit last week set up a high-stakes hearing
scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, a day before the government is
requiring schools to certify that students are taking in-person classes
to meet the visa requirements.

Dozens of universities have weighed in with Harvard and M.I.T., and
California’s attorney general and several universities filed their own
suits in federal court late last week seeking to block the directive.

“The president is using foreign students as pawns to keep all schools
open, no matter the cost to the health and well-being of these students
and their communities,” said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with Public
Counsel, a legal aid organization in Los Angeles representing foreign
graduate students at three California universities. “It’s temper-tantrum
policymaking.”

The administration responded in court filings Monday that Immigration
and Customs Enforcement has the discretion to set student visa guidance,
and that just because universities don’t like the requirements doesn’t
make them against the law.

The government also pointed out that the directive allows foreign
students to take more online classes than they could have a year ago,
when only one virtual course was allowed. The agency had waived that
requirement in March, as the pandemic swept across the country and
forced college campuses to abruptly close.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Universities have argued that the state of emergency declared by the
president in March remains in effect, so the waived visa rules should,
too.

“The Trump administration didn’t even attempt to explain the basis for
this senseless rule, which forces schools to choose between keeping
their international students enrolled and protecting the health and
safety of their campuses,” Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney
general, said in a statement announcing the suit she filed Monday with
16 other states, which accuses the administration of violating the
Administrative Procedure Act.

At stake is the fate of possibly tens of thousands of students from all
over the world who are enrolled in American universities this fall,
where they represent both a major source of academic brainpower and a
vital revenue stream for institutions that face deep financial losses in
the pandemic.

The federal guidance issued July 6 has sent students scrambling to
enroll in in-person classes that are difficult to find, if they are
available at all.

Harvard Medical School’s plan to move instruction online would force
students like Ayantu Temesgen of Ethiopia to return home. But the
Ethiopian government last month shut down the country’s internet amid
deadly civil unrest, and even if it returns, the time difference would
be difficult to overcome.

“If I’m back home, I won’t be able to wake up at 3 a.m. or 2 a.m. to
attend my classes,” Ms. Temesgen said.

In their lawsuits, universities and the state attorneys general suggest
that the new guidance is part of a politically motivated attempt to
force universities to reopen, against their better judgment of the
health risks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The same day as the announcement of the administration’s reversal, the
president of the United States made repeated public statements
expressing the view that schools must reopen in the fall,” the lawsuit
filed Monday by the states says, [citing a tweet by the
president](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1280209946085339136)
saying, in all capital letters, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL\!\!\!”

The government said in its response that it had an interest in keeping
close tabs on foreign students, and allowing them to study online and
untethered from a university campus posed a security risk. “A solely
online program of study provides a nonimmigrant student with enormous
flexibility to be present anywhere in the United States for up to an
entire academic term, whether that location has been reported to the
government, which raises significant national security concerns,” it
said.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a harbinger of how the case may fare, the Supreme Court ruled in June
that the Trump administration may not immediately proceed with its [plan
to end a
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/trump-daca-dreamers-immigration.html)
protecting about 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers from
deportation. In the majority opinion, [Chief Justice John G. Roberts
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/trump-daca-supreme-court.html)
wrote that the court did not decide whether rescinding the program was
sound policy, only whether “the agency complied with the procedural
requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action.”

The dispute illustrates the seismic shifts in how education is being
delivered during the pandemic, and the consequences of that change.
Online education has achieved new primacy even at prestigious
institutions like Harvard that previously relegated it mainly to
lower-status programs like extension
courses.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

But the move to online learning has prompted immigration authorities to
ask why, if classes can be attended from anywhere in the world, students
need to be in the United States to earn their degrees.

“You don’t get a visa for taking online classes from, let’s say,
University of Phoenix. So why would you if you were just taking online
classes, generally?” the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany,
told reporters at a news conference last week.

International students say this is a narrow view of what studying abroad
is all about, and that being in the United States may lead to research
and job opportunities that ultimately enrich the country and its
economic, cultural and intellectual life.

Meeting the demands of the government’s new guidance would be extremely
difficult, universities say. Just weeks before school is scheduled to
begin, they would have to rejigger classes to make sure that hundreds of
thousands of international students would have an in-person option.

“The alternative is to lose significant numbers of students from their
campuses,” the suit filed by state attorneys general says.

The area represented by the plaintiffs contains 1,124 colleges and
universities, with some approximately 373,000 international students
enrolled in 2019, who contributed an estimated $14 billion to the
economy that year, according to the complaint.

About 40 higher education institutions filed declarations in support of
the lawsuit, including Yale, DePaul, the University of Chicago, Tufts,
Rutgers and state universities in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota and Wisconsin.
