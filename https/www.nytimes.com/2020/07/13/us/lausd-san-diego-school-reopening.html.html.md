SACRAMENTO —
[California’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/ca-schools-reopening.html)
two largest [public
school](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/ca-schools-reopening.html)
districts said on Monday that instruction would be online-only in the
fall, in the latest sign that school administrators are increasingly
unwilling to risk crowding students back into classrooms until the
coronavirus is fully under control.

The school districts in Los Angeles and San Diego, which together enroll
some 825,000 students, are the largest in the country to abandon plans
for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
August.

The decision came as Gov. Gavin Newsom [announced some of the most
sweeping rollbacks
yet](https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1282752861835649024?s=20) of
California’s plans to reopen. Indoor operations for restaurants, bars,
wineries, movie theaters and zoos were shut down statewide on Monday,
and churches, gyms, hair salons, malls and other businesses were
shuttered for four-fifths of the population.

“There’s a public health imperative to keep schools from becoming a
petri dish,” said Austin Beutner, the Los Angeles school district’s
superintendent.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The California decisions are the latest blow to President Trump’s push
to fully [reopen
schools](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html)
across the country this fall in order to get the economy moving by
enabling parents to return to workplaces. Districts, parents and
teachers have struggled to maintain the education of tens of millions of
K-12 students while keeping them and their teachers healthy and safe.

At the White House, Mr. Trump denounced the decision in Los Angeles,
arguing that schools should resume because children wanted to attend.

“Schools should be opened,” Mr. Trump said. “You’re losing a lot of
lives by keeping things closed.” It was not clear what he meant, since
public health experts say the virus spreads quickly in poorly
ventilated, closed areas, the condition of many American schools.

Across the country, school districts are taking a patchwork approach to
reopening.

[New York
City](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html),
the nation’s largest school district, announced last week that it would
provide several days per week of in-person learning, with students
working online from home the rest of the time.
[Seattle](https://www.seattleschools.org/district/calendars/news/what_s_new/coronavirus_update)
has also announced a hybrid model that is [emerging as popular
nationwide](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html),
among both large and small districts. Chicago, the nation’s
third-biggest system, has [not yet
announced](https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2020/7/9/21319042/six-things-to-watch-as-chicago-weighs-reopening-school-buildings-this-fall)
its reopening plan.

But in cities where the virus has continued to rage, efforts at
compromise solutions have increasingly proven unworkable — a shattering
realization for families that have strained for months to cobble
normalcy out of a situation that is pitting their children’s development
and education against parental livelihoods and household
health.

Mahogany Taylor, a 39-year-old mother of two and the president of the
San Diego Unified Council of PTAs, said the loss of in-person
instruction was particularly destructive for elementary school students
— many of whom cannot type — and for low-income students, who often
lack internet access, and who make up nearly 60 percent of San Diego
Unified’s students.

At the same time, Ms. Taylor said, a districtwide survey showed that 40
percent of parents already were planning to insist on remote
instruction. “We obviously believe that school is the best place for
kids,” she said, “but we also want them to be safe.”

All across the nation, school officials are trying to balance safety
against learning losses. [Initial research
showed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html)
that during the first round of [school
closures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/health/covid-school-reopening.html),
American children were set back, on average, by seven months in their
reading and math learning, with children from low-income families, and
students of color, experiencing even bigger losses.

Still, district leaders in Los Angeles and San Diego said, California
was not in a position to reopen schools.

“Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so
with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available,” the
statement said. “California has neither. The skyrocketing infection
rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under
control.”

Mr. Beutner, whose district is the nation’s second largest, said in an
interview that schools “can’t just tap our heels together” like Dorothy
in “The Wizard of Oz” and “pretend it’s appropriate to bring people
back” despite “skyrocketing” rates of new infections.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

California’s death toll from the coronavirus rose to more than 7,000
over the weekend, with 7.4 percent of test results [coming back
positive](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/) over the past two weeks, even
as testing has ramped up to more than 100,000 tests a day. The state’s
[watch list of counties where the virus has
surged](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CountyMonitoringDataStep2.aspx),
which has flagged Los Angeles and San Diego Counties, includes 30 of its
58 counties.

For the time being, Mr. Beutner said, the Los Angeles district will
maintain the online instruction it has been providing since its 700,000
students and 75,000 employees were sent home in mid-March. He said the
decision would be revisited when local infection rates have been
sufficiently lowered and public health authorities have put into place
adequate testing and contact tracing systems.

“It’s disappointing,” he said. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to
make sure everyone’s safe.”

Many parents, students and teachers are still waiting to learn whether
their districts will open this fall.

On Monday night, the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education is
expected to adopt a plan for full-time remote learning for at least the
first nine weeks of the school year.

Nashville originally planned to open five days a week, but [rolled that
back](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2020/07/09/metro-schools-academic-year-start-online-nashville-students/5383315002/)
on July 9, citing the rising number of local coronavirus cases.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools is currently asking parents to choose
between full-time remote learning and a “schoolhouse model,” which would
be in-person two to five days a week and online the rest of the time,
depending on the number of students enrolled in a building and the
amount of space available for social distancing.

Schools in New York will only reopen if the state can keep the virus
under control, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday.

The governor said he would allow reopenings only in regions of the state
that have daily infection rates under 5 percent over a two-week average.
Regions with infection rates over 9 percent over a one-week average will
not be allowed to open schools or will automatically have their schools
shuttered.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in

        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

New York City, which has maintained an average infection rate of 1 to 2
percent, is on track to partially reopen in September.

All the plans, district leaders say, are subject to change at a moment’s
notice, as public health guidance shifts or as governors make statewide
decisions.

Indeed, with the pandemic still raging across much of the country, it
has become clear that improving the quality of online learning will be
at least as important in the coming months as dealing with the logistics
of reopening physical schools.

Several other large California districts, including [Santa
Clara](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Santa-Clara-area-school-district-delays-return-to-15403000.php),
[Oakland](https://www.ousd.org/covid-19updates) and [San
Bernardino](https://www.sbcusd.com/news/what_s_new/July22020_message_from_interim_superintendent),
have already announced that they will stick, at least for the
foreseeable future, with full-time remote instruction, and the state’s
politically powerful teachers’ unions also have come out against a
return to in-person classes.

The Los Angeles teachers’ union called last week for campuses to remain
closed and for learning to be fully remote when the district resumes
classes on Aug. 18, saying Mr. Trump’s reopening push was part of a
“dangerous, anti-science agenda.” In an [informal
survey](https://www.utla.net/news/poll-results-83-utla-members-say-lausd-schools-should-not-physically-reopen-august-18)
of 18,000 United Teachers Los Angeles members that was released on
Friday, 83 percent agreed that campuses should not physically reopen.

And the state’s largest teachers’ union wrote Mr. Newsom — a Democrat
elected with their support — a [sharply worded
letter](http://image.cta-mailings.org/lib/fe8a1574766d017b7c/m/2/2167fb86-b25b-4ce3-9bc7-4248b105a80d.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2QqpANyH9HwsSJJjE1-1NyK_r8bxIcrqucygKKV1ehQ-i_JYCwt3kksZg)
last week expressing concern “that politics are being played with the
lives of children and the educators who serve them.”

“It is clear that communities and school districts have not come close
to meeting the threshold for a safe return to in-person learning, even
under a hybrid model,” the 310,000-member California Teachers
Association wrote.

Some $13.5 billion went to K-12 education from the federal relief
package passed in March by Congress. But education groups and school
districts estimate that [schools will need much more money to safely
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/schools-reopening-trump.html),
and with the economic impact of the pandemic having depleted many local
and state budgets, it is unclear where it will come from. The Trump
administration has alternately threatened to cut funds to school
districts that fail to fully reopen and reward districts that do.

As recently as late last week, leaders in San Diego Unified were
promoting their plan to reopen five days a week, in person, for all
students whose families chose that option. But the district had also
warned that the health, sanitation and educational costs of reopening
physical classrooms safely were [so
steep](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/schools-reopening-trump.html)
— a minimum of $90 million for the coming school year — that they would
not be able to do so without a significant infusion of federal dollars.

At the same time, the district’s teachers’ union was arguing that
reopening during an alarming increase in coronavirus cases was unwise,
and would [put teachers’ health at
risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/us/virus-teachers-classrooms.html).

The superintendent, Cindy Marten, had been working with education
leaders across the country to lobby the Senate to pass a second stimulus
package for schools.

Ms. Marten said the district had not given up on the possibility of
reopening physically if infection rates get down to a safe and
manageable level, and even moved forward over the weekend with plans to
buy $11 million worth of masks and other protective equipment. But the
state’s current infection levels, she said, “should make it clear to
everyone that the virus is not under control.”

“School districts need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same
time,” Ms. Marten said. “We must both plan for a physical reopening
while taking measures to keep our communities safe.”
