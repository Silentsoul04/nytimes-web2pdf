WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump’s press office tried to
undermine the reputation of the nation’s top infectious disease expert
with an [anonymously attributed
list](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/fauci-trump-coronavirus.html)
of what it said were his misjudgments in the early days of the
coronavirus, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci returned to the White House on Monday.

The visit underscored a reality for both men: They are stuck with each
other.

Dr. Fauci — who has not had direct contact with the president in more
than five weeks even as the number of Americans with Covid-19, the
disease caused by the coronavirus, has risen sharply in the Southwest —
slipped back into the West Wing to meet with Mark Meadows, the White
House chief of staff, while his allies denounced what they called a
meanspirited and misguided effort by the White House to smear him.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

White House officials declined to comment on what was discussed in the
conversation between Mr. Meadows, who has long expressed skepticism
about the conclusions of the nation’s public health experts, and Dr.
Fauci, though one official called it a good conversation and said they
continued to have a positive relationship.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For his part, Mr. Trump made no effort to sugarcoat his rift with Dr.
Fauci, declining to repudiate the criticism of him from his staff and
saying that “I don’t always agree with him.” But the president also
implicitly acknowledged how unlikely he was to get rid of Dr. Fauci,
calling him “a very nice person” and saying that “I like him
personally.”

Mr. Trump could formally remove Dr. Fauci from the official coronavirus
task force, but that would be a relatively meaningless step because it
no longer serves as the nerve-center of a pandemic response that the
Trump administration has pushed governors to take responsibility for.

As the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Fauci is a career
civil servant. Firing him would require a finding of cause of
malfeasance, and would most likely end up tied up in lengthy appeals,
though the president could still seek to sideline Dr. Fauci in
meaningless work, transfer him to another location or cut his budget in
an attempt to get him to resign.

The anonymous accusations against Dr. Fauci were “enormously sad and
totally inappropriate,” said Dr. Margaret Hamburg, a former special
assistant to Dr. Fauci who served as commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration under President Barack Obama. “Never have we needed his
expertise and focus more than right now. Why would we both undermine him
and his ability to do his important work?”

Dr. Fauci is also a public figure unlike any other health official in
the federal government, well known for his decades organizing its
responses to diseases like AIDS and Ebola. In his office in Building 31
on the campus of the N.I.H., he keeps a wall of photographs of himself
with celebrities and presidents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over time, he has learned to navigate the collisions between politics
and health. That has never been more difficult than in this
administration, but Dr. Fauci has recognized that to remain effective,
he must navigate Mr. Trump’s mercurial moods and contempt for expertise.
The two once enjoyed an occasionally bantering relationship, and the
president several times followed Dr. Fauci’s advice to extend national
stay-at-home guidance. But that was as far as it went; Mr. Trump calls
Dr. Fauci “Anthony,” a name that few use for someone who prefers the
more casual moniker
“Tony.”

Dr. Fauci’s international reputation has not spared him from the White
House attacks, which [first appeared in The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/11/fauci-trump-coronavirus/)
and later in other news outlets. The criticism, which was distributed
anonymously to reporters, detailed what the White House believed was a
series of premature or contradictory recommendations that Dr. Fauci has
made over the past several months as the virus bore down on the United
States.

For example, White House officials pointed to a statement by Dr. Fauci
in a Feb. 29 interview that “at this moment, there is no need to change
anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis.” But they omitted a
warning he delivered right after.

“Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change,” [he said in
the
interview](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/13/deanna-lorraine/tweet-amplified-trump-misleads-faucis-late-februar/),
conducted by NBC News. “When you start to see community spread, this
could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things
that would protect you from spread.”

In the same interview, Dr. Fauci also warned that the coronavirus could
become “a major outbreak.”

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, took ownership on
Monday of the opposition research-style effort, saying that her office
merely “provided a direct answer to what was a direct question” from The
Post about whether Dr. Fauci had made mistakes during the course of the
response.

Even some of Dr. Fauci’s senior colleagues at the Department of Health
and Human Services have begun to echo the White House. Adm. Brett P.
Giroir, the assistant secretary for health and a fellow member of the
coronavirus task force, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Dr.
Fauci “is not 100 percent right, and he also doesn’t necessarily — and
he admits that — have the whole national interest in mind.”

Admiral Giroir added that Dr. Fauci “looks at it from a very narrow
public health point of view.”

Dr. Fauci spent the early days of the pandemic as the leading scientific
voice in the federal government’s response before falling out of favor
with Mr. Trump and his top aides over blunt comments inconsistent with
the president’s message of economic resurgence. In task force meetings,
Dr. Fauci has often styled himself as a solitary pessimist in a room
where some officials have been eager to wave away the alarming
trajectory of the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His analysis has sometimes clashed with another prominent public health
figure on the task force, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who has harnessed a
flurry of projections and models to package a more hopeful picture of
the outbreak.

In the early days of the outbreak, Dr. Fauci, who typically sleeps only
about five hours a night, lived mostly anonymously, taking the
Washington Metro to the White House and Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers.
He still spends late nights in his home office fielding calls from his
boss, Dr. Francis Collins, the N.I.H. director, and from politicians
like Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York and a close friend.

Dr. Fauci, 79, has for decades had broad access to the White House,
where he once explained the AIDS epidemic to President Ronald Reagan.

“There’s nothing unique or special about being the director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that sets you up
to be an adviser to presidents,” Dr. Hamburg said. “He has become that
because of what he brings to the role.”

Standing next to Mr. Trump through a long string of task force briefings
in March and April, he issued warnings about the ferocity of the virus’s
spread and pleas to take it seriously. But his message began to wear on
some Americans who viewed him as an avatar of government fear-mongering
and
overreach.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,

At one point, a right-wing movement on Twitter using the hashtag
\#FireFauci picked up steam, and Mr. Trump one night retweeted a
supporter who used the slogan, forcing the president to [defend
himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-fauci.html)
at the next day’s task force briefing, with Dr. Fauci seated inches
away.

By early April, Dr. Fauci had received so many personal threats that he
was assigned personal protection. The N.I.H. continues to turn over
threats to the agency’s security force, said one official familiar with
them.

As Dr. Fauci’s prominence has risen, he has received a glut of media and
event requests, forcing officials at the N.I.H. to monitor his email
inbox. He became a ubiquitous presence on cable news.

But as Dr. Fauci’s public assessments of the outbreak became
increasingly dire, Mr. Meadows and several press officials he brought to
the White House began to tighten the access television reporters had to
him, ignoring or blocking requests routed to them from the N.I.H.

Broadcast news requests for Dr. Fauci now go through Michael R. Caputo,
the top spokesman at the Department of Health and Human Services, a
loyal ally of the president’s who is still friendly with and supportive
of Dr. Fauci. In a text on Monday, Mr. Caputo said that only some of the
requests for Dr. Fauci had to be cleared by the White House.

The White House’s attempts to discredit Dr. Fauci raised alarm on Monday
among health experts who have long known him as public health’s most
important ambassador.

Dr. David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University, said that the
White House’s campaign against its own top health expert was “dark, dark
stain.”

“When you disrespect Tony on matters of public health science, you’re
slapping in the face all of U.S. science,” said Dr. Relman, who has
worked with Dr. Fauci for over 20 years. “Tony is in some ways the face
of U.S. public health-oriented science.”

Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard, said that Dr.
Fauci had become the default spokesman for scientific consensus in
absence of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has
maintained a quiet public role throughout the pandemic.

“What Tony represents is the best that he can find about a scientific
event and consensus,” said Dr. Bloom, who has known Dr. Fauci for over
40 years. “Tony doesn’t pop off on what’s in his head the moment it’s in
his head.”

Dr. Relman said Dr. Fauci’s role in the federal government’s response to
the AIDS epidemic prepared him for the dilemma of responding to complex
outbreaks with “imperfect information.”

“He learned that science can be politicized,” Dr. Relman added, “even
when your conversation partner isn’t someone who worships and respects
science.”
