Monday proved to be another turbulent day for Wall Street, with stocks
reversing an early gain that had briefly lifted the S\&P 500 back into
positive territory for the year.

The index was nearly 1 percent lower by the end of the day, after
earlier having climbed more than 1.5 percent. The unsteady trading came
as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise, and investors also
had the coming earnings season to consider.

Many companies, rocked by uncertainties caused by the spread of the
coronavirus, have stopped giving guidance on profit projections through
the year, so traders will be looking especially closely at the quarterly
numbers as they are reported.

On Monday, \textbf{Pepsico} reported better than expected results, in
part because of a jump in sales of snack foods. On Tuesday,
\textbf{JPMorgan}, \textbf{Citigroup} and \textbf{Wells Fargo} will all
report their results, and a range of other companies from
\textbf{Netflix} to \textbf{Delta Air Lines} will also provide updates
this week.

Stocks have climbed recently despite the unrelenting spread of the
coronavirus in many parts of the world, but the market has also proven
itself susceptible to a sudden downdraft if sentiment shifts and
investors choose to focus on the risks to the economy or profits ---
something that could happen if corporate results come in far weaker than
expected.

Adding to the market's jitters on Monday was the news that Gov. Gavin
Newsom of California
\href{https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1282752861835649024?s=20}{announced
one of the most sweeping rollbacks of any state's reopening plans},
saying that he would move to close indoor operations statewide for
restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, zoos and card rooms, and that
bars would be force to close all operations.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases.html}{Florida
on Sunda}y reported more than 15,000 new cases, the highest single-day
total by any state since the start of the pandemic.

The economic crisis is prompting a growing coalition in the United
States --- including Democrats and Republicans, labor and business ---
to push for a new training effort to upgrade
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/business/coronavirus-retraining-workers.html}{the
skills of American workers}, creating what one proponent called ``a
Marshall Plan for ourselves.''
