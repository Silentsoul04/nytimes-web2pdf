The vaccine, developed by government scientists and Moderna, a biotech
company, appeared safe and provoked an immune response in 45 people in a
study.

An experimental

vaccine} made by the biotech company
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html}{Moderna}
provoked a promising immune response against the virus and appeared safe
in the first 45 people who received it, researchers reported on Tuesday
in \href{https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus?query=RP}{The New England
Journal of Medicine}.

Moderna's vaccine, developed with researchers at the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was the first coronavirus vaccine to
be tested in humans, and the company announced on Tuesday that
\href{https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427?term=moderna\&cond=COVID-19\&draw=2\&rank=1}{large
Phase 3 tests} of it would begin on July 27, involving 30,000 people.
Half of the participants will be a control group who will receive
placebos.

The trial will need to show that those who were vaccinated were
significantly less likely to contract the virus than those who got a
placebo. The fastest way to get results is to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html}{test}
the vaccine in a ``hot spot'' with many cases, and the study is looking
for people at high risk because of their locations or circumstances.

Vaccines and improved treatments are the only hope of returning lives
back to anything close to normal, and dozens of companies are racing to
develop vaccines. Experts agree that more than one vaccine will be
needed, because no single company could produce the billions of doses
needed.

``None of us are safe unless all of us are safe,'' said Dr. Angela
Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. ``It's not
just us. It's everybody in the world.''

The Moderna vaccine uses genetic material from the virus, called mRNA,
to prompt the immune system to fight the coronavirus.

The report on Tuesday confirmed and provided details on findings the
company announced on May 18 in a news release that was criticized for
lacking data. Moderna defended itself at the time, saying that as a
publicly traded company it had a legal obligation to disclose results
that could affect its share price, and that the actual data would be
published later.

The results are from an early Phase 1 study that was designed to test
low, medium and high doses of the vaccine and to gauge their safety and
ability to create immunity to the virus. The participants were 45
healthy adults, ages 18 to 55, who received two vaccinations 28 days
apart.

After the second shot, all of the participants developed so-called
neutralizing antibodies, which can inactivate the virus in lab tests.
The levels of those antibodies were similar to those in the upper range
in patients who had recovered from coronavirus infections. The vaccine
also produced a favorable response involving T-cells, another part of
the immune system.

``It exceeds all expectations,'' said Dr. Kizzmekia S. Corbett, a viral
immunologist and leader of a team that developed the vaccine at the
infectious disease institute.

More than half of the participants had side effects, including fatigue,
chills, headaches, muscle aches and pain at the injection site. Some had
fever. One person who received the low dose developed hives and was
withdrawn from the study. None of the side effects were considered
serious.

Experts not involved with the study said the results were encouraging,
but early. ``Just because you have antibodies doesn't mean you're
completely immune,'' Dr. Rasmussen said.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

It is possible, she said, that a vaccine might not totally prevent
infection, but that it might make the illness less severe. ``If it's a
choice between a bad cold and being on a ventilator, I'll take the bad
cold,'' she said.

Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of
Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that the
neutralizing antibodies and other immune responses were a good sign, but
that it was not known yet whether they would actually protect people
against the virus, or how long they would last. The side effects are a
``small price to pay'' for protection against a potentially severe
disease, he said, though fever may be a cause for concern once the
vaccine is given to large numbers of people.

``You always worry that fever, especially high fever, could lead to
other things,'' Dr. Offit said, adding that only a large controlled
study can determine whether the vaccine is truly safe and effective.

Otherwise, ``it's reading the tea leaves,'' he said. ``You just don't
know anything until you do a Phase 3 trial.''
