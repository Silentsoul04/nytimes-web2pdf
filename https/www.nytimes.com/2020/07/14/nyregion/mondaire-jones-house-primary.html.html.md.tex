N.Y.}\label{mondaire-jones-rides-insurgent-wave-to-a-house-primary-win-in-ny}}

Mr. Jones is likely to become among the first openly gay
African-American members of Congress.

Mondaire Jones, a progressive candidate supported by the institutional
left, was declared the victor in a crowded Democratic House primary in
the suburbs north of New York City, all but ensuring that he will join
Congress next year as among its first openly gay African-American
members.

The race was not called by The Associated Press until Tuesday, three
weeks after the primary, even though Mr. Jones had a commanding
advantage after the machine ballot count: He had twice as many votes as
his closest competitor, Adam Schleifer.

Mr. Jones's support grew as Primary Day drew closer, as Black Lives
Matters protests galvanized voters across the district and allowed
candidates, for the first time since the pandemic, to campaign in the
open air.

As the leading candidate of color in the race, and as the candidate with
the most backing from national progressive leaders, Mr. Jones was
well-positioned to capitalize on a renewed interest in civil rights and
criminal justice reform.

Mr. Jones said on Tuesday that his victory demonstrated that his core of
progressive ideas --- combating climate change and racial injustice, and
providing equal access to health care and quality education --- was what
voters cared most about.

``On June 23, Democrats nominated a champion for working people,'' he
said in a statement.

``Growing up poor, Black, and gay, I never imagined someone like me
could run for Congress, let alone win,'' Mr. Jones said. ``Indeed, in
the 244-year history of the United States, there has never been an
openly gay, Black member of Congress. That changes this year.''

Mr. Jones may well be joined in Congress by a second openly gay member:
In the Bronx, Ritchie Torres, who identifies as Afro-Latino, is leading
a Democratic primary to replace Representative Jose E. Serrano.

The seat that Mr. Jones is likely to fill is now occupied by Nita Lowey,
the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee. Ms. Lowey,
83, was facing a primary from Mr. Jones when, in October, she announced
her impending retirement.

Ms. Lowey's resignation announcement opened the floodgates to would-be
successors eager for the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/nyregion/democratic-primary-house-ny.html}{once-in-three-decade
opportunity} to fill an open seat in a secure Democratic district. She
had declined to endorse a candidate in the race to succeed her.

Mr. Jones, 33, often says that ``policy is personal,'' and his personal
story played an integral role in his campaign. In television ads and
campaign literature, he recounted his grandparents' migration north from
the Jim Crow South, his upbringing in Section 8 housing in Rockland
County and the family's reliance on food stamps. He has relished his
success against competitors from more privileged backgrounds.

``These are people who come from money, obviously,'' Mr. Jones said.
``Unlike them, I don't come from money or from a political family. And
yet, they underestimated me. We have outmaneuvered them at every stage
of this campaign.''

Mr. Jones graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law School,
where he said he became good friends with James Comey's daughter,
Maurene (whose mother, Patrice, contributed to his campaign).

He returned to the district in 2017. Before running for Congress, he
worked as an attorney at the Westchester County Law Department and in
private practice. Mr. Jones also spent a year working as a fellow at the
Department of Justice, where he helped vet judicial nominees that Senate
Republicans would often block.

He

\href{http://www.mtv.com/news/3150060/mondaire-jones-could-be-the-first-black-openly-gay-member-of-congress/}{says}
that the latter experience seeded his distaste for political centrism in
the face of Republican intransigence.

Mr. Jones quickly emerged as the candidate of the Democratic Party's
progressive wing, winning the backing of Senators Bernie Sanders and
Elizabeth Warren, as well as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
all of whom cited his support for policies that they said would benefit
working families.

Like many of his competitors, Mr. Jones supports elevating the national
minimum wage to \$15 an hour and indexing it to inflation. He also backs
the creation of a single-payer health care system --- joining some of
his competitors
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrkWqdGT8eA\&feature=youtu.be}{in
support of} a robust public option en route to such a system.

He supports implementing Green New Deal policies to make the country
more reliant on clean energy and repealing a federal law that bars New
Yorkers from deducting their hefty state and local taxes from federal
taxes. He favors creating more mass transportation options for Rockland
County, which has only limited access to rail.

Mr. Jones won the race even though Mr. Schleifer, a pharmaceutical heir,
outspent him by more than five to one. Mr. Jones did however benefit
from some independent expenditures on his behalf,
\href{https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/06/07/house-progressives-wade-into-new-york-primary-1291755}{including}
by the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

An avowed science fiction fan, Mr. Jones, who had never run for office
before, said the trajectory of this race feels oddly familiar.

``Running in this Democratic primary has felt like a story out of a
sci-fi novel,'' he said.

Which sci-fi novel?

``One that is still being written,'' he said.
