As education leaders decide whether to reopen classrooms in the fall
amid a raging pandemic, many are looking to a standard generally agreed
upon among epidemiologists: To control community spread of the
coronavirus, the average daily infection rate among those who are tested
should not exceed 5 percent.

But of the nation’s [10 largest school
districts](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_215.30.asp),
only New York City and Chicago appear to have achieved that public
health goal, according to a New York Times analysis of city and
county-level data.

Some of the biggest districts, like Miami-Dade County in Florida and
Clark County, Nev., which includes Las Vegas, are in counties that have
recently reported positive test rates more than four times greater than
the 5 percent threshold, the data shows.

The alarming spread of the virus has prompted a growing number of
districts to announce they would rely on online instruction in the fall.
The superintendent of the nation’s sixth-largest district, in Broward
County, Fla., on Tuesday recommended full-time remote learning despite
pressure from the state’s governor and President Trump. That followed
[an announcement on
Monday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html)
that California’s two largest districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, will
teach 100 percent online.

“I’m just super frustrated and really disappointed that our nation, our
states and our communities have not exercised the discipline that they
need in order to get the coronavirus under control,” said Robert W.
Runcie, the Broward superintendent. “Now the futures of our young people
are collateral damage from our inability to take this thing seriously.”

In recent days, Nashville, Atlanta, Arlington, Va., and Oakland, Calif.,
have also announced plans to start the school year remotely.

The broad national move to keep schools shuttered represents a deepening
crisis for the nation’s tens of millions of schoolchildren, who are
already [falling

academically and socially during the pandemic.

The decisions will also require working parents to continue to carry a
[heavy
burden](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/nyregion/nyc-school-daycare-reopening.html)
of ad hoc child care and home schooling, which is presenting families
with impossible trade-offs.

But the fact remains that the United States has failed to control the
spread of the coronavirus, making it difficult to apply the reassuring
news from abroad. Local and state leaders must now decide on the best
course of action between two bad choices: either open school buildings
and take the risk that educators, students and parents become ill, or
keep them shuttered and hinder the development of tens of millions of
children.

“These are like wartime decisions,” Mr. Runcie said. “This is literally
like sending people into battle, and without appropriate
tools.”

In the United States, districts are increasingly splitting into three
groups: those that plan to teach online only, those that will allow
families to choose between in-person and at-home instruction, and those
offering a hybrid approach, with students spending some days in
classrooms and some learning remotely.

Many large districts fall into the third category, although more are
moving into the first as the virus continues to rage in their regions.

The 5 percent positive test rate was not developed specifically for
schools, but it has emerged as a metric that many districts are
considering when making plans.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The number comes from a general threshold [established by public health
experts](https://globalepidemics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/key_metrics_and_indicators_v4.pdf),
who say that a positive test rate of less than 10 percent, and ideally
under 3 percent, is generally needed to control and suppress the spread
of the virus in a community.

The [World Health
Organization](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity)
encourages governments to reopen their economies only if their
positivity rates are below 5 percent for at least two weeks. But the
rate is a reliable indicator only when there is widespread testing, and
[many states are still not testing
enough.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html)

This week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, announced that
schools across the state could only reopen in September if they were in
a region where the average daily infection rate was below 5 percent over
a two-week period. None of the state’s 10 regions currently have an
infection rate over 2 percent.

Jim Malatras, an aide to the governor, said the state “wanted to
establish an objective number so schools can
plan.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Florida, which has five of the nation’s largest school districts —
Miami-Dade, Broward, Hillsborough, Orange and Palm Beach Counties —
officials have taken a different approach, aggressively pushing schools
to resume operations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last week, the state’s education commissioner, Richard Corcoran, who was
nominated by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, issued an [emergency
order](http://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/19861/urlt/DOE-2020-EO-06.pdf)
asking districts to reopen “brick and mortar schools with the full
panoply of services.”

But fully staffing the Broward school system to maintain social
distancing between students and staff members would require at least
$230 million in new funding, Mr. Runcie said, because of the need to
hire thousands of additional teachers to reduce class sizes to an
average of 14 students.

In California, where case numbers have been soaring, **** reopening
schools has become a moving target. Just two and a half weeks ago, when
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the state budget, it included
strong language that discouraged schools from operating exclusively
online.

But as cases climbed, concerns about too much online instruction quickly
morphed into concerns about too little school safety. California is
using the 5 percent positivity threshold as a guideline — one that has
grown **** increasingly distant in many places. In Los Angeles County,
home to the nation’s second-largest school district, the positivity rate
has averaged [9 percent over the past seven
days.](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/data/index.htm)

“We had hoped it wouldn’t get to this point,” said the Los Angeles
schools superintendent, Austin Beutner. “All of a sudden, in the middle
of June, everything just went through the roof.”

The decision by Los Angeles and San Diego to teach online is expected to
be influential. Several other large districts in the state, including
San Bernardino, Santa Clara and Oakland, will start the year remotely,
and this week the public schools in Pasadena and the entirety of
Stanislaus County in the Central Valley said they would delay in-person
learning at least for the first weeks of August.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even in Orange County, Calif., where a cluster of conservative officials
has aggressively pushed for reopening, larger districts have been
hearing from teachers’ unions and nervously eyeing the local test
positivity rate, which [averaged 14.6
percent](https://ochca.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/cc4859c8c522496b9f21c451de2fedae)
over the last seven

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

On Monday, the county’s Board of Education voted to recommend that
schools reopen without social distancing and other precautions. But
their recommendation is not binding, and on Tuesday, the Santa Ana
Unified School District, the county’s second-largest, announced it
[would
pivot](https://www.sausd.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=1&ModuleInstanceID=6157&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=96385&PageID=1)
from a planned hybrid reopening to distance learning.

“While we hope at some point to have our students attend our schools
alongside their classmates and teachers, now is not the time,” the
superintendent, Jerry Almendarez, said in a statement.

In the Northeast, parents and school leaders face a very different
landscape. New York City, the nation’s largest district with some 1.1
million students and 1,800 schools, was the center of the country’s
outbreak this spring. Now the city’s average positive test rate hovers
around 2 percent — the lowest among the country’s largest school
districts.

That leaves New York virtually alone — with the exception of Chicago,
the third-largest district, where the city had a 5 percent positivity
rate — in having the virus sufficiently under control to satisfy the
public health threshold. Still, New York City will likely [offer
in-person instruction only one to three days a
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html)
when the school year begins in September.

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has made the return to
classrooms a priority, but he [signaled greater flexibility on
Tuesday](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/14/texas-schools-online-pandemic/)
amid a steep uptick in virus cases. The state’s guidelines require
districts to offer in-person education five days a week, although
parents could choose to have children learn online only.

The Houston Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 6,500
educators, had blasted the state’s plan for reopening campuses as
“unacceptably vague and hardly adequate.” In a letter sent to the
school district on Sunday, teachers asked to delay classroom instruction
until the area had seen a decline in new cases for at least 14 days and
achieved the positive test rate of less than 5 percent. That is far from
the current landscape in greater Houston, which in recent days had [a
positive test rate of 13
percent](https://www.tmc.edu/coronavirus-updates/covid-19-testing-trends/).

“No one wants to be inside the school building more than teachers,” said
Maxie Hollingsworth, a math teacher at a Houston elementary school. But
Ms. Hollingsworth said she was not comfortable returning to her
classroom and risking infection; her daughter has asthma and is at
higher risk of complications from the coronavirus.

“The plain truth to me,” she said, “is it is immoral to reopen schools
without the things we need in place.”

Texas officials are closely watching the national landscape, and it is
possible they will modify the five-day-a-week requirement. The Houston
Independent School District, the nation’s seventh largest with 209,000
students, is expected to make an announcement on Wednesday about plans
for the academic year.

Rising virus counts in Clark County, Nev., are complicating plans for
the nation’s fifth-largest district to provide 326,000 students with two
days per week of in-person learning.

“The No. 1 aspect is safety,” said Linda Cavazos, the vice president of
the district’s board of trustees. “We may be looking at having to change
the entire thing to distance learning.”

Nery Martinez, who has two teenage children and was laid off from his
job as a bartender at the Caesars Palace casino because of the pandemic,
said he preferred online instruction, despite the financial impact that
supervising his children’s learning would have on his family once he
goes back to work.

“Face to face is a lot of risk,” he said. “I need to make the money to
pay rent, but I want to be here to protect them.”
