<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has ordered hospitals to bypass
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and send all Covid-19
patient information to a central database in Washington beginning on
Wednesday. The move has alarmed health experts who fear the data will be
politicized or withheld from the public.

The new instructions were posted recently in a [little-noticed
document](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf)
on the Department of Health and Human Services website. From now on, the
department — not the C.D.C. — will collect daily reports about the
patients that each hospital is treating, the number of available beds
and ventilators, and other information vital to tracking the pandemic.

Officials say the change will streamline data gathering and assist the
[White House coronavirus task
force](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html)
in allocating scarce supplies like personal protective gear and
[remdesivir](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/health/coronavirus-remdesivir-gilead.html),
the first drug shown to be effective against the virus. But the Health
and Human Services database that will receive new information is not
open to the public, which could affect the work of scores of
researchers, modelers and health officials who rely on [C.D.C.
data](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/covid19/report-patient-impact.html)to
make projections and crucial decisions.

“Historically, C.D.C. has been the place where public health data has
been sent, and this raises questions about not just access for
researchers but access for reporters, access for the public to try to
better understand what is happening with the outbreak," said Jen Kates,
the director of global health and H.I.V. policy with the nonpartisan
Kaiser Family Foundation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“How will the data be protected?” she asked. “Will there be
transparency, will there be access, and what is the role of the C.D.C.
in understanding the data?”

News of the change came as a shock at the
[C.D.C](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/health/cdc-schools-coronavirus.html).,
according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. Michael R.
Caputo, a Health and Human Services spokesman, called the C.D.C.’s
system inadequate and said the two systems would be linked. The C.D.C.
would continue to make data public, he said.

“Today, the C.D.C. still has at least a week lag in reporting hospital
data,” Mr. Caputo said. “America requires it in real time. The new,
faster and complete data system is what our nation needs to defeat the
coronavirus, and the C.D.C., an operating division of H.H.S., will
certainly participate in this streamlined all-of-government response.
They will simply no longer control
it.”

But the instructions to hospitals in the department guidance are
explicit and underscored: “As of July 15, 2020, hospitals should no
longer report the Covid-19 information in this document to the National
Healthcare Safety Network site,” the C.D.C.’s system for gathering data
from more than 25,000 medical centers around the country.

Public health experts have long expressed concerns that the Trump
administration is politicizing science and undermining its health
experts, in particular the C.D.C.; four of the agency’s former
directors, spanning both Republican and Democratic administrations, said
as much in an [opinion
piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/14/cdc-directors-trump-politics/)
published Tuesday in The Washington Post. The data collection shift
reinforced those fears.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Centralizing control of all data under the umbrella of an inherently
political apparatus is dangerous and breeds distrust,” said Dr. Nicole
Lurie, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response
under former President Barack Obama. “It appears to cut off the ability
of agencies like C.D.C. to do its basic job.”

The shift grew out of a tense conference call several weeks ago between
hospital executives and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus
response coordinator. After Dr. Birx said hospitals were not adequately
reporting their data, she convened a working group of government and
hospital officials who devised the new plan, according to Dr. Janis
Orlowski, the chief health care officer of the Association of American
Medical Colleges, who participated in the group’s meetings.

While she said she understood Dr. Lurie’s concern, Dr. Orlowski said the
administration had pledged in “a verbal discussion” to make the data
public — or at least give hospitals access to it.

“We are comfortable with that as long as they continue to work with us,
as long as they continue to make the information public, and as long as
we’re able to continue to advise them and look at the data,” she said,
calling the switch “a sincere effort to streamline and improve data
collection.’’

The change exposes the vast gaps in the government’s ability to collect
and manage health data — an antiquated system at best, experts say. The
C.D.C. has been collecting coronavirus data through its [National
Healthcare Safety Network](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html), which
was expanded at the outset of the pandemic to track hospital capacity
and patient information specific to Covid-19.

In its new guidance, Health and Human Services said that going forward,
hospitals should report detailed information on a daily basis directly
to the new centralized system, which is managed by TeleTracking, a
health data firm with headquarters in Pittsburgh. However, if hospitals
were already reporting such information to their states, they could
continue to do so if they received a written release saying the state
would handle reporting.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate
health committee, has [raised
questions](https://www.help.senate.gov/ranking/newsroom/press/murray-demands-answers-regarding-non-competitive-multimillion-dollar-contract-for-duplicative-health-data-system-)
about the TeleTracking contract, calling it a “noncompetitive,
multimillion-dollar contract” for a “duplicative health data system.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Both the C.D.C. network and the TeleTracking system set up by Health and
Human Services rely on so-called push data, meaning hospital employees
must manually enter data, rather than the government tapping into an
electronic system to obtain the information.

“The whole thing needs to be scrapped and started anew,” said Dr. Dan
Hanfling, an expert in medical and disaster preparedness and a vice
president at In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit strategic investment firm focused on
national security. “It is laughable that this administration can’t find
the wherewithal to bring 21st-century technologies in data management to
the fight.”

Dr. Hanfling and others agree that information does need to be
centralized, but they disagree on how that should happen. Dr. Hanfling
called for a new “national data coordination center” that would be used
for “forecasting, identifying, detecting, tracking and reporting on
emerging
diseases.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Representative Donna E. Shalala of Florida, who served as health
secretary under former President Bill Clinton, said the C.D.C. was the
proper agency to gather health data. If there were flaws in the C.D.C.’s
systems, she said, they should be fixed.

“Only the C.D.C. has the expertise to collect data,” Ms. Shalala said.
“I think any move to take responsibility away from the people who have
the expertise is politicizing.”

Hospitals say the previous reporting requirements were cumbersome,
partly because they frequently changed.

“It has been an administrative hassle and confusing to constantly be
shifting gears on reporting while hospitals are on the front lines
during a pandemic,” Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas
Hospital Association, wrote in an email.

At Rush University Medical Center in Chicago as the pandemic raged, the
hospital had four full-time employees reporting coronavirus data to four
different agencies, said Dr. Bala N. Hota, the hospital’s chief
analytics officer. Rush collected more than 100 different measures, some
of which determined how much money it would receive under different
federal programs.

But while Dr. Hota said he supported streamlining the process and the
involvement of state and local agencies in reporting, he was also
concerned that months into the pandemic, the United States still did not
have an established system of collecting the kind of information it
needed to seamlessly move patients from a full hospital to one with
available beds.

“The C.D.C. is the right agency to be at the forefront of collecting the
data,” Dr. Hota said.

The C.D.C. has been criticized for its data collection, however. In May,
the agency
[acknowledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/politics/coronavirus-tests-cdc.html)
that in tracking the spread of the virus, it had been combining tests
that detect active infection with those that detect recovery from
Covid-19. That system muddied the picture of the pandemic but raised the
percentage of Americans tested as President Trump was boasting about the
number of tests the United States was conducting.

Similar complaints about coronavirus data have bubbled up around the
country.

In Florida, a former data manager for the Health Department [accused one
of her
superiors](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/05/22/ousted-manager-was-told-to-manipulate-covid-19-data-before-states-re-opening-she-says/)
of directing her to “manipulate” data used in the state’s plan to lift
stay-at-home orders this spring. Ms. Shalala said the mayor of
Miami-Dade County “was so concerned about the state data that he has the
hospitals reporting their data directly to him as well.”

And Arizona ended its partnership with a university modeling team whose
projections showed a rising caseload, prompting pushback from Will
Humble, the executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association
and a former director of the state’s Health Services Department.

“Trust and accountability and transparency — all three go together,” Mr.
Humble said. Of the federal government’s new system, he said: “They’d
better keep it transparent, or else people are going to think that it
was an ulterior motive.”
