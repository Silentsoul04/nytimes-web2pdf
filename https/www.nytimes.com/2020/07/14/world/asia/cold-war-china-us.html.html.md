One by one, the United States has hit at the core tenets of Xi Jinping’s
vision for a rising China ready to assume the mantle of superpower.

In a matter of weeks, the Trump administration has imposed [sanctions
over punitive
policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/business/economy/us-halts-high-tech-exports-hong-kong.html)
in Hong Kong and China’s western region of Xinjiang. It took new
measures to suffocate Chinese innovation by cutting it off from American
technology and pushing allies to look elsewhere. On Monday, it
[challenged China’s
claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-pompeo.html)
in the South China Sea, setting the stage for sharper confrontation.

And President Trump said on Tuesday that he had signed into law [a bill
to punish Chinese
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/senate-china-hong-kong-sanctions.html)
for the [new security
law](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html)
that curbs the rights of Hong Kong residents, along with an executive
order ending preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong.

“The power gap is closing, and the ideological gap is widening,” said
Rush Doshi, director of the China Strategy Initiative at the Brookings
Institution in Washington, adding that [China and the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/asia/us-china-consulate.html)
had entered a downward “ideological spiral” years in the making.

“Where’s the bottom?” he asked.

For years, officials and historians have dismissed the idea that a new
Cold War was emerging between the United States and China. The contours
of today’s world, the argument went, are simply incomparable to the
decades when the United States and the Soviet Union squared off in an
existential struggle for supremacy. The world was said to be too
interconnected to easily divide into ideological blocs.

Now, lines are being drawn and relations are in free fall, laying the
foundation for a confrontation that will have many of the
characteristics of the Cold War — and the dangers. As the two
superpowers clash over technology, territory and clout, they face the
same risk of small disputes escalating into military conflict.

The relationship is increasingly imbued with deep distrust and
animosity, as well as the fraught tensions that come with two powers
jockeying for primacy, especially in areas where their interests
collide: in cyberspace and outer space, in [the Taiwan
Strait](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/world/asia/taiwan-china-hong-kong.html)
and the South China Sea, and [even in the Persian
Gulf](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/world/asia/china-iran-trade-military-deal.html).

And the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with China’s recent aggressive
actions on its borders — from the Pacific to [the
Himalayas](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/china-india-border.html)
— has turned existing fissures into chasms that could be difficult to
overcome, no matter the outcome of this year’s American presidential
election.

From Beijing’s perspective, it is the United States that has plunged
relations to what China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said last week was
their lowest point since the countries re-established diplomatic
relations in 1979.

“The current China policy of the United States is based on ill-informed
strategic miscalculation and is fraught with emotions and whims and
McCarthyist bigotry,” Mr. Wang said, evoking the Cold War himself to
describe the current level of tensions.

“It seems as if every Chinese investment is politically driven, every
Chinese student is a spy and every cooperation initiative is a scheme
with a hidden agenda,” he added.

Domestic politics in both countries have hardened views and given
ammunition to hawks.

“What cooperation is there between China and the United States right
now?” said Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute at the
National University of Singapore. “I can’t see any substantial
cooperation.”

The pandemic, too, has inflamed tensions, especially in the United
States. Mr. Trump<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>refers to the
coronavirus [with racist
tropes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html),
while Beijing accuses his administration of attacking China to detract
from its failures to contain the virus.

Mr. Trump, in a statement delivered from the Rose Garden Tuesday evening
that focused harshly on China and his presidential rival, Joseph R.
Biden Jr., referred to the pandemic as “the plague pouring in from
China,” and said that the Chinese “could have stopped it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Both countries are forcing other nations to take sides, even if they are
disinclined to do so. The Trump administration, for example, has pressed
allies — with some success in Australia [and, on Tuesday, in
Britain](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/uk-bans-huawei-from-5g-network-raising-tensions-with-china.html)
— to forswear the Chinese tech giant Huawei as they develop 5G networks.
China, facing condemnation over its policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong,
has rallied countries to make public demonstrations of support for
them.

At the United Nations Humans Rights Council in Geneva, 53 nations — from
Belarus to Zimbabwe — signed a statement supporting China’s [new
security law for Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html).
Only 27 nations on the council criticized it, most of them European
democracies, along with Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Such blocs
would not have been unfamiliar at the height of the Cold War.

China has also wielded its vast economic power as a tool of political
coercion, cutting off imports of beef and barley [from
Australia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/australia/cyber-defense-china-hacking.html)
because its government called for an international investigation into
the origins of the pandemic. On Tuesday, Beijing said it would sanction
the American aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Martin over recent weapons
sales to Taiwan.

With the world distracted by the pandemic, China has also wielded its
military might, as it did by testing its disputed frontier with India in
April and May. That led to the [first deadly clash
there](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/china-india-border.html)
since 1975. The damage to the relationship could take years to repair.

Increasingly, China seems willing to accept the risks of such actions.
Only weeks later, it asserted a new territorial claim in Bhutan, the
mountain kingdom that is closely allied with India.

With China [menacing
vessels](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/world/asia/china-hong-kong-taiwan.html)from
Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia in the South China Sea, the United
States dispatched two aircraft carriers through the waters last month in
an aggressive show of strength. Further brinkmanship appears inevitable
now that the State Department has declared China’s claims there
illegal.

A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, said on Tuesday
that the American declaration would undermine regional peace and
stability, asserting that China had controlled the islands in the sea
“for thousands of years,” which is not true. As he stated, the
Republic of China — then controlled by the Nationalist forces of Chiang
Kai-shek — only made a formal claim in 1948.

“China is committed to resolving territorial and jurisdictional disputes
with directly related sovereign states through negotiations and
consultations,” he said.

That is not how its neighbors see things. Japan warned this week that
China was attempting to “alter the status quo in the East China Sea and
the South China Sea.” It called China a more serious long-term threat
than a nuclear-armed North Korea.

Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia and professor
of international studies at Stanford University, said China’s recent
maneuvering appeared to be “overextended and overreaching,” likening it
to one of the most fraught moments of the Cold War.

“It does remind me of Khrushchev,” he said. “He’s lashing out, and
suddenly he’s in a Cuban missile crisis with the U.S.”

A backlash against Beijing appears to be growing. The tensions are
particularly clear in tech, where China has sought to compete with the
world in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and
microchips, while harshly restricting what people can read, watch or
listen to inside the
country.

If the Berlin Wall was the physical symbol of the first Cold War, the
Great Firewall could well be the virtual symbol of the new one.

What began as a divide in cyberspace to insulate Chinese citizens from
views not authorized by the Communist Party has now proved to be a
prescient indicator of the deeper fissures between China and much of the
Western world.

Mr. Wang, in his speech, said China had never sought to impose its way
on other countries. But it has done exactly that by [getting Zoom to
censor
talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/technology/zoom-china-tiananmen-square.html)
that were being held in the United States and by launching cyberattacks
on Uighurs across the globe.

Its controls have been hugely successful at home in stifling dissent and
helping to seed domestic internet giants, but they have won China little
influence abroad. India’s move to [block 59 Chinese
apps](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html?searchResultPosition=1)
threatens to hobble China’s biggest overseas internet success to date,
the meme-laden short-video app TikTok.

Last week, TikTok also shut down in Hong Kong because of China’s new
national security law there. The American tech giants Facebook, Google
and Twitter said they would stop reviewing data requests from the Hong
Kong authorities as they assessed the law’s
restrictions.

“China is big, it will be successful, it will develop its own tech, but
there are limits to what it can do,” said James A. Lewis, a former
American official who writes on cybersecurity and espionage for the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Even in places where China has succeeded in selling its technology, the
tide appears to be turning.

Beijing’s recent truculence has now led the United Kingdom to block new
Huawei equipment from going into its networks, and the Trump
administration is determined to cut the company off from microchips and
other components it needs. To counter, Beijing has redoubled efforts to
build homegrown options.

Calls for a total decoupling of China’s supply chain from American tech
companies are unrealistic in the short term, and would prove massively
expensive in the longer term. Still, the United States has moved to pull
Taiwan’s microchip manufacturing — crucial to the supply chains of
Huawei and other Chinese tech companies — closer to its backyard, with
plans to support a new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing plant in
Arizona.

Mr. Wang, the foreign minister, urged the United States to step back and
seek areas where the two countries can work together. Pessimism about
the relationship is nonetheless widespread, though most Chinese
officials and analysts blame the Trump administration for trying to
deflect attention from its failure to control the
pandemic.

“It is not difficult to see that under the impact of the coronavirus in
this U.S. election year various powers in the U.S. are focused on
China,” Zhao Kejin, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua
University, wrote in a recent paper. “The China-U.S. relationship faces
the most serious moment since the establishment of diplomatic
relations.”

While he eschewed the idea of a new Cold War, his alternative phrasing
was no more reassuring: “The new reality is China-U.S. relations are not
entering ‘a new Cold War’ but sliding into a ‘soft war.’”
