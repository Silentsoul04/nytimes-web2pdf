Geoffrey S. Berman, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District
of New York who was abruptly fired last month by President Trump, will
be a visiting professor at Stanford Law School for the fall 2020 term,
the school said on Wednesday.

Mr. Berman, 60, will teach a course on prosecutors and their
decision-making, how they decide what crimes to charge and what
punishments to seek.

Mr. Berman, whose former office has undertaken highly sensitive
corruption investigations into members of Mr. Trump's inner circle, was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html}{dismissed
on June 20} after a dizzying 24 hours in which the attorney general,
William P. Barr, first tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to resign
and said if he did not step down, he would be fired.

In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last week,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/politics/top-manhattan-prosecutor-ousted-by-trump-details-firing.html}{Mr.
Berman recounted} a tense conversation with Mr. Barr at the Pierre Hotel
on June 19, in which the attorney general said ``getting fired from my
job would not be good for my résumé or future job prospects.''

At Stanford, Mr. Berman will teach a course called ``Prosecutorial
Discretion and Ethical Duties in the Enforcement of Federal Criminal
Law,'' the school said.

Mr. Berman, who received his law degree from Stanford in 1984, said in a
statement that he looked forward to serving as ``a resource to students
who are interested in criminal and national security law,'' and having
the opportunity to pass on what he had learned about the ``critical role
of the prosecutor in the administration of justice.''

``Prosecutors wield enormous power over life, liberty and reputation and
should be subject to ethical standards higher than those that apply to
other attorneys,'' he said in the statement.

Mr. Berman ultimately agreed to resign his prosecutor's post after Mr.
Barr said he would be succeeded by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/nyregion/us-attorney-trump-audrey-strauss.html}{Audrey
Strauss}, who was Mr. Berman's handpicked deputy.

Mr. Berman will not be the first former U.S. attorney for the Southern
District to take a law-school position after being fired by the Trump
administration.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/nyregion/preet-bharara-nyu-law-school.html}{Preet
Bharara, who was dismissed from the same post in March 2017 after he
refused to resign}, joined New York University School of Law later that
month.
