# Ocasio-Cortez Pushes Cuomo to Back Billionaires’ Tax

Progressives want the tax to help New Yorkers hurt by the virus, but the
governor says it could drive high earners out of state and damage the
tax base.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative [Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sexism-congress.html)
has joined a new campaign to push Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to tax
billionaires who live in New York State and use the money to assist
people hurt by the pandemic-fueled economic crisis.

Similar measures targeting the wealthy have stalled in Albany, opposed
by Republicans who long controlled the State Senate or by Mr. Cuomo, a
third-term Democrat who has made [his tax-cutting
way](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-state/cuomo-proposes-n-y-tax-cuts-for-small-businesses-farmers)s
a central platform of his decade-long tenure.

But the environment has changed: Democrats gained control of both houses
of the Legislature in a “blue wave” election in 2018, and the effects of
the coronavirus-forced shutdown have created a $13 billion state budget
shortfall.

Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens who was among the progressive
Democrats who won office in 2018, sponsored [the bill that would
tax](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S8277) the
unrealized capital gains of the state’s 119 billionaires. The money
raised would be redirected to workers not eligible for unemployment
insurance or the federal stimulus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The proposed legislation is one of at least three tax-the-rich bills,
including one that would impose an ultra-millionaires’ tax, that will
greet the State Legislature when it returns for a rare July session on
Monday.

But even with Democrats in control in Albany, the measures are still
sure to encounter opposition from Republicans and many business leaders.

Mr. Cuomo has argued that taxes that target high earners could drive
them out of the state and further damage the tax base — a concern that
the governor’s budget director, Robert Mujica, underscored in an
interview on
Wednesday.

New York already has one of the highest tax rates for the wealthy in the
country, Mr. Mujica said, adding that the top 2 percent of taxpayers
already pay half of the state’s tax liability. The only effective way to
get billionaires to pay more, he said, would be if Congress enacted a
wealth tax on high earners.

“It’s interesting when you have people elected to Congress pushing for
state action when they can’t get action in Congress,” Mr. Mujica said.
“It’s absolutely necessary for the federal government to step up and
provide the support we need.”

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is part of a coordinated effort that aims to persuade
Mr. Cuomo that the state should act first.

On Thursday, a campaign-like video was released that featured Ms.
Ocasio-Cortez; Ms. Ramos; the New York City public advocate, Jumaane
Williams; and two Assembly members, Carmen De La Rosa and Yuh-Line Niou.

“Governor Cuomo, we need you to pass a billionaires’ tax, in order to
make sure that we’re providing for our working families,” Ms.
Ocasio-Cortez said [in the
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIA1ex88faM&feature=youtu.be).
“It’s time to stop protecting billionaires, and it’s time to start
working for working families.”

Also on Thursday, 100 immigrant workers started a 24-hour fast and
sleep-out near the Fifth Avenue penthouse of Jeff Bezos, the founder of
Amazon and one of the richest men in the world. On Friday, hundreds of
people are expected to hold a “march on billionaires” that will end at
Mr. Cuomo’s Manhattan office.

“We are calling for a just recovery for all New Yorkers, but right now
our system is rigged to protect the mega-rich,” said Angeles Solis, lead
organizer for Make the Road New York, one of the groups in the
coalition.

Last year, a so-called pied-à-terre tax on the second homes of the
wealthy in New York City gained some momentum after Kenneth C. Griffin,
a hedge fund billionaire with an estimated net worth of $10 billion,
purchased the most expensive single family home in the United States, a
[$238 million
apartment](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/nyregion/238-million-penthouse-sale.html)
on Central Park South.

Mr. Cuomo voiced support for the plan before it fell apart after the
[real estate industry exerted
pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/nyregion/pied-a-terre-tax.html)
on legislators.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the financial crisis created by the coronavirus — the state
estimates it needs more than $10 billion to stave off major cuts in
education, health care and public safety — has forced lawmakers to
reconsider implementing new taxes.

Last month, 103 Democratic legislators — including a majority in the
State Senate — signed on to[a
letter](http://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Statement-of-Principles-6.pdf)
that called for the wealthy to pay their share, and pledged not to allow
budget cuts “without raising revenue from those who can most afford to
pay more.”

Ms. Ramos, who represents areas of Queens hit hardest by the
coronavirus, said the environment has changed since the failure of the
pied-à-terre
tax.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“The pandemic has only exacerbated the holes that already existed in our
safety net,” she said. “It is much easier to make the case for taxing
billionaires now that there is such widespread strife, and unemployment
has never been higher.”

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that Ms. Ramos’s bill would give “much deserved
economic relief” to the many people suffering from the effects of the
outbreak, especially undocumented immigrants “who have been at the
forefront of the crisis as essential workers.”

This is not the first time that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who

she has criticized Mr. Cuomo over his plan to add more police officers

Mr. Cuomo, in turn, has sought to

Ms. Ocasio Cortez’s role in scuttling the plans of Amazon to locate one
of its headquarters in Queens. More recently, the governor said Ms.
Ocasio-Cortez was mistaken in speculating that crime had risen because
people were unable to pay their rent and were fearful of eviction; he
pointed out that there was a state moratorium on evictions.

With Republicans no longer in charge of the State Senate, the proposals
for new taxes on the wealthy will undoubtedly have a far greater chance
of passing. But Robert G. Ortt, the Senate Republican minority leader,
still asserted that a billionaires’ tax would be a mistake that would
“send individuals who already pay for most of New York’s services away
to lower tax states along with their businesses and jobs.”

“We need to examine spending and start cutting waste before everyone
escapes from New York,” he added.

Yet in the end, Mr. Cuomo may be the biggest barrier to new taxes on the
wealthy; the governor has insisted that the federal government must
“step up” to help New York.

In late May, shortly after ringing the bell [to reopen the New York
Stock
Exchange](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-photos-amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-rings-opening-bell-new-york-stock),
the governor demurred when asked whether he’d support taxing the rich,
saying he was “still banking on Washington doing the intelligent thing.”

“I still don’t want to create the possibility or the excuse for
Washington to say, ‘Well, we don’t have to act,’” [he
said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9MFvDGjI64).

A recent analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness found that the wealth of
New York’s 119 billionaires [increased by $77 billion from March to
June](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/state-reports-billionaires-wealth-growth-coronavirus-pandemic-march-june-2020/),
a period that saw the state gain a new billionaire. The total net worth
of New York’s billionaires grew to $600.7 billion from $521.5 billion
from March to June, according to an analysis of data from Forbes.

“You are barely slowing down their growth in wealth,” said Frank
Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. “The
pandemic has been fabulous for helping people understand how vulnerable
so many millions of Americans are, and just how upside down the economic
system is.”
