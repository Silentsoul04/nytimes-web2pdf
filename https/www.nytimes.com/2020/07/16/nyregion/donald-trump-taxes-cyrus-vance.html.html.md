# D.A. Accuses Trump of Delay ‘Strategy’ in Fight Over Tax Returns

</div>

The Manhattan district attorney told a judge that by refusing to comply
with a subpoena, the president is effectively putting himself above the
law.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office accused [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/nyregion/trump-sharpton-ny-history.html)
on Thursday of purposely dragging out a court battle over a subpoena
[seeking eight years of his tax
returns](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html)
in an attempt to effectively shield himself from criminal investigation.

Carey R. Dunne, a lawyer for the prosecutor’s office, told a federal
judge that the longer the president disputes the subpoena, the higher
the chance that the statute of limitations would expire for any possible
crime that may have been committed.

The office is seeking the president’s personal tax returns and those of
his family business, the Trump Organization, as part of an investigation
into hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election. The
[president has been fighting the
subpoena](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/politics/trump-taxes.html)
for nearly a year.

“What the president’s lawyers are seeking here is delay,” Mr. Dunne
said. “I think that’s the entire strategy here.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He added: “Let’s not let delay kill this case.”

The prosecutor’s assertion came during a virtual hearing held before the
judge, Victor Marrero, of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr.
Trump’s lawyers did not respond directly to the accusation in court.

Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said later in an email, “Our
strategy seeks due process.”

The district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, issued the
subpoena to Mr. Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, in August.

Mr. Trump initially fought the subpoena last year with a bold and
untested argument: that a sitting president was immune from a state
criminal investigation. [Judge Marrero oversaw that case and ruled
against the
president](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/nyregion/trump-taxes-lawsuit-vance.html),
and his [decision was upheld by an appeals
court](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/nyregion/trump-taxes-vance-appeal.html).

The case went to the [Supreme Court, which last week also rejected the
president’s
argument](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/trump-taxes-supreme-court.html).
Still, the high court left open the possibility that Mr. Trump could
raise new objections to the subpoena.

The case was sent back to Judge Marrero, [who called for the hearing
this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html)
so that both sides could outline their positions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the hearing, a lawyer for the president, William S. Consovoy, made it
clear that Mr. Trump was likely to raise challenges to the scope of the
subpoena, which Mr. Consovoy characterized as “wildly overbroad,” and to
raise the question of whether there was a political motivation in
issuing it.

After the Supreme Court ruling was handed down last week, the White
House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, called the subpoena “frivolous
and politically motivated.”

Mr. Consovoy also said the president should be able to learn more about
the district attorney’s investigation, which largely has been kept
secret, and suggested that it was unfair for him to have to challenge a
subpoena without having access to “at least some information about its
nature and scope.”

At the hearing, Judge Marrero noted that in his ruling last year
rejecting the president’s claim of immunity, he also found that the
district attorney was not acting in bad faith.

In arguing that the delay could prevent a grand jury from considering
evidence before any statutes of limitations ran out, Mr. Dunne said that
the president was effectively getting the immunity from criminal inquiry
that the Supreme Court denied him. Other people and entities could also
escape scrutiny, Mr. Dunne said, without elaboration.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers must outline their new objections to the subpoena by
July 27, and Mr. Vance can then respond.

Mr. Vance has been looking into hush-money payments that Michael D.
Cohen, the president’s lawyer and former fixer, made in 2016 to Stormy
Daniels, an adult film actress who said she had an affair with Mr.
Trump. The president has denied an affair.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cohen later [pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance
violations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html)
for his role in that deal and another payment. Mr. Cohen, [who is
serving a three-year sentence at a federal prison in Otisville,
N.Y.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html),
implicated the president, saying in court that he had acted on Mr.
Trump’s orders.

[After federal prosecutors concluded their investigation last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-investigation.html),
Mr. Vance’s office began examining whether New York State laws had been
broken when Mr. Trump and his company reimbursed Mr. Cohen. The subpoena
was issued as part of that inquiry.

Even if Mr. Vance’s office wins its fight for the president’s records,
the documents are not likely to become public in the foreseeable future.
The materials would be shielded by grand jury secrecy rules and would
probably emerge only if charges were later filed and the records were
introduced as evidence at a trial.
