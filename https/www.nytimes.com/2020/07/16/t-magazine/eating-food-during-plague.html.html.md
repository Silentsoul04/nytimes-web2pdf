# What We Eat During a Plague

AT THE OUTSET of “[The
Decameron](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/07/magazine/decameron-project-short-story-collection.html),”
the 14th-century story collection by the Italian writer Giovanni
Boccaccio, a group of 10 young nobles — seven women and three men — flee
“the death-dealing pestilence” sweeping through Florence and make their
way to a country repast in the Tuscan hills. “Using very temperately of
the most delicate viands and the finest wines and eschewing all
incontinence,” Boccaccio writes, as translated by John Payne, of their
carefree, 10-day idyll, “they abode with music and such other diversions
as they might have, never suffering themselves to speak with any nor
choosing to hear any news from without of death or sick folk.” They
dined off “tables laid with the whitest of cloths and beakers that
seemed of silver,” sustaining themselves according to the common medical
wisdom of the day, which held that a cheerful disposition was as
necessary to keep the plague at bay as the right kind of food.

Boccaccio never describes these feasts in detail, but it’s easy to guess
what his nobles might have eaten: rich banquets of wild birds and veal
spiced with pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg imported at great expense from
Asia — and white bread, sliced and crustless, the only kind considered
suitable for the wealthy. Vegetables, deemed lowly and unwholesome, and
thus fit for the laity, might have been missing from the table. Diets at
the time, for rich and poor alike, were based off the humoral science of
the ancient Greeks, which held that unevenness between the body’s four
humors — blood, phlegm, choler (yellow bile) and melancholy (black bile)
— caused every kind of ailment. Once consumed, food was thought to
become blood and then flesh, having the potential to recalibrate the
body’s humoral balance, which could affect, or indeed transform, a
person’s constitution. Every food possessed fixed humoral qualities —
fennel was hot and dry, cucumber was cold and wet — and assigned a place
in a rigid cosmic hierarchy. While peasants ate foods like cabbages and
turnips that grew near the ground, along with whole-grain breads and
thick, stodgy gruels, aristocrats feasted on airborne fowl, sometimes
**** dressed, says [Ken
Albala](https://www.pacific.edu/academics/schools-and-colleges/college-of-the-pacific/academics/departments-and-programs/history/faculty-directory/ken-albala.html),
a historian at the University of the Pacific, “in completely whimsical,
shocking disguises” — tinged with dye, suspended in aspic (a medieval
invention) or stitched together into fantastical creatures. Those
underlying principles didn’t change at the height of the Black Death,
which arrived in Europe around 1347, but dietary recommendations did
“become less daring,” Albala adds, with physicians at the time
suggesting “mild foods unlikely to corrupt into melancholy or upset the
system in any way, which is, coincidentally, what people do
psychologically in any time of stress.” Even centuries ago, times of
crisis induced [a return to the
familiar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/business/coronavirus-processed-foods.html).

SINCE MARCH, NEWSPAPERS, magazines, lifestyle websites and, of course,
social media feeds have bloated with images of
[focaccia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/dining/focaccia-bread.html)
and
[sourdough](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/science/sourdough-bread-starter-library.html),
[beans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/business/coronavirus-beans-sales.html)
and

glossy-skinned

and fat-slicked [pot
roasts](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020845-slow-cooker-pot-roast):
rich, flavorful dishes that, for the most part, Boccaccio might have
recognized. Following the recent shift toward plant-based cooking and
the boom in boutique dietary restrictions — sales of gluten-free
products, for instance, have grown enormously over the last decade,
while the past several years have seen immense investments in
tech-fueled meat replacements — these images are striking in their
apparent indifference to the dogmas of so-called “clean” eating. Indeed,
in their flagrant carnality, the comfort foods of the novel coronavirus
crisis can seem practically medieval, particularly in their flouting of
health trends in favor of comfort.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Such comfort foods, according to the dominant paradigm of Anglo-American
food culture, are almost invariably bad for us — balms for the soul but
never what the body *needs,* at least not nutritionally. But there’s a
paradox therein: In medieval Europe, as in many of the world’s food
cultures today, comfort and health were inseparable; pleasure and
familiarity were among the guideposts to maintaining the body’s
equilibrium, a notion that persisted in popular thought even as medical
science transformed over the centuries.

When Spanish invaders brought a catastrophic outbreak of smallpox and
measles to the Americas in the 16th century, for instance, some
colonizers blamed the unfathomable crisis that ensued not on disease,
but on the same unfamiliar meats and wines introduced from Europe that
they claimed would “civilize” native populations (deaths among their own
kind, meanwhile, were attributed to local ingredients like corn and
chilies). To the Spaniards, eating unfamiliar foods could either
transform you or kill you. By the end of the 18th century, the
Enlightenment idea that all bodies — at least all white male bodies —
were fundamentally the same made humoral medicine seem largely outdated,
yet outside a small medical elite, food remained a principal tool for
treating disease. In the antebellum South, says [Carolyn
Roberts](https://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/carolyn-roberts), a Yale
historian focused on medicine and the slave trade, enslaved Black
healers remained **** a first line of defense against disease in their
communities, combining food-based medical knowledge with local
botanicals to blend healing traditions from Africa and the Americas,
even after hospitals became more common. **** In his “An Account of the
Bilious Remitting Yellow Fever, as it Appeared in the City of
Philadelphia, in the Year 1793,” the physician Benjamin Rush, a
proponent of modern medicine, nevertheless
[prescribes](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-2569009R-bk)
“lemonade, tamarind, jelly, and raw apple water, toast and water … and
camomile tea,” along with mercury-based treatments, during the early
stages of the illness and, as healing progressed, a course of “rich
broths, the flesh of poultry, oysters, thick gruel, mush and milk and
chocolate.” Recommended diets during the 1918 influenza pandemic were
practically identical, including meat broths and citrus juices to stave
off fever and oatmeal, potato soups, custards and toast as the patient
recovered. Even **** the folk adage to “feed a cold, starve a fever”
contains vestiges of that humoral sensibility.

But what *did* change was the way that many Europeans and Americans
related to their bodies outside of illness. The same Enlightenment
ideals that yielded political revolutions and, on the flip side,
justified colonialism on the basis of European superiority as a supposed
biological imperative, later remade how the aristocracy dined: Coursed
meals, where every diner ate the same thing at the same time, replaced
vast banquets, where everyone chose the food that best suited his or her
constitution. Later, in the 19th century, breakthroughs in chemistry and
the discovery of germs as a vector for disease broke humans down into
agglomerations of fats and proteins. “You no longer had a right to have
views on what your body required: what is required is a scientific
fact,” says [Rebecca
Earle](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/people/staff_index/earle/),
a food historian at the University of Warwick. “And your appetite is
just a problem as far as nutritional science is concerned.”

That same authoritative attitude persisted in the 20th century in the
form of diet culture, which still treats having the “wrong” body as a
sign of moral sickness. In the early days of the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic,
the assimilationist wing of the gay community relied on a similar
philosophy, recalls the Oakland-based food writer [John
Birdsall](https://www.john-birdsall.com/), the argument being that, *if
you eat well then that will stave off the infection*. Hedonism, the
wider culture insisted, had brought this plague down upon gay people;
austerity, in the form of fatless macrobiotic diets and then-nascent
American vegetarianism, could prevent it.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same time, the more radical side of the queer movement insisted
that gustatory pleasure could save queer bodies, just as claiming a
right to sexual pleasure had saved their souls. In his 1990s-era cooking
column “Get Fat, Don’t Die\!” published for nearly a decade in the
darkly humorous San Francisco zine “[Diseased Pariah
News](https://calisphere.org/collections/22661/?fbclid=IwAR2XcihgRMuSlZePJfzGuwyfZhaKWUutxnHqZQworbMUDdoOj0wpYYNf-5s),”
the activist Beowulf Thorne, writing under the pseudonym Biffy Mae,
prescribed meals of cereal with cream or half-and-half, gingerbread
puddings and Thai curries with the same enthusiasm that Rush reserved
for meat broths and weak tea. As Jonathan Kauffman wrote in [his recent
article](https://hazlitt.net/longreads/get-fat-dont-die) for Hazlitt,
Thorne “mocked nutritional supplements marketed to people with AIDS, and
leaned into Bisquick, his tastes alternately cosmopolitan and
straight-from-the-box
comforting.”

“ALTERNATELY COSMOPOLITAN AND straight-from-the-box comforting” more or
less encapsulates the core of [today’s quarantine
home-cooking](https://www.nytimes.com/article/recipes-cooking-tips-coronavirus.html).
The foods that have come to dominate social media — from lasagna to
congee, Tamil omelet curry to huevos rancheros, sourdough pancakes to
kimchi jjigae (with homemade kimchi, of course) — combine the limited
ingredients available at grocery stores with the one commodity that is
still in ample supply: time. Birdsall, after a few weeks of elaborate
meals, has returned in recent months to thrift and simplicity, imbuing
his back-to-basics dinners of braised greens and perfectly seared
hamburger patties with a monastic attention to detail that, he says,
“creates a halo around these limited ingredients.” [Sandor Ellix
Katz](https://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/), whose books
“Wild Fermentation” (2003) and “The Art of Fermentation” (2012) **
helped drive the fermentation revival of the last 15 years — and who
came to fermentation himself in the early 1990s — says his online
sourdough **** classes now draw up to 1,000 students each session. In
this time of disease and uncertainty, the making of artisanal foodstuffs
that many people would previously have left to professionals — buying
their bread at a bakery, their pickles from a deli, their kimchi from a
Korean grocer — has replaced physical fitness as one sign of
aspirational care. Corporeal pleasure has once again become a signal, if
not of physical health, then at least of mental health, as fundamental
to surviving this plague as it was to surviving the Black Death.

But while cooking has brought comfort and meaning into countless homes,
it has also highlighted stark global disparities. [One recent
study](https://sph.umich.edu/news/2020posts/coronavirus-pandemic-worsens-food-insecurity-for-low-income-adults.html)
out of the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health found that
44 percent of 1,500 low-income American households surveyed in late
March were already experiencing food insecurity. In
[Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/americas/mexico-coronavirus-cases.html),
where a nominally leftist president has suggested that eating healthy
foods instead of junk could prevent contagion, [dozens of merchants have
died](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/21/coronavirus-mexico-city-centro-abasto-market/?arc404=true)
in Latin America’s largest wholesale produce market. In
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html),
millions starve as they flee cities for villages, even while the
government stockpiles [unprecedented quantities of
grain](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/india-has-enough-food-to-feed-poor-amid-prolonged-shutdown-fears).
Like previous pandemics, Covid-19 has killed the poor quicker and in
greater numbers. If the foods we crave and cook have come to resemble a
medieval feast, maybe it’s because our society has been medieval all
along.

Still, the bubonic plague, for all its horror, was no apocalypse — and
Europe’s Middle Ages were not actually a time of darkness or stagnation.
The tragic deaths of tens of millions in Europe generated a labor
shortage that, over the course of more than a century, allowed the labor
class to demand higher wages, accumulate modest family wealth and even
change their diets, incorporating meat that had previously been
accessible only to the aristocracy. The 15th century heralded the
proliferation of Europe’s first published cookbooks as people of
middling ranks sought to emulate the cooking of the aristocracy,
complete with spices such as clove, galangal and long pepper that were
previously beyond their reach. The innovations often associated with the
Renaissance emerged out of revolutions in politics, education, art and
philosophy set in motion centuries before, often inspired and fed by the
same commercial and cultural exchanges that facilitated the spread of
disease in the first place.

Our generation’s pandemic has come with a revolution of its own, one
that has spread even faster than the virus. Calls for justice and
political change replaced the loving pictures of split sourdough loaves,
dan dan noodles gleaming with chile oil and turmeric-stained bowls of
khichdi, the rice-and-lentil porridge served in countless variations
across South Asia as both an iconic comfort food and, in times of
illness, a **** tonic. In the last couple months, we’ve witnessed the
toppling of bastions of [white food
culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/dining/john-t-edge-southern-foodways-alliance.html)
along with monuments that commemorate a shameful history of racism and
colonization, a movement — led by people of color — that demands, yet
again, the sort of political equality that the Enlightenment failed to
deliver. It also seems to require a return to a much older understanding
of our bodies as fluid and changeable, each with its own way of healing,
its own individual kind of comfort. Restricted as they were by class and
access, perhaps the foods that unfurled across Instagram for all those
months were a glimpse of a food culture that matches a new society, one
that relies not on self-denial or appropriation or facile notions of
unity, but looks instead like a medieval banquet refracted through
Thorne’s proposed comfort and cosmopolitanism: an endless table, a
fantastical bounty, with space for every kind of body and every kind of
desire.
