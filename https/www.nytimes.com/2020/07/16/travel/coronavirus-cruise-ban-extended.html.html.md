# Extending Cruise Ban, C.D.C. Slams Industry for Spreading Coronavirus

</div>

In a scathing order extending the current “no sail” order on U.S. cruise
lines, the agency said it spent 38,000 hours managing the outbreaks on
ships.

As the coronavirus pandemic raged around the world, cruise ship
companies continued to allow their crews to attend social gatherings,
work out at gyms and share buffet-style meals, violating basic protocols
designed to stop the spread of the highly transmissible virus, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a [scathing 20-page
order](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/No-Sail-Order-Cruise-Ships-Second-Extension_07_16_2020-p.pdf),
released Thursday, that extended the suspension of cruise operations
until Sept. 30.

In a rebuke of the cruise ship companies, Robert R. Redfield, the
director of the C.D.C., blamed them for widespread transmission of the
virus. The C.D.C. said there were 99 outbreaks aboard 123 cruise ships
in United States waters alone, the agency said in the statement. From
March 1 until July 10, 80 percent of the ships in the C.D.C.’s
jurisdiction were affected by the coronavirus. The agency said there had
been nearly 3,000 suspected and confirmed cases and 34 deaths on ships
in U.S. waters.

As of July 3, nine ships still had ongoing or resolving outbreaks.

The C.D.C. spent at least 38,000 hours managing the crisis, the order
said. Public health authorities had to do contact tracing for some
11,000 passengers, more than the number of contacts identified from
airplane flights since the beginning of the pandemic, the C.D.C. said.

The cruise industry has struggled to manage the coronavirus pandemic
since the start, when the [Diamond
Princess](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/world/asia/coronavirus-cruise-ship.html),
part of the cruise giant Carnival Corporation, moored in the Japanese
harbor of Yokohama, Japan, amid an outbreak that eventually infected 712
people and killed nine of them. Even as warnings were issued about the
dangers of cruise-ship travel, passengers kept boarding and ships kept
sailing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though more and more cruise passengers fell ill, companies [continued
their
voyages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/travel/coronavirus-cruise-costa-luminosa.html),
offering entertainment that included live music and pool parties. The
industry ultimately suspended operations in mid-March, but as ships made
their way to port, many passengers and crew were stranded around the
world, as countries refused the ships
entry.

One ship arrived in Fort Lauderdale with four [dead
passengers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-cruise-zaandam-rotterdam-florida.html)
on board.

Many of those passengers who were allowed to disembark from contaminated
ships “traversed international airports, boarded planes and returned to
their homes,” the C.D.C. said, potentially spreading the virus further.

The cruise industry had already voluntarily suspended operations until
Sept. 15, and many companies withdrew their ships from United States
waters, removing them from the C.D.C.’s jurisdiction. But the order from
Dr. Redfield underscores the gap between the industry and the public
health agency. The companies cannot begin to sail again until they come
up with cohesive plans for prevention and mitigation of the illness.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Cruise ship companies submitted plans on how to safely evacuate crews,
but nearly all the companies failed to meet the basic requirements
necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the C.D.C. said. Crew
members still bunked together and shared bathrooms. Even ships that
seemed to have gone a month without any coronavirus cases had crew
members who tested positive upon reaching shore, Dr. Redfield said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One company, Norwegian Cruise Lines, said it felt it had exceeded
recommended C.D.C. guidance, because crew members were not just asked
but “encouraged” to wear face coverings, the order said. Disney
acknowledged that some of its asymptomatic-infected crew members had not
quarantined until after the results of shipwide testing came in.

The companies created a task force to come up with recommendations on
how to safely sail, but according to the C.D.C., the group will not
produce its findings for several months.

If unrestricted cruise-ship passenger operations were permitted to
resume, it would put “substantial unnecessary risk” on communities,
health care workers, port personnel and federal employees, the order
said, as well as placing passengers and crew members at increased risk.

The agency’s previous no-sail order was set to expire July 24.

Disney said only one of its four ships, the Disney Wonder, had an
outbreak on board<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>—but only
after passengers had disembarked. The company tested every crew member
on board and isolated non-essential crew to their cabins for three weeks
in April. Half the 174 crew who tested positive had no symptoms, the
company
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The ship has not had a positive case since May 8, Disney said.

Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line, whose failures were
specifically cited in the C.D.C. document, released statements in
response to the order that did not specifically address the allegations.

Norwegian said it canceled trips through September, as well as cruises
embarking from or calling on ports in Canada in October. “We continue to
partner with the C.D.C. and other authorities to mitigate the impact of
COVID-19 by prioritizing the health and safety of our passengers and
crew,” the company said.

Royal Caribbean said it would suspend operations through September to
comply with the order. “The health and safety of our guests, crew and
the communities we visit is our top priority,” the company said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Carnival Cruises said that it had already extended its suspension
through September. But the company plans three voyages in Germany next
month through a European line, and Italy trips are also expected soon, a
spokesman said.

Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Line Industry
Association, a trade organization that represents most of the major
cruise companies, released a statement that did not address the C.D.C.
criticisms.

“As we continue to work towards the development of enhanced protocols to
support the safe resumption of cruise operations around the world, we
look forward to timely and productive dialogue with the C.D.C. to
determine measures that will be appropriate for ocean-going cruise
operations to resume in the United States when the time is right,” she
said.
