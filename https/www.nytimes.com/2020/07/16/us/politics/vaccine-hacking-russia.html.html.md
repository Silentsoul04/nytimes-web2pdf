WASHINGTON —
[Russian](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/russia-disinformation-coronavirus.html)
hackers are attempting to steal [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/russia-disinformation-coronavirus.html)
research, the American, British and Canadian governments said Thursday,
accusing the Kremlin of opening a new front in its spy battles with the
West amid the worldwide competition to contain the pandemic.

The National Security Agency said that a hacking group implicated in the
2016 break-ins into Democratic Party servers has been trying to steal
intelligence on [vaccines from universities, companies and other health
care
organizations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html).
The group, associated with Russian intelligence and known as both APT29
and Cozy Bear, has sought to exploit the chaos created by the
[coronavirus pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus),
officials said.

American intelligence officials said the Russians were aiming to steal
research to develop their own vaccine more quickly, not to sabotage
other countries’ efforts. There was likely little immediate damage to
global public health, cybersecurity experts said.

The Russian espionage nevertheless signals a new kind of competition
between Moscow and Washington akin to Cold War spies stealing
technological secrets during the space race generations ago.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Russian hackers have targeted British, Canadian and American
organizations using malware and sending fraudulent emails to try to
trick their employees into turning over passwords and other security
credentials, all in an effort to gain access to the vaccine research as
well as information about medical supply chains.

The accusations against Russia were also the latest example of an
increasing willingness in recent months by the United States and its
closest intelligence allies to publicly accuse foreign adversaries of
breaches and cyberattacks. The American government has previously warned
about efforts [by China and
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/us/politics/coronavirus-china-cyber-hacking.html)
to steal vaccine research.

Attributing such attacks, however, is imprecise, an ambiguity that
Moscow takes advantage of in denying responsibility, as it did Thursday.

Still, government officials, as well as outside experts, expressed
strong confidence that Cozy Bear, controlled by Russia’s elite S.V.R.
intelligence agency, was responsible for the attempted intrusions into
the virus vaccine research.

“We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to
combat the coronavirus pandemic,” said Paul Chichester, the director of
operations for Britain’s National Cyber Security Center.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The head of the center, Ciaran Martin, [told NBC
News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-attempting-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-research-u-s-u-k-n1234021)
that the cyberattacks were first detected in February and that no
evidence had emerged that data was
stolen.

Government officials would not identify victims of the hackings. But the
primary target of the attacks appeared to be Oxford University in
Britain and the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca,
which have been jointly working on a vaccine, said Robert Hannigan, the
former head of G.C.H.Q., the British intelligence agency.

Oxford scientists said on Thursday that they had noticed a surprising
resemblance between their vaccine approach and the work that Russian
scientists had reported.

Though Russia could be seeking to steal the vaccine data to bolster its
own research, it could also be trying to avoid relying on Western
countries for any eventual coronavirus vaccine.

While AstraZeneca has announced it will make the Oxford vaccine
available at cost, governments and philanthropies have paid huge sums to
the company to secure their place in line, even without any guarantee it
will work. The United States has said it will pay up to [$1.2 billion to
AstraZeneca](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/health/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca.html)
to fund a clinical trial and secure 300 million doses. Russia could find
itself near the back of the line if the vaccine proves successful.

“Russia clearly doesn’t want to disrupt vaccine production, but they
don’t want to be dependent on the U.S. or the U.K. for production and
discovery of the vaccine,” said Mr. Hannigan, now an executive at the
BlueVoyant cybersecurity firm. “It not impossible to think Kremlin pride
is such that they don’t want that to happen.”

An intense international race is underway to develop a vaccine for the
coronavirus that has already [killed 580,000
people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
and upended daily life around the world. More than [155
vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
are under development, including 23 being tested on humans.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some vaccines work by altering another common virus to mimic the
coronavirus to prompt an immune response without making people sick. The
research by Oxford and AstraZeneca is based on one such pathogen, a
chimpanzee adenovirus. Russia’s Ministry of Health is trying to use two
other adenoviruses but is not as far along in its testing as the Oxford
researchers are.

Some officials suggested the Russian attacks have not been hugely
successful but were widespread enough to warrant a coordinated
international warning.

Across the globe, intelligence services have stepped up their focus on
information surrounding the virus. The F.B.I. director, Christopher A.
Wray, accused China last week of [“working to compromise American health
care
organizations”](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states)
conducting Covid-19 research.

“Russia is not alone,” said John Hultquist, the senior director of
intelligence analysis at FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity firm.
“A lot of people are in this game even if they haven’t been called out
yet. The whole pandemic is absolutely riddled with spies.”

Chinese government hackers have long focused on stealing intellectual
property and technology. Russia has aimed much of its recent
cyberespionage, like election interference, at weakening geopolitical
rivals and strengthening its hand.

“China is more well known for theft through hacking than Russia, which
is of course better now for using hacks for disruption and chaos,” said
[Laura
Rosenberger](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/author/laura-rosenberger/),
a former Obama administration official who now leads the [Alliance for
Securing Democracy.](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/) “But there’s
no question that whoever gets to a vaccine first thinks they will have
geopolitical advantage, and that’s something I’d expect Russia to want.”

Still, a Russian intrusion could inadvertently damage some vaccine data
and additional security protocols to protect from future cyberattacks
could impose a burden on researchers. Private firms are more at risk
than the public, said Mike Chapple, a former National Security Agency
computer scientist who teaches cybersecurity at the University of Notre
Dame.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The potential harm here is limited to commercial harm, to companies
that are devoting a lot of their own resources into developing a vaccine
in hopes it will be financially rewarding down the road,” he said.

The Kremlin mocked the announcements Thursday, and Russian officials
said they did not know who could have hacked the companies or research
centers in Britain. One Russian official said the accusation was an
attempt to discredit Moscow’s own work on a
vaccine.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of
Russia, told reporters that the accusations were unacceptable. “Russia
has nothing to do with these attempts,” he said.

Cozy Bear is one of the highest-profile, and most successful, hacking
groups associated with the Russian government. It was implicated
alongside the group Fancy Bear in the [2016 hacking of the Democratic
National
Committee](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/mueller-indictment-russian-intelligence-hacking.html).
Though Cozy Bear is believed [to have breached the committee’s
computers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/technology/dnc-russian-hacking.html),
it played no known role in releasing stolen Democratic emails.

Cozy Bear “has a long history of targeting governmental, diplomatic,
think tank, health care and energy organizations for intelligence gain,
so we encourage everyone to take this threat seriously,” said Anne
Neuberger, the National Security Agency’s cybersecurity director.

The malware used by Cozy Bear to steal the vaccine research included
code known as “WellMess” and “WellMail.” The Russian group has not
previously used that malware, according to British officials.

But American experts say the tactics used in trying to obtain access to
the vaccine data bear all the hallmarks of Russian intelligence
officials. And American officials said they were confident in
attributing the attacks to the Russian hacking group.

The American, British and Canadian governments said Cozy Bear used
[recently publicized weak spots in computer
networks](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/16/2002457639/-1/-1/0/NCSC_APT29_ADVISORY-QUAD-OFFICIAL-20200709-1810.PDF)
to get a foothold. If organizations do not immediately patch a
vulnerability that a software company has identified, their networks can
be exposed to hacks.

Once Cozy Bear hackers exploit those gaps to gain entry to a computer
system, they create legitimate credentials to maintain access even after
the hole is patched.

While the various Russian hacking groups often share similar targets,
they are run by different intelligence agencies for different purposes.

Hackers with Cozy Bear are after information but do not generally
release it publicly, according to government and outside experts. Fancy
Bear, which works for Russian military intelligence and is also known as
APT28, will often publicize the information it steals.

Cozy Bear’s ties are to the S.V.R., the Russian equivalent of the
C.I.A., according to current and former officials. Unlike other Russian
hackers, Cozy Bears operations are sophisticated, stealthy and hard to
detect.

“Their job is quiet, old-fashioned intelligence collection,” said Mr.
Hultquist, the cybersecurity analyst.

Reporting was contributed by Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco, David
D. Kirkpatrick and Stephen Castle from London, Andrew Higgins from
Moscow, and Charlie Savage from Washington.
