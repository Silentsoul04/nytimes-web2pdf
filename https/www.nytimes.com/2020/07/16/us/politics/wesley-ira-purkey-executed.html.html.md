WASHINGTON — The Justice Department executed a 68-year-old man on
Thursday for the gruesome murder in 1998 of a teenage girl, the second
time this week the federal government has carried out capital punishment
after a 17-year hiatus.

Wesley Ira Purkey was put to death at the federal penitentiary in Terre
Haute, Ind., by lethal injection after the Supreme Court rejected the
last of a number of legal challenges including assertions that he was
not mentally competent.

He was pronounced dead at 8:19 a.m.

In the moments before his death, Mr. Purkey’s arms were strapped to a
gurney, and a light blue blanket covered his body, according to a
journalist who witnessed the execution. His spiritual adviser was nearby
in a face mask and surgical mask, praying with gloved palms pressed
together.

“I deeply regret the pain and suffering I caused to Jennifer’s family,”
Mr. Purkey said before the execution, referring to his victim, Jennifer
Long, 16, whom he raped, murdered and dismembered in Kansas City, Mo.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I am deeply sorry,” Mr. Purkey said after a Bureau of Prisons official
removed a mask from his face so he could speak. “I deeply regret the
pain I caused to my daughter, who I love so very much. This sanitized
murder really does not serve no purpose whatsoever. Thank you.”

He took several deep breaths and blinked repeatedly before he lay his
head back down on the gurney. With his mouth ajar and eyes closed, Mr.
Purkey lay motionless for several minutes before prison officials
reported a time of death.

The Justice Department announced its intention to bring back federal
capital punishment last summer. After a series of court fights over its
plan to use a single drug for lethal injection, Attorney General William
P. Barr scheduled four executions for this summer, the first by the
federal government since
2003.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Bureau of Prisons [put to death Daniel Lewis Lee, 47, on Tuesday
morning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html)
for his part in the murder of a family of three. Just hours before, the
Supreme Court issued the final go-ahead, [ruling in a split 5-4
decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/federal-execution.html)
in the dead of night that the federal government’s single-drug execution
protocol was constitutional. The verdict cleared the way for Mr. Lee,
Mr. Purkey, and Dustin Lee Honken, scheduled to die on Friday, to be
executed this week.

Mr. Purkey’s lawyers had argued that he was incompetent to be executed.
They said he suffered from schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and brain
damage, which left him unable to comprehend why he was sentenced to
death. He believed that his execution was intended as retaliation by the
federal government for his frequent complaints about prison conditions,
they said.

Judge Tanya Chutkan of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C.,
ruled on Wednesday that Mr. Purkey’s execution should be delayed until
the court could determine whether he was fit to be executed.

In a separate decision, Judge Chutkan also ruled on Wednesday that the
lethal injection protocol required additional litigation to determine
whether it violated several federal statutes and the inmates’
constitutional rights. She cited the potential for “irreparable harm” if
the inmates were put to death before their claims could be resolved by
the court.

The government filed an immediate appeal in both cases. Judge Chutkan’s
delays forced the Bureau to briefly postpone Mr. Purkey’s death,
scheduled for Wednesday evening. The Supreme Court, which overturned a
similar ruling from Judge Chutkan about the single-drug protocol in Mr.
Lee’s case earlier this week, vacated both preliminary injunctions early
Thursday.

In the case concerning Mr. Purkey’s mental fitness, the court split 5-4
with the liberal justices dissenting, as they did earlier this week in
Mr. Lee’s case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan, wrote that continuing with
Mr. Purkey’s execution “despite the grave questions and factual findings
regarding his mental competency, casts a shroud of constitutional doubt
over the most irrevocable of injuries.”

In a separate dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice
Ginsburg, reiterated questions about the effectiveness of the death
penalty as a form of deterrence and retribution.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“A modern system of criminal justice must be reasonably accurate, fair,
humane, and timely. Our recent experience with the federal government’s
resumption of executions adds to the mounting body of evidence that the
death penalty cannot be reconciled with those values,” he wrote. “I
remain convinced of the importance of reconsidering the
constitutionality of the death penalty
itself.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

A federal appeals court panel had issued a stay in Mr. Purkey’s case
that remained in effect until the day before his death. In that
proceeding, Mr. Purkey claimed that his legal counsel failed to
adequately defend him at trial and during his habeas proceedings, but
the government argued that federal law barred him from raising the issue
so late in his case.

The Seventh Circuit ruled that his claims deserved another look by the
court before he was executed. The Supreme Court rejected that argument.

The coronavirus pandemic also complicated Mr. Purkey’s case. The Rev.
Dale Hartkemeyer, a Buddhist priest and his spiritual adviser, said he
could not attend Mr. Purkey’s execution without exposing himself to the
virus. The priest, who goes by the name of Seigen, had developed a
relationship with Mr. Purkey over more than a decade. But he said his
history of bronchitis and pleurisy, lung-related illnesses, left him at
greater risk from the coronavirus.

Mr. Hartkemeyer sued the Justice Department, joined by a spiritual
adviser for Mr. Honken. They argued that by forcing them to choose
between their religious duties and health, the government violated the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law prohibits the government from
burdening an individual’s exercise of religion.

A federal judge in Indiana rejected the lawsuit Tuesday, and the Supreme
Court dismissed Mr. Hartkemeyer’s case Thursday morning.

Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information
Center, said the court failed to give Mr. Purkey the opportunity to
adequately defend his claims before his death. If the justices had
followed the rules of judicial
decision-making,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Mr. Purkey
would not have been executed, Mr. Dunham said.

“They did it again,” he said. “Five members of the court knew what
outcome they wanted before they decided, and the merits didn’t matter.”
