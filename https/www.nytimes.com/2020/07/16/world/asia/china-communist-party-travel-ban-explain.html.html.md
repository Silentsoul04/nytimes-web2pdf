# U.S. Wants to Bar Members of China’s Communist Party. Who Are They?

</div>

With more than 90 million members and led by Xi Jinping, the party
encompasses people at the heights of Chinese power and the civil
servants of everyday life.

As the Trump administration weighs [a travel ban against the members of
the Chinese Communist Party and their
relatives](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/us/politics/china-travel-ban.html),
it is considering cutting off a vast sector of Chinese society — 92
million people — that often defies stereotypes, including those who walk
the halls of power in Beijing, supervise China’s schools and run major
companies.

Barring them would change the topography of the [U.S.-China
relationship](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/asia/us-china-consulate.html)
in the most prosaic of ways: It would cut off huge numbers of regular
Chinese who, in pre-coronavirus pandemic times, traveled to the United
States by the millions to do business, see the sights, shop at high-end
department stores and study at some of the country’s most elite
universities.

Blocking the party members would not only turn off an economic spigot
for the United States, but also plunge the relationship between the
world’s two largest economies into a new phase of deeper isolation. Who
are the members of the Communist Party? Here’s what we know.

## Leaders, prize winners, dissenters and caretakers

Some Communist Party members are the stolid apparatchiks of the
Communist stereotype; many are not. At the heady heights of political
power in Beijing, members craft harsh crackdowns, [misleading
propaganda](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
and [sweeping
surveillance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html)
designed to preserve the party’s autocratic rule over the country.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They keep tabs on people they consider political troublemakers and
control China’s government in Beijing. They enforce rules that have led
to [the internment of more than a million members of
minorities](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)
like the [Uighurs in the country’s
west](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-court.html).

Yet voices of dissent have also come from the party. Dr. Li Wenliang,
who sounded the alarm online about a mysterious virus that emerged in
China and was [interrogated by the
police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html)
for his trouble before dying of Covid-19, was a party member.

So, too, is the Uighur [economist Ilham
Tohti](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/ilham-tohti-uighur-human-rights-award.html),
a winner of the Sakharov Prize.

[Recent
statistics](http://www.12371.cn/2020/06/30/ARTI1593514894217396.shtml)
showed 12.3 million of them are 30 or younger, about half have college
or university degrees, and 27.9 percent are female. Many party members
also offer child care services, run schools, manage technology
companies, organize beach cleanups, act in blockbuster movies and do
outreach to older Chinese citizens. Alongside them are academics,
scientists and business people — lifelines for a U.S.-Chinese economic
relationship that has persisted despite souring ties.

For those not at the top rungs of power, membership in the party is
often a way to fuel one’s career by making the right connections. During
the boom years from the 1980s to the early 2010s, many Chinese joined
the party to get a leg up in business, academics and the arts.

## A party born of a civil war

Founded in 1921, the Communist Party has dominated politics in China
since it won a civil war against the Nationalists of the Republic of
China in 1949. Since then, it has gone through many evolutions, some
dictated by practicality, others by the small-minded calculations of
power grabs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent decades, the party has appeared to emerge as a bastion of
technocrats wielding industrial policy and close ties to business to
emphasize economic growth, even as they sharply punished those who
defied their power.

[Under Xi
Jinping](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-constitution.html),
China’s top leader,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>a party
that 10 years ago was often jokingly called a business group
masquerading as Marxists has reaffirmed its Communist roots. Members
must engage in study sessions of high theory, at times with the
[tracking
power](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-study-the-great-nation-app.html)
of apps to monitor their reading habits.

Mr. Xi has emphasized political loyalty over economic benefits, and a
ferocious anticorruption crackdown has taken some of the shine out of
joining. He has also made the selection process more rigorous: What was
once a dull formality has become more [difficult and
selective](https://macropolo.org/analysis/members-only-recruitment-trends-in-the-chinese-communist-party/).
Applicants are subjected to an investigation and a battery of tests and
interviews, before years of waiting for full membership.

## A new, shinier hammer and sickle

The power and symbols of the Communist Party of China loom inside
companies and other organizations, and new, shinier hammer-and-sickle
signs have popped up at community centers in towns and cities across the
country.

Inside the party’s multiplicities, there are books and playgrounds for
children. But surveillance is a given, with officials neatly tracking
local happenings, reporting political troublemakers via databases.

Party committees, once ceremonial and dormant at private companies, have
gained new powers. Many top executives, like Jack Ma, co-founder of
Alibaba, are
[members](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/jack-ma-communist-party-alibaba.html).
Overseas, the party’s structure has helped tie together institutions
that run [influence
campaigns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/world/australia/australia-china.html)
to drum up support for China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet even as Mr. Xi has brought back many Mao trappings, like study
sessions and surveillance, people still join for the professional perks,
not the stultifying ideology. Tempted by the prospects of better jobs,
many students [sign up in
university](https://supchina.com/2019/07/31/communism-is-a-faith/), well
before they have a fully developed political outlook. Admittance is
often seen as a sign of excellence. In the southern tech hub of Shenzhen
in 2018, a sign encouraged entrepreneurs with a slogan that would boggle
the mind of the orthodox Marxist: “Follow our party, start your
business.”

## Barring millions may be impossible

With party members making up a bewilderingly huge portion of society in
China, some tell stories of the party losing the records of their
membership. Mr. Xi, in seeking to revive the party, has gone after
myriad members who have not paid dues for years.

If even Beijing is struggling to track the 92 million party members and
their families, it’s not clear that the United States could do a much
better job if it decides to carry out its travel ban. Experts cautioned
that the draft ban would be all but impossible to enforce on a wide
scale.

Even so, the United States could set up new mechanisms by which the
State Department and the Department of Homeland Security could more
closely track party membership. Several Chinese citizens who recently
traveled to the United States said they did not recall being asked about
party affiliation. Though some travel applications from the State
Department explicitly ask.

Any new rule would also be easier to apply to more prominent Chinese
political leaders and their families. Children of top leaders might
struggle to gain entry to the United States if the order is signed. Mr.
Xi’s daughter, Xi Mingze, for instance, attended Harvard under a
pseudonym several years ago.

Yet, if enforced strictly, the visa ban could make life difficult for
many others. Scholars and business people who regularly visit the United
States might have to either disclose their membership or risk running
afoul of laws that punish falsification of visa applications.

A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying,
called the possible move by the Trump administration “very pathetic.”

“The United States, as the most powerful country, what has it left? What
kind of impression does it want to leave the world? We hope that the
United States will stop doing such things that do not respect the basic
norms of international relations.”

The U.S. threat alone could keep many from coming to the States and do
more to push business conferences and other events that include
Americans and Chinese to other countries — like Canada.
