A hospital owner was arrested trying to flee in disguise after selling
certificates saying that migrant workers were coronavirus-free. Most
were never tested.

NEW DELHI — The Bangladeshi authorities have [arrested the owner of a
hospital](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2020/07/15/regent-hospital-chairman-shahed-arrested)
who they said had sold migrant workers thousands of certificates showing
a negative result on coronavirus tests, when in fact many tests were
never performed.

The authorities said they caught the hospital owner on Wednesday trying
to sneak across the border into India disguised as a woman. Police
officers said that when they arrested the owner — a man they identified
as Mohammad Shahed, with a long criminal record — he was wearing a black
burqa that covered him head to toe.

Over the past week and a half, Bangladeshi investigators pieced together
what happened: Mr. Shahed’s hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, had
been selling fake coronavirus certificates — thousands of them, at $59
apiece — indicating that a patient had tested negative, the Bangladeshi
authorities said.

  
There is a huge market for these certificates among migrant workers from
Bangladesh hungry to get back to work in Europe, doing jobs like
stocking grocery stores, bussing tables in restaurants or selling
bottled water on the streets. Many Bangladeshi workers have recently
flown to Italy, where they said that employers required such
certificates before allowing them to go back to work.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

As Bangladeshi police officers began to close in on Mr. Shahed, he
vanished, the authorities said. But after a nine-day search, they caught
him at the
border.

The widespread use of fake Covid-19 certificates has been “a huge blow
to the image of our country,” said Obaidul Quader, a minister in
Bangladesh’s government.

Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Millions of
Bangladeshis work overseas, sending billions of dollars back home,
keeping the economy afloat. During this pandemic, many workers who had
come back to Bangladesh for a short break found themselves cut off from
their jobs overseas and were eager to get back to work.

Mr. Quader, the minister, has said that different criminal syndicates
were operating across Bangladesh, luring migrant workers with virus-free
certificates and, in turn, endangering many lives. The Bangladeshi
authorities said that the Regent Hospital, run by Mr. Shahed, had issued
more than 10,000 certificates and that most of them were fake, backed by
no actual coronavirus test.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two other doctors have been arrested and accused of selling thousands of
fake virus certificates from their laboratory in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi
authorities said that special law enforcement agents were on the hunt
for others like them.

Bangladesh’s coronavirus situation is especially murky. The country,
home to more than 160 million people, has reported around 200,000 cases.
But with the virus sweeping through South Asia, and with testing
relatively low in Bangladesh, health experts believe the country has a
much higher infection rate than the official numbers indicate.

Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, has ordered the suspension of
all flights coming in from Bangladesh after at least 37 Bangladeshi
passengers arrived in Rome and tested positive for Covid-19, according
to Agence France-Presse. Last week, [Italy sent back 168
Bangladeshis](https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/2020/07/09/italy-denies-entry-to-151-bangladeshis)
who had arrived at airports in Rome and Milan, Italy’s health ministry
confirmed.

Even before the testing scam was exposed, Bangladeshi law enforcement
officials said that Mr. Shahed had been investigated in more than 30
other criminal cases connected to corruption, embezzlement and running
fraudulent companies. He has served two years in prison, the authorities
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“He is a known criminal,” said Faizul Islam, a member of Bangladesh’s
elite police unit, the Rapid Action Battalion. And, Mr. Islam added, “we
are acting against others.”

Bangladesh’s foreign ministry released a
[statement](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2020/07/16/bangladeshis-can-enter-italy-from-august-1)
on Thursday saying that “around 1,600 Bangladeshis who went to Italy
recently did not carry fake Covid-19 negative certificates.” But the
statement added, “some Bangladeshis who traveled to Italy in the recent
days did not follow the mandatory quarantine rule, and probably a few of
them might have spread the virus in the community.”

Fiorenza Aini, a spokeswoman in the press office of Italy’s justice
ministry, said that she was not aware of any current joint investigation
between Italy and Bangladesh.

Giuseppe Mazzara, a spokesman from the Lazio region, which includes
Rome, said that more than 6,000 coronavirus swab tests had been carried
out on people who traveled to Italy from Bangladesh in the month of
June, as well as people they came into contact with. So far, 191 had
tested positive, he said.

Taheer Hussain, a Bangladeshi migrant laborer who works in the kitchen
of a restaurant in Milan, said that Italian newspapers have been
continuously reporting on a surge of Covid-19 cases in the Bangladeshi
community, making ordinary workers suspect.

“People are looking at us with suspicious eyes,” Mr. Hussain said on
phone from Milan, “as if we all are infected by virus.”

Jeffrey Gettleman reported from New Delhi, and Sameer Yasir from
Srinagar, Kashmir. Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Bergamo,
