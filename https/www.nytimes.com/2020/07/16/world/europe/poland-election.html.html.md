# Opposition Challenges Poland’s Presidential Election Results

</div>

Critics say both the campaign and the vote were plagued with
irregularities and fraud. Amid a flurry of filings to the Supreme Court,
the main opposition party called for the election to be declared
invalid.

WARSAW — Supporters of the mayor of Warsaw, joined by scores of Polish
voters and rights groups, raced on Thursday to file legal challenges to
the validity of [Sunday’s presidential
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/europe/poland-president-elections-Andrzej-Duda.html),
which he narrowly lost to the incumbent, [President Andrzej
Duda.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/trump-andrzej-duda-poland.html)

The rush to file the complaints was the result of a new electoral code
passed by the government in May, cutting the time to file such
challenges from 14 days to three.

In lodging the official protests with the nation’s Supreme Court,
supporters of the mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, were not expecting to
overturn the result of the election, given the margin of defeat of
nearly half a million votes.

Their object was more to expose what they said was a pattern of
political interference that marred the [country’s closest
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/world/europe/poland-election-court-challenge.html)
since the [end of communist
rule](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/weekinreview/a-new-orbit-poland-s-break-leads-europe-and-communism-to-a-threshold.html)
in 1989 and to delay the certification of the vote long enough for it to
be declared invalid.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If nothing else, the challenges will pose a test for a court system that
has undergone [sweeping
changes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/world/europe/eu-poland-law.html)
since the governing Law and Justice party came to power five years ago.
The government has been accused of [undermining judicial
independence](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/europe/poland-supreme-court-protest.html)
and theoretically faces the prospect of becoming the first nation in the
European Union to lose its voting rights.

Joanna Lemanska, the head of the Extraordinary Control and Public
Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court, which will rule on the validity of
the election, was appointed by Mr. Duda. She suggested that she would
step aside but has yet to do so.

Even if she does recuse herself, critics believe the special chamber is
no longer an impartial arbiter of the law. But by overwhelming the
judges with complaints, they hope to make it impossible for the judges
to certify the results with the required 21 days.

Friday, where he will try to rally supporters against the government.

Borys Budka, the head of the main opposition party, Civic Platform, said
on Thursday that there was growing evidence that the election was deeply
flawed.

“These elections were not equal, didn’t meet democratic standards, they
were dishonest,” he said. “Because of that, we demand that they are
declared invalid.”

The most widespread irregularities were reported by the Polish diaspora,
with tens of thousands of votes from abroad potentially left uncounted.
But there were also reports of strange results in a number of nursing
homes, which reported Mr. Duda winning 100 percent of the vote, and
concerns about extra ballots sent to polling stations without proper
documentation.

Cezary Tomczyk, the head of the mayor’s campaign team, said they had
received reports from all around Poland of ballots that were not
properly stamped.

“The election result is not just a simple statement of who won but also
showing respect for every vote which was cast and or which couldn’t be
cast,” he said in an interview on [TVN24,](https://tvn24.pl/) a Polish
broadcaster. “We don’t know the scale of irregularities. This can only
be determined by the Supreme Court.”

His team set up a web page to help voters file protests, and he said
several thousand had already been
registered.

Some of the most troubling reports came from overseas, where a record
520,000 people had registered to vote before the election but only
415,951 ballots were counted. Complaints filed with the court charge
that the Polish Foreign Ministry worked to suppress the number of
voters.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

In Britain, over 30,000 ballots — 16.6 percent — went missing, according
to a calculation using public data by the Polish newspaper [Gazeta
Wyborcza](https://wyborcza.pl/0,0.html).

With the voting done exclusively by mail in Britain because of the
pandemic, Poland’s Foreign Ministry blamed the British Post Office and
voters themselves for the problems.

Mr. Trzaskowski won the vote there by a wide margin, securing 112,207
votes to Mr. Duda’s 32,067.

In Germany, 11,500 ballots did not make it to the consulates on time to
be counted, and similar problems were reported in other countries with
large Polish populations.

“We can expect a record number of election protests because these
elections — in my view — have been carried out in an unjust manner,”
said Michał Wawrykiewicz, a lawyer from the [Free Courts
Initiative](https://www.facebook.com/WolneSady/) and Committee for
Defense of Justice. “Never before have such situations taken place.
Never before have we been dealing with such a massive party propaganda
in the public media, which also influenced the result of the elections.”

Paulina Kieszkowska-Knapik, who joined her colleagues from the
Initiative at the Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon to file their
complaint, grew emotional over what she said was a deep injustice.

“The original sin,” she said, “was holding the election during a
pandemic.” That, she said, was itself a violation of the Constitution.

Adam Bielan, the head of the Law and Justice election team, said the
claims should be assessed by the Supreme Court, but that the review
would not change the outcome.

“The advantage of President Andrzej Duda over Rafał Trzaskowski is so
big that even if there had been inconsistencies, they could concern
voters of both candidates,” he was quoted as saying by Gazeta Prawna, a
legal newspaper. Other party officials did not return calls seeking
comment.

As the deadline to file protests approached, volunteers from “Polonia
Express,” a civic organization based in Britain, helped overseas voters
to register complaints on time.

Over 2,900 people joined a Facebook group called [“Electoral protests —
Polonia has the right to
vote.”](https://www.facebook.com/groups/271942133870461/) The
grass-roots initiative created forms for voters to fill out citing
abuses like the voting package arriving too late or not at all.

Separately, protests were filed over [the use of state television to
bolster the Duda
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/world/europe/poland-election-state-television-tvp.html).

The Supreme Court’s handling of the protests will be closely watched.

In the days between the first round of elections and the runoff contest
on Sunday, the European Court of Justice heard arguments in [one of
several
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/europe/poland-supreme-court-protest.html)
related to Poland’s changes in [the judicial
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/world/europe/poland-eu-parliament.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer),
which critics said were designed to quash the courts’ independence.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The whole judiciary system of the E.U. cannot work if courts are not
independent,” Michal Gajdus said in the European court, which is based
in Luxembourg.

Since 1989, judges in Poland had been selected by the National Council
of the Judiciary. But in 2017, Mr. Duda signed into law changes that
critics said would enable the president to appoint judges sympathetic to
the Law and Justice party.

The changes led the European Commission to trigger Article 7 of the
Treaty on the European Union, [the so-called nuclear
option](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/world/europe/eu-poland-law.html)
that could result in Poland losing its voting rights. But since that
would require a unanimous vote by all 27 E.U. member countries, it is
not likely to happen.
