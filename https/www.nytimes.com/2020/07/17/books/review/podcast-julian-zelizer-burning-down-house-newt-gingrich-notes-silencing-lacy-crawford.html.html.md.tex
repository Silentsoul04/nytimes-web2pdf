``We can date precisely the moment when our toxic political environment
was born,'' Julian E. Zelizer writes in his new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/books/review/burning-down-the-house-julian-zelizer.html}{``Burning
Down the House.''} That moment was in 1989, when Newt Gingrich
orchestrated the downfall of Jim Wright, then the speaker of the House.
On this week's podcast, Zelizer talks about why he decided to focus on
that moment.

Gingrich practiced ``a form of partisanship which is extraordinarily
aggressive,'' Zelizer says, ``which essentially says partisanship comes
above everything else. It's OK to tear down institutions, it's OK to
tear down your opponents, it's OK to break the norms and procedures we
depend on to govern, in pursuit of partisan power. And I was curious:
When did that all of a sudden become part of the leadership of the
Republican Party? And Gingrich spends 1987, 1988 and early '89 really
focused on Jim Wright. And he's successful.''

Lacy Crawford visits the podcast to discuss her new memoir,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/books/review/notes-on-a-silencing-lacy-crawford.html}{``Notes
on a Silencing,''} which recounts her time as a student 30 years ago at
the elite St. Paul's School, in Concord, N.H., the sexual assault she
suffered while there and the institution's effort to keep things quiet.

``It was clear to me that I was now prey,'' Crawford says of her time at
the school after the attack. ``I think one thing that encouraged me to
keep quiet is that people seemed to know that this had happened to me
but nobody was upset or thought there was anything wrong with it or
cared. So that seemed to further my sense that I had done something, I
was responsible for it and I would be the one who would be guilty for
it, rather than a victim who might be helped.''

Also on this week's episode, Elizabeth Harris has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/books/book-publishing-leadership.html}{news
from the publishing world}; and Lauren Christensen and Elisabeth Egan
talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
