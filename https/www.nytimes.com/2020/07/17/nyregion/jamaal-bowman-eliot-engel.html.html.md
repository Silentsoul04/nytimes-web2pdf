# Jamaal Bowman Proves Ocasio-Cortez Was No Fluke

</div>

Mr. Bowman beat Representative Eliot Engel, a 16-term incumbent, in a
race that pitted the Democratic Party’s progressive wing against the
establishment.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After a little-known candidate named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stunned a
powerful Queens congressman in a 2018 primary, Democratic Party leaders
were determined to never be surprised the same way again, vowing to
[protect
incumbents](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/435332-dems-seek-to-stifle-primary-challenges-to-incumbents)
and clashing with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other upstarts for pushing for
more progressive candidates.

On Friday, it became clear that those efforts had failed, as another
unlikely challenger, Jamaal Bowman, shocked the Democratic establishment
by defeating Representative Eliot L. Engel, overcoming the attempts of
old-guard party elite like Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to save a 16-term incumbent.

Mr. Bowman, 44, did so by running against Republicans in Washington and
the caution of centrist Democrats everywhere, capitalizing on
seven-figure spending by progressive groups to help him win the primary
in a district that straddles the Bronx and Westchester County.

“It means this country is ready, it’s yearning, it’s excited for
progressive change,” Mr. Bowman, a middle school principal from Yonkers,
said on Friday. “And it’s excited to finally hold elected officials
accountable.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Unlike Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s victory, Mr. Bowman’s looks more like an
indicator than an anomaly: He is one of three younger, insurgent
Democrats in New York who seem poised to tilt the state’s, and the
party’s, congressional delegation further to the left.

The other two, Mondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres, are candidates for
open seats in two neighboring districts. If elected, they would be the
first openly gay Black men in Congress. On Tuesday, Mr. Jones was
[declared the
winner](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/nyregion/mondaire-jones-house-primary.html)
of the primary in a district that covers parts of Westchester and
Rockland counties; Mr. Torres holds a healthy lead in his Bronx
district’s race.

Another veteran Democrat, Representative Carolyn Maloney, is fighting
for her political life in the district that includes Manhattan’s East
Side. Ms. Maloney holds a slim lead over another left-wing challenger,
Suraj Patel. The contest, like the one Mr. Bowman won and many others in
New York, has dragged on as election officials grapple with the deluge
of [absentee ballots that were cast by
mail](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-mail-ballots-voting.html)
because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The crush of absentee ballots — more than 50 percent of the total cast
in some races — [has overwhelmed election
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/nyregion/election-absentee-ballots-primary.html)
who are accustomed to handling far fewer than that. The disqualification
of thousands of ballots for small technical errors has also raised the
specter of widespread voter disenfranchisement, and concerns about how
prepared officials are for an even bigger turnout in November.

One candidate who will not have to worry about a November election is
Mr. Engel, who on Friday wished Mr. Bowman well, and said that he “never
for a minute thought of this as my seat.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s the people’s seat,” the congressman said in a statement.

With his loss, Mr. Engel became the fifth House incumbent and second
Democrat — Daniel Lipinski of Illinois [was the
other](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/marie-newman-dan-lipinski-illinois.html)
— to fall in this year’s primaries. The Republicans who lost were [Steve
King of
Iowa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/steve-king-iowa-primary.html),
[Denver Riggleman of
Virginia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/politics/denver-riggleman-virginia-primary-bob-good.html)
and [Scott Tipton of
Colorado](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/lauren-boebert-colorado.html).

As the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel had
practiced a form of old-school politics: rising slowly through the party
ranks; grabbing an aisle seat at the State of the Union so he could
glad-hand presidents as they passed; and boasting of the perks he
brought home to his district.

Entering his fourth decade in Washington, Mr. Engel, 73, seemed
consistently surprised by the level of opposition he faced in this
year’s race. He positioned himself as a dependable liberal voice in
Congress, [citing his own
support](https://engelforcongress.com/priorities/healthcare/) for
Medicare for All, action on [climate
change](https://engelforcongress.com/priorities/climate-change/) and
securing billions of dollars for housing programs.

“You know, I’m pretty progressive myself,” Mr. Engel said in an
interview just weeks before the June 23 primary.

But he also seemed badly out of step with the challenges of campaigning
amid the pandemic, a crisis that killed more than 4,500 people in the
Bronx and Westchester and caused typical retail politics — talking to
constituents on the street, attending town halls, handing out pamphlets
— to be replaced by Zoom calls and live-streamed debates.

“Engel wasn’t running against Bowman,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran
Democratic political consultant. “He was running against Been Around Too
Long. And Been Around Too Long won.”

Mr. Bowman was aided by an array of stars from the Democratic Party’s
left wing, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well
as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated
Joseph Crowley, the No. 4 House Democrat at the time, in 2018 (and
fought off her own primary challenger this year).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He also got ample financial help from liberal groups like the Working
Families Party and political action committees like the Justice
Democrats, which jointly spent more than $1 million to oust Mr. Engel.
Justice Democrats also recruited Mr. Bowman, after recommendations for
education activists.

A first-time candidate with a fiery anti-establishment message, Mr.
Bowman ran a campaign that built firmly on the pillars of current
progressive policy: reforming the criminal justice system, addressing
income inequality and embracing Medicare for All. He also preached about
the need for broader social changes such as what he called “righting the
wrongs of our country’s history toward a better future.”

Those issues took on new urgency as the United States reeled after the
killing in police custody of George Floyd in late May. The protests that
followed were broadly incorporated into, and invigorated, the Black
Lives Matter movement, and provided Mr. Bowman, who is Black and said he
had been[physically attacked by the
police](https://twitter.com/jamaalbowmanny/status/1267979573200932865)
as a child, with a powerful talking point.

The Black Lives Matter movement also served as a backdrop for a
cringe-inducing moment for Mr. Engel. At a social justice event in the
Bronx in early June, he [was caught on
microphone](https://twitter.com/emilyngo/status/1267873270218600448)
suggesting that he was only there because of his contested race.

“If I didn’t have a primary,” he said, “I wouldn’t care.”

Some analysts say Mr. Bowman’s win — and strong showings by Mr. Jones,
Mr. Torres, and Mr. Patel — reinforces the power of Black and other
minority voters in an [increasingly diverse
city](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/newyorkcitynewyork).

“The demographics have flipped,” said Peter Ragone, a former top aide to
Mayor Bill de Blasio and a regular adviser to Democratic politicians.
“And it’s accelerating with a velocity that no one could have
anticipated.”

Mr. Bowman, who [said his campaign had made a million
calls](https://twitter.com/JamaalBowmanNY/status/1275167126563762177) to
voters, also hammered Mr. Engel for not being in the district during the
crisis, suggesting that the incumbent spent much of his time at a home
he owns in suburban Maryland. Mr. Engel sought to refute the assertion,
saying he was a steady presence in the district, including in Riverdale,
where he lives.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the campaign’s closing weeks, as Mr. Bowman gained momentum and
prominent backers, prominent allies of Mr. Engel tried to salvage his
flagging campaign. Ms. Clinton [endorsed
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/politics/hillary-clinton-eliot-engel.html?searchResultPosition=1)
a week before the primary, followed in short order by Mr. Cuomo, a
third-term Democrat who said Mr. Engel deserved a vote because
[“seniority
matters.”](https://twitter.com/jessemckinley/status/1273706531868102658)

Those pleas followed endorsements from Ms. Pelosi, James E. Clyburn, the
House majority whip; and Hakeem **** Jeffries, the House Democratic
Caucus chairman. All were for naught, as Mr. Bowman won big in the Bronx
and bested Mr. Engel by a comfortable margin in Westchester.

In a statement released shortly after The Associated Press [declared him
the winner on
Frida](https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1284144985651249154)y, Mr.
Bowman referred to both his compelling personal story and the continuing
reckoning on race and policing in America.

“I’m a Black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing
project,” he said. “That story doesn’t usually end in Congress. But
today, that 11-year-old boy who was beaten by police is about to be your
next representative.”

Mr. Bowman is the prohibitive favorite to win in November given that
Democrats outnumber Republicans more than four-to-one in the district.
There is no Republican candidate, and only one other challenger, Patrick
McManus of the Conservative Party.

In an interview, Mr. Bowman promised to bring the same energy to
Washington that he brought to his campaign. He bashed President Trump as
a man who was proving himself to be “not only be a fascist, but a
racist,” and he pledged to fight for racial and economic justice, public
education, protecting the environment and more.

Despite his insurgent campaign, Mr. Bowman added that he was looking
forward to finding common ground in with his fellow House Democrats.

“I look forward to getting to Congress and working with my colleagues in
the Democratic Party, regardless of if they are quote-unquote
establishment,” he said, adding, “At this moment in our country’s
history, we have to work together.”
