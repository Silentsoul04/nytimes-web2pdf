In 2014, there were 211 homicides in the city of Baltimore. The
following year, there were 342, an astonishing increase of 62 percent.
The murder rate has barely budged since.

What happened? On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray sustained a fatal injury
in the back of a police van. Peaceful protests and then violence ensued.
A demoralized, under-resourced and sometimes corrupt police force
stopped doing its job properly. Nearly 30,000 residents have since fled
the city, whose
[population](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-population-estimates-20200326-nebck2k2anbwrcfsbknphsfgwi-story.html)
is now the lowest it’s been in a century.

The story of Baltimore’s unraveling was best told by the journalist Alec
MacGillis in [a searing
account](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/magazine/baltimore-tragedy-crime.html)
last year in The Times Magazine. It should be read again today, against
a backdrop of sudden surges in crime that are mainly devastating
minority communities. In New York, shootings during the first three
weeks in June [more than
doubled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/nyregion/nyc-shootings-surge.html?searchResultPosition=6)
over the same period last year. In Minneapolis, the homicide rate is
[double what it was this time last
year](https://www.startribune.com/as-gun-violence-continues-minneapolis-marchers-plead-for-peace/571713702/).

[Murder rates are similarly
rising](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/upshot/murders-rising-crime-coronavirus.html)
in some of America’s largest cities. Why is it all happening now?
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [had an
idea](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-ocasio-cortez-crime-nyc-shoplifting-bread-hungry-20200712-4ga4tm6vzze7ricmk2o2er4iwa-story.html):
Out-of-work parents, reeling from the recession, are shoplifting to feed
their kids. The New York congresswoman later defended her remarks by
insisting on the link between poverty and violent crime.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The theory, however, is doubtful — not to mention insulting to poor
people. As the social scientist James Q. Wilson pointed out, crime rose
dramatically in the 1960s, an era of steady employment and strong
economic growth. But it dropped across the board [during the Great
Recession](https://www.city-journal.org/html/crime-and-great-recession-13399.html)
(including in rates of property theft) when the unemployment rate
abruptly doubled. The causes of crime may be reasonably debated, but the
Jean Valjean theory belongs to the pages of Victor Hugo.

More instructive is the Baltimore example. “The national progressive
story of Baltimore during this era of criminal-justice reform has been
the story of the police excesses that led to Gray’s death and the
uprising, not the surge of violence that has overtaken the city ever
since,” MacGillis writes. “As a result, Baltimore has been left mostly
on its own to contend with what has been happening, which has amounted
to nothing less than a failure of order and governance the likes of
which few American cities have seen in years.”

The causes of this are several, racism among them. But MacGillis leaves
no doubt that the quality of policing is at the center. Until 2011,
Baltimore had become safer thanks to smart policing that targeted
criminal hot spots while making fewer arrests, albeit with a rise in
police-involved shootings.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That changed after a new commissioner arrived touting the virtues of
police restraint and improved community relations. In the protests and
violence that followed Gray’s death, the police were urged to hold back
until they came under attack: 130 officers were injured and the National
Guard was called in.

Toxic relations between the police and the city’s political leadership
made matters worse. A federal consent decree showed little understanding
of how effective policing works, further hamstringing law enforcement.
Expanded definitions of “use of force” made cops especially reluctant to
intervene in situations where there was a chance of a physical
altercation. The police force shrank. A new mayor touted the benefits of
after-school programs and social mediators to treat the root causes of
crime. But, as MacGillis acidly notes, the mayor’s plan “risked
overlooking the most immediate dilemma: People inclined toward
lawbreaking increasingly thought they could do so with impunity.”

The result is a comprehensive urban tragedy that can’t be blamed on long
lockdowns, hot summer weather, the coronavirus or the state of the
economy.

It’s also a cautionary tale. With all the usual good intentions, cities
across America risk emulating the same catastrophic mistakes made in
Baltimore. New York has disbanded its plainclothes crime-fighting unit
and may criminalize [the use of
holds](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-new-york-state-police-union-pull-out-of-city-reforms-20200715-uwcgecxovbfpxo3kxjej3otrby-story.html)
that, while prone to abuse, many cops consider essential for dealing
with violent suspects. Milwaukee is looking at a [10 percent cut in
police
funding](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/solutions/2020/07/14/mpd-chief-details-cuts-might-required-defund-police/5421894002/).
Minneapolis may disband its police force entirely, at least if its City
Council gets its way.

Idealists may hope these changes will eliminate police brutality as
communities find better ways to prevent crime than deterrence and force.
But on the hunch that human nature hasn’t changed, that isn’t going to
happen. Criminals, fearing less, will continue to prey on others.
Police, fearing more, will hold back from doing their jobs. Those with
means to leave their neighborhoods, will. Those without the means will
suffer.

For those under the age of, say, 35, who fail to appreciate what it
means to live in places where cops are more fearful than robbers,
there’s no need to look at the historical crime data. Just put
Baltimore on your itinerary to see where certain progressive fantasies
lead.
