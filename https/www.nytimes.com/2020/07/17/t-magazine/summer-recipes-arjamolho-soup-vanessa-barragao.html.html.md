# A Portuguese Artist’s Chilled Tomato Soup

</div>

For a simple lunch or dinner, Vanessa Barragão often makes arjamolho,
which is healthy, flavorful and perfect for summer.

*In “*[*One Good
Meal*](https://www.nytimes.com/column/one-good-meal?module=inline)*,” we
ask cooking-inclined creative people to share the story behind a
favorite dish they actually make and eat at home on a regular basis —
and not just when they’re trying to impress.*

When summer hits the Iberian Peninsula, everyone starts eating cold
tomato soup. Spaniards, of course, prepare gazpacho — the pinkish purée
that’s often served smooth enough to be drunk like a shot. Meanwhile,
across the border, the Portuguese make *arjamolho*, which is essentially
gazpacho’s fraternal twin. The key difference is the texture,
arjamolho’s being similar to a that of a chunky salsa; it’s a rustic
dish often served alongside other local staples such as grilled
sardines. But for the 28-year-old textile artist [Vanessa
Barragão](https://www.instagram.com/vanessabarragao_work/?hl=en), a
native of the seaside Algarve region of southern Portugal, arjamolho is
the main course. “It’s like a soup,” she says, “but at the same time a
salad.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the past four years, Barragão — a trained fashion designer who
realized, while receiving her master’s degree in fashion design at
Lisbon University, that she didn’t want to make garments after all — has
become one of her country’s most in-demand young artists. “I decided,
‘O.K., this is not for clothes but mostly to put on the wall,’” she
recalls. **** Her work since then has focused on tapestries and rugs,
which she makes using materials discarded from textile-industry
factories. For her tapestries, she works atop a jute canvas, applying
the threads via latch hook, needle felt, macramé and crochet until they
resemble the vibrant, varied landscape of a coral reef. Her [signature
piece](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/07/vanessa-barragao-world-tapestry/)thus
far is also a map of the world; it hangs, at more than six feet high and
nearly 20 feet long, in London’s Heathrow Airport and took Barragão five
months to complete. She’s currently finishing another large tapestry for
the 3HB Hotel, soon to open in the Portuguese city of Faro, just down
the shore from Albufeira, where she was born and recently returned. “I
had 10 years living out of here,” she says from her light-filled studio
near the coast. “I lived in Lisbon and then I decided to go to Porto and
then thought, ‘I’m done.’” Her reasons for going back were simple: Less
traffic. More time to work. Sunny weather. “I can walk everywhere,” she
says. “I have the beach. It’s a better life.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She also has her family; her mother and grandmothers have worked
alongside her on artworks, as has her younger sister Telma, who manages
Barragão’s studio. (Telma also grows tomatoes, which proves especially
useful during arjamolho season.) Barragão has realized that she doesn’t
need the big city in order to do her work — “Instagram is the main way
people find me,” she says — and with a schedule booked more than a year
in advance, she’s hardly hurting for clients. In a moment of worldwide
hunkering down, she has found what so many of us seek: success and
tranquillity, close to home.

### Vanessa’s Arjamolho

  - 5 ripe tomatoes, peeled and diced

  - 1 onion, minced

  - 2 garlic cloves, minced

  - Cucumber, minced (optional)

  - 3 tablespoons olive oil

  - 3 tablespoons vinegar

  - 1 tablespoon salt

  - Oregano (to taste)

  - 1 loaf stale sourdough bread, cut into one-inch cubes

1\. Place cut tomatoes in a large bowl, followed by the onion, garlic
and (if using) cucumber. Lightly mash together with your hand. Season
with oil, vinegar, oregano and salt. Taste and adjust if needed.

2\. Pour about four cups cold water into the bowl until it has the
consistency of a light soup. Stir. Taste again to check the seasoning.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

3\. Serve with the bread cubes, stirring them in like croutons. The goal
is to have a chunky texture without letting the bread get too soggy.
