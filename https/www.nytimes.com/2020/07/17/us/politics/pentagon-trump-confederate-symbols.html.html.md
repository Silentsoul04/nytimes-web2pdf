WASHINGTON — The Pentagon, without once mentioning the word
“Confederate,” announced a policy on Friday that essentially banned
displays of the Confederate flag on military installations around the
world.

In a carefully worded memo that Defense Department officials said they
hoped would avoid igniting another [defense of the flag from President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html),
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper issued guidance that listed the types of
flags that could be displayed on military installations — in barracks,
on cars and on signs.

According to the guidance, appropriate flags include those of American
states and territories, military services and other countries that are
allies of the United States. The guidance never specifically says that
Confederate flags are banned, but they do not fit in any of the approved
categories — and any such flags are prohibited.

“Problem solved — we hope,” one Defense Department official said on
Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger Mr.
Trump.

That senior military leaders are contorting themselves to such an extent
shows the gap that has developed between the White House and the
[movement for racial
justice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/unrest-protests-minneapolis-ending.html)
that has swept across the country since the killing of George Floyd
while in police custody in May in Minneapolis. As protests ignited,
senior Defense Department officials began grappling with the legacy of
racism in the military.

Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
last week at a House hearing that the Pentagon needed to take “a hard
look” at changing the names of Army bases honoring Confederate officers
who had fought against the Union during the Civil War, explicitly laying
out a course that [diverges from his commander in
chief](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/trump-rejects-renaming-military-bases.html).

Ten Army bases that [honor Confederate
generals](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/military-bases-confederates.html)
who fought to defend the slaveholding South have been the focus of a
growing movement for change. Mr. Trump, for his part, has sided with
those who want symbols of the Confederacy to remain in place.

“The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these
Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars,” [Mr. Trump
wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1270787974880526337)
in [a
string](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1270787975719391233)
of [Twitter
posts](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1270787978626052096).
“Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of
these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations. Our history as the
Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our
Military\!”

In the hearing, General Milley echoed senior military leaders who also
wanted to remove the [Confederate symbols and base
names](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/politics/congress-trump-confederate-base-names.html).
“There is no place in our armed forces for manifestations or symbols of
racism, bias or discrimination,” he said.

Mr. Esper’s memo on Friday did not address the issue of bases named
after Confederate generals; one senior military official said this week
that the Pentagon would wait until after the November election before
further raising the issue. But the memo goes after the many American
soldiers, Marines and airmen who display Confederate flags and other
symbols in their barracks and in parking lots on military installations.

“Flags are powerful symbols, particularly in the military community for
whom flags embody common mission, common histories, and the special,
timeless bond of warriors,” Mr. Esper said in his memo, before quoting
former Justice John Paul Stevens that the United States flag “is a
symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of
good will for other peoples who share our aspirations.”

Mr. Esper added in his memo that “the flags we fly must accord with the
military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our
people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols.”

A Defense Department official said that the new directive meant that
Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T.Q. flags would not be allowed, either.
The ban applies to public and shared spaces; troops and military
officials can display Confederate flags in areas deemed private and
personal, like lockers and single rooms.

“It’s absolutely outrageous that Defense Secretary Mark Esper would ban
the Pride flag — the very symbol of inclusion and diversity,” said
Jennifer Dane, the interim executive director of the advocacy group
Modern Military Association of America. “In what universe is it OK to
turn an opportunity to ban a racist symbol like the Confederate flag
into an opportunity to ban the symbol of diversity? This decision sends
an alarming message to L.G.B.T.Q. service members, their families, and
future recruits.”

Next week, senators will continue their own bipartisan push to strip
military bases of Confederate symbols, advancing an amendment to the
annual defense bill spearheaded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of
Massachusetts, that would require the Pentagon to eliminate [Confederate
names, monuments or
symbols](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/senate-confederate-names-military-bases.html)
from military assets in three years. The House is expected to press
ahead on a similar measure as lawmakers consider their version of the
military policy legislation.

Top Republican leaders in Congress have indicated they would broadly
support such measures. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky
and the majority leader, said this week in an interview [with The Wall
Street
Journal](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fmitch-mcconnell-signals-limits-on-race-related-policy-changes-11594733555)
that he would not block the effort to rename the bases despite Mr.
Trump’s pledge to veto the broader defense bill if Ms. Warren’s
amendment was included. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of
California and the House minority leader, told reporters last month that
he was “not opposed” to renaming the bases.

The Marine Corps this year banned the Confederate flag, and the Army was
moving to do the same until Mr. Esper intervened, saying that he wanted
to issue uniform guidance across all services.
