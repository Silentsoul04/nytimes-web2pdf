Americans are getting sick and dying while Trump plays a political game.

It never ceases to amaze me how more people aren't outraged, shocked and
disgusted by Donald Trump's cruelty and malfeasance.

Nearly 140,000 Americans are now dead because of the Covid-19 pandemic
and more than 3,000,000 have contracted the disease. Furthermore, our
outlook in this country is dire: Cases are surging and the number of
dead continues to climb.

This is still the first wave; a second wave could simply pile on and be
catastrophic.

And yet, Trump's cronies are attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's
leading infectious disease expert, demanding that all schools reopen in
the fall even as the virus rages, and continuing to tell the lie that
the reason we have more cases is because we have more tests.

Trump has so completely politicized the pandemic that people now
routinely refuse to wear masks in public places, insisting that being
compelled to wear them is an infringement on their rights.

Republican lawmakers for their part offer only the mildest
contradictions to Trump's deadly leadership, if they offer any at all.

Young people are now gathering at bars and parties, exhausted by
isolation, and no doubt having absorbed some of the myth that they are
invincible and the pandemic will be fleeting.

But instead of demonstrating leadership and doing the simplest and most
effective things he could do --- insisting on a nationwide mask order as
well as ramping up testing and contact tracing --- Trump appears to be
doing the opposite.

As
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rancor-between-scientists-and-trump-allies-threatens-pandemic-response-as-cases-surge/2020/07/17/d950e9b6-c777-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html}{The
Washington Post reported} last week:

``Trump in recent weeks has been committing less of his time and energy
to managing the pandemic, according to advisers, and has only
occasionally spoken in detail about the topic in his public appearances.
One of these advisers said the president is `not really working this
anymore. He doesn't want to be distracted by it. He's not calling and
asking about data. He's not worried about cases.' ''

Trump is simply putting his head in the sand and attempting to wish the
virus away, or lie it away, or let it take its victims until there are
no more to be had.

And he doesn't seem to want to know the true impact of the virus, nor
does he want the public to know.

As
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-virus-testing-relief-congress.html}{The
New York Times reported Saturday}, Senate Republicans had crafted a
proposal for yet another round of pandemic aid, this one including
billions for more testing and contact tracing, as well as money for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes
for Public Health, but the White House balked at these funding measures.

This obstruction will lead to more Americans dying.

Not to mention that the White House proposal for the new bill includes
``eliminating a proposed \$2 billion allocated to the Indian Health
Service, which is responsible for providing medical care to more than
half of the nation's tribal citizens and Alaska Natives, who have been
devastated by the pandemic and are particularly vulnerable to the
virus,'' according to The Times.

Add to this the fact that the administration has said that it might
continue to separate children from their parents and hold the parents in
detention facilities, even after a federal judge ruled that children
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-may-separate-families-after-federal-judge-orders-ice-to-free-migrant-children/2020/07/07/a1758ad6-c067-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html}{should
be released} because outbreaks of Covid-19 had rendered conditions at
the facilities unsafe and unconstitutional.

But the Trump administration has countered, ``The remedy for a
constitutional violation of conditions of confinement is to remedy the
violation, not to release petitioners.''

Add to that the fact that the Trump administration submitted a brief
last month asking the Supreme Court to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html}{overturn
the Affordable Care Act} in the middle of this pandemic, which would
eliminate coverage for as many as 23 million vulnerable Americans.

And add to that the fact that earlier this month,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who.html}{as
the Times reported}:

``The Trump administration has formally notified the United Nations that
the United States will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a
move that would cut off one of the largest sources of funding from the
premier global health organization in the middle of a pandemic.''

And recently, the Trump administration told states to stop sending their
coronavirus data directly to the C.D.C. and to send it instead to the
Department of Health and Human Services. As
\href{https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-coronavirus-data-has-already-disappeared-after-trump-administration-shifted-control-from-cdc-to-hhs.html}{CNBC
reported last week}, ``Previously public data has already disappeared
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website''
following the move.

So again I must ask, where is your outrage? How is this happening? How
is it being allowed to happen? Real people, Americans, are being allowed
to get sick and die while Trump plays a political game. How long can
this continue?
