# Building Accessibility Into America, Literally

</div>

Thirty years on, the Americans With Disabilities Act has reshaped the
way designers and the public have come to think about equity, civil
rights and American architecture. But it’s only a start.

The [Capitol Crawl](https://vimeo.com/328233990), it came to be called.
In March 1990, several dozen activists, cheered on by supporters, left
their canes and wheelchairs and pulled themselves up the steep stone
steps of the United States Capitol.

They wanted to pressure Congress into ratifying the Americans With
Disabilities Act. At the heart of what became a landmark of civil rights
legislation was the elemental role of architecture and design —
literally building accessibility into cities, products, public spaces
and workplaces, without which equity would remain just talk. Business
leaders predicted doomsday costs if the A.D.A. passed. The New York
Times even published an editorial titled “[Blank Check for the
Disabled?](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/06/opinion/blank-check-for-the-disabled.html)”

Thirty years on, the [A.D.A. has reshaped American
architecture](https://www.curbed.com/2015/7/23/9937976/how-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-transformed-architecture)
and the way designers and the public have come to think about civil
rights and the built world. We take for granted the ubiquity of entry
ramps, Braille signage, push buttons at front doors, lever handles in
lieu of doorknobs, widened public toilets, and warning tiles on street
corners and subway platforms. New courthouses, schools and museums no
longer default to a flight of stairs out front to express their elevated
ideals. The A.D.A. has baked a more egalitarian aesthetic of forms and
spaces into the civic DNA.

But there’s still a long way to go.

Last fall, the 22,000-square-foot, $41.5 million Hunters Point branch
library opened in Queens, N.Y. With a soaring interior of vertiginous
tiers and zigzagging stairs, the project’s architectural ambition was
obvious and outsized. [My
review](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/arts/design/hunters-point-community-library.html)
called it one of the most uplifting public buildings New York had
produced in years.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Disability rights advocates [saw
it](https://gothamist.com/news/new-41-million-hunters-point-library-has-one-major-flaw)
differently. All those stairs and tiers made certain areas inaccessible
to people in wheelchairs, they pointed out. How uplifting could a public
library be if some people — who expected, deserved and needed to use it
— felt unwelcome?

They were right. I was wrong. City officials insisted that the building
complied with A.D.A. regulations, in effect pointing the finger at the
law itself. As Karen Braitmayer, a Seattle architect and accessibility
consultant, put it, “that’s very definitely neither the spirit nor the
goal” of the legislation.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

The question I wish I’d asked at the time is one that architects and
designers might ask themselves more often today. Bess Williamson, author
of “Accessible America,”
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/besswww/status/1180128788065198080) it
when the library opened: “Who sets the priorities?”

A public building has everyone as its client, after all. Does its design
evolve out of a truly collaborative process that engages, upfront, the
diversity of users, including those with disabilities, who know best
what they need and want?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There is only so much that legislation can ever do,” Xian Horn, a
disability rights advocate, speaker and teacher in New York, born with
cerebral palsy, said recently. “The issue goes beyond civil rights. It’s
also about hospitality, patronage, a broader vision of accessibility,
and ultimately about doing what’s best for the bottom line.”

With [one in four American adults living with
disabilities](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html),
designing for accessibility and diversity should hardly be considered a
chore or just a compliance issue. It’s an opportunity, both economic and
creative, but one that requires a shift in mind-set. A ramp can be
something stuck onto a building to check off some legal requirement.

Or it can inspire the helical design of the [Ed Roberts
Campus](https://www.edrobertscampus.org/design/) in Berkeley, Calif., by
Leddy Maytum Stacy Architects. Or the serpentine pathways of the [Robert
W. Wilson
Overlook](http://www.weissmanfredi.com/project/brooklyn-botanic-garden-robert-w-wilson-overlook)
that Weiss/Manfredi, the New York architecture firm, recently devised to
wind through the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

“Architecture, from Vitruvius through Le Corbusier, has mirrored Western
culture, for whom the default user has always been the straight, white,
healthy, tall male,” said Joel Sanders, a New York-based architect and
Yale professor who runs MIXdesign, a think tank focused on inclusion.
“Everyone else, including those with mobility or cognitive issues,
tends to become an afterthought, a constraint to creativity, an added
cost.”

Nearly a century ago, tubular steel inspired both Marcel Breuer’s
[Wassily chair](https://www.knoll.com/product/wassily-chair) and new,
lighter wheelchairs. Chairs by Charles and Ray Eames, now classics of
midcentury modernism, evolved from a molded [plywood
splint](https://hyperallergic.com/328930/leg-splint-shaped-iconic-eames-chair/)
the couple devised for wounded soldiers during World War II.

“The most beautiful things we design,” as Mr. Sanders put it, “are often
the ones whose formal innovation is the product of a social or cultural
need.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A couple of years ago, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum
organized an eye-opening show called
[“Access+Ability”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/arts/design/cooper-hewitt-access-ability.html)
highlighting those sorts of designs. It included stylish puffer jackets
with Velcro seams and zip-on sleeves, sold by Target, the retail giant,
and a pair of FlyEase, designed by Nike in response to a letter from a
college-bound teenager with cerebral palsy who asked for sneakers that
didn’t look like medical equipment. The sneakers looked fantastic.

A term of art emerged during the 1960s and ’70s: universal design.

Today, “universal design” can sound a little reductive and creaky, with
its implication of a single norm, as if difference (physical, cognitive,
racial, gender, religious, age, you name it) boils down to a condition
that needs to be compensated for — as if it can’t be something worth
celebrating. There’s a
[debate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913847/#:~:text=an%20inspirational%20video%3F-,Sensationalizing%20Cochlear%20Implants,%E2%80%9Cmiracle%20cure%E2%80%9D%20for%20deafness.&text=When%20the%20implant%20is%20first,sudden%20flood%20of%20sensory%20inputs.)
today in the Deaf community about cochlear implants, for example,
because to some detractors the implants imply that deafness is a problem
to be solved, not a culture and condition with its own history and
pride.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_3_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“Noncompliant bodies don’t need to be ‘made whole’ by designers,” as Mr.
Sanders told me.

He prefers the term “inclusive design.”

Call it what you will, examples include text to speech and the homely
curb cut — that little ramp carved into street corners so wheelchair
users can navigate the six or so vertical inches between pavement and
sidewalk. Mandated by the A.D.A., during the last three decades the curb
cut has made daily life easier for countless shoppers with grocery
carts, teenagers on skateboards, travelers pulling wheeled bags, parents
with strollers and just about everybody else.

“As a person with a mobility disability who grew into adulthood prior to
the passage of the A.D.A.,” recalled Ms. Braitmayer, the architect and
consultant, “I spent my early years in a community without curb cuts on
the street corners, without accessible parking at the neighborhood
retail shopping centers, without wheelchair spaces in the movie
theaters. I appreciate every time I can now go to a movie and find a
place to sit without being told that if I sit in the aisle in my
wheelchair, I would be a fire hazard.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But for architects and designers, abiding by the letter of the A.D.A.
isn’t the same as internalizing its civil rights goals, she said. That
is what still remains for architecture — “to lift itself into the next
realm,” was Ms. Braitmayer’s phrase.

“People don’t only buy Apple products because they’re functional,” added
Ms. Horn, the advocate and teacher. “If you make a phone or a building
or a park or a hotel beautiful and also accessible, it makes life better
for everyone.”
