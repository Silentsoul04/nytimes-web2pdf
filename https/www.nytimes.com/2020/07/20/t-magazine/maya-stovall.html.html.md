**Name:** Maya Stovall

**Age:** 37

**Based in:** Los Angeles

**Originally from:** Detroit

**When and where did you make this work?** “1526 (NASDAQ: FAANG)” began
as a research project in 2018 and continues as an ongoing project. Over
the course of a year, I gathered United States historical archives and
volumes. From tens of thousands of pages of research, I developed a
series of dates, from 1526 to 2019, that reflect critical moments in
U.S. history. I am obsessed with words, numbers and time. I thought that
neon, which I’ve considered working with for a long time, would be a way
to emblazon these dates and facts into collective memory. The research
for this work was done in Pomona, Calif., where I’m an assistant
professor at California Polytechnic State University, and also in San
Francisco, where I spent quite a lot of time in 2019. The neons are
these tiny little dates, in buttercream with a soft glow. Postcards
accompany the neons. They summarize the actions and events associated
with each date.

**Can you describe what’s going on in the work?** The work links the
past to the present and attempts to unhinge our minds from the mythology
we’ve been fed. And neon is fun. I like data and information, and that
is happening, too. I don’t have an interest in emotions or feelings. I
like facts. These works reflect that. For instance, in xxxx year,
something monumental happened. We look at screens constantly, and
increasingly our economy is dominated by technology stocks — of course
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google are among the biggest. From
where did this outrageous accumulation of capital emerge? Well,
certainly from the ongoing exploitation of people, markets, circuits and
flows. The works move through significant but quite varied moments in
U.S. history, ranging from petitions to end human trafficking and
genocide (“1661”), to a woman human-trafficking and genocide survivor
writing a letter to an abolitionist journal scaffolding feminist theory
(“1827”), to [Adrian
Piper](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/magazine/adrian-pipers-self-imposed-exile-from-america-and-from-race-itself.html)
establishing conceptual art (“1968”), to the [Detroit mass water
shut-off
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/us/protesters-picket-detroit-over-move-to-shut-off-water.html),
which continues to the present day (“2014”*)* and more. There are 44
dates in the first iteration of the
series.

**What inspired you to make this work?** Imagine if Germany, for
instance, taught its schoolchildren that Nazism was an economic system
that, over time, was abolished, and that Nazism truly had ideals of hope
and freedom that were simply never realized. Imagine if Germany called
Nazism’s victims slaves rather than survivors. Here in the United
States, unfortunately, our collective brains have been glued to such
hegemony that we actually teach schoolchildren such lies — for instance,
the lie that we have a country built on democracy, freedom and
liberalism. This great big lie that must be upended if we are ever to
move forward. There is no democracy, freedom or liberalism in the United
States. The way Americans have been taught to think about United States
history is, in a word, criminal.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Today, Americans are victims and survivors of legalized human
trafficking, genocide, rape, murderous policing, exclusion from credit
markets, job markets, education, unjust incarceration policies and more,
spanning every aspect of existence — from philosophy to city life. There
has yet to be a reckoning where the U.S. government, history books,
popular narratives, etc., reflect reality. The people [protesting in the
streets](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html)
across the country and the world now, as a global pandemic intersects
with police brutality, know these realities, on some level, and they are
exasperated. The philosophy, the history writing, the history-telling,
the language, the marketing — everything absolutely must change about
how we think if this country is to right its murderous wrongs. There is
nothing emotional or up for debate here. These are facts that require
much organization, documentation, discussion, correction, **** and this
series is interested in that.

**What’s the work of art in any medium that changed your life?** There
are many works with which I have an intense relationship, but the first
that came to mind at this question is the work I’ll share. I am thinking
about conceptual artist [DeShawn Dumas](http://www.deshawndumas.com/)’s
ongoing series of Glock-shot glass paintings called “Ballistic
Testimonies.” The series is this feedback loop or networked array of
risk, calculation and violence. The artist shoots his work with a Glock
firearm through these laminated glass Rothko-like monochromes that he
first paints. The works are monuments to victims of police murder, one
of whom is the artist’s brother Derrick Conner. When I saw the work for
the first time, I was devastated and moved by it. I am attracted to
quite intellectual and conceptual, aesthetically cold, almost
heartless-looking work. For me, think: [Larry
Bell](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/t-magazine/mary-heilmann-larry-bell-conversation.html),
[Mary
Corse](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/artifacts-mary-corse/),
[Eva
Hesse](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/just-looking-eva-hesse/),
[Glenn
Ligon](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/t-magazine/glenn-ligon-adrian-piper-art.html).
Dumas’s works come off like this, and yet the series has an erotic,
painterly quality and crystallizes the construction of the simultaneous
logic and illogic of violence that courses through policing, through
murder and through walking down the street. This work changed my life in
some of the most profound ways you could
imagine.
