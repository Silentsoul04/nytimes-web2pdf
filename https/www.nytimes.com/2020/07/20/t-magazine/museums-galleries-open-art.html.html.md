# In a Time of Crisis, Is Art Essential?

</div>

T’s 2020 summer art issue coincides with a breakdown of the status quo,
both in the art world and the real one. Not for nothing, we’ve titled it
“True Believers.”

For the last two summers, T has published an [online art
issue](https://www.nytimes.com/issue/t-magazine/2018/06/08/ts-art-issue)
in which we celebrate artistic freedom in the face of overwhelming odds.
Traditionally, these odds have revolved around an international supply
chain largely fueled by greed: The small but powerful ecosystem that we
refer to as “the art world” has always exploited artists to protect its
profit margins.

It goes without saying that this year, the stakes are different. This
has been a summer of a [global
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus), of [rent
strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/nyregion/rent-strike-coronavirus.html)
and
[protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/teens-protest-black-lives-matter.html)
against [state-sanctioned murder and
inequality](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles),
of autocratic [threats of
violence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/esper-milley-trump-protest.html)
from elected officials. All of us have been made to witness and reckon
with the failure of our established systems of
power.

In the coming months, museums and galleries will try to find ways of
safely keeping their doors open to the public, but as this process
begins, I can’t help but think of the footage of European soccer teams
playing in empty arenas to a backing track of audience applause: It
*looks* familiar, but something is off. The old way of life isn’t so
distant, but it no longer suits our current reality. Up until March,
when the pandemic shut down much of the world, I had a certain monthly
ritual that I valued a great deal but never thought much about because I
took for granted that I would always be able to do it: On some weekday
afternoon, when I would look across the street from my desk in the Times
building to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and feel particularly
hopeless about my ability to finish whatever work I had to finish that
day, I’d take an hour or so to walk around the galleries in Chelsea, or
hop on the E train to the [Museum of Modern
Art](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/museum-of-modern-art) to
see how fast I could get through a show amid the throng of tourists.
Doing this would reset my mood like a clock. It was so easy to be
reminded how lucky I was to live in a place where great art was
constantly available to me, and to have a profession in which my job was
mainly to look at it. A lot worse has been lost in the past few months
than this ritual, but I wasn’t aware how much I missed it until I wrote
down its memory. Even having a desk in an office now feels foreign to
me.

But as the foundations of our very existence have gone awry, the basic
premise of T’s art issue still stands. Which is to say: Artists have
kept working, even through the days when it feels like the world might
end, or days when it feels as if it already has. I can’t say this is as
much a surprise as it is an affirmation of the notion that art is
essential, if you’ll allow me the use of a word that has taken on a
greater meaning as of late. We’ve called this issue “[True
Believers](https://www.nytimes.com/issue/t-magazine/2020/07/02/true-believers-art-issue),”
our initial reasoning being that a number of the pieces we’re publishing
this week are about artists who have undertaken nearly impossible tasks
and persisted, through sheer willpower — from resurrecting the dead (in
the case of the French sculptor Marguerite Humeau) to trying to map out
nothing less than space and time themselves (in the way of the land
artist Charles Ross, who has spent nearly 50 years constructing a
naked-eye observatory in the New Mexico
desert).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

But in retrospect, “True Believers” feels less to me like a theme than a
modus operandi: All art is an act of faith — a faith that life itself,
with all its tragedies and flaws, can be improved by creating something
new and putting it out into the world. I’m not sure we’ll ever go back
to what life was just a few months ago, but I do have faith that artists
will remain a crucial part of whatever new one we come up
with.
