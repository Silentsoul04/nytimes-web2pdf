Creamy as silk, costlier by weight than gold, the color of fine old
ivory, a Montecristi superfino Panama hat is as much a work of art as it
is of fashion. The finest specimens have more than 4,000 weaves per
square inch, a weave so fine it takes a jeweler’s loupe to count the
rows. And every single one of those weaves is done by hand. No loom is
used — only dexterous fingers, sharp eyes and Zen-like concentration.

“You cannot allow your mind to wander even for a second,” says Simón
Espinal, a modest, soft-spoken man who is regarded by his peers as the
greatest living weaver of Panama hats, possibly the greatest ever. “When
you are weaving it is just you and the
straw.”

I became interested in the hats about 15 years ago, quite by accident,
when I read about straw hats that could cost thousands of dollars.
Intrigued, I began researching the hats, made a trip to Ecuador — where
all true Panama hats are woven — and discovered this curious, and gently
anachronistic world of the hat weavers of
Montecristi.

Although the weaver is the star of the show, the making of a Montecristi
is a collaborative art. After the weaver has finished his or her part,
the raw hat body passes through the hands of a tag-team of specialist
artisans whose titles — the rematador, the cortador, the apaleador and
the planchador — lend the making of a Montecristi Panama hat something
of the hot-blooded formality of the bullring. (The term rematador is
drawn directly from bullfighting: There, it is the finisher, one who
“performs some act that will provide an emotional or artistic climax,”
as Hemingway describes it in “Death in the
Afternoon.”)

In Montecristi, the rematador is the specialist weaver who performs the
complicated back weave to seal the brim, thereby bringing to an artistic
close the weaving phase of the hat’s creation. After that, the excess
straw is trimmed away by the cortador, who then gives the hat the
closest of shaves with a razor blade to trim away any burrs in the
straw.

“Sometimes, when I am cortador-ing, I come across a straw that has
become discolored or has not been woven correctly,” says Gabriel Lucas,
one of Montecristi’s top finishing artisans, as he performs a delicate
operation on a fine hat that will be worth thousands when it is
finished. “We call these hijos perdidos — the lost straws. I have to
carefully cut them out and weave in a new straw to replace
it.”

hat into its recognizable styles: fedora, optimo,

Panama hats are uniquely Ecuadorean, despite their curious misnomer. The
term “Panama hat” has been in use since at least the 1830s, and came
about because the hats were often sold in trading posts on the Isthmus
of Panama, which was a shipping crossroads long before the canal was
built. The name was popularized during the California gold rush, when
tens of thousands of prospectors passed through Panama on their way to
the diggings, many of them picking up a hat along the
way.

Panama hats became even more firmly fixed in the popular imagination
after the Paris Exposition in 1855, when a Frenchman who had been living
in Panama presented Napoleon III with a finely woven hat. His Highness
loved the hat and wore it everywhere.

Then, as now, celebrities set the tone in the fashion stakes, and nobody
was more A-list than the Emperor of France. Silky fine Panama hats for
spring and summer became de rigueur among the rich and famous. King
Edward VII is said to have instructed his hatter to spare no expense but
get him the finest Panama available. Fabulous sums were paid by him and
others for the best hats. A [Talk of The Town
article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1930/07/05/thousand-dollar-hats)
in The New Yorker from July 1930 describes a $1,000 Panama — around
$16,000 today — on display at Dobbs hat store in the city. [Florenz
Ziegfeld](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/florenz-ziegfeld/) was
discussed as a likely
buyer.

These days, the overwhelming majority of Panama hats are woven in
Cuenca, an attractive town in the Andes whose residents, prompted by the
local government, turned to hat weaving in the mid 1800s, once Panama
hats became popular. These are the hats you find in department stores
and most hat shops. Nice hats, they are woven in a light, simple “brisa”
weave, which can be turned out swiftly and in commercial quantities.

Montecristi, on the other hand, is the seat of the art. Locals have been
weaving fine hats out of the fibers of the [toquilla
palm](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/09/02/101066082.html?pageNumber=24)
for centuries. Here, hat making has remained a cottage industry, the
weavers gathering and preparing their own straw as they have for
generations, weaving their hats in their artistic and time-consuming
“liso” weave, a pretty herringbone style.

Their output is necessarily small, and that of the elite weavers in Pile
smaller still. In a good year, Simón Espinal might make three hats.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lately the government has been urging the weavers in Pile to become more
commercial, to abandon the old ways, not to weave such fine hats — but
they’ve refused. “This,” says Simón Espinal, “is a gift from God.”
