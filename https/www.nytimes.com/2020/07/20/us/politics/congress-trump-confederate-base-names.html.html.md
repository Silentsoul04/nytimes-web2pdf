# Defying Trump, Lawmakers Move to Strip Military Bases of Confederate Names

</div>

The push by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress sets up an
election-year veto fight with the president, and shows how he has
isolated himself even from members of his own party on the issue.

WASHINGTON — Representative Don Bacon, a Republican, had a blunt message
for President Trump when a White House aide called him personally early
this month and asked that he abandon legislation to strip the names of
Confederate leaders from military bases.

“You’re wrong — you need to change,” Mr. Bacon, a second-term Nebraskan
and former Air Force brigadier general, told the official, he said in an
interview. “We’re the party of Lincoln, the party of emancipation; we’re
not the party of Jim Crow. We should be on the right side of this
issue.”

The sharp exchange between the White House aide and Mr. Bacon, who is
facing an unexpectedly difficult re-election race, reflects just how
much Mr. Trump has isolated himself — even from members of his own party
who rarely break with him — on an issue that has come to the forefront
of the political debate amid a national outcry for racial justice.

It will take center stage on Capitol Hill this week, when the House and
Senate each consider sweeping annual military bills that contain
bipartisan measures mandating that the Pentagon remove Confederate names
from military assets. Mr. Trump, who has sought to stoke cultural and
political divisions over symbols of the Confederacy, has said he would
veto any bill with such a requirement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The disconnect has raised the prospect of a rare, election-year clash
between congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump on the military bill,
the measure that authorizes pay raises for American troops and is
regarded as must-pass legislation. Despite the president’s unapologetic
stance, most Republicans have been unwilling to defend symbols of the
Confederacy, and some have warned the president not to force the first
veto override of his presidency.

The House voted on Monday to begin consideration of the bill and is
expected to pass it this week, as the Senate debates a similar measure
slated to be approved next week.

Mr. Trump, who has positioned himself against a growing movement for
racial justice, renewed his veto threat in an interview aired Sunday.
Mr. Trump told Fox News’s Chris Wallace that he rejected the counsel of
military leaders like Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, [who has called for taking “a hard
look”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/politics/milley-trump-confederate-base-names.html)
at changing the names of the bases.

“We won two world wars, two world wars, beautiful world wars that were
vicious and horrible, and we won them out of Fort Bragg,” Mr. Trump
said. “We won them out of all of these forts, and now they want to throw
those names away.”

On Monday, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the Republican chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, batted away the prospect of a
veto showdown.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He’s threatened several times to do that, but he also knows that’s the
most important bill of the year,” Mr. Inhofe said in a brief interview.

The measures cruising through Congress with bipartisan support,
including Mr. Bacon’s proposal and a separate one in the Senate, led by
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, go much further
than an [order issued by the Pentagon late last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/politics/pentagon-trump-confederate-symbols.html)
that effectively banned displays of the Confederate flag on military
installations around the world. Ms. Warren’s amendment would require the
Pentagon to strip all military assets of names and symbols of the
Confederacy within three years. Another measure in [House Democrats’
military spending
bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/appropriations-committee-releases-fiscal-year-2021-defense-funding-bill)
would provide the Army with $1 million to rename the installations and
other assets.

Few Republicans in Congress have rallied to Mr. Trump’s side on the
issue. Senate Republican leaders have moved to avoid a contentious
showdown on the issue, ducking a vote on a proposal by Senator Josh
Hawley, Republican of Missouri, to remove Ms. Warren’s requirement and
replace it with a weaker measure that would instruct the Pentagon to
study the issue.

“This cancel movement seeks to divide us, not unite; to erase our
history, rather than to reckon with it,” Mr. Hawley said in a speech on
the Senate floor, accusing proponents of Ms. Warren’s measure of being
driven by “a kind of woke fundamentalism.”

Taking such a vote on the Senate floor would have squeezed several
Republicans in tight re-election battles. And Republican leaders in both
chambers on Capitol Hill have been largely supportive of the effort to
rename the bases.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, [told The Wall
Street Journal last
week](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mitch-mcconnell-signals-limits-on-race-related-policy-changes-11594733555)
that he would not block the effort to rename the bases, and in an
[interview with a Louisville radio
station](https://www.wdrb.com/news/one-on-one-sen-mitch-mcconnell-backs-rebranding-military-bases-named-for-confederate-leaders/article_78838c9c-bfd4-11ea-babc-3b697035a8fa.html),
he said he didn’t “have any problem” with renaming the bases for “people
who didn’t rebel against the country.” He has [urged the president not
to veto the
bill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/505475-mcconnell-trump-shouldnt-veto-defense-bill-over-renaming-confederate-bases).

“The issue of Army bases being named after Confederate generals is a
legitimate concern in the times in which we live,” said Senator Lindsey
Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “I’m OK with a process that the
Senate came up with. And there’s a lot of good things in this bill.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House
Armed Services Committee, opposed the measure’s deadlines, saying that
it did not give the Pentagon enough time to facilitate community
discussion around the change and that the end goal should be “increased
understanding and changed hearts.”

“My personal opinion is that the names of some, if not all, of these
installations should be changed,” Mr. Thornberry said.
