## E.U. agrees on a groundbreaking stimulus package

After days of intense talks in Brussels, European Union leaders on
Tuesday stepped up to confront one of the gravest challenges in the
bloc’s history, [agreeing on a 750 billion euro spending
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/world/europe/eu-stimulus-coronavirus.html)
to rescue their economies from the ravages of the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The deal, spearheaded by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and
President Emmanuel Macron of France, was notable for its firsts.
European countries will raise large sums by selling bonds collectively,
not individually. And much of the money will go to hard-hit member
nations as grants, not loans.

Leaders agreed that the scale of the crisis required groundbreaking
measures to ensure the E.U.’s legitimacy, stability and prosperity. But
the negotiations were notable for their rancor, and it was clear that
the pooling of resources and sovereignty had come at a cost. At one
point, Mr. Macron slapped the table and yelled at Chancellor Sebastian
Kurz of Austria for impeding the deal, and for leaving the room to take
a call.

**Details:** Unusually for a German leader, Ms. Merkel sided with the
bloc’s southern countries — and did battle with the nations she once
championed, the northern members less affected by the virus, which have
been wary of the vast sums being discussed.

**Misplaced confidence:** [Our reporters explored how Europe became an
epicenter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/world/europe/coronavirus-mistakes-france-uk-italy.html)
of the pandemic. Experts say European leaders became complacent after
containing the 2009 swine flu, scaling back stockpiles of gear and
equipment and shifting to “just in time” contracts — overlooking the
possibility that a pandemic could disrupt global supply chains.

## U.K. suspends its extradition treaty with Hong Kong

In response to the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong,
Britain on Monday [suspended its extradition treaty with the
territory](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/world/extradition-treaty-hong-kong.html).

The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, cited concerns that under the
sweeping new law, anyone extradited to Hong Kong from Britain — which
ruled the territory as a colony until 1997 — could easily be sent to
mainland China. Australia and Canada suspended their own extradition
treaties with Hong Kong earlier this month.

China is expected to be high on the agenda this week when Prime Minister
Boris Johnson meets with Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, who
has called on allies to draw a firm line with Beijing on a number of
fronts. Last week, Britain [barred equipment from the Chinese tech giant
Huawei](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html?searchResultPosition=1)
from its 5G network.

**Response:** A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Wang Wenbin,
urged Britain to “stop going further down the wrong
path.”

## For some, Google’s virus app code can track location

When Google and Apple announced plans in April for free software to help
alert people to possible coronavirus exposure, [the companies said it
would not track users’
locations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/technology/google-covid-tracker-app.html).

Since then, Germany, Switzerland and other countries have used the code
to develop national apps that have been downloaded more than 20 million
times. But users of the Android operating system must first turn on the
device’s location setting, which means Google can still find out where
they are.

Some government agencies that use the software seemed surprised that
Google could detect Android users’ locations. Others said they had
unsuccessfully pushed the company to make a change.

**What this mean:** Many Android users in Europe feel misled by their
governments, and privacy and security experts say they are troubled that
the issue might deter some people from using public health apps.

**Response:** A Google spokesman said the virus alert apps that use the
company’s software did not use device location. The apps use Bluetooth
scanning signals to detect smartphones that come into close contact with
one another — without needing to know the devices’ locations. Once
Android users turn on the location setting, however, Google can
determine exactly where they
are.

Our Paris bureau chief described it as “a once-thronged wonder of Paris
more visited than the Eiffel Tower.”

“Equality, for everybody” was how one shopper described it. “This is a

### Here’s what else is happening

**Climate change:** Polar bears [could be close to extinction by the end
of the
century](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/climate/polar-bear-extinction.html)
due to shrinking Arctic sea ice if global warming continues unabated,
according to a new study.

**U.S. presidential election:** Former Vice President Joe Biden led
President Trump by 15 percentage points in the latest poll by ABC News
and The Washington Post, and he has held a nearly [double-digit
advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/upshot/biden-trump-poll.html)
in an average of surveys for more than a month. Such big leads tend to
erode — will this one be
different?

### And now for the Back Story on …

## Music and activism

Meshell Ndegeocello, Brandi Carlile and Hayley Kiyoko, artists of
varying backgrounds, found shared experiences in a conversation about
[music, activism and queer
identity](https://timesevents.nytimes.com/musicandqueering), part of The
Times’s “Live at Home” series. Here’s an excerpt from [their
exchange](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/insider/music-queer-activism.html).

**When did activism start for each of you? When did you become
politically awakened?**

**Hayley Kiyoko:** I was on my own journey. For me, it’s been out of
necessity. I think that for most people who have lived their lives being
activists, it is through necessity. When I released my music video for
[“Girls Like Girls,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0MT8SwNa_U)
that was out of necessity for myself.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Meshell Ndegeocello:** In my youth, I wasn’t very aware of it. I was
very singularly focused on making music. Music is something where I feel
genderless and raceless. But being a person of color, I think every day
of my existence is pretty much making a statement, and I’ve only come to
understand that as I now am
52.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**How do you integrate queerness into your music?**

**Brandi Carlile:** Music is such an expression that your sexuality
comes out. It just does. Whether you’re writing about it or not. The
people that need to know, know. I write songs with guys and sometimes
they’ll have written a song or a narrative and they’re singing about a
woman, but the perspective is so male I can’t put that on me. “I don’t
feel that way, I feel really female about this,” and that’s just where I
am with my gender identity so I kind of need to change this — keep the
pronoun where it is, but I need it to be me.

**So how do you balance activism and being out with threats of violence
that still exist?**

**Meshell:** I have to say your safety is much more important, your
life. I’m a very passive, nonviolent person, and I hope you can find the
peace within yourself, so perhaps do your activism through other
channels that don’t jeopardize your safety. That’s the most important
thing.

**Hayley:** Survival is key and without you, there is no change.
