Some presidents, when they get into trouble before an election, try to
“wag the dog” by starting a war abroad. Donald Trump seems ready to
wag the dog by starting a war at home. Be afraid — he just might get his
wish.

How did we get here? Well, when historians summarize the Trump team’s
approach to dealing with the coronavirus, it will take only a few
paragraphs:

“They talked as if they were locking down like China. They acted as if
they were going for herd immunity like Sweden. They prepared for
neither. And they claimed to be superior to both. In the end, they got
the worst of all worlds — uncontrolled viral spread and an unemployment
catastrophe.

“And then the story turned really dark.

“As the virus spread, and businesses had to shut down again and schools
and universities were paralyzed as to whether to open or stay closed in
the fall, Trump’s poll numbers nose-dived. Joe Biden opened up a
15-point lead in a national head-to-head survey.

“So, in a desperate effort to salvage his campaign, Trump turned to the
Middle East Dictator’s Official Handbook and found just what he was
looking for, the chapter titled, ‘What to Do When Your People Turn
Against You?’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Answer: Turn them against each other and then present yourself as the
only source of law and order.”

America blessedly is not Syria, yet, but Trump is adopting the same
broad approach that Bashar al-Assad did back in 2011, when peaceful
protests broke out in the southern Syrian town of Dara’a, calling for
democratic reforms; the protests then spread throughout the country.

Had al-Assad responded with even the mildest offer of more participatory
politics, he would have been hailed as a savior by a majority of
Syrians. One of their main chants during the demonstrations was,
“Silmiya, silmiya” (“Peaceful, peaceful”).

But al-Assad did not want to share power, and so he made sure that the
protests were not peaceful. He had his soldiers open fire on and arrest
nonviolent demonstrators, many of them Sunni Muslims. Over time, the
peaceful, secular elements of the Syrian democracy movement were
sidelined, as hardened Islamists began to spearhead the fight against
al-Assad. In the process, the uprising was transformed into a naked,
rule-or-die sectarian civil war between al-Assad’s Alawite Shiite forces
and various Sunni jihadist groups.

Al-Assad got exactly what he wanted — not a war between his dictatorship
and his people peacefully asking to have their voices heard, but a war
with Islamic radicals in which he could play the law-and-order
president, backed by Russia and Iran. In the end, his country was
destroyed and hundreds of thousands of Syrians were killed or forced to
flee. But al-Assad stayed in power. Today, he’s the top dog on a pile of
rubble.

I have zero tolerance for any American protesters who resort to violence
in any U.S. city, because it damages homes and businesses already
hammered by the coronavirus — many of them minority-owned — and because
violence will only turn off and repel the majority needed to drive
change.

But when I heard Trump suggest, as he did in the Oval Office on Monday,
that he was going to send federal forces into U.S. cities, where the
local mayors have not invited him, the first word that popped into my
head was “Syria.”

Listen to [how Trump put
it](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-phase-four-negotiations/):
“I’m going to do something — that, I can tell you. Because we’re not
going to let New York and Chicago and Philadelphia and Detroit and
Baltimore and all of these — Oakland is a mess. We’re not going to let
this happen in our country.”

These cities, Trump stressed, are “all run by very liberal Democrats.
All run, really, by radical left. If Biden got in, that would be true
for the country. The whole country would go to hell. And we’re not going
to let it go to hell.”

This is coming so straight from the Middle East Dictator’s Handbook,
it’s chilling. In Syria, al-Assad used plainclothes, pro-regime thugs,
known as the shabiha (“the apparitions”) to make protesters disappear.
In Portland, Ore., we saw militarized federal forces wearing battle
fatigues, but no identifiable markings, arresting people and putting
them into unmarked vans. How can this happen in America?

Authoritarian populists — whether Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Jair
Bolsonaro in Brazil, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Vladimir Putin
in Russia, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Jaroslaw Kaczynski in Poland, or
al-Assad — “win by dividing the people and presenting themselves as the
savior of the good and ordinary citizens against the undeserving agents
of subversion and ‘cultural pollution,’” explained Stanford’s Larry
Diamond, author of “[Ill
Winds](https://diamond-democracy.stanford.edu/publications/ill-winds-saving-democracy-russian-rage-chinese-ambition-and-american-complacency):
Saving Democracy From Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American
Complacency.”

In the face of such a threat, the left needs to be smart. Stop calling
for “defunding the police” and then saying that “defunding” doesn’t mean
disbanding. If it doesn’t mean that then say what it means: “reform.”
**** Defunding the police, calling police officers “pigs,” taking over
whole neighborhoods with barricades — these are terrible messages, not
to mention strategies, easily exploitable by Trump.

The scene that The Times’s [Mike Baker
described](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html)
from Portland in the early hours of Tuesday — Day 54 of the protests
there — is not good: “Some leaders in the Black community, grateful for
a reckoning on race, worry that what should be a moment for racial
justice could be squandered by violence. Businesses supportive of
reforms have been left demoralized by the mayhem the protests have
brought. … On Tuesday morning, police said another jewelry store had
been looted. As federal agents appeared to try detaining one person,
others in the crowd rushed to free the person.”

A new [Washington Post-ABC News poll,](https://wapo.st/3jiOiyp)
according to The Post, found that a “majority of Americans support the
Black Lives Matter movement and a record 69 percent say Black people and
other minorities are not treated as equal to white people in the
criminal justice system. But the public generally opposes calls to shift
some police funding to social services or remove statues of Confederate
generals or presidents who enslaved people.”

All of this street violence and defund-the-police rhetoric plays into
the only [effective Trump
ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-portland-federal-agents.html)
that I’ve seen on television. It goes like this: A phone rings and a
recording begins: “You have reached the 911 police emergency line. Due
to defunding of the police department, we’re sorry but no one is here to
take your call. If you’re calling to report a rape, please press 1. To
report a murder, press 2. To report a home invasion, press 3. For all
other crimes, leave your name and number and someone will get back to
you. Our estimated wait time is currently five days. Goodbye.”

Today’s protesters need to trump Trump by taking a page from another
foreign leader — a liberal — Ekrem Imamoglu, who managed to win the 2019
election to become the mayor of Istanbul, despite the illiberal Erdogan
using every dirty trick possible to steal the election. Imamoglu’s
campaign strategy was called “radical love.”

Radical love meant reaching out to the more traditional and religious
Erdogan supporters, listening to them, showing them respect and making
clear that they were not “the enemy” — that Erdogan was the enemy,
because he was the enemy of unity and mutual respect, and there could be
no progress without them.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a [recent
essay](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-pushback-against-populism-running-on-radical-love-in-turkey/)
on Imamoglu’s strategy in The Journal of Democracy noted, he overcame
Erdogan with a “message of inclusiveness, an attitude of respect toward
\[Erdogan\] supporters, and a focus on bread-and-butter issues that
could unite voters across opposing political camps. On June 23, Imamoglu
was again elected mayor of Istanbul, but this time with more than 54
percent of the vote — the largest mandate obtained by an Istanbul mayor
since 1984 — against 45 percent for his opponent.”

Radical love. Wow. I bet that could work in America, too. It’s the
perfect answer to Trump’s politics of division — and it’s the one
strategy he’ll never imitate.
