\emph{In this new series, The Artists, an installment of which will
publish every day this week and regularly thereafter, T will highlight a
recent or little-shown work by a Black artist, along with a few words
from that artist, putting the work into context. Today, we're looking at
a piece by Carrie Mae Weems, known for her powerful images of
African-American identity, whose new project, ``Resist Covid Take 6!,''
of which this work is a part, uses the mediums of advertising and
photography to raise public awareness of Covid-19 among people of
color.}

\textbf{Name:} Carrie Mae Weems

\textbf{Age:} 67

\textbf{When and where did you make this work?} 2014, Museum of Modern

\textbf{Can you describe what's going on in it?} People holding hands.

\textbf{What inspired you to make it?} I was one of 10 artists
commissioned by MoMA to photograph Philip Johnson's famed sculpture
garden. After a bit of research, I decided to reconstruct a series of
similar events that included a diverse group of people, something
lacking in past events held there.

Two books: Zora Neale Hurston's ``Their Eyes Were Watching God'' (1937)
