</div>

The company permanently suspended thousands of accounts associated with

OAKLAND, Calif. — Twitter said Tuesday evening that it had removed
thousands of accounts that spread messages about the conspiracy theories
known as QAnon, saying their messages could lead to harm and violated
Twitter policy.

Twitter said it would also block trends related to the loose network of
QAnon conspiracy theories from appearing in its trending topics and
search, and would not allow users to post links affiliated with the
theories on its platform.

It was the first time that a social media service took sweeping action
to remove content affiliated with QAnon, which has become increasingly
popular on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

Facebook is preparing to take similar steps to limit the reach of QAnon
content on its platform, said two Facebook employees with knowledge of
the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The company has been
coordinating with Twitter and other social media companies and plans to
make and announcement next month, the employees said. Facebook declined
to comment.

The QAnon theories stem from an anonymous person or group of people who
use the name “Q” and claim to have access to government secrets that
reveal a plot against President Trump and his supporters. That
supposedly classified information was initially posted on message boards
before spreading to mainstream internet platforms and has led to
significant online harassment as well as physical violence.

“QAnon is not conventional political discourse,” Alice Marwick, an
associate professor of communication at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill. “It’s a conspiracy theory that makes wild claims and
baseless accusations about political actors and innocent people alike.”

Over several weeks, Twitter has removed 7,000 accounts that posted QAnon
material, a company spokeswoman said. The accounts had been increasingly
active, and had been involved in coordinated harassment campaigns on
Twitter or tried to evade a previous suspension by setting up new
accounts after an old account was deleted.

An additional 150,000 accounts will be hidden from trends and search on
Twitter, the spokeswoman added. The takedowns were [reported earlier by
NBC
News.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-bans-7-000-qanon-accounts-limits-150-000-others-n1234541)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“These accounts amplify and enable networked harassment on a level
that’s clearly against the Twitter terms of service,” Ms. Marwick
said. “But this won’t stop QAnon from operating. It’s multiplatform and
really good at adapting as media ecosystems change.”

In May, [Facebook
removed](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/april-cib-report/) a cluster
of five pages, 20 Facebook accounts and six groups affiliated with
QAnon, saying they had violated its policy against coordinated
inauthentic behavior. In 2018, Reddit [banned a handful of
groups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/09/12/reddit-bans-r-greatawakening-the-main-subreddit-for-qanon-conspiracy-theorists/)
focused on QAnon.

After years of taking a hands-off approach to content moderation,
Twitter has acted more aggressively in recent months to stem the flood
of abuse and harassment on its platform.

Since it became a venue for disinformation during the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, Twitter has cracked down on content that spreads
false information or encourages harassment. In February, it introduced a
[ban against manipulated photos and
videos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/technology/twitter-fake-videos-photos-disinformation.html),
a popular method of tricking viewers and spreading disinformation. And
in May, it began labeling some of Mr. Trump’s tweets, saying they
contained false information or promoted violence.

Twitter’s aggressive enforcement actions have put it on [a collision
course with Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/technology/twitter-trump-dorsey.html),
who has said that Twitter is unfairly silencing conservative voices and
has [encouraged regulators to crack
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-order-social-media.html)
on the service. While the QAnon ban was applauded in many circles, some
conservatives said Twitter’s move was further evidence that the company
unevenly enforced its rules against Mr. Trump’s supporters.

The political attention has added to Twitter’s headaches. A
[wide-ranging
hack](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html)
last week compromised the Twitter accounts of Democratic political
figures, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former
President Barack Obama. Twitter also faces concerns that advertisers are
tightening spending during the coronavirus pandemic, and is expected to
report its second-quarter earnings this week.

More than two years after QAnon emerged from [the troll-infested corners
of the
internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/what-is-qanon.html),
supporters of the movement, which the F.B.I. has labeled a potential
domestic terrorism threat, are [trickling into the
mainstream](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/qanon-politicians-candidates.html)
of the Republican Party. Precisely how many candidates, mostly
Republicans, are running under the QAnon banner is unclear. Some
estimates put the number at a dozen, and few are expected to win in
November.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A number of the candidates have sought to spread a core tenet of the
QAnon conspiracy: that Mr. Trump ran for office to save Americans from a
so-called deep state filled with child-abusing, devil-worshiping
bureaucrats. According to QAnon, backing the president’s enemies are
prominent Democrats who, in some telling, extract hormones from
children’s blood.

The president has [repeatedly retweeted QAnon
supporters](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/12/trump-tweeting-qanon-followers-357238)
and cheered on candidates who openly support the conspiracy theory, like
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican House candidate in Georgia.

“A big winner. Congratulations\!” [Mr. Trump
tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1271428819296157697?s=20)
after Ms. Greene, whose ads have been banned by Facebook for violating
its terms of service, placed first in her primary.

Some QAnon followers have diverted their attention from political
causes. Recent QAnon campaigns on Twitter have focused on
[Wayfair](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/07/16/business/ap-us-wayfair-conspiracy-theory.html),
a furniture and décor company, and Chrissy Teigen, a model and cookbook
author who recently said she had blocked [one million
accounts](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a33333809/chrissy-teigen-conspiracy-theorist-drama-jeffrey-epstein/)
affiliated with QAnon. She called on Twitter to take action after she
became a target of harassment.

QAnon theories share similar themes with [Pizzagate, a conspiracy
theory](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html?searchResultPosition=11)
popularized ahead of the 2016 presidential election that advanced the
baseless notion that the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and party
elites were running a child sex-trafficking ring out of a Washington
pizzeria. In December 2016, a [vigilante gunman showed
up](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/business/media/comet-ping-pong-pizza-shooting-fake-news-consequences.html?searchResultPosition=12)
at the restaurant with an assault rifle and opened fire into a closet,
and social media companies fear that they could be linked to similar
incidents if they allow conspiracy theories to thrive on their
platforms.

Facebook, Twitter and YouTube managed to largely suppress that Pizzagate
conspiracy theory, but as the presidential election nears it has
appeared to rebound on those platforms and newer ones, [like
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/technology/pizzagate-tiktok.html).

Steinhauer and Kevin Roose.
