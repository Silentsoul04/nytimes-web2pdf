WASHINGTON — More than [20,000 American service
members](https://www.defense.gov/explore/spotlight/coronavirus/) have
contracted the coronavirus, and the infection rate in the services has
tripled over the past six weeks as the United States military has
emerged as a potential source of transmission both domestically and
abroad, according to military and local public health officials.

Cases are rising the most on military bases in Arizona, California,
Florida, Georgia and Texas, states that have all seen surges in
confirmed infections. At a base in Okinawa, Japan, the U.S. Marine Corps
has reported nearly 100 cases, [enraging local
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/asia/coronavirus-military-okinawa.html).
And in war zones in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, already awash with
unreported cases, U.S. troops have contended with outbreaks within their
ranks.

In South Korea, where Gen. Robert B. Abrams was praised early in the
pandemic for taking aggressive steps to rein in the virus, U.S. Forces
Korea has 98 positive cases, which appear to have been brought from the
United States, General Abrams has
[confirmed](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200720007051325).

Domestically, local officials in Chattahoochee County, Ga., a sparsely
populated area with high infection rates,
[traced](https://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2020/06/fort-benning-cases-covid-19-surge-chattahoochee-county/)
the outbreaks to Fort Benning, the large training base there. And
officials in California and North Carolina have also seen connections
between military installations and local communities.

The rise of cases among a largely young population that lives in dense
quarters near cities where bars and other crowded places have been
reopened is unsurprising. But the increase in coronavirus cases —
especially overseas — raises questions about the military’s safety
precautions as the Pentagon wrestles with both containing the virus
within the ranks while also addressing logistical problems it has
created, like relieving units that had been stuck overseas for longer
than expected

“It’s an amazing challenge,” said Jason Dempsey, an adjunct senior
fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “With our inability to
control the virus nationally, I think we’re going to see countries that
may not welcome deployments of American troops for anything but the most
essential missions.”

In many ways, the surge in military cases mirrors the situation in the
rest of the United States: exhausted by months of lockdown and trying to
get back to normal. There were 21,909 cases in the military as of
Monday, compared with 7,408 on June 10, according to the Pentagon. Three
service members have died since March, including a sailor on the
aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. More than 440 service members have
been
hospitalized.

In the military training camps, there is little room for a socially
distant middle ground. Barracks are packed, grueling training schools
are the norm, and open bars and other places to socialize beckon, all as
troops prepare to head overseas.

“Military bases represent a combustible demographic mix of young and
older people in a dense institutional setting, which is pretty much an
ideal context for a wildfirelike outbreak to occur,” said Lindsey J.
Leininger, a health policy researcher and clinical professor at the Tuck
School of Business at Dartmouth College. “Unfortunately, both density
and demographics place military bases at high outbreak risk. And since
many employees on the bases are from the host communities, a base
outbreak can easily seed a community outbreak.”

In a recent conference call with reporters, Army Secretary Ryan D.
McCarthy noted sharp increases in cases at Fort Benning and at Fort
Leonard Wood in Missouri, both large infantry training schools, and
acknowledged that the Army might be paying for reopening its basic
training sites too early or without adequate protections.

Mr. McCarthy said the Army was weighing whether to change its testing
protocols, expand the 14-day isolation bubble for deploying troops
before they are sent overseas or increase the frequency of coronavirus
testing.

“This is something that we take very, very seriously,” General Abrams
said on a radio program on American Forces Network Korea.

As the only nation that projects military power in dozens of countries
all over the world — some of which are banning American travelers — the
United States has many opportunities to export an unchecked virus, as
well as possibilities to facilitate domestic spread in areas that are
already overwhelmed with new cases.

This was clear in Okinawa, one of Japan’s southernmost islands that is
home to several American bases. Over several weeks in June, several
thousand Marines deployed to Okinawa, delayed by Pentagon travel
restrictions that have since been eased. Defense Secretary Mark T.
Esper’s decision to restrict, then loosen, military travel by the end
of June served two purposes: It was an attempt to keep the virus from
the ranks, but also to minimize disruptions to long-planned deployment
schedules.

A Marine helicopter and infantry unit from California is believed to
have brought new cases of the virus to Okinawa, according to a Marine
familiar with the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Covid-19 rapidly spread in the unit in June and was most likely
accelerated through a series of unauthorized parties around the Fourth
of July weekend, the Marine said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As I suspect you are all aware, based on the tracing teams, Marines and
sailors who contracted Covid likely broke” restrictions placed on their
movements, military commanders in Okinawa wrote to Marines several days
after the holiday in a message obtained by The New York Times. The
commanders warned the service members to adhere to the restrictions and
said that they were “under the
microscope.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In Australia, where more than 1,000 Marines recently started their
annual monthslong deployment in Darwin, at least one Marine was found to
have the virus, according to a [Marine news
release](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/373660/confirmed-positive-case-covid-19-mrf-d-marine)
this month. The Bitburg-Prüm region, home to Spangdahlem Air Base, has
one of the highest rates of infection in Germany, although cases on the
base [appear to be
abating](https://www.spangdahlem.af.mil/Portals/10/2019%20Novel%20Corona%20virus%20%28COVID-19%29%20HPCON%20A_%20PHASE%203%20Guidance.pdf).

Chattahoochee County, Ga., has seen its per capita infection rate nearly
double over the past two weeks. “Of course there is community spread on
the base,” Pamela Kirkland, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of
Public Health’s West Central Health District, said of Fort Benning.
“Many live off base and could be reported in several counties in
Georgia and Alabama.”

She added, “We did see quite an increase in what was otherwise a typical
smaller number of cases for a low-populated county.”

Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the biggest Army bases and home to
Special Operations units and training schools, also had a large
outbreak, and surrounding counties have also been affected. More than 80
soldiers tested positive for the virus last month after a weekslong
survival course, known as SERE school.

“There is evidence of community spread in North Carolina and in
Cumberland County,” said Dr. Jennifer Green, the county’s public health
director. “Fort Bragg is a part of our Cumberland County community.”
