<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — For companies with supply chains that snake around the
globe, the crises have just kept coming: First the prolonged and painful
U.S.-China trade war, then a pandemic that snarled shipments, stalled
international travel and shut factory doors.

President Trump and his advisers have seized on the disruptions to make
a familiar case to manufacturers: Come back home.

“The global pandemic has proven once and for all that to be a strong
nation, America must be a manufacturing nation,” Mr. Trump said at a
Ford factory in Ypsilanti, Mich., on May 21. “We’re bringing it back.”

Mr. Trump has spent much of his presidency trying to cajole
manufacturers to return to the United States, through both tough talk
and policies like tariffs. His advisers have pointed to both the trade
war and the pandemic as evidence that it is just too risky for
multinational companies to rely on other countries, particularly China,
to make their goods.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But those arguments have yet to result in a wave of factories returning
to the United States. Foreign direct investment into the United States —
which measures spending from internationally owned companies to start,
expand or acquire American businesses — [sank drastically last
year](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/new-foreign-direct-investment-united-states-2019),
to its lowest recorded level since 2006.

Foreign-owned companies invested about half as much in the United States
in 2019 as they did in 2016, the year before Mr. Trump took office.
After increasing in the first two years of Mr. Trump’s presidency, the
number of manufacturing jobs [flatlined last
year](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag31-33.htm) and fell sharply with
the pandemic. As of June, there were nearly 300,000 fewer factory jobs
in the United States than there were when Mr. Trump was inaugurated.

For all the president’s criticisms of global supply chains, the economic
incentive to outsource still prevails. While his trade policy has made
doing business abroad, particularly in China, more uncertain and costly,
higher wages in the United States and the lure of foreign markets mean
that most global businesses are choosing to remain global. Most firms
that shifted out of China to avoid the crossfire of the trade war moved
to other low-cost countries, like Vietnam and Mexico. Other companies
say China is a growth market they cannot afford to lose.

And while the pandemic has prompted [a broader
reassessment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/business/coronavirus-globalism.html)
of the risks of global supply chains, it has also brought about the
deepest economic contraction in generations, battering companies’
finances and forcing them to cut back on workers. Executives are deeply
uncertain what demand for their products will look like in the coming
months and years — hardly the environment to encourage big investments
in new American factories.

The furniture maker La-Z-Boy is one example. The company shifted its
production out of China to Vietnam last year to bypass Mr. Trump’s
tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to tracking by
Panjiva, a research firm. But on a June 24 earnings call, Kurt L.
Darrow, La-Z-Boy’s chief executive, announced that the economic effects
of the pandemic would force the firm to make steep cuts to its work
force, including in the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“While we were pleased to have brought back some 6,000 furloughed
workers, we made the decision to permanently close our Newton, Miss.,
La-Z-Boy branded manufacturing facility and reduce our global work force
by approximately 10 percent,” Mr. Darrow
said.

There could still be a more significant reordering of global factory
activity on the horizon. The one-two punch of the trade war and pandemic
has shaken the confidence of executives and investors; led to shortages
of [toilet
paper](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/toilet-paper-shortage.html),
[meat](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/business/coronavirus-meat-shortages.html),

and [kettle
bells](https://www.gq.com/story/inside-the-great-kettlebell-shortage);
and revealed hidden frailties in many companies’ business models.

As factories struggle to reopen with components still in short supply,
some executives are questioning the [just-in-time supply
chains](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/business/coronavirus-globalism.html)
they use to whisk products around the globe, rather than keeping
warehouses stocked — and particularly how much they rely on factories in
China, where production moved en masse in previous decades.

Emily J. Blanchard, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at
Dartmouth College who studies global value chains, said many firms were
not thinking “in such broad and apocalyptic terms” before the pandemic.

“Covid has generated this new imagination of worst-case scenarios,”
Professor Blanchard said.

U.S. [factory output](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=sKQ7)
declined throughout 2019, as Mr. Trump’s trade war intensified, and it
has dropped further this year, suggesting there is no boom in new
American factories. Since peaking in mid-2019, corporate investment has
[declined](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PNFI) for three
consecutive quarters. Total foreign direct investment in manufacturing
was nearly one-third lower in the first three years of Mr. Trump’s
tenure than it was in the final three years of President Barack Obama’s.

Mr. Trump ostensibly fought his trade war on behalf of American
manufacturing. But economists say it has actually been a drag on most
U.S. factories, by [increasing prices for components and inciting
foreign
retaliation](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf).
It has also coincided with a plunge in Chinese investment in the United
States to [$5 billion
in 2019](https://rhg.com/research/two-way-street-us-china-investment-trends-2020-update/),
the lowest level since 2009, according to Rhodium Group, a research
firm.

Some Trump officials and their supporters blame a broader global
economic malaise that has dragged down factories around the world. And
they point to the fact that [imports fell last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/business/economy/trump-trade.html)
and now account for a slightly smaller share of the goods consumed by
Americans, as a sign of their success.

[Calculations by the Coalition for a Prosperous
America](https://www.prosperousamerica.org/cpa_s_new_manufacturing_reshoring_index_shows_strong_gains_in_2019),
a trade group that supports the administration’s policies, indicate that
30.6 percent of the manufactured goods Americans consumed in 2019 were
imported, down slightly from 31.2 percent the previous year. For much of
the last two decades, the trend went in the opposite direction.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are good reasons for some companies to move out of China. Wages
are rising, whittling away at one incentive to manufacture there. And
deep [fissures between the United States and
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/world/asia/cold-war-china-us.html)
have opened in areas like security and technology, which could lead to
more aggressive action by either side, regardless of who wins the
presidential election in November.

Still, more companies leaving China does not necessarily represent a win
for American workers. Like La-Z-Boy, many companies that are moving some
facilities out of China — including Samsung, Hasbro, Apple, Nintendo and
GoPro — are relocating to countries where wages are even lower. While
U.S. trade with China [fell
sharply](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/business/economy/trump-trade.html)
last year, imports from Vietnam, Taiwan and Mexico swelled.

For many companies, making their supply chains more resilient has
actually meant spreading out production around the world, not
concentrating it in the United States, said Chris Rogers, a global trade
and logistics analyst at Panjiva.

“If you want to hedge your risks, you need to stay global,” he
said.

relatively low wages and proximity to American customers.

“There is a real desire to begin to near-shore, and Mexico’s a great
place to do business,” Mr. Upchurch said. Constructing new factories
would take some time, he said, “but over the next few years, we would
certainly expect to see benefit.”

For other companies, China still beckons.

Purveyors of consumer products, fast food and automobiles continue to
expand in China, which is home to a rapidly growing consumer market and
the world’s greatest concentration of factories. Some firms have
struggled to find factory space or skilled workers outside of China.

show that U.S. foreign direct investment in China continued to rise in
2019, despite the trade war.

In May, the U.S. engineering giant Honeywell [opened a new

in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the [coronavirus

announced plans to expand its Shanghai factory, while Popeyes Louisiana
Kitchen, Walmart and Costco are [planning new stores in

Some executives insist that, contrary to popular belief, their
investments in China allow them to employ more workers in the United
States.

Milliken & Company, a textile maker with headquarters in South Carolina
that employs 8,000 people, still performs the bulk of its manufacturing
in the United States. It resisted a wave of offshoring in the 1980s and
’90s by shifting into niche products, like floor coverings and
military uniforms. But it has opened factories in China in recent years
to serve that market, enabling it to hire more people back home, said
Halsey M. Cook Jr., the company’s chief executive.

“I think you’d hear the same thing” from other major multinational
companies, Mr. Cook said, like John Deere. “Global supply chains are
complicated. When you’ve seen one, you’ve seen one.”
