# Government Denies Cohen Was Imprisoned to Stop Trump Book

</div>

Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, said he was returned to
prison as retaliation for writing a tell-all memoir about President
Trump.

The Trump administration denied on Wednesday that it had returned
[Michael D.
Cohen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-book.html)
to prison in retaliation for his decision to publish a jailhouse
tell-all book about his former boss, the president.

The government said in newly filed court papers that the decision to
send Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, back to
prison earlier this month after he had been released on furlough was
made by a federal Bureau of Prisons employee. That employee had no idea
that Mr. Cohen was writing a memoir, the papers said.

Instead, Mr. Cohen endangered his own freedom by becoming “combative”
when refusing to sign an agreement outlining the terms of his release,
the government said. The agreement was “not devised by anyone at B.O.P.
or in the executive branch — let alone a high-level official with any
motive to prevent the release of” Mr. Cohen’s book, the papers said.

The new filing came in response to a lawsuit Mr. Cohen filed on Monday
against Attorney General William P. Barr and the director of the Bureau
of Prisons, demanding that he be released and allowed to serve the
remainder of his sentence in home confinement.

by returning him to custody in what he said was retaliation for his book
project, making it impossible for him to complete the
manuscript.

Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan has
set a hearing on the matter for Thursday.

Mr. Cohen’s lawsuit has drawn support from the American Civil Liberties
Union, which joined private lawyers in helping to represent him, as well
as from legal scholars.

This week, a group of constitutional law professors filed a brief in the
case, saying they were “deeply concerned about the blatant disregard for
First Amendment rights and values displayed in the treatment of Mr.
Cohen.”

Mr. Cohen, 53, [pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations
and other
crimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-guilty-plea-trump-takeaways.html),
stemming from a scheme to pay hush money to two women who said they had
had affairs with Mr. Trump before he was president. Mr. Trump has denied
the allegations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cohen had been serving a three-year sentence at a minimum-security
prison camp in Otisville N.Y., about 75 miles northwest of New York
City.

He said in his lawsuit that he had been writing his book “in plain
sight” in a prison library at Otisville and had discussed it with
other inmates, prison officials and staff members.

The suit said the book would include Mr. Cohen’s “firsthand experiences
with Mr. Trump” and “graphic details about the president’s behavior
behind closed doors.”

“The narrative describes pointedly certain anti-Semitic remarks against
prominent Jewish people and virulently racist remarks against such Black
leaders as President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela,” according to the
suit.

The book was tentatively titled “Disloyal: The True Story of Michael
Cohen, Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump,” the suit
said.

Then, in May, Mr. Cohen, whose lawyers have said he has severe
hypertension and respiratory issues, [was released on furlough as a part
of an effort by the Bureau of
Prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/nyregion/michael-cohen-coronavirus-prison-release.html)
to curb the spread of coronavirus in its facilities. He continued to
work on his project at home and also publicized it, announcing plans to
publish the book in late September, before the election.

On July 9, [Mr. Cohen was abruptly sent back to
prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/nyregion/michael-cohen-arrested.html)
after he balked at signing an agreement that would have allowed him to
remain home if he agreed not to publish the book for the duration of his
sentence. His projected release date from prison is November 2021.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The timeline here clearly indicates retaliation,” the lawsuit said.

But in its response, the government described the behavior of Mr. Cohen
while meeting with probation officers to consider the agreement as
“defiant” and “unacceptable.”

The government asserts that Mr. Cohen told the officers that he was
going to write a book “no matter what happens.” He also objected to a
provision that restricted his employment, asking whether he could appear
“as a political correspondent on television or the radio,” the
government filing said.

It added that Mr. Cohen also told one officer to “say hello to ‘Mr.
Barr.’”

Since his return to prison, Mr. Cohen has been held in solitary
confinement virtually around the clock, making it impossible for him to
complete his book, according to the suit.

The government responded in its filing that Mr. Cohen was isolated after
being returned to Otisville under a policy that says new inmates are
quarantined for about two weeks before being allowed to enter the
prison’s general population.

He is to be tested for the coronavirus on Friday, the government said,
adding, “He is free to work on his book while
incarcerated.”
