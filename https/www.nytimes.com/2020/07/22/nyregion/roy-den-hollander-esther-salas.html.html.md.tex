Killing}\label{suspect-in-death-of-nj-judges-son-is-linked-to-california-killing}}

Roy Den Hollander, the ``anti-feminist'' who is the prime suspect in the
New Jersey shooting, may also have killed a rival men's rights lawyer,
officials say.

The two killings on opposite sides of the country were strikingly
similar. A gunman showed up at the front door, posing as a delivery man,
and opened fire.

One of the victims was Marc Angelucci, 52, a men's rights lawyer who was
killed on July 11 outside his home in San Bernardino County, Calif.
Eight days
later,\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/nyregion/esther-salas.html}{a
shooter approached}the New Jersey home of Esther Salas, a federal judge,
killing the judge's son and leaving her husband seriously injured.

On Wednesday, the F.B.I. office in Newark said in a statement that
agents had uncovered evidence linking Mr. Angelucci's killing to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/nyregion/roy-den-hollander-esther-salas-list.html}{Roy
Den Hollander}, who is also the primary suspect in the New Jersey
shooting.

It was the first time that the authorities had publicly connected the
two killings.

Mr. Den Hollander, 72, was found dead in the Catskills in New York on
Monday in an apparent suicide, hours after the shooting at Judge Salas's
home. He was a self-described anti-feminist lawyer who wrote thousands
of pages in online screeds denouncing women, including female judges.

On Wednesday, the F.B.I. did not publicly say what evidence had been
uncovered. But the authorities investigating Mr. Den Hollander's
apparent suicide found a semiautomatic Walther pistol that was of the
same caliber as the weapon used in both the California shooting and the
New Jersey shooting, according to a law enforcement official briefed on
the matter.

Investigators were conducting ballistics tests to determine whether that
weapon was used in both attacks, according to law enforcement officials.

The authorities are investigating whether Mr. Den Hollander was seeking
revenge against his enemies after receiving a terminal cancer diagnosis,
according to a different law enforcement official. In a self-published
book last year, Mr. Den Hollander said he learned in late 2018 he had a
rare form of melanoma.

Although Mr. Den Hollander detailed extensive grievances against judges
and others in his online writings, it was not clear whether he was
planning more violent attacks.

The F.B.I. has contacted New York State's chief judge, Janet M. DiFiore,
to notify her that Mr. Den Hollander had her name and photo in his car,
according to her spokesman, Lucian Chalfen.

The name of another female state judge, who presided over a case that
Mr. Den Hollander was involved in, was also found in his car, Mr.
Chalfen said. He declined to name the judge.

Mr. Den Hollander's connection to Judge Salas and Mr. Angelucci revolved
around the same case.

In 2015, Mr. Den Hollander brought a legal challenge to the male-only
military draft that was assigned to Judge Salas in Newark federal court.
Two years earlier, Mr. Angelucci had filed a similar lawsuit in a
different jurisdiction.

In February 2019, a federal court in Houston
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/military-draft-men-unconstitutional.html}{ruled
in Mr. Angelucci's favor}, finding that the exclusion of women from the
draft was unconstitutional. The case is now on appeal.

In his online writings, Mr. Den Hollander was well aware of Mr.
Angelucci's legal victory and complained that Judge Salas was moving too
slowly with his lawsuit.

``The only difference in the Texas case was that two guys were the
plaintiffs and a white 70-year-old man was the judge,'' Mr. Den
Hollander wrote. ``Just unbelievable, by now we should have been
knocking on the U.S. Supreme Court's door, but lady unluck stuck us with
an Obama appointee.''

Judge Salas, 51, was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama in
2010. She is the first Hispanic woman to serve as a federal judge in New
Jersey.

In 2018, she had allowed Mr. Den Hollander's lawsuit to proceed, a
ruling in his favor, but he still ranted about her in his online
writings, insulting her and claiming that she was a beneficiary of
affirmative action.

Mr. Angelucci was the vice president of the National Coalition for Men,
a men's rights group. About a decade ago, Mr. Den Hollander had
approached the coalition and asked its support for his causes and
lawsuits, but he was turned away, according to the group's members.

``We rejected him because we all thought and, it turns out he was, a nut
job,'' said Al Rava, a lawyer in San Diego who was previously a
secretary for the coalition.

Mr. Den Hollander had been a member of the coalition but was kicked out
of the group after he made a jarring phone call to Harry Crouch, the
coalition's president, around the time that Mr. Angelucci's lawsuit was
filed.

``He threatened to come to California to kick my ass,'' Mr. Crouch said.

When Mr. Angelucci found out about the threat, he called Mr. Den
Hollander to chastise him, according to Mr. Crouch.

In his online writings, Mr. Den Hollander criticized the men's rights
movement, suggesting its advocates did not go far enough.

``I don't belong to that group of wimps and whiners,'' he wrote.
``They're trying to win back their rights by acting like girls instead
of men.''

Paul Elam, another prominent men's rights activist, said in a Facebook
live video on Monday night that Mr. Den Hollander was ``absolutely
enraged'' about Mr. Angelucci's pursuit of a lawsuit against the
Selective Service Administration, the government agency that maintains a
database of Americans eligible for a potential draft.

Mr. Den Hollander viewed the lawsuit as his proprietary domain,
believing Mr. Angelucci's work to be ``an intrusion into his space,''
Mr. Elam said.

``There was a grudge between the two,'' Mr. Elam said.

Mr. Elam did not respond on Wednesday to a request for comment.
