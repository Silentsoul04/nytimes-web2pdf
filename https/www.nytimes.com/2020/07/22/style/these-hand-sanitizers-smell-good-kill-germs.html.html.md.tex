\section{These Hand Sanitizers Smell Good, Kill
Germs}\label{these-hand-sanitizers-smell-good-kill-germs}}

Now that hand sanitizers have become an accessory of the new normal,
upscale brands are introducing their own portable cleansers.

At Cecconi's in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn and in West
Hollywood, Calif., diners are offered more than a grind of fresh pepper
or a spoonful of grated Parmesan with their meal.

On many tables, where you may expect to find a bottle of olive oil or
hot sauce, there's Amass Botanic Hand Sanitizer, a spicy-scented
cleanser to keep the restaurant's guests germ free.

The product is one of a new crop of upscale hand sanitizers, frequently
formulated with refined scents and emollients. Like the standard
versions, these have an alcohol base but aim to offer a more indulgent
experience than, say, a smear of Purell or a quick rub with a
disinfecting wipe.

``This is becoming a quotidian ritual for people, an everyday thing
that's part of their lives,'' said Morgan McLachlan, a founder and the
master distiller at Amass, a Los Angeles company that focused on spirits
before it began producing hand sanitizer in March. ``Why not have it be
a pleasurable experience?''

The company's Botanic Hand Sanitizer is a light liquid that, if poured
into a glass, could be mistaken for gin. The spicy scent, called Four
Thieves, is redolent with clove and cinnamon; it brings to mind a wintry
fruitcake. The name and formula were inspired by medieval criminals who,
according to legend, avoided contracting the bubonic plague by anointing
themselves with a similar blend of botanicals, Ms. McLachlan said.

A second scent, an herbaceous blend called Basilisk Breath, was
introduced on July 16.

Beauty brands are also introducing hand sanitizers.
\href{https://biossance.com/products/squalane-hand-sanitizer}{Biossance},
a popular skin care line, came out with one last month with moisturizing
squalane. The Brooklyn fragrance house
\href{https://dsanddurga.com/search?q=hand+sanitizer\&type=product}{DS
\& Durga} added one with a eucalyptus-based scent to its collection in
April.

The skin care line
\href{https://www.peterthomasroth.com/hand-sanitizer-alcohol-antiseptic-80-topical-solution-3003007.html}{Peter
Thomas Roth} unveiled its version in April; the makeup brand
\href{https://www.nudestix.com/search?type=product\&q=hand+sanitizer}{Nudestix}
introduced hand sanitizer in June.
\href{https://shen-beauty.com/search?q=hand+sanitizer\&type=product}{Shen
Beauty}, the influential beauty boutique in Brooklyn, created one it
began selling this month.

Predictably, these elevated products come with a commensurate price tag.
At \$12 for a two-ounce bottle, the Amass hand sanitizer costs about
eight times as much as a purse-size hand sanitizer at CVS. On the other
hand, Augustinus Bader, the cultish German line that includes a \$165
body cream, has, since May, been offering a limited supply of the hand
sanitizer it created for front line workers to consumers for free, for a
small shipping fee.

Higher prices haven't necessarily deterred shoppers. March and April
sales of \href{https://jaobrand.com/}{Jao Brand's Refresher hand
sanitizer}, which was introduced in 1997 and costs between \$10 and
\$18, depending on size, exceeded those for all of last year, according
to a representative of the brand. (Admittedly, one factor of high sales
could be the low supply, at least early in the pandemic, of traditional
hand sanitizers, although some high-end brands have also sold out of
these products over the last couple of months.)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends a minimum
concentration of 60 percent alcohol in these products; in upscale
versions, that percentage is often much higher.

``The higher the concentration, perhaps the more effective, but it's
more damaging to the outer skin layer,'' said Dr. Joshua Zeichner, the
director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai
Hospital in New York.

``That can lead to cracks in the outer skin layer, loss of hydration and
inflammation,'' he said. Moisturizing after use is advised.

Of course, simply decanting basic hand sanitizer into a fancy container
can make it feel more glamorous. Early this month, sleek sanitizer
dispensers in polished steel were installed in the Tom Ford Madison
Avenue boutique. They were created by
\href{https://puretesystem.com/}{Pureté System}, a new brand founded by
Jonathan Reed, who also runs a company that produces physical and
digital events.

One of the receptacles, a shiny silver box filled with disinfecting
wipes, looks like a designer take on a package of tissues. Another, a
narrow tower that dispenses squirts of sanitizer, could be a luxurious
water cooler.

Their aesthetic is, of course, more in sync with the boutique's grand
black staircase and marble detailing than, say, the packs of cleaning
products at the Duane Reade a couple of blocks away.

Mr. Reed said that other high-end stores are interested in using the
dispensers, which are designed to use with a variety of sanitizers. He
added that Pureté System's own line of hand sanitizer, scented with
white musk and rose, will be introduced in the next couple of months.

The new company's goal, he said, was to offer a sophisticated way to
incorporate something that's now part of everyday life.

``I don't think it's going away,'' he said. ``This is our new reality.''
