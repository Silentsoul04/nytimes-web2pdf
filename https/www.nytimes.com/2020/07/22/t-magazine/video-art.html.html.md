When coronavirus shuttered just about every gallery in the United States
and confined many to their homes, museum curators and dealers [had to
improvise](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/arts/design/art-galleries-online-viewing-coronavirus.html).
Overnight, the only way they could show art was digitally. In some
cases, this meant posting photos of paintings or using cameras to offer
360-degree virtual tours of exhibitions — to varying degrees of success.
But then there were the works that were *designed* to be viewed on a
screen, which have enjoyed a sort of a renaissance.

On many Friday nights since April, the [Whitney Museum of American
Art](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/whitney-museum-of-american-art)
in New York has streamed video art by [Alex Da
Corte](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/t-magazine/alex-da-corte-st-vincent.html),
[Juan Antonio Olivares](https://whitney.org/artists/18064) and [Adelita
Husni-Bey](https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/adelita-husni-bey-chiron),
to name a few. [Gagosian Gallery](https://gagosian.com/) staged web
shows with moving-image work by artists including [Ed
Ruscha](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/arts/design/ed-ruscha.html)
and [Douglas Gordon](https://gagosian.com/artists/douglas-gordon/),
Metro Pictures hosted a digital film festival over more than a dozen
weekends, and the artist [Nina Chanel
Abney](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/t-magazine/artist-work-habits-camille-henrot-nina-chanel-abney.html)
curated a two-week run of pieces by [Tiona Nekkia
McClodden](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/arts/design/whitney-museum-biennial-artists.html),
[Solange
Knowles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/t-magazine/solange-interview.html)
and others at Brooklyn’s [We Buy Gold](https://webuygold.wtf/).
Pittsburgh’s [Carnegie Museum of
Art](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/arts/design/carnegie-museum-to-open-a-survey-of-the-designer-peter-muller-munk.html)
launched an online exhibition series with “Lake Valley,” a 2016
cartoon-collage animation by [Rachel
Rose](https://www.artsy.net/artist/rachel-rose) that follows a
rabbitlike animal as it explores an enchanted world, seeking community.
“Two-dimensional work or sculpture all comes out a bit flat on social
media,” says the filmmaker [Isaac
Julien](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/arts/international/facing-the-camera.html).
“I’m not saying people can’t sell works. They do, in fact. But I think
the moving image — it becomes its own form. It’s not really
compromised.”

Since its emergence in the 1960s, it’s video art that has typically been
harder to present and sell and perhaps to take in, too, often requiring
time and patience of its viewer. When pioneers like [Bruce
Nauman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/t-magazine/bruce-nauman-art-interview.html),
[Vito
Acconci](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/design/vito-acconci-dead-performance-artist.html)
and [Joan
Jonas](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/t-magazine/joan-jonas-reanimation-venice-biennale.html)
wielded cumbersome cameras in the 1970s to make scrappy, poetic or
otherwise bizarre tapes intended for gallery display, the prominent
dealers [Leo
Castelli](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/arts/leo-castelli-influential-art-dealer-dies-at-91.html)
and [Ileana
Sonnabend](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/arts/24sonnabend.html)
started a service to rent and sell them. It never turned a profit.
However, as production values increased and minds opened in the 1980s
and ’90s, stars were minted: [Bill

[Pipilotti

and [Christian
Marclay](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/arts/music/christian-marclay-huddersfield-music-festival.html)
were among those to see their work sold in limited editions and featured
in major museums and international biennials, just as that of [Ryan
Trecartin](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/ryan-trecartin),
[Arthur
Jafa](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/t-magazine/arthur-jafa-in-bloom.html)

But even in 2020, with screens glowing all around us, video art remains
a relatively niche field. It is still rare, for instance, to come across
a figure like [Julia Stoschek](https://www.jsc.art/), a German collector
who focuses exclusively on multimedia and video. When the art spaces
Stoschek runs in Berlin and Düsseldorf, Germany, were closed in March,
she collaborated with artists and technicians to upload more than 70
works from her 800-some-piece collection online. Her aim, she says, is
“to make it accessible for everyone, all the time, everywhere.” [Eric
Crosby](https://carnegiemuseums.org/expert/eric-crosby/), the Carnegie’s
director, feels similarly, saying that a lesson from lockdown is that
“audiences should be able to encounter art regardless of whether our
museum doors are open or closed.” Their comments underscore the diffuse
and potentially democratic nature of video art in comparison to, say,
oil painting.

At the same time, readily available offerings raise questions about
where exactly video art should live, and how its future might be shaped.
Is its star turn on the web a sign of things to come, or just a
momentary detour? Here, four video and digital artists talk about
working during the pandemic and share thoughts on the field as a
whole.

### **Hito Steyerl**

*For more than 20 years,* [*Hito
Steyerl*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/arts/design/hito-steyerl.html)*,
53, has made incisive, deliriously entertaining videos that examine how
images and ideas circulate. Based in Berlin, she is set to have her
first* [*survey
exhibition*](https://www.kunstsammlung.de/de/exhibitions/hito-steyerl)
*in Germany — at the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, in Düsseldorf —
in September.*

Most of my work has always been online. But I try not to share it on
commercial or corporate platforms, so you will find very little of it on
YouTube. It’s mostly hidden in plain sight, meaning that it’s on
platforms that are not Google searchable, which technically makes them
part of the dark web.

The concept of the digital sphere is not in a very fortunate moment.
I’ve been talking for the past year about how the digital has been
privatized and gentrified. It’s basically monetized by four or five big
corporations, and none of this has changed just because of lockdown, so
I’m very ambivalent about the digital euphoria.

What institutions or galleries assume is that videos are available and
that they can just stream them for free without taking into account any
sort of production cost or anything like that because the web is seen as
a sphere of distribution of things that are free. There is a sort of
digital fatigue now, and I think there is a whole oversupply, and it’s
not good for the artwork. It doesn’t get it any more attention. On the
other hand, if people were to give it more time and attention, and also
resources, I think it could develop a lot. The over-traveling that the
art world has experienced could be reduced if there were some convincing
digital platforms. But I’m not sure whether that will happen.

Basically, I think it’s a good idea to expand digital distribution, but
then we also need public digital infrastructure. We need, let’s say,
municipal digital platforms, for teaching, for schooling, for education,
but also, of course, for the arts. We should also keep in mind that most
of these means of production are not easily accessible — especially if
we go into this video sphere, with 3-D modeling and VR, it quickly
becomes very complex and expensive. And it stifles the development of
modes of expression because it’s just too expensive and young people
have a hard time getting access to it. There is a huge difference to 20
or 30 years ago, because the camcorders were really cheap. That was my
only shot at ever entering this kind of activity.

But if people in Minneapolis can start thinking about [how to build
their security
institutions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html),
then why not a municipal digital platform? I think that’s really easy in
comparison — even cheap. Many things that once seemed impossible are
suddenly possible, so why not
try?

### **Rachel Rose**

*Based in New York, though she’s been working upstate during this
period, Rachel Rose, 33, shows transfixing, research-intensive videos in
intimate, carefully crafted environments. Her 2016 work “Lake Valley”*
[*is on view*](https://cmoa.org/exhibition/rachel-rose/) *on the
Carnegie Museum of Art’s website through Aug. 16, and at a solo show at
Lafayette Anticipations in Paris through Sept. 13.*

The biggest change during lockdown has really been not having time. Not
having child care for Eden, my 10-month-old daughter, I don’t have the
same amount of time to myself every day. It’s more broken up and
staccato. But I’m also planning for an exhibition, and I’m working on a
screenplay, so the computer is all I need.

The Carnegie proposed doing an online exhibition of “Lake Valley,” and I
was excited about that because it felt like a nice opportunity to show
it to families at home with kids, which I had always wanted to do. All
of my works thus far have been developed in relationship, at least in
part, to the site where I’m first showing them, because so many of them
have been commissioned by institutions. So for me, the installation has
always been a condition of the work. One of the gifts of the art
universe is the opportunity to think through the physicality of how you
view something. That’s not something you get with a feature film,
because it’s going out to theaters or it’s going out to streaming
platforms. But, because none of us can be in physical spaces together, I
feel it might as well be shared online.

I wonder about this period as a time for slower kinds of producing. Art
is on this very seasonal cycle that parallels fashion. There are the
September shows, there are the art fairs — it’s this constant
saturation, and I think for artists, that can often make them feel as
though they need to keep up with that pace, which keeps getting faster
and faster. Because of what I do, and the way in which my work has been
commissioned, I’ve been able to work more slowly, but I notice how
detrimental that cycle can be, and this could be the beginning of a new
sort of time scale.

Online is essential right now, but as a long-term strategy, I’m not
sure. When I open up Netflix and look at the main page, I’ve never heard
of most of the TV shows it lists, and most of them are like six seasons
in. It feels like there’s so much entertainment and moving-image stuff
online. In a way, I feel like the value that art can hold is parallel to
that of live concerts. We can all listen to anything on Spotify or
iTunes, but going to a concert is an entirely different thing. That is
one of the things that museums can do for us, for art. Maybe, after
Covid, art should become *less* visible on the internet. At the same
time, the immediacy of “[Two

Bennani](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/t-magazine/art-meriem-bennani-hijab-video.html)
and [Orian Barki](https://www.orianbarki.com/) debuted in March\] — what
is that? It’s like watching art live. And there’s something really
exhilarating and beautiful about that, too.

### **Isaac Julien**

*After having a solo show at* [*Jessica Silverman
Gallery*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/t-magazine/jessica-silverman-gallery.html)
*in San Francisco cut short because of shelter-in-place orders, Isaac
Julien, 60, was working in Santa Cruz, whose University of California
branch is home to the* [*Isaac Julien
Lab*](https://danm.ucsc.edu/project_group/isaac-julien-lab)*. Known for
sumptuous videos centered on radical histories, which he releases in
multiple formats, from single-screen cuts to immersive multiscreen
installations, Julien is scheduled to have a show at the McEvoy
Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco in the fall.*

Filming would be impossible right now. Maybe the gods were looking down
on me in 2019, because I had the kind of mad intention of making these
two gigantic projects — “A Marvellous Entanglement,” on the architect
Lina Bo Bardi, and “Lessons of the Hour,” on Frederick Douglass — and I
did. That has meant that 2020 has been the kind of year with more
exhibitions and my making single-screen versions of work, so a time when
it’s more postproduction. If I had not done that, this would be very
disruptive. There really are some things you can continue doing while
social distancing, and there are some things that you cannot.

And yet, we’re seeing this flourishing of video art and media works on
social-media platforms. I participated in this Metro Pictures film
festival, which I think was really successful. I really enjoyed seeing
“Baltimore” \[his 2003 short starring [Melvin Van
Peebles](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/arts/design/melvin-van-peebles-headlines-a-group-art-show.html)\]
during that time, and it was great to be able to post about it on
Facebook and Instagram, to have all the responses to the work. I
realized that a lot of the video artworks that one makes — they become,
in a way, connected to the time when they were made. People have the
memory. But it’s great to be able to redistribute them on social-media
platforms and to introduce the work to new audiences. Viewers were
really excited, and this made me think about the possibility of how
those works could live in a different capacity. When we have an
exhibition of work showing in a museum, maybe we can have a
single-screen version on social media simultaneously and think about
both platforms as exhibition spaces.

What was good about the festival was that you got excited about who was
going to be the next artist, and then you looked at the films, and you
had time to look at them, and you could really learn things. Since then,
other works of mine have been shown at special events. For example, in
Brazil, the
[Goethe-Institut](https://www.goethe.de/ins/br/pt/sta/sal.html) in
[Salvador](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/travel/what-to-do-in-salvador-brazil.html)
showed my Fanon film \[“[Frantz Fanon: Black Skin, White
Mask](https://www.isaacjulien.com/projects/frantz-fanon-black-skin-white-mask/)”
(1995)\] — it was just on for 24 hours, and it was watched by over
37,000 people. We kind of couldn’t believe it when the figure came out.
Funnily enough, the Fanon film was also showing in an exhibition in
Singapore, and they showed it online, too, and some friends from Germany
saw it. So you have this internationalization of the platform, of
different people watching different works.

This kind of lit the fuse. I got approached by lots of other
institutions and museums, and I thought to myself, “OK, hang on here a
minute. I think I might stop and think about it a little bit more,
because maybe we can do it ourselves, in the
studio.”

### **Lynn Hershman Leeson**

*For more than half a century, the San Francisco-based* [*Lynn Hershman
Leeson*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/arts/design/Lynn-Hershman-Leeson-Shed-art-technology.html)*,
79, has released feature films, cross-disciplinary scientific endeavors,
interactive videos (like 1979-84’s
“*[*Lorna*](https://www.lynnhershman.com/lorna/)*,” which concerns an
agoraphobic woman) and web projects such as “*[*Agent
Ruby*](http://www.lynnhershman.com/agent-ruby/)*” (1998-2002), a chatbot
with artificial intelligence that can converse with internet visitors. A
survey of her work at the* [*New
Museum*](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/new-museum-of-contemporary-art)
*in New York has been postponed because of the pandemic, though she is
currently developing what she calls “an occultish online game.”*

I probably have more time to work now because usually I run around a
lot. In the past few months, I was able to finish a lot of projects I
started in the ’60s. I’m doing calls on Zoom, which I didn’t have
before, but my practice hasn’t changed all that much because these
things do take a long time to develop. I have the luxury of staying home
and being able to commute digitally, which is something that [Nam June
Paik](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/arts/design/nam-june-paik-73-dies-pioneer-of-video-art-whose-work-broke.html)
talked about — how we’re becoming stationary nomads. He talked about
that in the early 1980s, going all around the world without leaving your
house.

I started a project called “Agent Ruby” in 1998, and nobody knew what to
do with it, and I finally gave it to SFMOMA because I couldn’t afford
her upkeep on the net. I was told that the piece is the most-visited
artwork in their collection. What really astounded me, because we did an
exhibition of it in 2013, was that you do these things on the internet
and they never die. The museum had collected something like 80 tons of
global responses that became a portrait of what the world was thinking
about all of these years.

One of the things I want to do when I have my next museum exhibition —
and I don’t think that any museum can afford to not do this — is really
design a way it can be seen online. I think that there are ways that we
can design almost telerobotic surveillance systems that allow you to see
works better — really going into the piece and being able to understand
it and see details of it. I haven’t seen anybody, any museum, take
advantage of the possibilities of how a work can be seen online. The
viewer needs to be in control of what they’re seeing and have access to
the tools that will allow them to do that. The way that museums have
been portraying exhibitions is that they’re in control. They let you fly
through a gallery, but they don’t let you stop or go into something to
understand it in a more tactile way.

Artists use the tools of their time and if, for instance, people who
were shooting in 8-millimeter or 16-millimeter then want to convert it
to video or maybe a form that may last longer, it’s not the same piece.
It doesn’t look the same, it doesn’t feel the same. You don’t breathe
the same way when you watch it. The light is different. We actually took
“Lorna” from LaserDisc and migrated it to a DVD just because it could be
shown that way. We have the original in an archive, but I kept all the
mistakes in — I wanted it to look like it was made then. I think
glitches are the key to discovery. They’re underrated.
