# Trump Defends His Cognitive Testing Results on Fox News. Again.

</div>

The president again tried to defend his own mental fitness for office —
and disparage Joe Biden’s — by frequently repeating a memory sequence:
“Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.”

WASHINGTON — “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.”

President Trump again sought to showcase his mental fitness on
television by reciting, over and over again in an interview broadcast on
Wednesday evening, what he said was a sample cognitive testing sequence.

For the better part of a month, Mr. Trump, 74, has made repeated
appearances on Fox News to brag about acing [a cognitive
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-cognitive-test-health.html)
he said he recently took at Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center, first with [Sean
Hannity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-cognitive-test-health.html)
and again with [Chris
Wallace](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/politics/trump-fox-interview-coronavirus-race.html)
on “Fox News Sunday.” All the while, the White House has not disclosed
details about when the president underwent the testing or why.

During the most recent interview — an appearance with Dr. Marc K.
Siegel, a professor of medicine at New York University and a medical
analyst for Fox News — Mr. Trump tried to defend his own mental fitness
for office by outlining the particulars of the test he said he had
taken, and by questioning the acuity of former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr., 77, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s really something that’s been great,” Mr. Trump said, referring to
being the president. “But you need stamina. You need physical health,
and you need mental health.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then Mr. Trump seemed to offer differing timelines for when he had taken
the test.

First, the president said that he had asked a physician during a
hospital visit “a little less than a year ago” if there was a test he
could take to prove his mental acuity to the news media.

It is unclear when that visit would have occurred: Last month, the White
House released a summary of Mr. Trump’s health, but not an annual
physical report, and did not explain a [highly unusual unannounced
visit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-physical-hydroxychloroquine.html)
last fall to Walter Reed. The summary also did not indicate whether he
had undergone cognitive testing.

Then, Mr. Trump said that he had asked Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, who has not
been his physician since 2018, if there was an acuity test he could
take. That year — after the book [“Fire and
Fury”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/books/review/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-trump-white-house.html)
described some of Mr. Trump’s advisers questioning his fitness for
office — Dr. Jackson said that the president had received a score of 30
out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

That test, also called the
[MOCA](https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-cognitive-test.html), has
been criticized by experts as too blunt an instrument that does not rule
out declines in reasoning or memory, or difficulties with planning or
judgment.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I said to the doctor, it was Dr. Ronny Jackson. I said, ‘Is there some
kind of a test, an acuity test?’” Mr. Trump recalled on Wednesday. “And
he said, ‘There actually is,’ and he named it, whatever it might be.”

Then the president elaborated for several minutes.

“It was 30 to 35 questions,” Mr. Trump said. “The first questions are
very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory
question. It’s, like, you’ll go: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. So they
say, ‘Could you repeat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. It’s: Person. Woman.
Man. Camera. TV.’”

“‘OK, that’s very good. If you get it in order you get extra points,’”
Mr. Trump said a doctor told him. “OK, now he’s asking you other
questions, other questions, and then, 10 minutes, 15, 20 minutes later
they say, ‘Remember that first question — not the first — but the 10th
question? Give us that again. Can you do that again?’”

“And you go: ‘Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV,’” Mr. Trump said. “If you
get it in order, you get extra points.”

“They said nobody gets it in order,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s actually not
that easy, but for me, it was easy. And that’s not an easy question. In
other words, they ask it to you, they give you five names and you have
to repeat ’em. And that’s OK. If you repeat ’em out of order, it’s OK,
but, you know, it’s not as good. But when you go back about 20, 25
minutes later and they say go back to that — they don’t tell you this —
‘Go back to that question and repeat ’em, can you do it?’ And you go:
‘Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.’

“They say, ‘That’s amazing. How did you do that?’” Mr. Trump continued.
“I do it because I have, like, a good memory, because I’m cognitively
there. Now, Joe should take that test, because something’s going on.
And, and, I say this with respect. I mean — going to probably happen to
all of us, right? You know? It’s going to happen.”

Dr. Siegel did not ask follow-up questions.

In an interview broadcast on Sunday, when told that Mr. Biden was chosen
in a Fox poll as the more mentally sound candidate, Mr. Trump disputed
that finding and defended his cognitive test results to Mr. Wallace, who
said he had taken the same test that the president had boasted about
acing. Mr. Wallace pointed out that one of the questions asked to
identify an elephant.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s all misrepresentation,” Mr. Trump said. “Because, yes, the first
few questions are easy, but I’ll bet you couldn’t even answer the last
five questions. I’ll bet you couldn’t. They get very hard, the last five
questions.”

In [another portion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3akO234sQi0) of the
Wednesday interview, he defended his track record as president during
the pandemic, reiterating [a call for Americans to wear
masks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-masks.html)
to combat the coronavirus.

But Mr. Trump appeared to shift away from more sober assessments he has
delivered about the pandemic, which [has killed more than 143,000
Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
by saying that coronavirus testing was “overrated” and “makes us look
bad.”

He then accused Democrats of sounding the alarm over a virus for
political reasons.

“Watch,” Mr. Trump said, “on Nov. 4, everything will open up.”
