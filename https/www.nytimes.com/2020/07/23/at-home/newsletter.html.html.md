# Suggestions, Distractions and Diaries. Our Staff Is an Open Book.

Worry is a drumbeat. Above it, though, there’s a melody: a craving for
distraction and joy, for intimacy, for
serendipity.

Welcome. It’s a funny thing, what’s happening with us, with this growing
community of ours at home and [At Home](http://www.nytimes.com/athome).
We’re anxious about the coming months, about what happens when schools
start or don’t, when the sun stops coming up early and falling late,
when the temperature drops and we can’t be outside so much, can’t eat on
a sidewalk, can’t loll around in a park. Will we be back at work, will
we be still working or looking for work at this tiny desk in the corner
of the bedroom, in the attic, in the living room, in the garage? Will we
still be alone, or alone together? Will we be safer, or less safe?

That worry’s a drumbeat. We attend to it closely. Above it, though,
there’s a melody: a craving for distraction and joy, for intimacy, for
serendipity.

Lately we’ve been finding that in the off-hours work of our colleagues,
and in the notes that they’ve taken recently on life during the pandemic
about what they’ve been reading and listening to and watching, about
what they’ve been doing and how and why. We call these documents [“Notes
From Our Homes to
Yours,”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/at-home/even-more-reporters-editors-diaries-lists-recommendations.html)
and they’re a remarkable collection of observations and recommendations
about living a full and cultured life during the pandemic. I’d urge you
to check them out today.

And when you’re done, please visit us [At
Home](http://www.nytimes.com/athome) for more straightforward advice
about how to deal with life right now, how to manage, how to feed, how
to help. We are as always here to serve. Let us know what you want to
know: <athome@nytimes.com>. See you on Friday.

  - For people who are still working from home for the foreseeable
    future, it is time to stop making excuses and get things around the
    house in order. That can mean [tidying your
    bedroom](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/20/burst/bedroom-organization-tips.html)
    or [upgrading your home
    office](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/realestate/that-home-office-of-yours-it-needs-an-upgrade.html)
    (or setting up a home office if you’ve been trying to survive
    without one). And if your home has amenities you aren’t able to use,
    it’s worth asking if you [still have to pay for
    them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/realestate/gym-playroom-fees-coronavirus.html).

  - Urban centers have proved resilient as centers of innovation, but a
    growing sense that [density is a core issue in our new
    world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-cities.html)
    could lead to a lack of luster for cities once thought of as
    superstars.

  - People often talk about how one day [they’ll write a short
    story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/at-home/coronavirus-fiction-writing.html).
    Curtis Sittenfeld, the best-selling author of “Prep” and “Rodham,”
    thinks the time to start is *now*.

  - When asked for a selection for the “[One Good
    Meal](https://www.nytimes.com/column/one-good-meal?module=inline)”
    series, the textile artist Vanessa Barragão picked [arjamolho, a
    chilled tomato
    soup](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/t-magazine/summer-recipes-arjamolho-soup-vanessa-barragao.html)
    that is healthy, flavorful and, in her opinion, perfect for summer.

  - Marcella Hazan spent years teaching Americans the finer points of
    Italian home cooking. It is easy to picture her as a breakout star
    of quarantine cooking if she’d lived this long, and with [these
    three tomato sauce
    recipes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/dining/marcella-hazan-tomato-sauce-recipe.html),
    she might still get there.

  - And Bill Buford spent more than a decade seeking the heart of French
    cuisine for his new book, “Dirt.” But in quarantine, he just wants
    to make [the perfect
    chicken](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/dining/bill-buford-dirt-book-chicken-recipe.html).
    Pete Wells dug in on Buford’s obsession, and the effect it has had
    on his family and friends. “When they grew up, the boys would almost
    certainly remember when they didn’t have to go to school for months
    and their father kept coming up with new ways to poach a
chicken.”

  - Our friends in Parenting asked a very big question: [How do children
    play, and why does it
    matter.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/parenting/the-state-of-play.html)
    The resulting “State of Play” series is an ambitious dive into how
    kids work that can be a road map for parents everywhere. Ever wonder
    [how a paleontologist would play dinosaurs with your
    kid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/parenting/dinosaur-kids.html)?
    It’s in there.

  - When asked to sum up concerts in a pandemic era of livestreams in
    living rooms, Jon Pareles did not hold back: “[So many good
    intentions, so little
    joy.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/arts/music/livestreams-intimacy.html)”
    He did, however, take the time to put together the [10 best
    quarantine
    concerts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/arts/music/best-quarantine-concerts-livestream.html)
    that you can still stream at home.

  - And while the thought of traveling right now can be intimidating —
    that’s if you’re even allowed to travel — we can help expand your
    worldview a bit. With our “The World Through a Lens” series you can
    travel to Ecuador, [the real home of Panama
    hats](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/travel/panama-hats-ecuador.html);
    and through a [series of
    podcasts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/at-home/coronavirus-travel-podcasts.html)
    you can chart out plenty of other virtual journeys.
