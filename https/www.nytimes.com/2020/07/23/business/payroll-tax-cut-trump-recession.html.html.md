WASHINGTON — President Trump badly wants to cut the payroll tax. Hardly
anyone in Congress shares his enthusiasm.

From the early days of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the United
States, and plunging the economy into a sharp and brutal recession, Mr.
Trump has been pushing Congress to temporarily eliminate the taxes
American workers and their employers pay to help support Social Security
and Medicare. He [pushed such a cut on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237924658185469954)
in March, before lawmakers agreed on the first of what would be several
economic rescue packages passed this year:

This week, as congressional Republicans prepared to introduce a bill
that would serve as their opening bid for negotiations over the next
major economic bill, Mr. Trump told reporters that a payroll tax cut
remained “very important” to the discussions.

“It’s very good,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s been proven to be successful.
It’s a big saving for the people. It’s a tremendous saving, and I
think it’s an incentive for companies to hire their workers back and to
keep their workers.”

Most economists, even conservative ones, do not rank a payroll tax cut
anywhere close to the top of their list for best ways to support and
stimulate the American economy as it struggles to climb out of the
recession. They say it will cost a lot in lost tax revenues, while doing
little to induce hiring — and excluding millions of unemployed workers
from its benefits. A broad cut would heavily benefit people who still
have jobs and are earning six-figure salaries, which is not the group
that is most in need of federal support right now. And it would cross
into the political danger zone around funding for a pair of safety net
programs that remain highly popular with the American
public.

Bowing to political reality, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin,
said Thursday that the first draft of the next rescue package in the
Senate would not include a payroll tax cut. But Mr. Trump remains
enamored with the plan and is expected to continue lobbying for one,
particularly if he wins a second term.

Here’s what the fuss is all about.

## It’s a tax cut for workers and employers

Currently, the federal government imposes a 15.3 percent tax on workers’
wages, which is split evenly between employees and employers. Most of it
goes to fund Social Security. Only earnings below $137,700 are subject
to the part of the tax that supports Social Security; all earnings are
subject to the part of the tax that funds Medicare. Mr. Trump has
proposed suspending the entirety of the payroll tax through the end of
the year.

Congress has already passed a bill this year that delays — but does not
eliminate — the employer side of those taxes, meaning companies will not
have to start paying their liabilities for this year until next year. It
is possible that lawmakers could vote to do the same with the employee
side in their next bill, but that would not be the true “cut” that Mr.
Trump is interested in.

Actually suspending the taxes would cost the government about $400
billion from August through the end of the year, according to estimates
from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Trump’s favorite economist loves it

The biggest champion of the cut outside the White House has been Arthur
B. Laffer, the famed supply-side economist whom Mr. Trump [honored with
the Presidential Medal of
Freedom](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/arthur-laffer-medal-of-freedom.html)
last year. Mr. Laffer touted the cut and its benefits this week in a
call with Mr. Trump and congressional Republican leaders who had
gathered in the Oval Office.

Mr. Laffer’s acolytes, including conservative activists Stephen Moore
and Steve Forbes, have also pushed Mr. Trump to cut payroll taxes. Their
argument is that by reducing the cost of employing someone, and
increasing the amount of money workers take home, the cut will make both
hiring and job-seeking more
attractive.

## Few other economists support the idea, nor do business leaders or congressional Republicans

Other economists point out that the shift in incentives from a temporary
tax cut would be weak, at best. Employers would still have to factor in
the cost of paying the tax starting in January, which is when workers
would have to expect their take-home pay would shrink.

More important, cutting payroll taxes won’t do much for laid-off workers
who have few prospects at a time when 30 million Americans are
unemployed. Economists have warned since March that such a move would
not help those workers.

“They were a bad idea then,” Josh Bivens, director of research at the
liberal Economic Policy Institute, who [first wrote in
opposition](https://www.epi.org/blog/employer-tax-credits-can-be-part-of-the-economic-response-to-covid-19-if-they-finance-direct-benefits-for-workers/)to
Mr. Trump’s payroll tax proposals in the spring, wrote in a direct
message on Twitter this week, “but, since then we’ve lost 14
million-plus jobs, and so we now have 14 million fewer people who would
benefit now from a payroll tax cut than would’ve back in March.” It is,
he said this week, “a bad idea that has aged terribly.”

Business groups also have shown little enthusiasm for the plan. “We can
provide more targeted assistance both to employers, to help maintain
employment, but also to individuals who are unemployed,” Neil Bradley,
the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, told reporters last week. “It is not an issue that
we heard from businesses or state and local chambers as a priority that
would help during this time.”

Mr. Trump had been pushing Republicans to include the tax cut in the
bill they will introduce to kick off the next round of negotiations with
Democrats. But his own party has balked.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, pushed back against the idea in a private Senate Republican
lunch attended by top administration officials on Tuesday, arguing that
direct payments to families, which would probably be sent out in
October, would prove more meaningful to individual voters.

Mr. Grassley expressed a similar sentiment to reporters this week. “I
think that’s going to do more economic good than if we dribble out $30
every paycheck,” he said. “Because people are going to notice it, take
some action as a result.”
