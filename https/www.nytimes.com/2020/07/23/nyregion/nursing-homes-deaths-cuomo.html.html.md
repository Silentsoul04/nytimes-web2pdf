# Blame Spreads for Nursing Home Deaths Even as N.Y. Contains Virus

ALBANY — As New York moves from coronavirus crisis to sustained
recovery, there remains a heartbreaking fact that some are trying to
explore and others seem to be trying to exploit: [Nearly 6,500 people
have
died](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html)of
the virus in nursing homes and other long-term facilities in the state.

Republicans in Washington and elsewhere have attacked Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo for his role in, and response to, those deaths; Mr. Cuomo has
returned fire, accusing his foes of politicizing a human tragedy and
arguing that the blame for the number of deaths lay with infected health
care workers, not his own policies.

The death toll — a figure that surpasses that of [many
states](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases) — has also
inspired questions from Mr. Cuomo’s fellow Democrats, who rule the State
Legislature and have scheduled hearings on the issue next month.

The tension and pain surrounding the topic have bled into the debate
over a related
[bill](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S8835) that is
expected to be passed on Thursday by the Legislature.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The initial goal of the bill’s supporters was to void [a last-minute
provision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/nyregion/nursing-homes-coronavirus-new-york.html),
buried into the state budget just before it was passed in early April,
that gave nursing homes and hospitals broad immunity from lawsuits
stemming from their failure to protect residents from death or sickness
caused by the coronavirus.

But after considerable pushback from the hospital and nursing home
industries, and legal questions about its scope, the legislation that’s
being advanced is far weaker, with the immunity merely narrowed.

“This is just a first step,” said the bill’s lead sponsor, Assemblyman
Ron Kim, of Queens, where [nearly 1,000 nursing homes residents
died](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/covid-19/fatalities_nursing_home_acf.pdf).
“We’re coming back after the hearings to see how we can provide
retroactive justice for anyone who feels like they’ve been wronged.”

The fight over the bill highlights how fraught the issue has become for
Mr. Cuomo and other politicians, as well as nursing home executives, and
how sensitive all involved have been to suggestions that they are to
blame for the deaths.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has pushed back aggressively on
assertions that his administration’s directive of March 25, which
effectively ordered nursing homes to accept coronavirus-positive
patients from hospitals, led to more deaths.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In response to that criticism, the State Health Department released [a
report](https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2020/docs/nh_factors_report.pdf)
that essentially absolved the state of any blame; the report concluded
that “most patients admitted to nursing homes from hospitals were no
longer contagious when admitted and therefore were not a source of
infection.”

Those conclusions did little to stem Republican criticism that the
governor was to blame for thousands of deaths, allegations carried on
Twitter and marked by hashtags like
[\#KillerCuomo](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KillerCuomo).

[In a
letter](https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/letter-to-Cuomo-about-NYSDOH-report-2.pdf)
sent to Mr. Cuomo in July, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana,
the Republican minority whip who is the ranking member of a House
subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis, said the state report was filled
with “blame-shifting, name-calling and half-baked data manipulations.”

Mr. Cuomo said his political enemies were spreading lies and “ludicrous”
accusations.

“It was cheap, it was ugly, it was political, it was Fox News, it was
the haters and it was a lie,” Mr. Cuomo said in [a July 10 radio
interview](https://soundcloud.com/nygovcuomo/governor-cuomo-is-a-guest-on-5),
a day after Mr. Scalise sent his letter. “It’s just a pure lie, not
based on any fact, but they did it for political expediency.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For the families of people who died in nursing homes and assisted living
facilities in New York, the political friction overshadowed the
importance of seeking accountability for deaths that they believe were
preventable.

Many were outraged when the state included the immunity provision in the
budget. Advocates called it among the most restrictive protections
against lawsuits in the country.

“Having liability can cause a facility to be more diligent and prevent
incidents occurring that will cost them money,” said Susan M. Dooha, the
executive director of the Center for Independence of the Disabled. “The
preventive power of liability has been muted.”

Under the budget provision, health care facilities and their employees
were protected from civil or criminal liability for the duration of the
coronavirus emergency, which Mr. Cuomo [declared on
March 7](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-queens.html?searchResultPosition=1)
and is still in force.

The legal immunity did not cover gross negligence or intentional
criminal misconduct, but would most likely cover a variety of other
scenarios, including harm that arose from a shortage in staffing or
protective equipment.

The provision was fought for and celebrated by industry lobbyists like
the Greater New York Hospital Association, which has close ties to
Governor Cuomo and has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to
Democratic campaign committees in Albany in recent months (as well as
lesser amounts to committees for Republicans, who sit in the minority in
both legislative chambers).

Under Mr. Kim’s bill, that immunity would be modified to allow legal
action if it could be argued that a health care facility or health care
professional had failed to prevent a patient from contracting the
coronavirus, or had not tried to safeguard them from infection.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We now know how to prevent and arrange for Covid,” said Mr. Kim, who is
a Democrat. “So we will be able to hold nursing homes
accountable.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The bill will also specify that the immunity clause will “only apply to
Covid-19 related care and treatment.” That will restore a path for
medical malpractice suits unrelated to Covid-19, said Richard Gottfried,
the chairman of the Assembly Health
Committee.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

But opponents quickly pointed to what they consider shortcomings of the
legislation, including a stipulation that the bill would only affect
future cases and would not be applied retroactively — a clause that they
said would hurt those most affected.

“The overreliance, the overacceptance of the industry’s lobbying
efforts, and the credulity that we give to the arguments they make is
what led to a large extent to tragedies for families across the state,”
said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community
Coalition.

Nursing home facilities were encouraged to reach out to lawmakers to
voice their concerns, and the Greater New York Hospital Association sent
legislators a two-page memo on Tuesday outlining its opposition to any
legislative action meant to scale back immunity.

“New York hospitals are deeply committed to caring for New Yorkers to
the best of their abilities at all times, including in a possible
resurgence of Covid-19,” the memo said. “The Legislature should not take
actions to undercut or chill that commitment.”

Industry groups argued that repealing immunity could pose constitutional
issues and open the floodgates to a barrage of retroactive lawsuits
against health care facilities. They said the legislation did not take
into account the broad impact a resurgence of the virus could have on
the way hospitals and nursing homes care for all patients and residents,
not just those ill with the coronavirus.

A surge in cases, for example, could lead to a shortage of health care
workers and strain the supply of personal protective equipment, both of
which could affect the care provided to those not infected with the
virus, they said.

“If the pandemic comes back in full force like it was in April, the
pressures that come up at nursing homes don’t affect only people with
Covid, they affect all the residents that you’re serving,” said Jim
Clyne, chief executive of [LeadingAge New
York](https://www.leadingageny.org/), a group that represents nonprofit
nursing homes.

Campaign finance records show that since mid-March, the Greater New York
Hospital Association has given more than $300,000 to campaign committees
controlled by the Democrats — who rule both chambers of the Legislature
— and Republicans. That haul includes $150,000 to the New York State
Democratic Assembly Democratic Committee and $100,000 to their Senate
Democratic counterparts.

Both Senate and Assembly spokesmen noted, however, the hospital
association had opposed Mr. Kim’s bill, which is sponsored by Senator
Luis Sepulveda in the Senate.

“Contributions do not influence our positions nor will they ever,” said
Michael Whyland, a spokesman for the Assembly.

On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said he could “see the rationale” for allowing
lawsuits on cases that are not coronavirus-related, but said he wanted
to review the entire bill before giving an opinion.

Mr. Kim said he hopes that the Legislature approves a victims
compensation fund at some later date for families of nursing home
victims, a sentiment shared by Mr. Gottfried, who said he still supports
a full repeal of the immunity provision.

But like determinations on what went wrong in the state’s nursing homes,
Mr. Gottfried suggested that sometimes a full reckoning on an issue can
take time.

“Half a loaf is better than none,” Mr. Gottfried said.
