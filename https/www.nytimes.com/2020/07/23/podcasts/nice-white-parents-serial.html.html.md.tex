``Nice White Parents'' is a new podcast from Serial Productions, brought
to you by The New York Times, about the 60-year relationship between
white parents and the public school down the block.

We know American public schools do not guarantee each child an equal
education. Two decades of school reform initiatives have not changed
that. But when Chana Joffe-Walt, a reporter, looked at inequality in
education, she saw that most reforms focused on who schools were
failing: Black and brown kids. But what about who the schools are
serving? In this five-part series, she turns her attention to what is
arguably the most powerful force in our schools: White parents.

A group of parents takes one big step together.

White parents in the 1960s fought to be part of a new, racially
integrated school in Brooklyn. So why did their children never attend?

\textbf{On this series:}

Chana Joffe-Walt is a producer for the award-winning public radio show
``This American Life*,''* where Chana originated her reporting for what
eventually became ``Nice White Parents.'' In 2015, Chana teamed up with
the reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones to do several stories about
\href{https://www.thisamericanlife.org/550/three-miles}{education} and
\href{https://www.thisamericanlife.org/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-one}{school
segregation}, for which they won the Peabody Award. In addition to
education coverage, Chana's reporting on sexual harassment, including
the Rashomon-style ``This American Life*''* episode
''\href{https://www.thisamericanlife.org/640/five-women}{Five Women},''
offered a new frame to understand a wave of \#MeToo stories. ``Five
Women'' is currently being adapted into a TV series. Before joining
``This American Life,'' Chana was a reporter for NPR, where she helped
create the podcast ``Planet Money.''

``Nice White Parents'' was reported by Chana Joffe-Walt; produced by
Julie Snyder; edited by Sarah Koenig, Neil Drumming and Ira Glass;
editorial consulting by Eve L. Ewing and Rachel Lissy; and sound mix by
Stowe Nelson.

The original score for ``Nice White Parents'' was written and performed
by the jazz group The Bad Plus. The band consists of bassist Reid
Anderson, pianist Orrin Evans and drummer Dave King.

Additional music from Matt McGinley, who has contributed music to Serial
Productions podcasts including ``S-Town'' and season three of
``Serial.'' Matt is also the drummer and co-founder of the band Gym
Class Heroes.

Special thanks to Sam Dolnick, Julie Whitaker, Seth Lind, Julia Simon
and Lauren Jackson.
