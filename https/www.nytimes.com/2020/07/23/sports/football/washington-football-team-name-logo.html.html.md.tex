Washington's N.F.L. team will retire Redskins branding and adopt a
placeholder team name until it can decide on a permanent name, the
organization said Thursday, weeks after announcing it would yield to
pressure from sponsors and activists and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html}{drop
the name it has used for nearly 90 years}.

``For updated brand clarity and consistency purposes, we will call
ourselves the `Washington Football Team' pending adoption of our new
name,'' the team said in a news release, adding that the logo would be
retired by the start of the 2020 season in September.

The team also said it would roll out an aesthetic that would reflect the
direction of the new franchise as it changes.

The team's \href{https://twitter.com/WashingtonNFL}{Twitter account} and
\href{https://www.redskins.com/}{official site} on Thursday took on the
temporary name and logo, a large W, though images of the original logo
remained in some places and its web address using the old name remained
unchanged.

The team also tweeted a design for new uniforms, which featured its
existing color scheme and a numeral on its helmet instead of the drawn
profile of a Native American face.

The team advertised forthcoming ``Washington Football Team''
merchandise, and
\href{https://www.redskins.com/team/washingtonfootball}{on its website
shared prototypes} of the temporary logo, uniform concepts and field
designs that included an N.F.L. logo at midfield. The end zones in its
mock field design read ``Washington Football Team, Est. 1932.''

Team officials did not answer messages seeking comment on Thursday. It
was not immediately clear whether fans --- if spectators are allowed at
all during the coronavirus pandemic --- would be allowed to wear
merchandise with the old logo to games. It was also not clear whether
the team would eventually change its distinctive burgundy and gold
colors,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/native-american-washington-name-change.html}{a
move sought by Native American groups} and nearly 150 federally
recognized tribes in a letter sent to N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell
this month.

The team is scheduled to open its season Sept. 13 against the
Philadelphia Eagles.

On July 13,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/sports/football/washington-redskins-nickname-history.html}{10
days after announcing it would review} the 87-year-old team name and
under mounting pressure from corporate sponsors, fans and Native
American activists, the team
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{said
it would drop its logo and the name ``Redskins,''} a term many had long
considered a racial slur.

The team's owner, Daniel Snyder, had previously been uncooperative in
changing the team's name, but said the new name would
``\href{https://www.nfl.com/news/washington-redskins-to-undergo-thorough-review-of-team-s-name}{take
into account} not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise
but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National
Football League and the local community it is proud to represent on and
off the field.''

The name change came after weeks of national unrest following the
killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in late May,
and as much of the country quickly moved to change historical
representations that use racist symbols.

Last month, the Washington franchise spent several days
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/sports/football/redskins-ring-of-fame-marshall.html}{removing
a monument and remembrances honoring its former owner}, George Preston
Marshall, from team facilities and its website. The change came amid
pressure on the team to acknowledge Marshall's resistance to signing and
drafting African-American players and his decision in 1933 to name the
team the ``Redskins.'' A memorial of Marshall, which had stood in front
of R.F.K. Stadium, the team's former arena, was removed by a city agency
after being defaced.

Last week, the team was once again in the spotlight as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/sports/football/washington-sexual-assault-harassment-dan-snyder.html}{15
women said they were sexually harassed} while employed by the team.
