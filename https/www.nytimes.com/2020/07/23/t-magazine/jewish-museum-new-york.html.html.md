IN AMERICA IN the 1960s, the museum that showcased the latest and best
contemporary art was located, predictably enough, in New York, but it
wasn’t the
[Guggenheim](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/t-magazine/adrian-villar-rojas-guggenheim-marian-goodman.html),
the
[Whitney](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/whitney-museum-of-american-art)
or the [Museum of Modern
Art](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/museum-of-modern-art).
Instead, the epicenter of the shock of the new was the modestly endowed
upstart that art-world insiders affectionately called “the Jewish.”

Housed on upper Fifth Avenue in a Renaissance Revival mansion with a
Modernist annex, [the Jewish Museum](https://thejewishmuseum.org/) is
where the dealer [Leo
Castelli](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/arts/leo-castelli-influential-art-dealer-dies-at-91.html)
discovered the work of [Jasper
Johns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/t-magazine/jasper-johns.html),
where the 37-year-old [Robert
Rauschenberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/t-magazine/robert-rauschenberg-endless-combinations.html)
had his initial retrospective and where the 1966 exhibition “Primary
Structures” caught and popularized the cresting wave of Minimalist
sculpture. It was at the Jewish that New York museum audiences were
introduced to such diverse artists as [Mark di

and [Ad Reinhardt](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/ad-reinhardt)
received their first solo museum shows. “It was the most radical place
in New York City, the only place you could see seriously installed
contemporary art,” says the artist [Mel
Bochner](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/t-magazine/mel-bochner.html).
“These shows were groundbreaking and established the possibility of a
future. Important things were being discussed at the [Jewish

that weren’t being said
elsewhere.”

To understand how a museum controlled by the tradition-bound Jewish
Theological Seminary came to spearhead the artistic avant-garde, it is
necessary to appreciate the social status of Jewish Americans in the
postwar years, the minor position of contemporary art at that time and
the role played by a few inspired, ambitious curators. In 1947, the
Jewish Museum expanded out of the seminary’s library annex, which
contained a collection of historic Judaica, and moved into the mansion
given to it by Frieda Schiff Warburg, who was the wife and daughter of
renowned financiers. At the time, the few Jews welcomed as trustees at
elite cultural institutions like the [Metropolitan Museum of
Art](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/metropolitan-museum-of-art)
in New York and the [Art Institute of
Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/art-institute-of-chicago)
came from wealthy, established German Jewish (as opposed to Eastern
European Jewish) families — and like the board members, the art that
those museums collected needed to have passed the test of time. Even the
avowedly “modern” museums in New York hesitated to display the
achievements of young American artists.

Many of the collectors who flocked to the less snobbish and more
affordable precincts of contemporary art were Jewish — among them,
[Robert](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/obituaries/robert-scull-prominent-collector-of-pop-art.html)
and [Ethel
Scull](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/01/arts/ethel-scull-a-patron-of-pop-and-minimal-art-dies-at-79.html),
who ran a New York taxi business and had a preternatural eye for the
contemporary, and
[Frederick](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/13/obituaries/frederick-weisman-82-leader-in-the-business-and-art-worlds.html)
and [Marcia
Weisman](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/arts/marcia-weisman-collector-73-supporter-of-major-art-museums.html),
who lived in Los Angeles and had made a fortune in real estate. Another
enthusiast was [Vera
List](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/nyregion/vera-g-list-94-is-dead-philanthropist-and-collector.html),
the wife of [Albert
List](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/obituaries/albert-a-list-86-industrialist-who-supported-many-causes.html),
a self-made millionaire industrialist of Romanian Jewish heritage who
was on the board of the Jewish Theological Seminary. When Vera proposed
donating a sculpture, “The Procession,” by [Elbert
Weinberg](http://www.elbertweinberg.com/index.html), to the Jewish
Museum in 1957, the trustees hesitated. “The Procession” was a
figurative piece that represented men carrying a Torah and a menorah,
rendered in Modernist angles. Some board members questioned whether the
acquisition was permissible, considering the Second Commandment
prohibition of graven images. Eventually, loath to rebuff the generosity
of a significant benefactor, the board approved the donation.

In 1962, Vera List became the chair of the Jewish Museum’s newly
constituted board of governors, which declared its allegiance to “the
work of younger or otherwise unacknowledged” artists. The senior staff
resigned in protest, but the shift was less abrupt than it might seem,
because Stephen Kayser, the exiting de facto director, had also
championed contemporary art as a way of attracting visitors. For a
10th-anniversary show in 1957, with advice from the distinguished art
historian [Meyer
Schapiro](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/04/us/meyer-schapiro-91-is-dead-his-work-wove-art-and-life.html),
Kayser mounted the far-reaching and farsighted “Artists of the New York
School: Second Generation,” at which Castelli first laid eyes on Johns’s
1955 painting “Green Target.” Intrigued, Castelli visited Johns’s
studio, reacted with messianic fervor to what he was shown and in early
1958, presented the show that launched Johns’s fame and changed the
course of postwar American art. By sparking the interest and sculpture
donation of List, “Artists of the New York School” also altered the
trajectory of the Jewish Museum — and placed it on a path on which it
would help predict and shape the movement of contemporary art for years
to come.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

KAYSER’S DEPARTURE amounted to a change of emphasis and style. A
specialist in Jewish art, he had emigrated from Germany in 1938.
“Stephen Kayser was an old-fashioned gentleman,” recalls Tom
Freudenheim, who was a curator at the museum in the early ’60s. “He
still had his heavy accent. He was of that generation of people who had
a formality about them.” His successor, [Alan R.
Solomon](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/01/archives/alan-r-solomon-19201970.html),
was a Harvard-trained academic and curator who had founded the art
gallery at Cornell University. “Alan Solomon was a quite sophisticated
art historian who, as they say in the art world, happened to be Jewish,”
Freudenheim continued. “He had very, very high standards, and he would
absolutely not yield on them.” As Vera List put it in an oral history at
the [Smithsonian Archives of American Art](https://www.aaa.si.edu/),
Kayser’s shows were “like a whisper,” and when Solomon came in, “he had
much more space, and he wasn’t whispering; he was bellowing.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Solomon served as director for only two years, from July 1962 to July
1964. Despite the brevity of his career, **** he set the museum on its
course. For his debut exhibition, in March 1963, he presented a
Rauschenberg retrospective of paintings, transfer drawings and the
three-dimensional “combines” that melded elements of both painting and
sculpture. He followed with “[Toward a New
Abstraction](https://www.amazon.com/Toward-Abstraction-Heller-Steinberg-Solomon/dp/B000PSXR2A)”
that summer, which provided an overview of hard-edge abstract painting
and included the shaped canvases of [Frank
Stella](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/t-magazine/frank-stella.html)
and the monochromes of [Ellsworth
Kelly](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/t-magazine/ellsworth-kelly-austin-last-work.html).
His 1964 solo show of the 33-year-old Johns was even more magisterial
than the Rauschenberg
exhibition.

But it wasn’t just *what* he showed that would make Solomon a key figure
in reshaping the mission of the modern art museum — it was when and how
he showed it. “That was where Alan was really prescient,” Freudenheim
says. “You might say he was the father of the midcareer retrospective.”
Solomon treated his contemporaries like old masters, applying the most
rigorous expectations to shows of artists who were still in their 30s.
Bochner, who worked as a guard at the museum in the early ’60s, was once
accosted by Solomon in a gallery that was displaying prints by [Marc
Chagall](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/marc-chagall). “He looked
at me and said, ‘That print is crooked,’” Bochner recalls. “I said, ‘I
don’t know, sir, it looks OK to me.’ He had a tape measure in his
pocket. He took it out and measured. It was one-sixteenth of an inch
off. He said very imperiously, ‘Please correct that.’ He put the tape
back in his pocket and walked off.”

Acknowledging what he termed in his foreword to the Johns catalog to be
the museum’s “two- fold policy,” Solomon also staged shows, like ****
the Chagall prints, with a clear Jewish content. He recognized that the
museum was the subsidiary of a seminary. He was even able, in a 1963
show of modern American synagogue architecture, organized by [Richard
Meier](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/richard-meier), to perform
the neat topological trick of combining the contemporary and the Jewish
into one. But the tension between some board members’ interests and
Solomon’s own lingered. In an often told tale, the widow of an eminent
seminary scholar asked at the Rauschenberg opening whether the artist
was a Jew. Told that he was not, she exclaimed, “Thank God\!”

Rauschenberg would be chosen to represent the United States at the
Venice Biennale the following year, in a presentation organized by
Solomon and the Jewish, and would win the show’s grand prize in
painting. But Solomon spent so much time in Italy that the seminary
board lost confidence in him. Nonetheless, the appointment of [Sam
Hunter](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/arts/sam-hunter-curator-and-museum-founder-dies-at-91.html)
as his successor in 1965 only affirmed the museum’s commitment to the
avant-garde. During his tenure, Hunter organized retrospectives of Ad
Reinhardt, Philip Guston and Max Ernst. His signature achievement,
however, was recruiting from MoMA as a senior curator [Kynaston
McShine](https://stories.thejewishmuseum.org/the-jewish-museum-remembers-kynaston-mcshine-1d6741c02815),
the witty, opinionated scion of a distinguished Black Trinidad family,
whose exhibitions would herald some of the most important trends in
contemporary art. McShine was at the Jewish **** from 1965 to 1968 (the
last year as acting director), a break from his otherwise lifelong
tenure at the Modern. But in that short sojourn, he contributed greatly
to the Jewish’s mythology. Inspired by the sizable **** main exhibition
gallery in the new wing, he staged “Large Scale American Paintings” in
the summer of 1967, displaying canvases of 23 American artists,
including [Al
Held](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/t-magazine/art/al-held-brushstroke-drawings.html)’s
truly monumental “Greek Garden,” **** a geometric study in acrylic,
which stretches 56 feet long. (In June 1965, the museum had displayed in
the same room [James
Rosenquist](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/arts/design/james-rosenquist-and-erro-discuss-a-long-friendship-forged-in-pop-art.html)’s
86-foot-long “F-111,” a Pop Art depiction of the titular bomber plane,
and a recent purchase of the Sculls’.) Earlier that year, McShine
mounted the first American museum retrospective of Yves Klein, already a
legend not even five years after his premature
death.

The show for which McShine is best remembered — and which is one of the
most celebrated exhibitions of the late 20th century — is “Primary
Structures: Younger American and British Sculptors,” from 1966. McShine
assembled works by East Coast, California and British sculptors, early
in their careers, who shared what we now call a Minimalist aesthetic.
Here for the first time together were artists like Carl Andre, Donald
Judd, Dan Flavin, [Larry

Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Morris and [Ronald

who used various materials (painted steel or aluminum, colored plastic,
coated glass) in different ways (structured repetition of prefabricated
units, heroically scaled steel) but shared an interest in machine-made
objects, smooth planes of vibrant color and the removal of the sculpture
from a pedestal. “It had tremendous impact because it was really the
first show including those artists,” says the dealer [Paula
Cooper](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/10/11/t-magazine/my-life-in-pictures-paula-cooper/s/paula-cooper-slide-010G.html),
who went on to represent many of the show’s contributors at the
eponymous New York gallery that she founded in 1968. “I think it was the
beginning.”

“Primary Structures” had its eye trained so thoroughly on the future
that it would take years for its importance to be recognized. [Judy
Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/t-magazine/judy-chicago-dinner-party.html),
then known as Judy Gerowitz, exhibited “[Rainbow
Pickett](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/judy-chicago-rainbow-pickett),”
**** a sequence of six brightly painted wooden beams that leaned against
the wall. “I got nowhere with a lot of that big sculpture,” she says.
“My male peers would get picked up and be on the choo-choo train, and
I had to constantly start over again. After a decade and a half of that,
I changed direction.” [Robert
Grosvenor](https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/artists/robert-grosvenor/selected-works),
who installed “Transoxiana,” a 31-foot-high V-shaped sculpture of
painted wood and steel that was destroyed after the exhibition, says the
show “had no impact whatsoever” on his career. For Hunter, too, “Primary
Structures” did little to help his standing at the museum. He was forced
to resign in October 1967.

Hunter’s
[replacement](https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/03/archives/jewish-museum-finds-its-new-director-brooklynborn-karl-katz-in.html),
Karl Katz, who had been a curator at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, had
a reputation as being “open to pretty much anything,” says the curator
Susan Tumarkin Goodman, who in 1970 organized “Using Walls,” with a
group of artists — the roster included [Richard
Artschwager](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/arts/design/richard-artschwager-painter-and-sculptor-dies-at-89.html),
[Lawrence
Weiner](https://www.lissongallery.com/artists/lawrence-weiner), Richard
Tuttle, Sol LeWitt and Bochner — who drew and painted directly onto ****
the museum’s walls. But Katz’s daredevil spirit would also indirectly
end the museum’s improbable run as the primary promoter of the
avant-garde. His 1970 exhibition “Software: Information Technology and
Its New Meaning for Art” was a flawed but visionary look at the impact
of computer science on art. Everything in the show — the exhibitions,
the performing artists — ran on programmed instructions or were issued
from a prescribed system. Those **** artists included [Vito
Acconci](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/design/vito-acconci-dead-performance-artist.html),
[John
Baldessari](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/arts/john-baldessari-dead.html),
[Allan
Kaprow](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/10/arts/design/allan-kaprow-creator-of-artistic-happenings-dies-at-78.html),
[Joseph Kosuth](https://www.skny.com/artists/joseph-kosuth) and [Nam
June
Paik](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/arts/design/nam-june-paik-73-dies-pioneer-of-video-art-whose-work-broke.html),
most of whom were still largely unknown to the general public. The day
before “Software” opened, Katz gave a tour to the seminary chancellor,
Rabbi Louis Finkelstein, and a representative of the Smithsonian, which
wanted to stage the show and therefore defray some of its costs. The
three men viewed Nicholas Negroponte’s installation, “Seek,” in which a
computer-controlled claw moved 2,000 metal-coated plastic cubes of a
maze navigated by gerbils. Then they advanced to a video recording by
Les Levine. As Katz recalls in his memoir, all was fine until they got
to the footage that depicted the artist stark naked in the company of
two equally unclad women. The rabbi sputtered in furious disbelief.

“I think, Mr. Katz, that this is the end,” he said.

And it was. A fire at the Smithsonian, coupled with technical failures
in the challenging show, led to the cancellation of the Smithsonian
showing, and “Software” finished at least $50,000 over budget. The
combination of salaciousness and shortfall was insurmountable, and the
seminary declared it would no longer subsidize a program that was not
“basically Jewish.” Katz submitted his resignation the next
day.

THAT SHOULD HAVE been the final chapter in the museum’s role in the
vanguard. By 1970, Solomon’s program was becoming everybody’s program.
It was no longer risky for prestigious museums to present contemporary
art because, commercially and critically, contemporary art was becoming
prestigious. Two years after returning to MoMA in 1968, McShine mounted
“Information,” a survey of conceptual art that featured such Jewish
Museum exhibition alumni as Andre and Daniel Buren. In 1980, the Whitney
purchased Jasper Johns’s “[Three
Flags](https://whitney.org/collection/works/1060)” for $1 million, a
record at the time for **** a living artist. (A “Flag” painting the size
of a place mat sold at auction in 2014 for $36 million.) In a
generation, contemporary art had gone from being viewed with suspicion
and slight distaste to being an asset, its acquisition an announcement
of both one’s taste and one’s wealth. So, too, had the Jewish’s once
radical commitment to the midcareer retrospective gone from daring to de
rigueur; the show quickly became a museum-menu staple.

Then there was the fact that Jewish people no longer had to start their
own museums. After decades of exclusion, Jews, including those from
Eastern European backgrounds, began joining the boards of the major arts
institutions. Today, Daniel Brodsky is the chair of the Metropolitan,
Leon Black is the chair of MoMA and Leonard Lauder is the chairman
emeritus and éminence grise on the board at the Whitney.

The culture at large had finally caught up with the one the Jewish
Museum had helped create. And yet, improbably, the Jewish had one last
prediction to make. In 1972, the museum appointed as its director [Joy
Ungerleider-Mayerson](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/obituaries/joy-ungerleider-mayerson-74-former-head-of-jewish-museum.html),
a specialist in biblical archaeology. Under her stewardship, the
institution began to concentrate on Jewish themes and Israeli artists;
one of her first tasks as director was to negotiate the acquisition of
600 ancient artifacts from Israel, and one of the major shows during her
tenure, from 1975, was called “Jewish Experience in the Art of the 20th
Century.” The museum went, in other words, from advancing provocative
art to concentrating on identity culture. And viewed that way, the
Jewish Museum was still on the cutting edge. The [Studio
Museum](https://studiomuseum.org/) in Harlem, which exhibits
African-American art, opened in 1968; [El Museo del
Barrio](https://www.elmuseo.org/), which focuses on Latino culture, was
founded the next year. Today, the questions and tensions that surround
and are informed by identity culture — who am I and how do I fit within
the society around me? — also provide an engine for contemporary art
itself.

Under its current director, [Claudia
Gould](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/t-magazine/jane-mayle-claudia-gould.html),
who has a background in contemporary art, the museum straddles its dual
legacies. It continues to mount innovative, sometimes forward-thinking
shows, such as 2018’s survey of [Martha
Rosler](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/t-magazine/martha-rosler.html),
the pioneering feminist and video artist whose politically charged work
from the ’60s feels newly relevant today. With exhibitions like “[Marc
Camille Chaimowicz: Your Place or
Mine](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/t-magazine/marc-camille-chaimowicz.html),”
**** staged **** that same year, the museum looked anew at an artist
whose work had previously been considered decorative. It is, however,
still grappling with internal and external debates over whether the
museum is “too Jewish” or “not Jewish enough.” In 2018, it installed an
ongoing exhibition of Jewish ceremonial objects integrated with artworks
from its **** collection. Some felt the show was facile and unscholarly;
others found **** it adventurous: an effort to interest younger visitors
in objects they might otherwise ignore.

In the summer of 2022, the Jewish Museum will present a survey of the
New York art scene from 1962 to 1964. During these years, [Andy
Warhol](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/t-magazine/andy-warhol-photo-portraits.html)
opened his Factory studio in Midtown, Donald Judd laid out his artistic
philosophy in an essay called “Specific Objects” and Pace Gallery, now
one of the largest in the world, moved from Boston to Manhattan. And
then there was the Jewish Museum itself — pushing the idea of what a
museum could and should be in different and previously unheard-of
directions.
