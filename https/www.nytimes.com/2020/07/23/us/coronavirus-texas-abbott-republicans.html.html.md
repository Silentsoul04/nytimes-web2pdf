DALLAS —
[Texas](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/coronavirus-family-houston-masks.html)
Republicans have long sparred with one another, with feisty internal
disputes in recent years over gun rights, bathroom bills and other
culture-war issues. But since the spring, as [the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) began to
take hold across the state, it has been an all-out battle of red versus
red.

This month, Republican groups in eight counties censured the Republican
governor after he issued a statewide mask order, saying that it
infringed on their rights and followed the lead of Houston, San Antonio
and other Democratic-led cities and counties that already required masks
in businesses.

And on Monday, party activists ousted the chairman of the state party in
favor of an outspoken firebrand conservative who called for President
Barack Obama’s impeachment in 2014 and whose ascension to the top party
post received a [congratulatory tweet from President
Trump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1285196013020610562).

In Texas, the virus has heightened long-simmering friction in the
largest Republican-led state in the country, and for the first time Gov.
Greg Abbott has come under serious attack from within his own party. The
conflict in many ways is not unique to Texas. The rifts in the party run
along some of the same establishment-versus-insurgent fault lines that
years ago defined the rise of the Tea Party and of Mr. Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This has been building for a long, long time,” said State Senator Kel
Seliger, a former mayor of Amarillo who is the second-most senior
Republican in the Texas Senate and has served more than 16 years in
office. “When a party dominates, it also becomes sort of arrogant and
exclusive. It used to be back in the ’80s and ’90s, let’s all get
together in this big Republican tent and be a majority. Increasingly,
we’ve been ushering people out of the tent.”

Indeed, the clash is about more than conservative anger over the
governor’s mask order, and has its roots in the ideological divide
between the right and the far-right in Texas. Some of that same energy
and tension in 2012 helped a lawyer named Ted Cruz who had never held
elected office defeat a powerful Republican lieutenant governor to win a
seat in the U.S. Senate.

As Democrats continue to make gains statewide, archconservatives have
tried pushing Texas further to the right, while more moderate
Republicans try to steer it closer to the center.

More than 130 local Republican leaders in eight counties publicly
rebelled against Mr. Abbott and voted to formally censure him, a
stunning rebuke for a politician who easily won re-election in 2018 and
who until now has been the most popular Republican in the state. The
[censure
votes](https://www.facebook.com/EctorCountyGOP/posts/3251377961614048)
were symbolic expressions of disapproval, largely over his statewide
mask order. An effort to stiffen the punishment for being censured and
to pass a statewide Republican resolution condemning the governor
remains in the
works.

Mr. Abbott, who faces re-election in 2022, was the first Republican
governor of Texas in modern time to be officially reprimanded by a group
of Republican county leaders.

“We feel that Abbott is going overboard in shutting down the economy,”
said Lee Lester, the chairman of the Harrison County Republican Party in
East Texas, one of the eight counties that censured the governor.

Mr. Lester, a retired insurance salesman who lives near the Louisiana
border in a county that has recorded more than 500 coronavirus cases and
nearly 70 deaths, said Mr. Abbott needed to “start acting like we think
he should act, and that is looking at the overall picture — following
the facts, not fear tactics.”

The divide has been evident in and around Fort Worth, the largest
conservative-led city in Texas. Republicans in urban, suburban and rural
Texas disagree on how the government should respond to the virus, and on
whether masks cross a line.

Mayor Betsy Price of Fort Worth, which has seen an explosion of cases in
recent days, expressed empathy rather than criticism for the governor
and was as pro-mask as the Democratic mayors of Houston and other major
cities. “Y’all wear a mask,” Ms. Price, a Republican, said in a recent
public service announcement, through a white mask decorated with the
silhouette of a Texas longhorn, the logo of a city whose nickname is
Cowtown.

“It’s been a very measured approach in Fort Worth, not much knee-jerk
reaction,” she said in an interview. “People are very much afraid, and
when they’re afraid, they tend to be very critical of things.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But nearby in the same county, in the affluent suburb of Colleyville,
Mayor Richard Newton took a more aggressive approach. In April, he
opened restaurants before state rules allowed it, and last month, he
bucked a county mask order. “We just choose not to participate,” Mr.
Newton told reporters at the time.

And in two counties, one to the northeast and one to the southwest of
Fort Worth and Colleyville, the tenor is even more rebellious.
Republican leaders in suburban Denton County and rural Hood County were
among those who passed resolutions against the governor.

The disarray was on full display last weekend at the Republican state
convention, typically a time of unity, networking and chest-thumping
speeches for the dominant party in Texas. In a back-and-forth that
lasted weeks, top Republican elected officials supported meeting
virtually — as the Democrats did earlier this summer — while the party
leadership voted to meet as planned in person in Houston, a Democrat-led
city.

After losing a legal battle, the party gathered for a virtual convention
that was delayed by technical problems. After it resumed, those who were
fed up with the party’s chairman, James Dickey, helped push him out.

The party elected a new chairman, Allen B. West, a former Florida
congressman who was chosen in part by appealing to the anti-Abbott
sentiments over the statewide mask order. [In a video
message](https://youtu.be/cqlkCX1VWUc) to delegates at the San Jacinto
Monument outside Houston, a revered site commemorating the Texas battle
for independence in 1836, he called the moment a “new
battleground.”

“There’s a new battlefield,” he said in the video, “and it’s really not
too much different from what they faced — the despotism, the tyranny,
that we see in the great state of Texas, where we have executive orders
and mandates, people telling us what we can and cannot do, who is
essential and who is not essential. It is time for us to stand up, and

In his own video address to delegates, Mr. Abbott acknowledged the
criticisms over his mask mandate, but defended his actions, his
authority to issue executive orders in emergencies and his dedication to
conservative principles*.*

“I know that many of you do not like the mask requirement,” Mr. Abbott
said [in his
remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DM1SCP8vwU&feature=youtu.be).
“I don’t either. It is the last thing I wanted to do. Actually, the
next to last. The last thing that any of us want is to lock Texas back
down again. We must do all that we can to prevent
that.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Mr. Abbott, who did not respond to a request for an interview, remains
popular with a number of Republican lawmakers and business leaders, and
his supporters say the criticisms are coming from a small but loud wing
of the party and will not amount to a threat to his re-election.

Even so, a Quinnipiac poll released on Wednesday showed that his support
among Republicans, while still strong, had slipped as the spread of the
virus intensified: A quarter of respondents said they disapproved of Mr.
Abbott’s handling of the virus, up from about 10 percent in early June.

At the same time, the governor has faced pressure from many public
health officials and Democratic leaders to do more to stop the rising
tide of infections, hospitalizations and deaths across the state.

“I told the governor’s people this: The virus will force you to take
action, eventually,” said Clay Jenkins, a Democrat who is the top
elected official in Dallas County and who has clashed with Mr. Abbott
over the state response. “The challenge is when the doctors ask you to
take action, go ahead and do it then.” He urged the closure of indoor
dining and a delay in opening schools for in-person
instruction.

Texas has become one of the largest coronavirus hot spots in the
country, and Mr. Abbott, who began opening the state for business on May
1, has struggled to find the best approach to control it. Some
Republicans had urged him to go faster in reopening businesses, and have
pushed him to keep them open despite the spread of the virus.

“There’s just a division between what politically your base is wanting
you to do, and what is the right thing to do,” said Mari Woodlief, a
Republican political consultant in Dallas who worked on the Fort Worth
mayor’s first campaign. “He did the right thing, but it was not what his
base wanted him to do.”

After cases related to bars began to spike, Mr. Abbott ordered them
closed in late June. For weeks, he said the government should not
mandate mask-wearing, and then he reversed course before the Fourth of
July weekend and put in place an order for most Texans.

Among the 25 American counties with the most cases per capita over the
past week, nine are in Texas. That includes not just the populous
counties that include Houston and Dallas, but also smaller counties that
include San Angelo and Corpus Christi. The average daily case total has
exploded to more than 10,000 statewide. In early July, Texas was
averaging about 6,500 new cases daily. At the start of June, the figure
hovered around 1,400.

Leaders in major cities, mostly Democrats, have asked for the power to
impose county or city-specific stay-at-home orders; Mr. Abbott has so
far refused, arguing that such measures should be voluntary. That stance
is common among conservatives in the state, wary of government
intrusions on personal liberty.

Sam Bryant, an Army veteran and Republican from Waxahachie, a solidly
conservative suburb 30 miles south of Dallas, accused Mr. Abbott of
doing the very thing the governor built his political career fighting
against — government overreach.

Mr. Bryant, 38, a member of the governing board of the Republican Party
of Texas until he left in frustration a few days ago, said he had
already decided not to run for another term because the board was full
of “a lot of establishment do-nothings.”

“I just think what’s happened is the party has lost its ability to
deliver its message,” said Mr. Bryant, who cheered Mr. West’s takeover
as chairman. “Why don’t we just disband the whole thing and start from
scratch?”
