# Trump Moves to Roll Back Obama Program Addressing Housing Discrimination

The move coincides with efforts by the president’s re-election campaign

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Thursday to eliminate an
Obama-era program intended to combat racial segregation in suburban
housing, saying it amounted to federal overreach into local communities.

The rule, introduced in 2015, requires cities and towns to identify
patterns of discrimination, implement corrective plans and report
results. The administration’s decision to complete a process of
rescinding it culminates a yearslong campaign to gut the rule by
conservative critics and members of the administration who claimed it
overburdened communities with complicated regulations.

A new rule, which removes the Obama administration’s requirements for
localities, will become effective 30 days after it is published in the
Federal Register.

The move comes as President Trump’s re-election campaign contends with
waning support among white suburban voters, particularly suburban women.
The decision to eliminate the rule [echoes the president’s recent
efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-obama-housing-discrimination.html)
to appeal to white grievances as he seeks to maintain support in
suburbs.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Within hours of the announcement by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing
and urban development, Mr. Trump promoted his position on Twitter,
[posting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1286372175117791236?s=20)
a New York Post [opinion
article](https://nypost.com/2020/07/21/joe-bidens-disastrous-plans-for-americas-suburbs/)
attacking the Obama housing rule and former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, for
supporting it.

“The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article,” Mr. Trump
said. “Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I
will preserve it, and make it even better\!”

Mr. Trump had signaled last month that he was considering a full
rollback of the rule. In a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1278136326647406593?lang=en),
he wrote that the program had a “devastating impact on these once
thriving Suburban areas.” He added, “Corrupt Joe Biden wants to make
them MUCH
WORSE.”

A spokesman for the Biden campaign called the elimination of the rule a
distraction from the president’s handling of the coronavirus. Mr. Biden
has proposed a housing policy that some Republicans say would undercut
traditional suburban neighborhoods of single-family homes.

The Obama administration introduced its rule in 2015 to enforce the 1968
Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination among housing
providers. Failure to comply with the new rule jeopardized federal
funds, and opponents claimed that it intruded upon the right of
localities to make decisions about their own neighborhoods.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Carson has been a vocal opponent of the rule since his 2016
presidential bid. After he became housing secretary, the former
neurosurgeon [announced
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/upshot/trump-delays-hud-fair-housing-obama-rule.html)
to suspend the program in January 2018, citing concerns raised by cities
that struggled to comply with its requirements. He claimed that he would
delay its resumption until communities had the necessary tools.

Two years later, the department published a proposal that would water
down the original rule by eliminating the original mandate that cities
and towns address housing discrimination.

A study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
found that under the Obama rule, municipalities proposed more ambitious
fair housing goals. Justin Steil, a co-author of the study, said that
the program initially faced some difficulties, including complaints from
localities that its requirements were onerous, but that those issues
could have been resolved with time.

The elimination of the Obama-era rule is one of several efforts by the
housing department to roll back housing regulations. It announced in
August a proposal that would make it more difficult to prove some
discrimination cases — those known as disparate impact claims — under
the Fair Housing Act by establishing a higher bar of proof.

The new and final replacement for the Obama-era program, called
Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice, broadly reinterpreted the
meaning of “affirmatively furthering fair housing.” Now, it makes no
mention of segregation.

The housing department and the Office of Management and Budget waived
the comment period for the new rule to speed its enactment, which raised
concern among critics of the administration’s decision.

They argued that the old rule’s elimination had killed the first effort
in decades to ensure the protections afforded by the Fair Housing Act.
Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition,
said the Trump administration was exploiting the political ramifications
of a racially motivated policy change to boost his re-election campaign.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shaun Donovan, the former housing secretary who created the Obama
administration policy, was scathing in his criticism of the Trump
administration’s move.

“This is a blatantly racist appeal to and attempt to return us to an era
when the federal government actively implemented racist policies based
on the false notion that Black families moving to white communities
brings down property values,” said Mr. Donovan, who is now running for
mayor of New York City.

The move to end the program also comes amid monthslong protests against
racism spurred by the death of George Floyd. The disparity in
homeownership between Black and white households is [the highest it has
been in 50
years](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/explaining-black-white-homeownership-gap-closer-look-disparities-across-local-markets/view/full_report).

This new rule “will take us backwards,” said Debby Goldberg, a vice
president at the National Fair Housing Alliance. “If you’re looking to
tackle the problem of segregation and widespread systemic discrimination
— if you're looking to create a prosperous country where that prosperity
is shared by everybody — then adopting this rule is 100 percent the
wrong move to make.”

But in his announcement on Thursday, Dr. Carson called the old rule “a
ruse for social engineering under the guise of
desegregation.”
