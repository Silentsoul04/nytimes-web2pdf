Welcome. A couple of newsletters ago I asked you to tell us how you were
doing, and how we might help. That’s a central tenet of our world here
[At Home](http://www.nytimes.com/athome), where we seek to make life a
little more bearable, a little fuller, a little more interesting, even
as the pandemic continues to swirl and we find ourselves at home more
than perhaps ever before.

The responses were revealing: We’re not having much fun, any of us, and
we’re worried for the fall. We have a lot of questions about that. I
thought I’d take on one today and more in the coming ones:

> *What we struggle with is excessive screen time for online learning
> and work calls. When we need a mental escape, we watch movies. It’s
> getting to the point that we don’t want to conference call with
> friends and family because we are burned out. What is the
> refresher-reset for this? A book? Staring at a wall?*

It might be a book, but I find at the end of a day of screen time that
sometimes books are hard to read. The letters swim around. I find myself
trying to click on words. It’s easier to stare at the wall. (Staring at
a wall can be an interesting practice. Concentrate on your breathing.
It’s meditation.) In truth, though, the best reset I’ve found is to
use your telephone to make an actual telephone call. This removes the
weird technological newness of video technology (“You’re on mute\!”) and
returns you to high school, when you could easily talk with a friend for
an hour. I emerge from those calls refreshed and ready for another day
of screens.

More good advice for living a good life at home right now is below.
Please let us know what you’d like to know:
<athome@nytimes.com>.

    Famous”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/movies/almost-famous-anniversary-golden-god-scene.html)
    and many of the key players sat down to discuss a movie that
    celebrated a long-ago era, but became something of a classic in and
    of itself.
