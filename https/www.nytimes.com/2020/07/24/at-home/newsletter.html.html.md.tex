You}\label{a-telephone-is-your-friend-but-a-tablet-can-betray-you}}

A reader wants to know how screen breaks should work when our mental
escapes also come via screens.

Welcome. A couple of newsletters ago I asked you to tell us how you were
doing, and how we might help. That's a central tenet of our world here
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/athome}{At Home}, where we seek to make
life a little more bearable, a little fuller, a little more interesting,
even as the pandemic continues to swirl and we find ourselves at home
more than perhaps ever before.

The responses were revealing: We're not having much fun, any of us, and
we're worried for the fall. We have a lot of questions about that. I
thought I'd take on one today and more in the coming ones:

\begin{quote}
\emph{What we struggle with is excessive screen time for online learning
and work calls. When we need a mental escape, we watch movies. It's
getting to the point that we don't want to conference call with friends
and family because we are burned out. What is the refresher-reset for
this? A book? Staring at a wall?}
\end{quote}

It might be a book, but I find at the end of a day of screen time that
sometimes books are hard to read. The letters swim around. I find myself
trying to click on words. It's easier to stare at the wall. (Staring at
a wall can be an interesting practice. Concentrate on your breathing.
It's meditation.) In truth, though, the best reset I've found is to use
your telephone to make an actual telephone call. This removes the weird
technological newness of video technology (``You're on mute!'') and
returns you to high school, when you could easily talk with a friend for
an hour. I emerge from those calls refreshed and ready for another day
of screens.

More good advice for living a good life at home right now is below.
Please let us know what you'd like to know:

  It has been
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/movies/almost-famous-anniversary-golden-god-scene.html}{20
  years since the release of ``Almost Famous''} and many of the key
  players sat down to discuss a movie that celebrated a long-ago era,
  but became something of a classic in and of itself.

  While some zoos and aquariums are opening up for the summer --- at
  least in a limited capacity --- the pandemic has created a huge
  resource of
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/arts/design/zoos-aquariums-virtual-virus.html}{virtual
  options for visiting with animals} you may never have seen otherwise.
  We did a dive into the options available, many of which are free of
  charge.
\item
  Our culture writers were asked to come up with
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html}{eight
  things you should do this weekend}. One of their suggestions is to
  check out the work of the sketch group Model Majority that imagined
  what it would look like if networks retrieved old hits from their
  archives and recast them with Asian-American actors.
\item
  This
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/arts/music/playlist-taylor-swift-j-cole-drake.html}{week's
  playlist} has a new track from Taylor Swift --- who, at 30, appears to
  have officially grown up. If you'd rather laugh than dance, we picked
  out
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/arts/comedy-funny-podcasts.html}{seven
  podcasts} that can lighten the mood.

  Ronda Kaysen realizes
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/realestate/pandemic-housekeeping.html}{her
  home is not what it used to be} in terms of tidiness, but with no one
  coming over any time soon, she openly wondered if that matters. One
  option to getting things in order, of course, is to move, and
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/style/moving-during-covid-coronavirus.html}{Hannah
  Wise answered questions} about the realities of such a decision. And
  we checked in with
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/coronavirus-quick-escapes-nyc.html}{five
  New Yorkers who escaped the city}, asking them the big question: Was
  it worth it?
\item
  Facing what they see as a crisis in the education system, and
  unsatisfactory answers from their schools, some parents have formed

  pods} to educate kids at home. One benefit of virtual learning? A
  chance to reset and reduce

  and teen drama}.
\item
  And in good news for large bags of chips that have so often been
  vilified, a study has shown that all of the sitting involved in a
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/well/move/the-lightness-of-being-a-couch-potato-may-work-to-keep-us-fat.html}{couch
  potato lifestyle} may actually be tricking our bodies into thinking
  they need to gain weight. Could the chips be innocent?!
