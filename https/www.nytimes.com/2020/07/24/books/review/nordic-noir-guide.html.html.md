<div class="css-53u6y8">

What, exactly, is Scandinavian noir? They’re thrillers with a few things
in common — an almost dour sensibility, a belief that political issues
are the bedrock of modern crime fiction. They often feature bleak, snowy
settings and what seem to be rather morose police detectives. If you’re
looking for a dark, chilly read, pluck one from this list.

## Denmark

**Jussi Adler-Olsen**  
One of Denmark’s most popular crime authors, Adler-Olsen brings great
inventiveness to the depiction of sadistic brutality in his disturbing
Department Q novels.  
**Must Read** “The Absent One”

**Sara Blaedel**  
Her best-known series is about a Danish homicide detective, Louise Rick
(a housebroken Lisbeth Salander), who often takes up the cause of
marginalized women in her cases.  
**Must Read** “The Midnight Witness”

**Leif Davidsen**  
The foreign correspondent’s trenchant novels offer an intrigue-filled
look at European politics.  
**Must Read** “The Russian Singer”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Soren and Lotte Hammer**  
This brother-and-sister writing team delivers a solid series about the
melancholy homicide chief at the Copenhagen Police Department.  
**Must Read** “The Vanished”

**Peter Hoeg**  
It wasn’t Stieg Larsson who sparked Americans’ current love affair with
Nordic crime novels. It was Hoeg, whose Greenland-set crime thriller
“Smilla’s Sense of Snow” became a surprise best seller when it was
translated into English in 1993.  
**Must Read** “Smilla’s Sense of Snow”

**Lene Kaaberbol and Agnete Friis**  
Their disturbing novels, all exposés of social injustice, are led by the
righteous Red Cross nurse Nina Borg.  
**Must Read** “The Boy in the Suitcase”

**Soren Sveistrup**  
Sveistrup, the creator of the Danish crime show “The Killing,” has
written only one book, a graphic, gruesome police procedural about a
body-part-collecting serial killer.  
**Must Read** “The Chestnut
Man”

</div>

</div>

## Finland

**Kati Hiekkapelto**  
Her novels are a bracing mix of crime and social commentary, but what
sets Hiekkapelto apart are her narratives, a dizzying blend of twists,
switchbacks and turns.  
**Must Read** “The Defenceless”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Matti Joensuu**  
Joensuu, a Finnish cop, wrote beloved, fantasy-laced books starring
Detective Sgt. Timo Harjunpaa of the Helsinki Police Department’s
violent crimes unit.  
**Must Read** “The Priest of Evil”

**Leena Lehtolainen**  
In Lehtolainen’s edgy series, the personal life of cop-turned-lawyer
Maria Kallio keeps interfering with the crimes she’s trying to solve.  
**Must Read** “Copper Heart”

**Jarkko Sipila**  
Not many volumes of Sipila’s biting, dry Helsinki Homicide series have
been translated into English, but the ones that have are excellent.  
**Must Read** “Against the Wall”

**Antti Tuomainen**  
You don’t expect to laugh when you’re reading about terrible crimes, but
that’s what you’ll do when you pick up one of Tuomainen’s decidedly
quirky thrillers.  
**Must Read** “The Man Who
Died”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Iceland

**Viktor Ingolfsson**  
In his best books, set in remote parts of Iceland, Ingolfsson weaves in
strands of history, folklore and sociology; you’ll learn how to collect
eiderdown from duck nests and gather kittiwake eggs.  
**Must Read** “The Flatey Enigma”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Steinar Bragi**  
Bragi’s psychological thrillers, tinged with an almost Lovecraftian
sense of horror, are as much about the ills of contemporary society as
they are about individual crimes.  
**Must Read** “The Ice Lands”

**Arnaldur Indridason**  
Loss and abandonment bedevil Indridason’s detective, Erlendur Sveinsson,
who is haunted by the childhood disappearance of his younger brother in
a snowstorm.  
**Must Read** “Arctic Chill”

**Ragnar Jonasson**  
Although he specializes in classically crafted whodunits, Jonasson has a
gift for describing his starkly beautiful Icelandic settings.  
**Must Read** “Snowblind”

**Yrsa Sigurdardottir**  
Like many of her fellow Scandinavian writers, Sigurdardottir has created
a memorably depressed police detective.  
**Must Read** “The Day Is
Dark”

</div>

</div>

## Norway

**Samuel Bjork**  
Books by Bjork — the pen name of the Norwegian novelist, playwright and
singer-songwriter Frode Sander Oien — check all the Scandinavian noir
boxes. The real pleasure comes from deciphering their plots, which are
as deviously tricky as a 500-piece puzzle.  
**Must Read** “I’m Traveling Alone”

**Thomas Enger**  
In his series, Enger follows the high-octane exploits of an
investigative journalist named Henning Juul, who gets involved in some
of the best chase scenes ever written.  
**Must Read** “Burned”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Karin Fossum**  
Fossum writes suspense novels on abnormal-psychology themes, but in a
perversely delicate style that brings Ruth Rendell to mind.  
**Must Read** “Black Seconds”

**Anne Holt**  
This author and former minister of justice — best known for procedurals
that are written with an easy, unforced style — has created one of the
genre’s most memorable detectives, a prickly police officer named Hanne
Willhelmsen.  
**Must Read** “1222”

**Jorn Lier Horst**  
Horst, a former Norwegian police detective, is often compared to
Sweden’s Henning Mankell for his moody, sweeping crime dramas.  
**Must Read** “Closed for Winter”

**Jo Nesbo**  
The best-known novels from this Norwegian rock star-turned-crime writer
feature Harry Hole, a macho homicide cop in perennial pursuit of
foaming-at-the-mouth psychopaths.  
**Must Read** “The Redbreast”

**Pernille Rygg**  
In Rygg’s atmospheric yet delightfully offbeat thrillers, a young
scientist becomes an amateur sleuth after the unexpected death of her
father.  
**Must Read** “The Butterfly Effect”

**Gunnar Staalesen**  
Staalesen isn’t very well known in this country, which is a shame, since
his series, starring the hard-boiled Bergen detective Varg Veum (whose
name in Old Norse means “the outlaw”), is as searing and gripping as
they come.  
**Must Read** “Wolves at the
Door”

## Sweden

**Karin Alvtegen**  
A personal tragedy led Alvtegen — the great-niece of Astrid Lindgren, of
“Pippi Longstocking” fame — to pick up a pen for the first time.
(“Finding the ability to write felt similar to have suddenly
discovered a secret room in which I had never been before,” she has
said.)  
**Must Read** “Missing”

**Arne Dahl**  
Jan Arnald, a Swedish literary critic and novelist, writes the grisly
but blackly comic Intercrime novels — about a team of Swedish
investigators — under the name Arne Dahl. **Must Read** “Misterioso”

**M.T. Edvardsson**  
Best known as a Y.A. author in Sweden, Edvardsson has had only one book
translated into English: “A Nearly Normal Family,” the story of an
18-year-old girl who’s been accused of murder.  
**Must Read** “A Nearly Normal Family”

**Kerstin Ekman**  
In Ekman’s powerful, evocative novels, the brooding landscapes become
characters in their own right.  
**Must Read** “Blackwater”

**Kjell Eriksson**  
While Scandinavian thriller writers are famously unemotional, Eriksson’s
police procedurals demonstrate extraordinary compassion for those caught
up in serious crimes.  
**Must Read** “The Cruel Stars of the Night”

**Camilla Grebe**  
Though she sometimes teams up with her sister Asa Traff to write novels,
Grebe’s best books — the slow-burn ones starring the profiler Hanne
Lagerlind-Schon — are her own.  
**Must Read** “After She’s Gone”

**Lars Kepler**  
The husband-and-wife team behind Kepler — Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril and
Alexander Ahndoril — has a taste for the macabre and a surefire recipe
for the lurid serial-killer thriller.  
**Must Read** “The Sandman”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Jens Lapidus**  
His Stockholm Trilogy is a good old-fashioned gangster story about the
godfathers of Sweden’s criminal underworld.  
**Must Read** “Easy Money”

**Stieg Larsson**  
He revived the craze for Scandinavian mystery with “The Girl With the
Dragon Tattoo,” and his political paranoia and sadomasochistic
sensibilities continue to influence the genre.  
**Must Read** “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”

**Henning Mankell**  
Outside of Larsson, Mankell is probably Sweden’s best-known crime
novelist; his philosophical police procedurals feature the gloomy
homicide detective Kurt Wallander.  
**Must Read** “Faceless Killers”

**Hakan Nesser**  
His novels, set in a made-up country with a vaguely Swedish coastline,
feature a cerebral chief inspector given to brooding on abstract
concepts of good and evil while solving un-Swedish crimes like ax
murders.  
**Must Read** “Borkmann’s Point”

**Roslund & Hellstrom**  
Anders Roslund and Borge Hellstrom, the authors behind this pen name,
have a knack for transforming social scourges into taut, gritty
thrillers.  
**Must Read** “Box 21”

**Emelie Schepp**  
In her trilogy about an aloof and unlikable public prosecutor with a
hidden past, Schepp takes on such thorny issues as class prejudice,
exploitation and broken trust.  
**Must Read** “Marked for Life”

**Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo**  
Their widely translated police procedurals, about a dedicated cop named
Martin Beck, introduced an international readership to the progressive
socialism of Swedish society in the 1960s and ’70s.  
**Must Read** “The Laughing Policeman”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Johan Theorin**  
Theorin, a journalist and author, improvises on the traditional recipe
for Nordic thrillers by adding generous sprinklings of folklore and the
supernatural.  
**Must Read** “Echoes From the Dead”

**Helene Tursten**  
When it comes to Scandinavian fiction, as Tursten shows, the women can
be every bit as bloodthirsty as the men.  
**Must Read** “An Elderly Lady Is Up to No Good”
