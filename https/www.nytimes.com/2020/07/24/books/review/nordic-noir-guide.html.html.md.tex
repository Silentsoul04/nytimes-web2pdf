What, exactly, is Scandinavian noir? They're thrillers with a few things
in common --- an almost dour sensibility, a belief that political issues
are the bedrock of modern crime fiction. They often feature bleak, snowy
settings and what seem to be rather morose police detectives. If you're
looking for a dark, chilly read, pluck one from this list.

\hypertarget{denmark}{%
\subsection{Denmark}\label{denmark}}

\textbf{Jussi Adler-Olsen}\\
One of Denmark's most popular crime authors, Adler-Olsen brings great
inventiveness to the depiction of sadistic brutality in his disturbing
Department Q novels.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Absent One''

\textbf{Sara Blaedel}\\
Her best-known series is about a Danish homicide detective, Louise Rick
(a housebroken Lisbeth Salander), who often takes up the cause of
marginalized women in her cases.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Midnight Witness''

\textbf{Leif Davidsen}\\
The foreign correspondent's trenchant novels offer an intrigue-filled
look at European politics.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Russian Singer''

\textbf{Soren and Lotte Hammer}\\
This brother-and-sister writing team delivers a solid series about the
melancholy homicide chief at the Copenhagen Police Department.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Vanished''

\textbf{Peter Hoeg}\\
It wasn't Stieg Larsson who sparked Americans' current love affair with
Nordic crime novels. It was Hoeg, whose Greenland-set crime thriller
``Smilla's Sense of Snow'' became a surprise best seller when it was
translated into English in 1993.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Smilla's Sense of Snow''

\textbf{Lene Kaaberbol and Agnete Friis}\\
Their disturbing novels, all expos√©s of social injustice, are led by the
righteous Red Cross nurse Nina Borg.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Boy in the Suitcase''

\textbf{Soren Sveistrup}\\
Sveistrup, the creator of the Danish crime show ``The Killing,'' has
written only one book, a graphic, gruesome police procedural about a
body-part-collecting serial killer.\\

\hypertarget{finland}{%
\subsection{Finland}\label{finland}}

\textbf{Kati Hiekkapelto}\\
Her novels are a bracing mix of crime and social commentary, but what
sets Hiekkapelto apart are her narratives, a dizzying blend of twists,
switchbacks and turns.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Defenceless''

\textbf{Matti Joensuu}\\
Joensuu, a Finnish cop, wrote beloved, fantasy-laced books starring
Detective Sgt. Timo Harjunpaa of the Helsinki Police Department's
violent crimes unit.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Priest of Evil''

\textbf{Leena Lehtolainen}\\
In Lehtolainen's edgy series, the personal life of cop-turned-lawyer
Maria Kallio keeps interfering with the crimes she's trying to solve.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Copper Heart''

\textbf{Jarkko Sipila}\\
Not many volumes of Sipila's biting, dry Helsinki Homicide series have
been translated into English, but the ones that have are excellent.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Against the Wall''

\textbf{Antti Tuomainen}\\
You don't expect to laugh when you're reading about terrible crimes, but
that's what you'll do when you pick up one of Tuomainen's decidedly
quirky thrillers.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Man Who Died''

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/26/books/review/26ScandinavianNoir-03/26ScandinavianNoir-03-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

\hypertarget{iceland}{%
\subsection{Iceland}\label{iceland}}

\textbf{Viktor Ingolfsson}\\
In his best books, set in remote parts of Iceland, Ingolfsson weaves in
strands of history, folklore and sociology; you'll learn how to collect
eiderdown from duck nests and gather kittiwake eggs.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Flatey Enigma''

\textbf{Steinar Bragi}\\
Bragi's psychological thrillers, tinged with an almost Lovecraftian
sense of horror, are as much about the ills of contemporary society as
they are about individual crimes.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Ice Lands''

\textbf{Arnaldur Indridason}\\
Loss and abandonment bedevil Indridason's detective, Erlendur Sveinsson,
who is haunted by the childhood disappearance of his younger brother in
a snowstorm.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Arctic Chill''

\textbf{Ragnar Jonasson}\\
Although he specializes in classically crafted whodunits, Jonasson has a
gift for describing his starkly beautiful Icelandic settings.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Snowblind''

\textbf{Yrsa Sigurdardottir}\\
Like many of her fellow Scandinavian writers, Sigurdardottir has created
a memorably depressed police detective.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Day Is Dark''

\hypertarget{norway}{%
\subsection{Norway}\label{norway}}

\textbf{Samuel Bjork}\\
Books by Bjork --- the pen name of the Norwegian novelist, playwright
and singer-songwriter Frode Sander Oien --- check all the Scandinavian
noir boxes. The real pleasure comes from deciphering their plots, which
are as deviously tricky as a 500-piece puzzle.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``I'm Traveling Alone''

\textbf{Thomas Enger}\\
In his series, Enger follows the high-octane exploits of an
investigative journalist named Henning Juul, who gets involved in some
of the best chase scenes ever written.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Burned''

\textbf{Karin Fossum}\\
Fossum writes suspense novels on abnormal-psychology themes, but in a
perversely delicate style that brings Ruth Rendell to mind.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Black Seconds''

\textbf{Anne Holt}\\
This author and former minister of justice --- best known for
procedurals that are written with an easy, unforced style --- has
created one of the genre's most memorable detectives, a prickly police
officer named Hanne Willhelmsen.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``1222''

\textbf{Jorn Lier Horst}\\
Horst, a former Norwegian police detective, is often compared to
Sweden's Henning Mankell for his moody, sweeping crime dramas.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Closed for Winter''

\textbf{Jo Nesbo}\\
The best-known novels from this Norwegian rock star-turned-crime writer
feature Harry Hole, a macho homicide cop in perennial pursuit of
foaming-at-the-mouth psychopaths.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Redbreast''

\textbf{Pernille Rygg}\\
In Rygg's atmospheric yet delightfully offbeat thrillers, a young
scientist becomes an amateur sleuth after the unexpected death of her
father.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Butterfly Effect''

\textbf{Gunnar Staalesen}\\
Staalesen isn't very well known in this country, which is a shame, since
his series, starring the hard-boiled Bergen detective Varg Veum (whose
name in Old Norse means ``the outlaw''), is as searing and gripping as
they come.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Wolves at the Door''

\hypertarget{sweden}{%
\subsection{Sweden}\label{sweden}}

\textbf{Karin Alvtegen}\\
A personal tragedy led Alvtegen --- the great-niece of Astrid Lindgren,
of ``Pippi Longstocking'' fame --- to pick up a pen for the first time.
(``Finding the ability to write felt similar to have suddenly discovered
a secret room in which I had never been before,'' she has said.)\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Missing''

\textbf{Arne Dahl}\\
Jan Arnald, a Swedish literary critic and novelist, writes the grisly
but blackly comic Intercrime novels --- about a team of Swedish
investigators --- under the name Arne Dahl. \textbf{Must Read}
``Misterioso''

\textbf{M.T. Edvardsson}\\
Best known as a Y.A. author in Sweden, Edvardsson has had only one book
translated into English: ``A Nearly Normal Family,'' the story of an
18-year-old girl who's been accused of murder.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``A Nearly Normal Family''

\textbf{Kerstin Ekman}\\
In Ekman's powerful, evocative novels, the brooding landscapes become
characters in their own right.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Blackwater''

\textbf{Kjell Eriksson}\\
While Scandinavian thriller writers are famously unemotional, Eriksson's
police procedurals demonstrate extraordinary compassion for those caught
up in serious crimes.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Cruel Stars of the Night''

\textbf{Camilla Grebe}\\
Though she sometimes teams up with her sister Asa Traff to write novels,
Grebe's best books --- the slow-burn ones starring the profiler Hanne
Lagerlind-Schon --- are her own.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``After She's Gone''

\textbf{Lars Kepler}\\
The husband-and-wife team behind Kepler --- Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril
and Alexander Ahndoril --- has a taste for the macabre and a surefire
recipe for the lurid serial-killer thriller.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Sandman''

\textbf{Jens Lapidus}\\
His Stockholm Trilogy is a good old-fashioned gangster story about the
godfathers of Sweden's criminal underworld.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Easy Money''

\textbf{Stieg Larsson}\\
He revived the craze for Scandinavian mystery with ``The Girl With the
Dragon Tattoo,'' and his political paranoia and sadomasochistic
sensibilities continue to influence the genre.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo''

\textbf{Henning Mankell}\\
Outside of Larsson, Mankell is probably Sweden's best-known crime
novelist; his philosophical police procedurals feature the gloomy
homicide detective Kurt Wallander.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Faceless Killers''

\textbf{Hakan Nesser}\\
His novels, set in a made-up country with a vaguely Swedish coastline,
feature a cerebral chief inspector given to brooding on abstract
concepts of good and evil while solving un-Swedish crimes like ax
murders.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Borkmann's Point''

\textbf{Roslund \& Hellstrom}\\
Anders Roslund and Borge Hellstrom, the authors behind this pen name,
have a knack for transforming social scourges into taut, gritty
thrillers.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Box 21''

\textbf{Emelie Schepp}\\
In her trilogy about an aloof and unlikable public prosecutor with a
hidden past, Schepp takes on such thorny issues as class prejudice,
exploitation and broken trust.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Marked for Life''

\textbf{Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo}\\
Their widely translated police procedurals, about a dedicated cop named
Martin Beck, introduced an international readership to the progressive
socialism of Swedish society in the 1960s and '70s.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``The Laughing Policeman''

\textbf{Johan Theorin}\\
Theorin, a journalist and author, improvises on the traditional recipe
for Nordic thrillers by adding generous sprinklings of folklore and the
supernatural.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``Echoes From the Dead''

\textbf{Helene Tursten}\\
When it comes to Scandinavian fiction, as Tursten shows, the women can
be every bit as bloodthirsty as the men.\\
\textbf{Must Read} ``An Elderly Lady Is Up to No Good''
