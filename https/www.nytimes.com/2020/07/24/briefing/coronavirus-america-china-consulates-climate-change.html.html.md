## U.S. passes four million cases

The U.S. [passed four
million](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu#link-39da89b8)
known coronavirus cases on Thursday, the world’s highest number. The
numbers of daily hospitalizations and deaths are also rising.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Public health experts have warned that the actual number of people
infected is far higher than the number of reported cases and could be
[up to 13 times as high in some
regions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html).

California and Texas are among the states setting daily records for new
infections. More than 143,000 people have died in the U.S.

**Spain reopening:** New coronavirus cases have [quadrupled in Spain
since it lifted a strict lockdown in
June](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-reopening.html),
and thousands in various areas are returning to temporary lockdowns.
This time, the focus is on younger people and the risk that they are
unwittingly spreading the virus.

**In other news:**

  - **Romania** [reimposed
    restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu#link-7aa50c66)
    after daily new infections rose above 1,000.

  - **Belgium’s** prime minister issued [broad mask-wearing
    requirements](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/23/world/europe/23reuters-health-coronavirus-belgium.html)
    and warned of even stricter measures if infections continued to
    rise.

  - Case surges could be slowed if the world’s poorest people received a
    temporary **basic income**, [enabling them to stay at
    home](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu#link-7aa50c66),
    according to a United Nations report.

  - President Trump said he had canceled the portion of the
    **[Republican National
    Convention](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html)**
    slated for Jacksonville, Fla., citing the virus.

## China wants to punish the U.S., but how much?

China ordered the [closure of the U.S. consulate in
Chengdu](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/asia/china-us-consulate-chengdu.html)
on Friday, saying it was a retaliation for Washington’s decision earlier
this week to close China’s consulate in Houston.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The tit-for-tat consulate closures were yet another twist in
deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, perhaps the
gravest one yet.

But behind the scenes, Chinese leaders seem to have little desire to
further escalate tensions, concerned that [a breach in relations would
hurt the economy or invite global
isolation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/asia/us-china-consulate.html).
Officials are also wary that any moves could play into President Trump’s
hands during his re-election campaign.

Still, Beijing cannot afford to appear weak in the face of attacks from
the United States, and the furor is inflaming anti-American sentiment
domestically.

**Bigger picture:** China is also clashing with India, Britain, Canada,
Australia and many other countries, and it is still reeling from the
coronavirus pandemic and the global fallout.

**Related:** Cybersecurity researchers have found [a vulnerability in an
app that helps power popular Chinese-made consumer
drones](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/dji-drones-security-vulnerability.html),
highlighting U.S. officials’ concerns that Beijing could get access to
information about
Americans.

## Former Nazi guard is convicted

A 93-year-old man was [convicted on Thursday for helping the Nazis
murder thousands of
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/europe/holocaust-trial-nazi-guard-germany.html)
when he was a 17-year-old concentration camp guard — possibly one of the
last verdicts to be handed down to a living Holocaust participant.

Bruno Dey was found guilty of 5,230 counts of murder, one for each
person believed to have been killed in the Stuffhof concentration camp
in Poland. Tried in juvenile court, he was given a two-year suspended
sentence. Survivors and those representing them said it was too lenient.

**Context:** Prosecutors in the special office for handling Nazi-era
crimes are pushing to bring aging suspects to justice before it is too
late. It comes as the country is dealing with a resurgence in right-wing
extremism. A trial opened this week in another court for a German
suspect accused in a [plot to attack a
synagogue](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/world/europe/germany-synagogue-attack-trial.html)
that left two people
dead.

Above, farm workers who are struggling to harvest maize to feed their

model, for the first time, how people will move across borders. With

Targets include Adidas, Lacoste, H\&M, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren
and the PVH Corporation, which owns labels including Tommy Hilfiger and
Calvin Klein.

**Climate change lawsuit:** A 23-year-old law student has filed a
class-action suit accusing the [Australian government of failing to
disclose financial risks from climate
change](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/australia/lawsuit-climate-change-bonds.html).
Experts say it’s the first case of its kind being brought against a
sovereign nation.

**France:** The dramatic rescue of two Grenoble boys, ages 3 and 10, who
leapt from a [burning apartment into the waiting arms of a crowd
below](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/europe/france-children-rescue-video.html)

of them are, and I plan to follow their
advice.”

### And now for the Back Story on …

## A harsh virus response in the Philippines

*With more than 70,000 infections and 1,800 deaths, the Philippines has
been hit hard by the coronavirus. President Rodrigo Duterte has
empowered the police to go home to home searching for the sick and has
warned that anyone not wearing a mask will be arrested.*

*Jason Gutierrez, who is based in Manila, spoke to our colleagues from
the* [*Coronavirus
Briefing*](https://static.nytimes.com/email-content/CB_sample.html)
*about the government’s heavy-handed approach.*

**What is the status of the virus in the Philippines?**

The government hasn’t really been upfront about what’s happening.
President Duterte just said that all we can do is wait for the experts
in the United States or China to develop a vaccine and basically advised
the public to follow the rules or risk arrest.

Our Health Ministry is seen by many as really inefficient. It lets Mr.
Duterte say what he wants to say and does not clarify it in
public.

**What is the situation in Manila?**

People in the city have to go through checkpoints, and cops go around
some areas in fatigues, like they’re going into battle. Some carry large
firearms. It’s worrying because it’s militarizing the response.

In some areas, especially the impoverished parts, people are really
afraid to leave their homes and are basically told to just wait it out
for food and medical advice or risk being arrested.

**What has the response been to President Duterte saying the police
would arrest people who didn’t wear masks?**

In a lot of places, you see people in public always wearing medical
masks. Ironically, he does not wear a mask whenever he meets his
officials, and he only wore a mask when he made that threat.

Militarizing the response is probably his way of telling the public that
he, as a strongman president, is doing something.
