# Why a Biden Presidency Could Be Bullish for Stocks

</div>

Despite the stock market’s “knee-jerk” distaste for the prospect of a
Democratic victory, stocks could prosper if Joe Biden wins, a new
analysis says. The coronavirus and trade are two big factors.

In one of the stock market’s brief downward slides during its long march
upward this
[summer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/wall-street-joe-biden.html),
worries about the prospects of a Biden presidency began to dominate the
chatter, and for seemingly solid reasons.

The logic was simple: Corporate taxes might rise, and that would hamper
profits. But that’s perhaps too simple, as a deeper look at the issue
indicates. Such an examination came this week in
a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>deeply contrarian July 20
[BofA Global
Research](https://www.bofaml.com/en-us/content/market-strategies-insights.html?cm_mmc=GCB-Integrated-_-Google-PS-_-bofa_global_research-_-Brand_General&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjer4BRCZARIsABK4QeU5ptDZuvjxVvf9x6D3VXH0kNxfFUZPOhTy-730690mmsz2N8xezkwaAjguEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
report to the firm’s investors.

It said that once the market had gotten over its reflexive distaste for
the notion of a Democratic victory, many people were likely to conclude
that would not be a disaster for stocks or the economy. In some
respects, the report said, a Biden win could be a boon for both.

The report, “US Viewpoint: An election during a pandemic,” said that,
given the current [polling
data](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/), it was
reasonable to assume as a “base case” not only that former Vice
President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
would win, but that there would also be a Democratic sweep of both
houses of Congress.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That, the report said, implies that a new administration could enact
far-reaching policy changes. While some would drag down corporate
profits and stock market returns, it said, others would provide a
longer-term boost.

“The knee-jerk reactions of the market are likely to be based on
perceptions of a Republican regime as more business friendly and a
Democratic regime as more negative for risk assets, but medium- to
long-term ramifications of either scenario are less clear cut,” the
report said. The authors of the report declined to comment for this
column.

They found that a Biden victory would have complex, mixed effects on the
bond, stock and foreign exchange markets, as well as the underlying
economy. But they concluded that the overall impact of a Democratic
victory could be positive, and would most likely include a steadier and
more vigorous handling of the coronavirus crisis and a more open
approach to international
trade.

Those conclusions run counter to the narrative promoted by President
Trump, who has [frequently
boasted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-jobs-numbers-report-2/)
that the stock market and the economy have flourished under his
stewardship and [has
warned](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/investing/biden-trump-stock-market-election/index.html)
of serious trouble if he were to lose in November. That argument has
gotten plenty of attention and, in some respects, seems plausible.

First, during Mr. Trump’s presidency, taxes dropped sharply, including
those on [corporate
profits](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-jobs-act.html),
capital gains and the income of wealthy people. The Biden campaign [has
called for an
increase](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/business/2020-democrats-tax.html)
in these taxes (along with a reduction in those for lower- and
middle-income people). All things being equal, those changes could be
expected to trim net profits for corporate America and net gains for
individual investors, making the stock market less attractive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After all, the Trump corporate tax cut, to 21 percent from 35 percent,
was a corporate windfall, accounting for nearly half the 23 percent
growth in earnings per share for the S\&P 500 in 2018, the analysts
estimated. Mr. Biden has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28
percent, which, they estimated, “would be a mid-single digit hit” to
earnings per share, the analysts said.

And Mr. Trump has helped big business in other ways. His administration
has stripped regulations on all manner of corporate activities. In moves
bolstering fossil-fuel energy companies, for example, Mr. Trump has
rolled back nearly 70 environmental regulations and is in the process of
eliminating about 30 more, [a tally by The New York Times
shows.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html)

His administration has helped the financial service industry, too,
[loosening Obama-era
rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/your-money/fiduciary-duty-investments-best-interest.html)
that gave greater protections to people saving for retirement and
investing for other purposes.

Mr. Biden can be expected to take a very different approach on many
issues. He recently proposed a [$2 trillion
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html)to
increase the use of clean energy over the next four years, and a [$775
billion
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/biden-workplace-childcare.html)
covering care for small children, older adults and family members with
disabilities.

It is understandable that an abrupt change in course, such as the one
suggested by Mr. Biden’s rise in the polls, might initially unsettle the
markets.

But there has been time for investors to digest the Democratic
ascendancy in the polls. That intelligence has been absorbed by the
market — and it has risen to new highs.

For thoughtful investors, that makes sense, the authors of the report
said, because the Biden policies may, on balance, have a positive
economic impact. That would be expected to yield better stock returns.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On taxes, for example, the cut in corporate rates has [not been
accompanied](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/business/economy/trumps-tax-cut-was-supposed-to-change-corporate-behavior-heres-what-happened.html)
by an increase in research and development or economic growth. By
contrast, Mr. Biden’s “emphasis on supporting the welfare of the middle
class by offering greater access to education, job training and lower
student debt should offer longer term benefits” that could translate
eventually into stock market gains, the authors said.

Furthermore, the pandemic remains the main impediment to economic growth
now and, quite likely, will at the start of the next administration. Mr.
Biden calls [for a much stronger federal
role](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/biden-trump-coronavirus-testing.html)
in promoting and financing social distancing, contact tracing and
quarantines.

“Biden’s more aggressive stance on Covid-19 is likely to improve
medium-to longer-term U.S. growth prospects potentially at the expense
of shorter term prospects, if restrictive policies are pursued,” the
report said.

And the [trade
conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/business/trade-disputes-more-than-a-money-problem.html),
tariffs, restrictions on immigration and diminution of global
institutions of the Trump era would be supplanted by a more
internationalist approach — and one likely to yield substantial
benefits, the report projected.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>In short, the authors said, a Democratic sweep of the presidency
and both houses of Congress would be “growth positive.”

This isn’t the first time the stock market has shuddered at the thought
of a Democratic presidency; in fact, I’ve written [this kind of
story](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/your-money/wall-st-may-not-cheer-but-obamas-been-good-for-stocks.html)
before, about Wall Street’s
[misguided](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/your-money/the-obama-years-the-best-of-times-to-be-a-stock-investor.html)
apprehensions [about the
impact](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/your-money/this-ironman-market-is-still-lacking-respect.html)
of the Obama presidency.

But the historical record shows that since 1900 the stock market has
fared far better under Democratic presidents, with a 6.7 percent
annualized return for the Dow Jones industrial average compared with
just 3.5 percent under Republicans. (The results are similar when
measured from Election Day to Election Day.) Data provided by Bespoke
Investment Group shows that these are the best annualized returns under
individual presidents:

  - 25.5 percent under Calvin Coolidge, a Republican, in the 1920s.

  - 15.9 percent under Bill Clinton, a Democrat.

  - 12.1 percent under Barack Obama, a Democrat.

“Wall Street generally considers Republicans to be better for market
returns but historically, that’s not true,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder
of Bespoke. “Democratic presidents have generally had better returns
versus Republicans.”

The market under Mr. Trump has been fine — despite a calamitous drop in
late February and early March — with a 9.2 percent annualized return
through Wednesday.

But despite all the hoopla about Mr. Trump’s undoubtedly pro-business
policies, the stock market performance under Mr. Trump doesn’t match up
well against Mr. Clinton or Mr. Obama. It is entirely possible that the
same would be true if Mr. Biden became
president.
