There’s a point early on in “The Plague” when a journalist stuck in the
sickened city of Oran tries desperately to get out — beyond the walls,
to the rest of healthy, happy French Algeria.

It’s meant to be for love. Raymond Rambert, the would-be escapee in
Albert Camus’s 1947 novel, is eager to reach the woman he intends to
marry.

But I found myself recalling the scene last week because it reminded me
of the divide that pandemics create between places and people, and the
enormous difference between life inside with the contagion and life
beyond, in someplace that feels almost normal.

At the time, I was catching up on news of the surging coronavirus
outbreak in Victoria while enjoying a gourmet lunch in northern New
South Wales after stopping at a busy local bookstore. It felt odd and,
if I’m honest, exhilarating, to be enjoying such luxuries. The tables in
the restaurant, [Shelter in Lennox
Head](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/dining/restaurants-northern-rivers-byron-bay.html),
were far enough apart to feel safe but not so distant to feel abnormal.
The food was great. The bookstore, too, felt almost pre-pandemic.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Our family of four felt as though we had escaped to the other side, and
in many ways we had, especially compared to our loved ones in the United
States. I recently talked to a friend in South Carolina who told me he
had been in isolation for 110 days and spoken to only five people in
that time who were not members of his
family.

And yet, even for the lucky ones, it all feels so fragile. The
difference between the imaginary world of Camus and our very real world
today is that the virus is not — and may never be — truly contained. Our
societies are porous. Our lives are networked and global.

So in the bookstore, the clerk, when she heard our American accents,
told us that she had Australian friends who were forced to leave the
U.S. because the Trump administration — its anti-immigration urges
empowered by the pandemic — had canceled their visas.

At the restaurant, one of the owners told me that while they were doing
well there, he had to close another restaurant he had opened only
recently. “The places that are not well established, they’re not going
to make it,” he said.

Another divide, another wall: between the businesses that survive and
those that do not; between those with work and those without.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What should we do and how should we feel about the uneven distribution
of pandemic consequences?

This, it seems to me, is a question that we’ll be grappling with for a
while. The Australian government’s [adjustments to the JobKeeper
program](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/jobkeeper-jobseeker-extended-rates-cut-coronavirus-morrison/12475716)
this week, extending wage subsidies into next year but curtailing the
amounts, signals that officials have begun to recognize what it took the
residents of Oran a long time to accept — that pestilence requires
endurance.

Here’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison: “The virus will plot its own
course.”

Here’s Camus: “The preceding months, though they had increased the
desire for liberation, had also taught them to count less and less on a
rapid end to the epidemic.”

In this middle moment between initial infection and final eradication —
the very lengthy moment “The Plague” focused on — Camus’s characters
prioritized perseverance and small acts of kindness. Flipping back
through the book as I wrote this, the power of consistency re-emerged.
Dr. Bernard Rieux, “struggling against the world as it was,” provided
both treatment for the sick and an ear for the struggles of the anxious.

He was a hero of small things, a hero of careful carrying on. Perhaps
that’s what we all need to aim for as
well.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).
