Although the city and state have broad requirements in place, apartment
buildings are enacting their own rules for residents. The key is to make
sure you know what they are.

\textbf{Q: I live in a large Manhattan co-op where, before the pandemic,
apartment renovations happened almost constantly, with crews of workers
showing up early in the morning and spreading out to different floors in
the building. Now that workers are returning again, I'm concerned about
my health and safety. How can we be certain that someone won't bring
Covid-19 into the building? Does our co-op really have to allow all this
work to happen again?}

\textbf{A:} Since the city entered Phase 1 of its reopening plan in
early June, your co-op has been allowed to resume residential
construction. It is still bound by
\href{https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/ConstructionShortGuidelines.pdf}{state}
and
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/restart_enforcement_guidance.pdf}{city}
guidelines --- meaning workers must practice social distancing, wear
masks and be screened upon entry to the building --- but can also enact
stricter rules than those the state and city mandate, and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/realestate/coronavirus-home-renovations.html}{many
buildings are.}Some co-ops and condos aren't moving forward with any new
projects, only allowing ones that were halted during the shutdown to
resume. Others are limiting the size and scope of projects.

If you are concerned about what protections are in place, ask the
managing agent to share the co-op's renovation guidelines with you. Ask
how it plans to keep common areas clean, and what its screening policy
involves. Some buildings are charging owners daily or weekly cleaning
fees, according to
\href{https://www.seyfarth.com/people/ingrid-c-manevitz.html}{Ingrid C.
Manevitz}, a real estate lawyer and a partner in the Manhattan office of
Seyfarth Shaw.

Ask what enforcement policies the building has in place should a
shareholder or contractor violate the rules. Some buildings have enacted
policies giving the board the authority to fine shareholders or even
halt construction for rule-breaking, according to Ms. Manevitz.

If you do see ongoing problems, and the board is unresponsive, you can
contact the city by calling 311 and request that a building inspector
visit the work site. ``We take this matter very seriously, which is why
we have dedicated additional inspectors to respond to these specific
complaints,'' said Lisa Wood, deputy press secretary for the Department
of Buildings, adding that inspectors are visiting every construction
site in the city.

New York isn't returning to normal anytime soon, but as time passes more
work will likely resume. Your co-op board should keep you informed about
how it plans to keep you and your neighbors safe during this slow,
complicated reopening process.
