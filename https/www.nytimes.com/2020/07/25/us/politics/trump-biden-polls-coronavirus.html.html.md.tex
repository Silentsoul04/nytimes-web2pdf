pandemic, backtracking on previous positions and behavior. How long will
it last?

\subsection{Catch me up}\label{catch-me-up}}

This was the week when
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html}{President
Trump} started looking like he was facing reality about America's
coronavirus pandemic.

On Monday he tweeted a picture of himself wearing a face mask ---
something he had long resisted --- and encouraged the country to join.
At a Tuesday news conference, he said the virus would likely ``get worse
before it gets better,'' instead of acting like the worst was in the
rearview mirror. His news briefings were shorter and less antagonistic
than those in the spring. He spoke of setting a good example for the
country.

But Mr. Trump's attempt at a Covid Reset for his presidency --- in the
face of soaring cases, as well as his falling poll numbers --- raises
two important questions:

How long will it last?

Will many people believe it?

The president usually reverts to combative form after a seeming change
in tone, a pattern of behavior that helped make him famous --- and now
endangers his re-election. His response to the pandemic has been widely
panned by Americans in public polling and public health experts, who say
these actions should have come in March or April, not July.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{About
145,000 Americans have already died}.

After months of bluster, the president has seemingly come to understand
what many have known for months: he cannot wish away the coronavirus.
The refusal to acknowledge the reality of rising cases and deaths has
hurt Mr. Trump's poll numbers and hampered the country from a
coordinated response. It has alienated him from key groups of swing
voters, including seniors and ideological moderates.

In several interviews and news conferences this week, Mr. Trump tried to
change course. Here's how:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Teed up with an opportunity to criticize \textbf{Dr. Anthony Fauci}
  from Fox News host \textbf{Sean Hannity}, Mr. Trump ignored it.
\item
  On Thursday, Mr. Trump said schools should delay reopening in
  coronavirus hot spots --- a reversal of his previous position that all
  schools should open in the fall.
\item
  That afternoon, the president canceled the Republican National
  Convention in Florida, citing the threat posed by the virus. Some
  Republican leaders had already said they would not attend.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{obama-and-biden-together-again}{%
\subsection{Obama and Biden, together
again}\label{obama-and-biden-together-again}}

The relationship between \textbf{President Barack Obama} and his vice
president, Mr. Biden, was so publicly affectionate that it was its own
meme genre. The relationship helped Mr. Biden secure the Democratic
nomination, and on Thursday, Mr. Obama returned to the virtual campaign
trail, releasing a sleek video conversation with Mr. Biden filmed in the
44th president's D.C. office.

The discussion focused on Mr. Trump's response to the coronavirus, and
contrasted how a potential Biden administration would deal with
unforeseen crises. But more than any individual policy, Mr. Obama sought
to brand Mr. Biden as compassionate and decent, the type of person who
stands out against Mr. Trump's combativeness.

``The thing I've got confidence in, Joe, is your heart and your
character, and the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the
kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.''

Some other highlights from the video release, which totaled 15 minutes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mr. Obama called the Affordable Care Act a ``starter house,'' saying
  it's time for Democrats to expand coverage.
\item
  Both men encouraged those who have been leading protests against
  racial inequality and police brutality. Mr. Obama's administration
  was, at times, criticized by activists for not embracing systemic
  police reform. Mr. Obama said Mr. Biden would be an ally to bigger
  change.

The whole idea behind moving the convention from its original location
in Charlotte, N.C., to Jacksonville was to make it easier to give Mr.
Trump the spectacle he wanted: televised images of packed crowds
cheering him into the final sprint of his re-election campaign, a
dangerous reality that Republicans thought would not be possible under
strict social distancing rules that Democratic governor of North
Carolina, \textbf{Roy Cooper}, was requiring.

But bringing together a large crowd during a surging pandemic proved to
be much more difficult than simply finding a new location with a
supportive Republican governor and mayor.

And on Thursday, Mr. Trump broke the news himself that he was pulling
the plug on his second attempt at a large-scale celebratory convention.

``It's not the right time for that,'' Mr. Trump said, nodding to the
growing cases in Florida and the problems with security that local law
enforcement officials had expressed.

The end was welcomed by Republican officials who had been tasked with
putting it together. Some talked of celebrating the president's decision
by cracking open expensive bottles of wine on Thursday night.

How did we get here?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Republicans said raising money had been difficult, and making
  last-minute adjustments --- like sending attendees in-home Covid-19
  test kits, had been complicated. They also assumed that Mr. Trump
  would ultimately be blamed for a coronavirus death tied to the
  convention.

  \href{https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20200722/rnc-plans-in-jeopardy-as-jacksonville-council-president-opposes-city-bill}{Jacksonville
  City Council president opposed a bill}that would have given the mayor,
  \textbf{Lenny Curry}, the power to spend \$33 million in federal
  security funds however he deems necessary.
\item
  The sheriff of Jacksonville, meanwhile, said of convention security on
  Monday:
  \href{https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/07/20/we-cant-pull-it-off-florida-sheriff-says-he-cant-muster-security-for-gop-convention-1302359}{``We
  can't pull it off}.'' The Republican National Committees response?
  ``Jacksonville has accommodated upwards of 70,000 people for football
  games and other events, and we are confident in state, local and
  federal officials to be able to ensure a safe event for our
  attendees,'' \textbf{Mandi Merritt}, an R.N.C. spokeswoman, said.
\item
  Florida continued to see a rise in coronavirus cases and deaths
  overall this week, and Jacksonville is no exception.
  \href{https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2020/07/23/over-one-fifth-of-jacksonvilles-covid-19-deaths-were-reported-in-last-7-days/}{Over
  one-fifth of Jacksonville's coronavirus deaths were reported in last
  seven days}, according to local news sources.
