# Your Coronavirus Antibodies Are Disappearing. Should You Care?

Declining antibody levels do not mean less immunity, experts say.
Besides, two widely used tests may detect the wrong antibodies.

Your blood carries the memory of every pathogen you’ve ever encountered.
If you’ve been infected with the coronavirus, your body most likely
remembers that, too.

Antibodies are the legacy of that encounter. Why, then, have so many
people stricken by the virus discovered that they don’t seem to have
antibodies?

Blame the tests.

Most commercial antibody tests offer crude yes-no answers. The tests are
[notorious for
delivering](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html)
false positives — results indicating that someone has antibodies when he
or she does not.

But the volume of coronavirus antibodies drops sharply once the acute
illness ends. Now it is increasingly clear that these tests may also
produce false-negative results, missing antibodies to the coronavirus
that are present at low levels.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Moreover, some tests — including those made by Abbott and Roche and
offered by Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp — are designed to detect a
subtype of antibodies that doesn’t confer immunity and may wane even
faster than the kind that can destroy the virus.

What that means is that declining antibodies, as shown by commercial
tests, don’t necessarily mean declining immunity, several experts said.
Long-term surveys of antibodies, intended to assess how widely the
coronavirus has spread, may also underestimate the true prevalence.

“We’re learning a lot about how antibodies change over time,” said Dr.
Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist who has led such surveys for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If the narrative on immunity to the coronavirus has seemed to shift
constantly, it’s in part because the virus was a stranger to scientists.
But it’s increasingly clear that this virus behaves much like any other.

This is how immunity to viruses generally works: The initial encounter
with a pathogen — typically in childhood — surprises the body. The
resulting illness can be mild or severe, depending on the dose of the
virus and the child’s health, access to health care and genetics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A mild illness may trigger production of only a few antibodies, and a
severe one many more. The vast majority of people who become infected
with the coronavirus have few to no symptoms, many experts believe, and
those people may produce a milder immune
response.

But even a minor infection is often enough to teach the body to
recognize the intruder.

After the battle ends, balloon-like cells that live in the bone marrow
steadily pump out a small number of specialized assassins. The next time
— and every time after that — that the body comes across the virus,
those cells can mass-produce antibodies within hours.

The mnemonic response grows stronger with every encounter. It’s one of
the great miracles of the human body.

“Whatever your level is today, if you get infected, your antibody titers
are going to go way up,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at
Harvard University, referring to the levels of antibodies in the blood.
“The virus will never even have a chance the second time around.”

A single drop of blood contains billions of antibodies, all lying in
wait for their specific targets. Sometimes, as may be the case for
antibodies to the coronavirus, there are too few to get a positive
signal on a test — but that does not mean the person tested has no
immunity to the virus.

“Even if their antibodies wane below the limits of detection of our
instruments, it doesn’t mean their ‘memory’ is gone,” Dr. Mina said.

A small number of people may not produce any antibodies to the
coronavirus. But even in that unlikely event, they will have so-called
cellular immunity, which includes T cells that learn to identify and
destroy the virus. Virtually everyone infected with the coronavirus
seems to develop T-cell responses, according to several recent studies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This means that even if the antibody titer is low, those people who are
previously infected may have a good enough T-cell response that can
provide protection,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale
University.

T cells are harder to detect and to study, however, so when it comes to
immunity, antibodies have received all of the attention. The coronavirus
carries several antigens — proteins or pieces of a protein — that can
provoke the body into producing antibodies.

The most powerful antibodies recognize a piece of the coronavirus’s
spike protein, the receptor binding domain, or R.B.D. That is the part
of the virus that docks onto human cells. Antibodies that recognize the
R.B.D. can neutralize the virus and prevent infection.

But the Roche and Abbott tests that are now widely available — and
several others [authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)
— instead look for antibodies to a protein called the nucleocapsid, or
N, that is bound up with the virus’s genetic material.

Some scientists were stunned to hear of this choice.

“God, I did not realize that — that’s crazy,” said Angela Rasmussen, a
virologist at Columbia University in New York. “It’s kind of puzzling to
design a test that’s not looking for what’s thought to be the major
antigen.”

The N protein is plentiful in the blood, and testing for antibodies to
it produces a swifter, brighter signal than testing for antibodies to
the spike protein. Because antibody tests are used to detect past
infection, however, manufacturers are not required to prove that the
antibodies their tests seek are those that actually confer protection
against the virus.

Officials at the Food and Drug Administration did not respond to
requests for comment on whether the two tests target the appropriate
antibodies.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There’s another wrinkle to the story. Some
[reports](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153536v2?%253fcollection=)
now suggest that [antibodies
to](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6)the viral
nucleocapsid may [decline
faster](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155663v2)
than those to R.B.D. or to the entire spike — the really effective ones.

“The majority of people are getting tested for anti-N antibody, which
does tend to wane more rapidly — and so, you know, it may be not the
most suitable test for looking at neutralizing capacity,” Dr. Iwasaki
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In the United States, millions of people have taken the Roche and Abbott
tests. LabCorp alone has performed more than two million antibody tests
made by the two manufacturers.

Quest relies on tests made by Abbott, Ortho Clinical and Euroimmun.
Quest declined to reveal what proportion of the 2.7 million tests it has
deployed so far were made by Abbott.

Dr. Jonathan Berz, a physician in Boston, tested positive for the virus
in early April but felt fine, apart from a sore throat. His wife was
sicker, and despite several negative diagnostic tests, she remained ill
for weeks.

“Initially, we felt as a family that, ‘Oh wow, we got sick,
unfortunately,’” Dr. Berz said. “‘But the good side of that is that
we’re going to have immunity.’”

In early June, the couple and their two children took Abbott antibody
tests processed by Quest. All four turned up negative. Even though Dr.
Berz knew that immunity is complex and that T cells also play a role, he
was disappointed.

As a doctor in a Covid-19 clinic, he had always acted as though he was
at risk for infection. But after seeing the antibody results, he said,
“my level of anxiety just increased.”

A spokeswoman at Abbott said the test had 100 percent sensitivity 17
days after symptoms began but did not provide information about
sensitivity beyond that time.

Dr. Beatus Ofenloch-Haehnle, who heads immunoassay research at Roche,
defended the company’s antibody test. His team has tracked N antibodies
in 130 people who had mild to no symptoms and has not yet seen a
decline, he said.

“There is some fluctuation, but no waning at all,” he said. “We have a
lot of data, and we do not rely anymore on theory.” The N antibody can
be a decent proxy for immunity, Dr. Ofenloch-Haehnle added.

He also pointed to a study by Public Health England that suggested that
the Abbott and Roche tests seemed to perform well [up to 73 days after
symptom
onset](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/898437/Evaluation__of_sensitivity_and_specificity_of_4_commercially_available_SARS-CoV-2_antibody_immunoassays.pdf).
“I think we should be careful to jump to conclusions too soon,” he said.

Other experts also urged caution. Without more information about what
antibody testing results mean, they said, people should do as Dr. Berz
did: Act as though they do not have immunity.

There is no definitive information as yet on what levels of antibodies
are needed for immunity or how long that protection might last. “I think
we’re getting closer and closer to that knowledge,” Dr. Iwasaki said.
