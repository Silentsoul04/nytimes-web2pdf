# Your Coronavirus Antibodies Are Disappearing. Should You Care?

</div>

Declining antibody levels do not mean less immunity, experts say.
Besides, two widely used tests may detect the wrong antibodies.

Your blood carries the memory of every pathogen you’ve ever encountered.
If you’ve been infected with the coronavirus, your body most likely
remembers that, too.

Antibodies are the legacy of that encounter. Why, then, have so many
people stricken by the virus discovered that they don’t seem to have
antibodies?

Blame the tests.

Most commercial antibody tests offer crude yes-no answers. The tests are
[notorious for
delivering](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html)
false positives — results indicating that someone has antibodies when he
or she does not.

But the volume of coronavirus antibodies drops sharply once the acute
illness ends. Now it is increasingly clear that these tests may also
produce false-negative results, missing antibodies to the coronavirus
that are present at low levels.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Moreover, some tests — including those made by Abbott and Roche and
offered by Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp — are designed to detect a
subtype of antibodies that doesn’t confer immunity and may wane even
faster than the kind that can destroy the virus.

What that means is that declining antibodies, as shown by commercial
tests, don’t necessarily mean declining immunity, several experts said.
Long-term surveys of antibodies, intended to assess how widely the
coronavirus has spread, may also underestimate the true prevalence.

“We’re learning a lot about how antibodies change over time,” said Dr.
Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist who has led such surveys for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If the narrative on immunity to the coronavirus has seemed to shift
constantly, it’s in part because the virus was a stranger to scientists.
But it’s increasingly clear that this virus behaves much like any other.

This is how immunity to viruses generally works: The initial encounter
with a pathogen — typically in childhood — surprises the body. The
resulting illness can be mild or severe, depending on the dose of the
virus and the child’s health, access to health care and genetics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A mild illness may trigger production of only a few antibodies, and a
severe one many more. The vast majority of people who become infected
with the coronavirus have few to no symptoms, many experts believe, and
those people may produce a milder immune
response.

But even a minor infection is often enough to teach the body to
recognize the intruder.

After the battle ends, balloon-like cells that live in the bone marrow
steadily pump out a small number of specialized assassins. The next time
— and every time after that — that the body comes across the virus,
those cells can mass-produce antibodies within hours.

The mnemonic response grows stronger with every encounter. It’s one of
the great miracles of the human body.

“Whatever your level is today, if you get infected, your antibody titers
are going to go way up,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at
Harvard University, referring to the levels of antibodies in the blood.
“The virus will never even have a chance the second time around.”

A single drop of blood contains billions of antibodies, all lying in
wait for their specific targets. Sometimes, as may be the case for
antibodies to the coronavirus, there are too few to get a positive
signal on a test — but that does not mean the person tested has no
immunity to the virus.

“Even if their antibodies wane below the limits of detection of our
instruments, it doesn’t mean their ‘memory’ is gone,” Dr. Mina said.

A small number of people may not produce any antibodies to the
coronavirus. But even in that unlikely event, they will have so-called
cellular immunity, which includes T cells that learn to identify and
destroy the virus. Virtually everyone infected with the coronavirus
seems to develop T-cell responses, according to several recent studies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This means that even if the antibody titer is low, those people who are
previously infected may have a good enough T-cell response that can
provide protection,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale
University.

T cells are harder to detect and to study, however, so when it comes to
immunity, antibodies have received all of the attention. The coronavirus
carries several antigens — proteins or pieces of a protein — that can
provoke the body into producing antibodies.

The most powerful antibodies recognize a piece of the coronavirus’s
spike protein, the receptor binding domain, or R.B.D. That is the part
of the virus that docks onto human cells. Antibodies that recognize the
R.B.D. can neutralize the virus and prevent infection.

But the Roche and Abbott tests that are now widely available — and
several others [authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)
— instead look for antibodies to a protein called the nucleocapsid, or
N, that is bound up with the virus’s genetic material.

Some scientists were stunned to hear of this choice.

“God, I did not realize that — that’s crazy,” said Angela Rasmussen, a
virologist at Columbia University in New York. “It’s kind of puzzling to
design a test that’s not looking for what’s thought to be the major
antigen.”

The N protein is plentiful in the blood, and testing for antibodies to
it produces a swifter, brighter signal than testing for antibodies to
the spike protein. Because antibody tests are used to detect past
infection, however, manufacturers are not required to prove that the
antibodies their tests seek are those that actually confer protection
against the virus.

Officials at the Food and Drug Administration did not respond to
requests for comment on whether the two tests target the appropriate
antibodies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There’s another wrinkle to the story. Some
[reports](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153536v2?%253fcollection=)
now suggest that [antibodies
to](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6)the viral
nucleocapsid may [decline
faster](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155663v2)
than those to R.B.D. or to the entire spike — the really effective ones.

“The majority of people are getting tested for anti-N antibody, which
does tend to wane more rapidly — and so, you know, it may be not the
most suitable test for looking at neutralizing capacity,” Dr. Iwasaki
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In the United States, millions of people have taken the Roche and Abbott
tests. LabCorp alone has performed more than two million antibody tests
made by the two manufacturers.

Quest relies on tests made by Abbott, Ortho Clinical and Euroimmun.
Quest declined to reveal what proportion of the 2.7 million tests it has
deployed so far were made by Abbott.

Dr. Jonathan Berz, a physician in Boston, tested positive for the virus
in early April but felt fine, apart from a sore throat. His wife was
sicker, and despite several negative diagnostic tests, she remained ill
for weeks.

“Initially, we felt as a family that, ‘Oh wow, we got sick,
unfortunately,’” Dr. Berz said. “‘But the good side of that is that
we’re going to have immunity.’”

In early June, the couple and their two children took Abbott antibody
tests processed by Quest. All four turned up negative. Even though Dr.
Berz knew that immunity is complex and that T cells also play a role, he
was disappointed.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a doctor in a Covid-19 clinic, he had always acted as though he was
at risk for infection. But after seeing the antibody results, he said,
“my level of anxiety just increased.”

A spokeswoman at Abbott said the test had 100 percent sensitivity 17
days after symptoms began but did not provide information about
sensitivity beyond that time.

Dr. Beatus Ofenloch-Haehnle, who heads immunoassay research at Roche,
defended the company’s antibody test. His team has tracked N antibodies
in 130 people who had mild to no symptoms and has not yet seen a
decline, he said.

“There is some fluctuation, but no waning at all,” he said. “We have a
lot of data, and we do not rely anymore on theory.” The N antibody can
be a decent proxy for immunity, Dr. Ofenloch-Haehnle added.

He also pointed to a study by Public Health England that suggested that
the Abbott and Roche tests seemed to perform well [up to 73 days after
symptom
onset](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/898437/Evaluation__of_sensitivity_and_specificity_of_4_commercially_available_SARS-CoV-2_antibody_immunoassays.pdf).
“I think we should be careful to jump to conclusions too soon,” he said.

Other experts also urged caution. Without more information about what
antibody testing results mean, they said, people should do as Dr. Berz
did: Act as though they do not have immunity.

There is no definitive information as yet on what levels of antibodies
are needed for immunity or how long that protection might last. “I think
we’re getting closer and closer to that knowledge,” Dr. Iwasaki said.
