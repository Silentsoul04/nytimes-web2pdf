After mocking people for wearing masks, refusing to publicly wear one
himself and holding rallies and gatherings where social distancing was
not required, President Trump has shifted his tone.

He has canceled his convention activities in Jacksonville, Fla., after
moving the events from North Carolina when that state’s governor raised
public health concerns about such a large indoor gathering.

He has resumed briefings, ostensibly about the coronavirus, after
canceling them and trying to move on to other matters, as if the virus
would simply vanish if he sufficiently ignored it.

Trump is in real trouble. With the election passing the 100-day-away
milestone, he is down in the polls, people don’t trust or approve of his
handling of the pandemic and he faces a real uphill battle to
re-election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Apparently, the reality of his dire straits has begun to pierce his
inner circle of perpetual affirmation. There is a reality lurking that
can’t be lied away. If the election were held today, he wouldn’t win.

But Trump is a political chameleon: He can alter himself to suit his
environment, to reflect it. He may not be fond of apologies, but he is
open to course reversal, for survival.

Indeed, that is the maleficent marvel of it all: He has changed his
position to the opposite of what it once was and argued that the new
direction is the one he’s always embraced. Only a person with an utter
contempt for the truth could repeatedly take this tack.

We need look no further than 2016 to see how Trump operates when he is
desperate and in trouble, trying to woo the votes he needs, and how
hollow and nakedly political his efforts can be.

In 2016, after calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists and
promising to build a wall between the United States and Mexico — one
that he would somehow force the Mexican government to finance — he posed
with taco bowls on Cinco De Mayo and wrote on Twitter: [“I love
Hispanics\!”](https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/donald-trump-taco-bowl-cinco-de-mayo/index.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He got [over a
quarter](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls) of the
Hispanic vote, yet once elected, he continued to demonize immigrants and
[tried to
dismantle](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-he-will-sign-order-to-provide-road-to-citizenship-for-dreamers)
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young immigrants
known as “Dreamers.”

His administration’s [negligence and lack of
preparedness](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/us/fema-puerto-rico-maria.html)
in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria undoubtedly led to more deaths than
there would have been under a competent president.

And the Trump administration’s [“zero
tolerance”](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/06/17/family-separation-under-trump-administration-timeline)
policy, under which thousands of migrant children, sometimes infants,
were taken from their parents, flourished.

In 2016, when the “Access Hollywood” tape on which Trump is heard
bragging about sexually assaulting women was made public, he issued a
rare half-apology, saying, “I’ve said and done things I regret, and the
words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of
them.” He would later deem his assault claims “locker room talk.”

But shortly after winning the election he started suggesting that the
voice on the tape wasn’t his, and after his inauguration, [according
to](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/trump-access-hollywood-tape.html)The
New York Times, he told a Republican senator that “he wanted to
investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women’s
genitals.”

In 2016, Trump [finally
admitted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjHPDzUOe2U) that Barack Obama
was born in the United States. It is important to note that he didn’t in
fact apologize for years of racist birtherism during which he insisted
otherwise. Instead, he once again attempted to shift blame, saying:
“Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther
controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean.”

But after Trump was elected he revived his questioning of Obama’s place
of birth and the authenticity of his birth certificate.

Trump is an incendiary figure. He uses fear and division as his devices.
He believes they work … until they don’t. When forced — by shifts in
sentiment by his core supporters, or those on the margins he needs, or
in the face of possible loss and defeat — he will say and do whatever it
takes to get back in the good.

But none of the change is ever real. This man doesn’t evolve. He doesn’t
grow. He doesn’t grow up.

He is stuck and stunted. He is a creature of instinct and that instinct
is base and animalistic, survival-centered, without core conviction of a
prevailing character.

The way Trump handled — and failed to handle
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>the pandemic in its early
months no doubt led to the deaths of people who should not have died. He
was thinking of himself, his political prospects, and nothing else.

American lives were collateral damage.

Now, his calculus has finally shifted: It’s hurting him more to ignore
the virus than to engage it. So he has done a 180 and now wants to
pretend to be in charge, mature and not completely dismissive of the
science that could save us.

But even now, this is not about the American people but about politics.
Should he prevail in November, the true Trump will no doubt re-emerge.
