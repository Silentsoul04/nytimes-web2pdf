# Trump Officials Float Idea of Narrow Bill to Extend Unemployment Benefits

</div>

The proposal on the eve of Republicans’ unveiling of a larger aid bill
amounts to a concession that the two parties are unlikely to reach a
deal before benefits expire.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Top Trump administration officials proposed on Sunday potentially
short-circuiting free-ranging stimulus talks with Democrats to rush
through a much narrower bill prioritizing an extension of federal
unemployment benefits that are set to expire this week for millions of
Americans.

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said he would now like to
see lawmakers act this week to extend and alter the unemployment
program, give tax credits to businesses to help ease reopening costs and
grant employers new liability protections — while setting aside a long
list of other objectives, including Democrats’ priorities.

“Perhaps we put that forward, get that passed, as we can negotiate on
the rest of the bill in the weeks to come,” Mr. Meadows said on ABC’s
“This Week.”

The proposal, echoed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in his own
Sunday morning interview, was a last-ditch effort by Republicans to
prevent the program from lapsing as signs mounted that the nation’s
economy was once again weakening amid a [resurgence of coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
But as they prepared to roll out their own more expansive relief
legislation on Monday, it amounted to a concession that Republicans,
slowed by their own internal divisions, were unlikely to reach a deal on
a comprehensive relief package with Democrats before millions begin
losing a [$600-a-week
benefit](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/24/business/economy/600-unemployment-benefits.html)
that has helped contain the economic carnage.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With Democrats already on record in opposition to a piecemeal approach,
a narrow fix is almost certainly dead on arrival. Republicans know that,
suggesting their Sunday proposal may in part be a **** negotiating
tactic laying the groundwork to blame the opposition party when the
funds ultimately expire.

Democrats passed their own [$3 trillion
proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/politics/house-simulus-vote.html)
— which also includes money to bail out states and cities, fully fund
the $600 federal jobless benefit and infuse billions more into the
nation’s health care system — in May and view the time pinch now as a
problem of Republicans’ making that only gives them more leverage in
shaping a final bill.

“We’ve been anxious to negotiate for two months and 10 days,” Speaker
Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” She
said Congress could not leave town for its annual August recess until a
deal was struck and noted that she spent the weekend waiting to hear
from the other party and begin
talks.

“This is an emergency,” Ms. Pelosi added. “Maybe they don’t understand.
I don’t know what they have against working families in America to keep
this going so long.”

In addition to a difference in negotiating strategy, the two sides have
very different views about how to handle even the narrow set of issues
identified by the White House. Republicans are proposing altering the
jobless benefit program to replace the $600 flat weekly payments with a
plan that would replace about 70 percent of a worker’s lost wages — a
change Democrats are unlikely to endorse. And Democrats strongly oppose
an effort by Republicans to give many employers new protections from
lawsuits from their workers, patients or students.

Even before engaging Democrats, Senate Republicans and the White House
have struggled to come to terms on their own $1 trillion proposal. They
[blew through a series of self-imposed
deadlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/republicans-stimulus-coronavirus.html)
last week as they fought over how to structure changes to the
unemployment benefit system, whether to include a [payroll tax cut
pushed by President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/payroll-tax-cut-trump-recession.html)
and whether to tie funds for schools to a commitment that they reopen in
person this fall.

Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Meadows now claim to be on the same page as Senate
Republicans, and after working through the weekend to iron out details,
they now plan to begin unveiling the legislative package Monday
afternoon.

“It’s just down to a handful of items where we believe a phone call here
and there should be able to resolve it,” Mr. Meadows told reporters as
he left Capitol Hill early Sunday evening, after a rare weekend meeting
with Senate staff members and Mr. Mnuchin.

Formal talks with Democrats could follow, but Senator Mitch McConnell,
Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, predicted on Friday that
they could take “weeks.”

Even then, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina,
predicted on Sunday that months after voting unanimously on the first
stimulus bill, much of his party would now be unwilling to support any
relief bill. Outright opposition to additional stimulus from the
Republicans’ right flank may only further empower Democrats when
two-party talks begin.

“Half the Republicans are going to vote no to any Phase 4 package,” Mr.
Graham said on Fox News. “That’s just a fact.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to the unemployment benefits change and liability
protections, the Republican legislation is expected to include $105
billion for schools and billions of dollars more for testing, contact
tracing and vaccine distribution. Some of the education funds would be
reserved for elementary and secondary schools that are reopening and
bringing students back to a more traditional, in-person
setting.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The bill is likely to provide for another round of stimulus checks to
American families, though it remains unclear who would be eligible to
receive those payments. Larry Kudlow, the director of the National
Economic Council, said on Sunday that the checks would be worth $1,200,
though he did not detail who precisely would receive them.

The largest sticking point, though, has been the effort to scale back
unemployment insurance benefits. The White House and congressional
Republicans largely agree that the $600 weekly payment established in
the $2.2 trillion stimulus law on top of state unemployment pay is too
generous, in some cases providing recipients more money than they
received in their job, and discourages people from returning to work.

“The original unemployment benefits actually paid people to stay home,
and actually a lot of people got more money staying at home than they
would going back to work,” Mr. Meadows said on Sunday. “So the president
has been very clear, our Republican senators have been very clear, we’re
not going to extend that provision.”

Democrats, who want to extend the current benefit through the end of the
year, say Republicans’ plan would present significant technical hurdles
and cut funds to Americans when they need it. When Democrats in March
proposed matching 100 percent of a worker’s prior income, Labor
Department officials said that antiquated state unemployment systems
would make it too complicated to execute.

The National Association of State Workforce Agencies also warned Capitol
Hill this week that such a significant change to the current program was
likely to take months for states to carry out, according to a memo
obtained by The New York Times, meaning that it would take even longer
for Americans to start receiving the benefits again.

Even though the [benefits program is set to expire at the end of
July](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html),
workers in most states are already losing access to the expanded
unemployment payments. Experts fear further economic turbulence if the
program is not quickly reinstated.

After a Saturday meeting with Senate staff on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mnuchin
and Mr. Meadows said they also planned to include a number of tax
incentives in their bill to help businesses trying to reopen, as well as
language providing for what Mr. Meadows described as “manufacturing
incentives to make sure we can support American jobs.”

And Mr. Kudlow said on Sunday that the White House was looking to
include an extension on a moratorium on evictions that just expired.

“We will lengthen the eviction” moratorium, he said. “We will lengthen
it.”
