In Lexington, Va., where Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson are buried,
people are reassessing the town’s ties to a legacy that symbolizes
slavery and oppression.

LEXINGTON, Va. — It’s a short drive in Lexington from a home on
Confederate Circle past the [Stonewall Jackson Memorial
Cemetery](https://lexingtonvirginia.com/directory/attractions/stonewall-jackson-memorial-cemetery)
and over to the [Robert E. Lee Hotel](https://roberteleehotel.com/),
where locals like to stop for a drink.

There may be tourists there looking for directions to the [Lee
Chapel](https://my.wlu.edu/lee-chapel-and-museum), or one of the two
Stonewall Jackson statues in town. They might see a Washington and Lee
University student paddling a canoe down the Maury River, named for the
Confederate oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury.

If medical treatment is needed, residents can head to the Stonewall
Jackson Hospital. For groceries, there’s a Food Lion at Stonewall
Square, which isn’t far from Rebel Ridge Road, just up the way from
Stonewall Street and Jackson Avenue.

For 150 years Lexington, a picturesque city nestled in Virginia’s Blue
Ridge Mountains, has been known to the outside world as the final
resting place of Lee, the Confederacy’s commanding general during the
Civil War, and Jackson, whom Lee referred to as his “right arm.” They
form the basis of a daily existence here that has long been tethered to
the iconography of the Civil War and its two most famous Confederate
generals, whose legacy has seeped into the town’s culture like the July
humidity.

But Lexington is no longer a bastion of conservatism. It is a liberal
college town of about 7,000 people that voted [60 percent for Hillary
Clinton four years
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/virginia), and in
2018 gave [70 percent of its vote to the Democratic Senate
candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia-senate),
Tim Kaine. Black Lives Matter signs dot the windows of downtown stores,
and residents haven’t backed a Republican for president since Ronald
Reagan.

These dueling sensibilities place Lexington at particularly delicate
intersection of the [national debate over Confederate monuments and
emblems](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/confederate-statues-photos.html).
As Americans protesting racial injustice have torn down statues and
memorials to Confederates, the town finds itself reassessing its
identity, divided between the growing imperative to eradicate symbols of
slavery and decades of cultural and economic ties to the Confederates
who fought to preserve it.

“When you’re surrounded by all of the symbols, it just is a way of
life,” said Marylin Alexander, 67, the lone Black member of the City
Council. “It was not until recently that there was a realization for me
that there was such an outcry from the community, that felt these
symbols and signs needed to come down or be changed.”

City Council meetings in July have been almost entirely devoted to the
question of the city-owned cemetery named for Jackson; [one session
lasted five hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip6tg5VIbCE), ending
with a unanimous after-midnight vote to remove signs bearing Jackson’s
name. A second meeting began with pleas from residents to put the signs
back up. The council plans a session on Friday to discuss new names,
with a vote possible in September.

“I long for the days of people complaining about potholes and not
heritage,” said Lexington’s mayor, Frank Friedman.

Ms. Alexander said it had never occurred to her to propose taking
Jackson’s name off the cemetery, believing that it would have no support
from white Lexingtonians. “Most of my life I have come to realize that
these are things that have just been, this is the way it is and this is
the way it’s always going to be,” she said.

For decades, the names of Lexington’s Confederate forebears have mostly
gone unchallenged. A 2011 City Council vote to forbid flying the
Confederate flag on municipal flagpoles drew a lawsuit, [eventually
dismissed by a federal appeals
court](https://casetext.com/case/sons-of-confederate-veterans-v-city-of-lexington-2),
from the local chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans; until this
spring no one had proposed removing Jackson’s name from the cemetery,
where a towering statue of the general rises above his family plot.

At Washington and Lee, students’ degrees still come [with portraits of
its two
namesake](https://www.law.com/2019/11/20/robert-e-lee-on-your-diploma-some-law-students-say-no-thanks/?slreturn=20200625074259)s,
and at the Virginia Military Institute, where Jackson taught before the
war, first-year students are required to [re-enact the 1864 Battle of
New
Market](https://www.vmi.edu/archives/civil-war-and-new-market/battle-of-new-market/new-market-ceremony-history/)

Still, attitudes have started to change in recent years. [Grace

year the local Boy Scout council [changed its name from the Stonewall

Bigger changes are now afoot in town, which has a Black population of
just under 9 percent. Carilion, the Roanoke, Va.-based health care
conglomerate that owns the Stonewall Jackson Hospital, said Thursday
that [it would change the name to Rockbridge Community
Hospital](https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2020/07/24/carilion-to-rename-lexingtons-stonewall-jackson-hospital/).
Francesco Benincasa, whose family owns the Robert E. Lee Hotel, said
Friday that it would be renamed “The Gin” starting next month.

“It’s a little hard to brand hospitality after generals,” Mr. Benincasa
said in an interview.

Adama Kamara grew up in Lexington, attending preschool in a church named
for Stonewall Jackson. [A 2020 graduate of Emory
University](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/05/er_commencement_award_orator_kamara/campus.html),
in Atlanta, she had never protested the city’s Confederate memorials,
but when the City Council met on July 2 to debate the cemetery’s name
she called in via video conference.

“It’s not just the history that’s shameful, it’s the way the people are
so committed to preserving it in this town,” she told city officials.
“This preservation has caused me deep pain.”

Almost instantly, Ms. Kamara, 22, began receiving supportive text
messages and emails from former classmates, teachers and longtime
friends in town, people with whom she’d never before discussed the
city’s Confederate forefathers. She and other young people, Lexington
natives who’d gone away to college but returned during the coronavirus
pandemic, began organizing to protest the city’s street names, statues
and the local public school curriculum, which they said focused too much
on lionizing local Confederate history at the expense of America’s Black
experience.

“I don’t think we have ever been given the space to say we as Black
people feel very uncomfortable about this,” Ms. Kamara said. “We have
been silently thinking these things and silently compartmentalized this,
but until we started hearing each other we had no idea that we all felt
this way.”

It did not take long for resistance to removing Jackson’s name from the
cemetery to grow.

Representative Ben Cline, a Republican who represents Lexington in
Congress, [wrote on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/48631937877/posts/10158889404357878/?d=n):
“I suppose they’ll rename it something like ‘Lexington Cemetery: Now
with Surprise Inside\!’ Or if they want to be more accurate, something
like ‘Future Democrat Voter Quarry.’” His office did not respond to
phone calls, emails or text messages seeking an interview.

Heather Hopkins Barone, a local marketer, wrote to the City Council that
she had more than 2,000 names on a petition opposing the change.

“You cannot erase history because a few people are offended,” she wrote
in the letter that she also shared [on a Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/historicdowntownlexingtonvirginia/posts/1897047810425491)devoted
to local affairs. “The affect that it will also have on the tourism
industry and the Alumni will destroy this town.”

Tourism is the biggest component of the city’s revenues after property
taxes, and the biggest economic drivers are the two universities, which
are inextricably linked to Lee and
Jackson.

In a house two blocks from a downtown shopping strip that includes the
Red Hen — [a restaurant briefly
famous](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/us/politics/sarah-huckabee-sanders-restaurant.html)
for refusing to serve then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders in 2018 — Ellen Darlene Bane, 64, flies three flags: The
Confederate battle flag, a flag that combines the Confederate emblem
with the Virginia state seal and the yellow Gadsden flag that’s become
associated with the Tea Party.

Ms. Bane, who lives across the street from a Black church, the Gospel
Way Church of God in Christ, said she began flying the flags six years
ago and has never received a complaint. She called the movement to
remove Lee and Jackson’s names “crap” and predicted escalating racial
tensions in Lexington.

“Everybody’s getting racist,” she said. “It’s going to be the Blacks
against the whites.”

Lexington’s universities are facing their own reckoning. At Washington
and Lee, [79 percent of the faculty voted on
July 6](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/07/06/faculty-resoundingly-votes-change-name-washington-lee/)
to strip Lee’s name from the school, prompting the board of trustees to
announce “[a thoughtful and deliberative
process](https://www.wlu.edu/the-w-l-story/leadership/board-of-trustees/messages-from-the-board/)”
to examine Lee’s legacy.

One of the leading proponents of keeping the Lee name is Lucas E. Morel,
[an Abraham Lincoln
scholar](https://my.wlu.edu/directory/profile?ID=x1338) who is chairman
of the politics department. He argued that the name honors Lee’s
contributions to the school — [he led its revival after the
war](https://www.wlu.edu/the-w-l-story/university-history/) — without
making a judgment about his leadership of the Confederate army.

“We can separate Lee’s generalship of the Confederacy and his symbolism
as patron saint of the Lost Cause from his laudable contribution to the
university,” Professor Morel said. “To remove Lee’s name is to say,
‘Thank you for the gift of saving this college, but we don’t
appreciate that contribution to such an extent that we think we should
continue to honor you.’’’

At the Virginia Military Institute, until 2015 all first-year students
were required to salute the statue of Jackson when passing it. A public
university, the school has retained its conservative politics, well
after the [Supreme Court ordered it to admit women
in 1996](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/22/us/defiant-vmi-to-admit-women-but-will-not-ease-rules-for-them.html).

But Virginia’s state politics, which govern the school, have changed.
[Democrats control the state
legislature](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/virginia-elections.html).
Gov. Ralph Northam, a 1981 V.M.I. graduate who [is working to take down
state-owned Confederate
monuments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/robert-e-lee-statue-richmond.html),
“has confidence that V.M.I.’s Board of Visitors will do the right
thing,” said his spokesman, Grant Neely.

Jennifer Carroll Foy, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who in
2003 was among the first group of Black women to graduate from V.M.I.,
said the Jackson statue should be
moved<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>to a museum.

“We can’t say in Virginia that we’re open for business but we’re closed
to diversity and inclusion,” said Ms. Foy, who is now running for
governor. “No child looks at a Confederate monument and feels
inspired.”

Stonewall Jackson Cemetery ought to be the first move to pivot the
town’s identity away from its Confederate past.

“Our small business owners, they have products to sell, meals to
prepare, they want their tables filled in their restaurants,” he said.
“I will feel bad if they lose one customer because we renamed the
cemetery. But I think we might gain two customers for every one we might
lose in the long run if we’re not so one-dimensional.”
