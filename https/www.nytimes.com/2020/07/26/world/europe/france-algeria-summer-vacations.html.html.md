# For French-Algerian Families, Virus Disrupts Cherished Summer Ritual

</div>

Holidays in Algeria are a cornerstone of the cross-cultural identity of
many French people with roots there. This year, they are stuck at home,
and the pain is acute: “It’s sacred for us to leave.”

TOULOUSE, France — Sitting around a table strewn with steaming cups of
mint tea, a dozen women were sharing memories of their summer holidays
in their homeland, Algeria.

Malika Haï recalled sweltering days spent with her cousins near the
beaches. Samia Tran described the cheerful family dinners around
traditional dishes.

And Zohra Benkebane, almost an hour into the conversation, was the first
to burst into tears.

“We all have a lump in our throats,” Ms. Tran said as she hugged her
sobbing friend. “It’s too hard. We need to go home.”

For many French citizens of Algerian descent whose families migrated
across the Mediterranean in the second half of the 20th century, summer
holidays in Algeria are a deep-rooted tradition. Every year thousands of
people venture off toward what they commonly call the “bled*”* — a word
derived from Arabic that refers to the countryside.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Leaving for the bled ** is a form of holiday routine,” said Jennifer
Bidet, a sociologist at the Paris Descartes University who estimated,
based on official statistics, that 82 percent of French people of
Algerian origin had spent at least one holiday in Algeria during
childhood, while 34 percent returned every year.

But with the Covid-19 pandemic still raging, Algeria is keeping its
borders tightly closed until further notice. That effectively forbids
vacations that had become a cornerstone of the cross-cultural identity
of many French-Algerian families, much to their dismay.

“Holidays in the bled are a cultural bridge,” said Mustapha Benzitouni,
a 45-year-old French-Algerian. “It allows people to rediscover an
identity through their parents, through their belonging to a people,
through their belonging to a culture.”

Perhaps nowhere has the Algerian travel ban been felt more acutely than
in Toulouse, a city of about 500,000 people in southwestern France that
was shaped by waves of immigration.

Hundreds of Toulouse families of Algerian descent are now stranded at
home, unable to afford, or simply unwilling, to spend summer vacations
anywhere but
Algeria.

“It’s sacred for us to leave,” said Ms. Haï, 58, who, like many
Algerians of her generation, mixed Arabic and French when speaking.
“During a normal summer, in July and August, the neighborhood goes
completely empty.”

The neighborhood to which Ms. Haï referred is Le Mirail, an impoverished
area outside the city center that is plagued by drug trafficking and
where about 30,000 people live in dreary apartment blocks. A large
majority of the residents come from Algeria, with other families from
Morocco and Tunisia, who also often visit their homelands in France’s
former North African colonies in July and
August.

Unlike Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia have recently reopened their borders
to tourists and their citizens living abroad, meaning some of Le
Mirail’s residents can go ahead with their summer plans.

For Algerians, though, the travel ban means parents need to come up with
alternative plans for idle children.

“Spending the summer here is impossible, there’s hardly anything to do,”
said Djelloul Zitouni, 38, a father of three who was playing with his
children on a small playground nestled in the middle of Le Mirail.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like every year, Mr. Zitouni — who migrated to France from Algeria 14
years ago to work as a driver — had planned on spending August in his
hometown, the coastal city of Oran. “Eleven months of hard work for one
month of dreams,” he said.

This year Mr. Zitouni said he would try to “get by with the children,”
taking them to the local swimming pool and a few days at the
seaside.

Worried that bored teenagers could lead to trouble, local community
groups and the authorities have tried to alleviate the doldrums by
organizing activities in Le Mirail.

On a recent afternoon, dozens of families, mostly of Algerian heritage,
gathered on large plots of grass bordering a small lake in the
neighborhood to take part in painting workshops, water games and dance
classes.

But Soraya Amalou, a volunteer, had no illusions that these activities
could make up for the loss of a genuine summer escape. “Spending
holidays here means no holidays. In this neighborhood, you suffer from
tiny apartments, from insecurity, you suffer from everything,” she said.

By contrast, summer vacations in Algeria, which Ms. Haï likened to a
“breath of fresh air,” are much anticipated all year long, and the
rituals leading up to the trip — from the tickets booked well in advance
to the suitcases filled with presents for the cousins — have shaped
several migrant
generations.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Mr. Stora said that “returning to the bled” was a way for
French-Algerians to “reconnect with a national filiation.”

But while French-Algerians can be made to feel like they don’t fully fit
in with France, they also “are badly regarded in Algeria,” Mr. Stora
said, where they are seen as French citizens whose Algerian heritage is
but a detail.

“They treat us like French bourgeois and raise prices as soon as we
arrive,” said Ahmed Adjelout, 72, who was waiting in a travel agency in
downtown Toulouse in the hope of rescheduling his July 22 flight to
Oran, which had just been canceled.

Mr. Adjelout, a retiree with a beret thrust upon his head, recalled how
he would be called “an emigrant, a stranger” by Algerians whenever he
returned to the country he left in 1967.

“The paradox,” Mr. Adjelout added, “is that in Algeria, we’re seen as
French and in France, we’re seen as
Algerians.”

This ambiguous situation — [straddling two cultures and belonging to
neither](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/world/africa/france-algeria-immigration-discrimination-racism.html)
— can make building an identity a challenge for the estimated 2.5
million people of Algerian descent in France, especially for second- and
third-generation immigrants for whom Algeria is merely a summer getaway.

“It’s tricky to deal with both sides, the French and the Algerian, no
culture really welcomes us,” said Fatiha Zelmat, whose mother, Naouel
Matti, has taken her to [the ancient stone alleys of
Algiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/africa/algeria-casbah-preservation-plan.html),
the Algerian capital, every summer since she was born — except this
year.

Ms. Zelmat, 21, said she had fond memories of her time in Algeria, but
she also condemned a more conservative culture that forbids women from
smoking or wearing shorts.

“I have mixed feelings about Algeria,” she said.

Ms. Bidet, the sociologist, said that for some young people, spending
holidays in Algeria — where they can afford activities that would be far
beyond their means in France — is an opportunity to escape the poor
social status to which they are normally relegated.

But, she noted, this reversal of social hierarchies is only temporary
and does nothing to address the problems of integration they face in
France.

Ms. Matti, who covered her hair with an elegant white veil, said that
young people of Algerian descent like her daughter were integrated
neither in Algeria nor in France, where they often grow up in deeply
socially segregated neighborhoods like Le Mirail.

“Our children stop going to Algeria because they don’t feel they belong
there,” Ms. Matti said. “But where will they go
instead?”
