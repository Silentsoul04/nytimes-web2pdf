LONDON — Hilary Mantel’s “[The Mirror and the
Light](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/books/review-mirror-light-hilary-mantel.html)”
— the conclusion to her Thomas Cromwell trilogy — was announced here on
Tuesday as one of 13 novels competing for this year’s Booker Prize, the
British literary award.

Anne Tyler’s “[Redhead by the Side of the
Road](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/books/review/redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road-anne-tyler.html)”
is also on the list. But most of the other nominated books are less
high-profile, with eight by debut novelists, including [C Pam
Zhang](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/books/c-pam-zhang-how-much-of-these-hills-is-gold.html)’s
“[How Much of These Hills Is
Gold](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/books/review/how-much-of-these-hills-is-gold-c-pam-zhang.html),”
about a Chinese-American family during the Gold Rush.

Nine of the longlisted authors are women.

“The Mirror and the Light” is focused on the final years of Thomas
Cromwell’s life, as the chief adviser to King Henry VIII. The book was a
sensation in Britain when it was published in March, despite its length:
It is 875 pages long.

“Like Henry VIII, bloat has set in,” wrote Robbie Millen, [in a review
for the Times of
London](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mirror-and-the-light-by-hilary-mantel-review-5d73zvlpv).
“It’s true that passages of noun-bloat swell the volume to gargantuan
heft,” wrote Simon Schama [in a review for The Financial
Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e52e9200-57bb-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc?accessToken=zwAAAXOQsTOYkdPlLpIAV7sR6tOlKN0Plx_rvA.MEQCIHEpEfi4JW9qMeSu48FLNSBGC9GMiUE00t5wnOiIlZutAiB3x-V2IiTLZddRbMg_NE2IUOU4ExHG0C1bv0HNsAPQBw&sharetype=gift?token=92f7106d-6113-49a3-b937-400e0280d1e8),
“but this reader wouldn’t want a word less.”

Parul Sehgal, in [a review for The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/books/review-mirror-light-hilary-mantel.html),
said the length was appropriate. “This is not a young man’s book, not a
book of striving,” she wrote. “It is a novel of late middle age, a novel
of preserving what one has seized.”

If “The Mirror and the Light” wins, Mantel would become the first author
to take the prize three times. She [won in 2009 for “Wolf
Hall”](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/books/07booker.html) and
[again in 2012 for “Bring Up the
Bodies](https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/hilary-mantel-wins-a-second-booker-prize/),”
the two other Cromwell novels.

Several novels in the running focus on race, including [Kiley
Reid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/books/review/inside-the-list-kiley-reid.html)’s
“[Such a Fun
Age](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/books/review/such-a-fun-age-kiley-reid.html),”
about two white people who compete for a Black woman’s attention to
signal their progressive credentials. “There are voices from minorities
often unheard, stories that are fresh, bold and absorbing,” said
Margaret Busby, the chair of the judges, in a statement.

The other judges, who chose the 13 titles from 162 submitted books,
include [Lee
Child](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/books/jack-reacher-lee-child-wyoming.html),
the thriller writer, and the poet Lemn Sissay. A shortlist will be
announced in September, and the winning title will be unveiled in
November. The author of that book will receive £50,000, or about
$64,000.

Last year’s prize was shared by Margaret Atwood for “[The
Testaments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/testaments-margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale.html)”
and Bernardine Evaristo for “[Girl, Woman,
Other](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/books/review-girl-woman-other-bernardine-evaristo.html),”
after the judges decided to rebel against their own rules [and split the
prize](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/books/booker-prize-winner-atwood-evaristo.html),
a decision that [was met with widespread
derision](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/15/bernardine-evaristo-margaret-atwood-share-booker-prize-award).

This year’s longlist seems unlikely to cause similar controversy,
although it does include six authors born in the United States, as well
as three others who claim American citizenship. There have [been regular
complaints](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/books/booker-longlist-margaret-atwood.html)
about Americans’ eligibility for the prize, something only allowed in
2014.

Before then, it was limited to books by writers from Britain, Ireland
and Commonwealth countries (plus South Africa and, later, Zimbabwe).

The full longlist is:

  - Diane Cook, “The New Wilderness”

  - Tsitsi Dangarembga, “[This Mournable
    Body](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/books/review/tsitsi-dangarembga-this-mournable-body.html?searchResultPosition=1)”
