## Britons returning from Spain face quarantine

Often criticized for a slow response to the coronavirus, the British
government quickly [imposed a quarantine this weekend on anyone arriving
from
Spain](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/europe/Spain-quarantine-UK-travel.html),
after coronavirus cases spiked there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the speed blindsided many Britons who had traveled to Spain assuming
they could return home without restrictions — including the
transportation secretary responsible for aviation policy, Grant Shapps,
who was on vacation.

Travelers will now have to isolate themselves for 14 days when they
return. As a result, many in Britain are rethinking their plans, and
some airlines canceled flights to Spain.

The decision had been made after data received on Friday showed a jump
in Spanish cases, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said.

**Details:** Scotland, which had lifted its quarantine rules for Spain
just a few days ago, said it would reimpose them. France on Friday also
advised against travel to Catalonia, Spain’s northeastern region
bordering France, where hundreds of thousands of residents were in
temporary lockdown this month.

In the last week, Spain’s daily average has topped 1,700 cases — as many
as Britain, France and Italy combined.

## Russian street rallies continue for third week

Tens of thousands of demonstrators [rallied for the third straight
weekend](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/world/europe/russia-protests-putin-khabarovsk.html)
in Khabarovsk, in Russia’s Far East. The outpouring of anger, fueled by
the arrest of a popular governor, has little precedent in modern Russia.
It highlights the discontent that President Vladimir Putin now faces
across the country.

Just this month, Mr. Putin won a scripted referendum that will allow him
to stay in office until 2036. Still, public disenchantment with
corruption, stifled freedoms and stagnant incomes has worsened with the
pandemic.

**Bigger picture:** Across the country, fear of the police and the
seeming hopelessness of effecting change has largely kept people off the
streets, and many believe an alternative to Mr. Putin could be worse. He
still enjoys about a 60 percent approval rating, though that is falling.

**Related:** Facebook hired [a Ukrainian group battling Russian
disinformation to flag misleading
posts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-facebook-fake-news.html).
But the group has been battling accusations of ties to the Ukrainian far
right and of bias in its fact-checking — raising questions about who is
a neutral fact checker in a country at
war.

## Hungary’s independent press comes under attack

Hungary’s most widely read news site was thrown into disarray last week
after the organization’s editor in chief was fired and [scores of
journalists quit in
protest](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/europe/hungary-poland-media-freedom-index.html),
as the government moved closer to complete control over the country’s
media landscape.

The takeover of Index.hu’s advertising unit by an ally of Prime Minister
Viktor Orban was part of an effort to limit dissenting voices and
silence critics. The site is one of many independent media outlets in
Central Europe that have been pressured financially and politically by
governments bent on controlling public discourse.

**Context:** The decline of such outlets in Hungary is part of a
troubling pattern. Since returning to power, Mr. Orban has rewritten
Hungary’s constitution to favor his party and has overhauled the
judicial system. Poland’s press also faces pressure following a
presidential election.

**Quote of note:** “Imagine all the media in a U.S. state were to come
under the ownership of a single political group,” one media think tank
commentator said, “and all of these media outlets are funded by taxpayer
money.”

For many French citizens of Algerian descent whose families migrated
across the Mediterranean, summer in Algeria is a cornerstone of their
cross-cultural identity — what they call “bled,” a word derived from
Arabic that refers to the countryside.

### Here’s what else is happening

**U.S. unrest:** Weeks of violent clashes between federal agents and
protesters in Portland, Ore., galvanized thousands to march through the
streets of U.S. cities over the weekend. In Seattle, the police
confronted a crowd of about 5,000 people, some of whom were setting
fires, they said. Officers [fired flash grenades, and showered
protesters with pepper
spray](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/us/protests-seattle-portland.html).

**Nantes fire:** A Rwandan refugee who volunteered at the 15th-century
cathedral in France has confessed to [setting a fire that severely
damaged the interior of the
church](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/europe/fire-nantes-cathedral-arrest.html)
this month. Prosecutors have charged him with arson.

**In memoriam:** [Olivia de
Havilland](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/movies/olivia-de-havilland-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1),
an actress who gained movie immortality in “Gone With the Wind,” died on
Sunday in Paris. She was 104 and one of the last surviving stars of
Hollywood’s fabled Golden Age.

**Paris deputy quits:** The longtime deputy mayor resigned on Thursday,
after protests over [his links with Gabriel
Matzneff](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/europe/paris-deputy-mayor-resigns-matzneff.html),
a French writer once embraced by France’s elite who openly promoted
pedophilia for
decades.

## A pandemic respite for Times correspondents

*Stationed all over the world, foreign correspondents can feel isolated.
Alissa J. Rubin, our Baghdad bureau chief, wrote about* [*a weekly call
with
colleagues*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/insider/international-journalists-meeting.html)
*that has helped them deal with the pandemic. Here’s an excerpt.*

At The New York Times, foreign correspondents are a disparate group. We
work in different countries, in different time zones, in wildly
different cultures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Only rarely do we know our colleagues in other regions, and when we do
run into them, we often feel a bit shy talking to them — what would
Bangkok and Warsaw have in common?

But the coronavirus changed that. It gave us common ground. In ways we
never could have anticipated, Covid-19 turned out to be a leveler — of
differences between editors and reporters, Sinophiles and Europeanists,
newer reporters and “old hands.”

What brought us closer together was a weekly group video meeting that
began as a result of a voluntary group session with a psychiatrist. The
idea was to help those far from home feel less anxious as the pandemic
spread to more and more of the countries where we lived and
worked.

We discuss the mundane, such as ordering food or which Netflix or Amazon
Prime series we are watching, but we also discuss the professional: the
pros and cons of working with sources through video; long-distance
transportation options (for those of us who can travel); where to stay
(hotel or Airbnb?).

And, because all of us are living the story that we are reporting,
sometimes we talk about the deeply personal, like writing frustrations
and strategies for avoiding depression during a lockdown (one
suggestion: have a call every day with a colleague).

Ernesto Londoño, the Rio de Janeiro bureau chief, offered advice on
meditation. Chris Buckley, a China correspondent who had been through a

Our latest episode is an examination of the truth, in a moment when
facts can seem malleable.  
• Here’s today’s [Mini Crossword
puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini), and a clue:
“Sesame Street” muppet who lives in a trash can (five letters). [You
can find all our puzzles here](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords).
