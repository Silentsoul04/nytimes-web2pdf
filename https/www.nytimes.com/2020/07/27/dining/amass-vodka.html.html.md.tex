Amass, distilled in Copenhagen, delivers floral notes for that martini
or tonic drink, without gin's lash of juniper.

If you prefer vodka to gin, with tonic or in a martini, you might
consider trying the new Amass Botanic Vodka from Denmark. It heads in
the direction of gin, without the aggressive juniper profile. The vodka
is distilled from wheat and mixed with marigold, chamomile and lemon,
ingredients that have been processed in an aquavit still, for an
80-proof, delicately floral, citric spirit that's mellow on the palate.
Though the brand is based in Los Angeles, the vodka is distilled in
Copenhagen, and has no connection to the highly regarded restaurant of
the same name in that city.

Amass Botanic Vodka, \$35.99,
