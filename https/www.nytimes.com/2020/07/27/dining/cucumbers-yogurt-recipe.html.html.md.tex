The most memorable summer meals don't hinge on a single perfect dish.
Instead, it is the interplay of multiple plates and platters --- like a
great mezze --- that transforms them into an occasion. And a
well-executed simple side is as critical to the whole menu as anything
that may have taken hours to compose.

This salad combines two components, crisp cucumbers and creamy yogurt
dressing, to lend a cooling counterpoint to any summer menu.

To make, toss bite-size pieces of cucumber with a spiced oil that's been
warmed just enough to make the coriander, cumin and red-pepper flakes
bloom. Splash in a little vinegar, then set aside in the refrigerator to
pick up the spices' flavors. To a thick, full-fat yogurt or labneh, toss
in a series of herbs: Cucumber and dill, or cucumber and mint? Add both,
and some parsley and lemon zest. Each element folds into the others
without overpowering the whole.

In the finished dish, the cold cucumbers retain their freshness, and
carry a little heat, as well as earthy notes from the other spices. The
lemon and herbs in the yogurt offer subtleties of their own while
tempering the cucumber marinade's warmth. A satisfying contrast of
textures awaits you on the plate as the crisp cucumbers sink into the
smooth, tangy yogurt. It's this balance that helps the dish stand on its
own as a snack or a simple salad.

This cold-marinated cucumber salad pairs well with sizzling kebabs right
off the grill, smoky glazed chicken thighs with a good amount of char or
sweet corn dripping with butter. It also pairs nicely with a seltzer and
lime, a gin and tonic or a chilled Riesling. With the right balance of
competing and complementary flavors, this salad is the right
accompaniment to the grilled meats or vegetables of summer, whether it's
an elaborate dinner or a leisurely alfresco lunch.
