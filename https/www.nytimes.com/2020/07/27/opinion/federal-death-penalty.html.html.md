# The Death Penalty Can Ensure ‘Justice Is Being Done’

A top Justice Department official says for many Americans the death

This month, for the first time in [17
years](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html),
the United States resumed carrying out death sentences for federal
crimes.

On July 14, [Daniel Lewis
Lee](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html)
was executed for the 1996 murder of a family, including an 8-year-old
girl, by suffocating and drowning them in the Illinois Bayou after
robbing them to fund a white-supremacist organization. On July 16,
[Wesley
Purkey](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/politics/wesley-ira-purkey-executed.html)
was executed for the 1998 murder of a teenage girl, whom he kidnapped,
raped, killed, dismembered and discarded in a septic pond. The next day,
[Dustin
Honken](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/dustin-honken-federal-execution.html)
was executed for five murders committed in 1993, including the
execution-style shooting of two young girls, their mother, and two
prospective witnesses against him in a federal prosecution for
methamphetamine trafficking.

The death penalty is a difficult issue for many Americans on moral,
religious and policy grounds. But as a legal issue, it is
straightforward. The United States Constitution expressly contemplates
“capital” crimes, and Congress has authorized the death penalty for
serious federal offenses since President George Washington signed the
Crimes Act of 1790. The American people have repeatedly ratified that
decision, including through the [Federal Death Penalty Act
of 1994](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-69-federal-death-penalty-act-1994)
signed by President Bill Clinton, the federal execution of Timothy
McVeigh under President George W. Bush and the decision by President
Barack Obama’s Justice Department to seek the death penalty against the
[Boston Marathon
bomber](https://www.wsj.com/articles/boston-marathon-bomber-appeals-death-penalty-11576152005)
and [Dylann
Roof](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dylann-roof-appeals-death-penalty-south-carolina-church-massacre-n1125341).

The recent executions reflect that consensus, as the Justice Department
has an obligation to carry out the law. The decision to seek the death
penalty against Mr. Lee was made by Attorney General Janet Reno (who
said she personally opposed the death penalty but was bound by the law)
and reaffirmed by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Purkey was prosecuted during the George W. Bush administration, and
his conviction and sentence were vigorously defended throughout the
Obama administration. The judge who imposed the death sentence on Mr.
Honken, [Mark Bennett,
said](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2020/07/17/judge-who-oversaw-dustin-honken-trial-says-evidence-overwhelming-dealth-penalty-iowa/5457829002/)
that while he generally opposed the death penalty, he would not lose any
sleep over Mr. Honken’s execution.

In a New York Times Op-Ed essay [published on
July 17](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/justice-department-federal-execution.html),
two of Mr. Lee’s lawyers criticized the execution of their client, which
they contend was carried out in a “shameful rush.” That objection
overlooks that Mr. Lee was sentenced more than 20 years ago, and his
appeals and other permissible challenges failed, up to and including the
day of his execution.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Lee’s lawyers seem to endorse a system of endless delays that
prevent a death sentence from ever becoming real. But his execution date
was announced almost a year ago, and was initially set for last
December. It was delayed when his lawyers obtained six more months of
review by unsuccessfully challenging the procedures used to carry out
his lethal injection.

After an appellate court rejected their claim as “without merit,” the
Justice Department rescheduled Mr. Lee’s execution, providing an
additional four weeks of notice. Yet on the day of the rescheduled
execution, after family members of his victims had traveled to Terre
Haute, Ind., to witness the execution, a District Court granted Mr.
Lee’s request for further review. That court entered a last-minute
reprieve that the Supreme Court has said should be an “extreme
exception.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given the long delay that had already occurred, the Justice Department
asked the Supreme Court to lift the order so the execution could
proceed. Mr. Lee’s lawyers opposed that request, insisting that
overturning the order would result in their client’s imminent execution.
After reviewing the matter, the court [granted the government’s
request](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/federal-execution.html),
rebuked the District Court for creating an unjustified last-minute
barrier, and directed that the execution could proceed.

In the final minutes before the execution was to occur, Mr. Lee’s
lawyers claimed the execution could not proceed because Mr. Lee still
had time to seek further review of an appellate court decision six weeks
earlier lifting a prior stay of execution. The Justice Department
decided to pause the execution for several hours while the appellate
court considered and promptly rejected Mr. Lee’s request. That cautious
step, taken to ensure undoubted compliance with court orders, is
irreconcilable with the suggestion that the department “rushed” the
execution or disregarded any law. Mr. Lee’s final hours awaiting his
fate were a result of his own lawyers’ choice to assert a
non-meritorious objection at the last moment.

Mr. Lee’s lawyers also disregarded the cost to victims’ families of
continued delay. Although they note that [some members of Mr. Lee’s
victims’ families opposed his
execution,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/arkansas-federal-death-penalty.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
others did not. Nor did the family members of Wesley Purkey’s victim,
Jennifer Long, who were in Terre Haute on Wednesday afternoon. When the
District Court again imposed another last-minute stoppage, granting more
time for Mr. Purkey’s lawyers to argue (among other things) that he did
not understand the reason for his execution, the Justice Department
again sought Supreme Court review.

As the hours wore on, Justice Department officials asked Ms. Long’s
father if he would prefer to wait for another day. The answer was
unequivocal: He would stay as long as it took. As Ms. Long’s stepmother
later said, “We just shouldn’t have had to wait this long.” The Supreme
Court ultimately authorized the execution just before 3 a.m. In his
final statement, Mr. Purkey apologized to “Jennifer’s family” for the
pain he had caused, contradicting the claim of his lawyers that he did
not understand the reason for his execution.

The third execution, of Dustin Honken, occurred on schedule, but still
too late for some of his victims’ families. John Duncan — the father of
the victim Lori Duncan and grandfather of her slain daughters, Kandace
(age 10) and Amber (age 6) — had urged Mr. Honken’s execution for years.
As John Duncan was dying of cancer in 2018, he asked family members to
promise they would witness the execution on his behalf. On July 17, they
did. “Finally,” [they said in a
statement,](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/columnists/courtney-crowder/2020/07/17/dustin-honken-execution-iowa-man-executed-federal-prison-terre-haute-indiana-methamphetamine-murder/5456933002/)
“justice is being done.”

Mr. Lee’s lawyers and other death penalty opponents are entitled to
disagree with that sentiment. But if the United States is going to allow
capital punishment, a white-supremacist triple murderer would seem the
textbook example of a justified case. And if death sentences are going
to be imposed, they cannot just be hypothetical; they eventually have to
be carried out, or the punishment will lose its deterrent and
retributive effects.

Rather than forthrightly opposing the death penalty and attempting to
change the law through democratic means, however, Mr. Lee’s lawyers and
others have chosen the legal and public-relations equivalent of
guerrilla war. They sought to obstruct by any means the administration
of sentences that Congress permitted, juries supported and the Supreme
Court approved. And when those tactics failed, they accused the Justice
Department of “a grave threat to the rule of law,” even though it
operated entirely within the law enacted by Congress and approved by the
Supreme Court. The American people can decide for themselves which
aspects of that process should be considered “shameful.”
