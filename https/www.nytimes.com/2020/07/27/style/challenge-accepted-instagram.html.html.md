# ‘Challenge Accepted’: Why Women Are Posting Black-and-White Selfies

</div>

A campaign that purports to be about “women supporting women” is filling
people’s Instagram feeds with striking, if opaque, imagery.

Over the past several days, many Instagram feeds have been overrun with
black-and-white images of women both famous and not.

These photographs are often posed and filtered, taken from flattering
angles and accompanied by benign captions about “supporting women.”

“Love this simple way to lift each other up. \#challengeaccepted. Thank
you for nominating me @vanessabryant,” the model Cindy Crawford posted
on Monday along with a black-and-white [photo of herself strolling on a
beach](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDJnHlQFuQi/?igshid=1vzk7hu5crx15)
that looks ripped from a Calvin Klein advertisement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The premise of the “challenge accepted” trend is that these photos
promote female empowerment, and that nominating friends to take part in
the campaign is a way for [women to support each
other](https://twitter.com/SoniAggarwal/status/1287784564262223872).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So far, more than 3 million photos have been uploaded with the
\#ChallengeAccepted hashtag; many more have appeared without it.

“The trend is still picking up with usage of the hashtag on Instagram
doubling in the last day alone,” an Instagram spokeswoman said on
Monday. “Based on the posts, we’re seeing that most of the participants
are posting with notes relating to strength and support for their
communities.”

Many women have included the hashtag \#womensupportingwomen in their
posts. “Challenge Accepted,” Khloe Kardashian wrote in an [Instagram
post on Sunday](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDH3xn1BB3W/). “To all my
Queens- Let’s spread love and remember to be a little kinder to one
another. \#womensupportingwomen.”

This is not the first time Instagram users have leveraged
black-and-white selfies in support of a vague cause. Back in 2016,
black-and-white photos with the hashtag \#ChallengeAccepted were meant
to spread a message of “[cancer
awareness](https://metro.co.uk/2016/08/29/what-is-the-black-and-white-photo-challenge-6097096/).”
Over the years the photo trend has also been used to “spread
positivity.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The challenge has circulated like chain mail. Participants nominate at
least one other woman (and often several) to post her own
black-and-white portrait. Celebrities including the actresses Kerry
Washington, Jennifer Garner, Kristen Bell and Eva Longoria have helped
the campaign gain visibility.

Cristine Abram, a public relations and influencer marketing manager for
[Later](https://later.com/), a social media marketing firm, said that [a
video](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sexism-congress.html)
of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking out against
Representative Ted Yoho’s [sexist remarks against
her](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/sunday-review/aoc-daughters-ted-yoho.html)
on the floor of Congress last week led to a spike in social media posts
about feminism and female empowerment, which may have contributed to the
latest round of black-and-white photos.

“That was the spark that led to the resurgence of the hashtag
challenge,” said Ms. Abram. “It’s all to do with female empowerment.
There was this hashtag that already existed to raise awareness around
other large issues. Tapping into that allowed participants to gain
traction a lot faster because the algorithm was already familiar with
the hashtag.”

A representative from Instagram said that the earliest post the company
could surface for this current cycle of the challenge was posted [a week
and a half ago](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCxGfzTBmXP/) by the
Brazilian journalist Ana Paula Padrão. Others have noted that women in
Turkey began sharing black-and-white photos recently to [raise awareness
about
femicide](https://twitter.com/imaann_patel/status/1288080743198068736?s=21).

Though the portraits have spread widely, the posts themselves say very
little. Like [the black
square](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/arts/music/what-blackout-tuesday.html),
which became a symbol of solidarity with Black people but asked very
little of those who shared it, the black-and-white selfie allows users
to feel as if they’re taking a stand while saying almost nothing.
Influencers and celebrities love these types of “challenges” because
they don’t require actual advocacy, which might alienate certain
factions of their fan base.

“Ladies,” Alana Levinson, a writer, [tweeted on
Monday](https://twitter.com/alanalevinson/status/1287818379818971136),
“instead of posting that hot black-and-white selfie, why don’t we ease
into feminism with something low stakes, like cutting off your friend
who’s an abuser?”

Other women have spoken out about the backlash they have faced for
critiquing the trend. “Currently getting hate mail on instagram from
complete strangers because i said black and white selfies aren’t a
cause,”
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/OnlineAlison/status/1287804859773677568)
the [podcast host Ali Segel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDJw9mpgqc1/).
“Apparently i hate women and don’t love myself\!\!\!\!\!\! I’m minding
my own business for the rest of my life\!\!\!\!\!\!”

“I think that if this ‘movement’ featured trans women or differently
abled women, or showcased female businesses or accomplishments or women
in history, it would make more sense,” Ms. Segel explained further, in a
direct message on Twitter. “But the idea of this as a challenge or cause
is really lost on me.”

Brooke Hammerling, 46, the founder of the New New Thing, an advisory to
technology C.E.O.s, questioned the trend’s efficacy [in her weekly pop
culture
newsletter](https://medium.com/popculturemondays/pop-culture-mondays-7-20-20-3d2276f3c16)
on Monday.

“I just don’t know what it stands for,” she said by phone. “Virtually
everyone in my life has done the challenge, a lot of my friends and a
lot of people I love. I’m 100 percent for women supporting women and I’m
grateful to the women who nominated me, but I don’t understand how a
black-and-white vanity selfie does that. If we could do portraits of the
women who inspired us, that would be a little bit more in line with what
this is trying to accomplish.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other women online
[suggested](https://twitter.com/itsbooyeah/status/1287807365614534661)
that, instead of a black-and-white selfie, women should share photos of
books, articles, products and charities that benefit women. A few people
wondered whether the trend was [started by
men](https://twitter.com/wolfiecomedy/status/1287813475096387584).

Camilla Blackett, a TV writer, suggested that the campaign was little
more than a vehicle for attractive photos. “What is the point of this
[\#ChallengeAccepted](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChallengeAccepted?src=hashtag_click)
thing?” she[tweeted on
Monday](https://twitter.com/camillard/status/1287768130140246022). “Do
people not know you can just post a hot selfie for no reason?”
