President Trump’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has
tested positive for the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html),
the administration said on Monday.

Mr. O’Brien, 54, “has mild symptoms” and is working remotely from “a
secure location off site,” the administration said in a statement.

“There is no risk of exposure to the president or the vice president,”
it said. “The work of the National Security Council continues
uninterrupted.”

Mr. O’Brien is the most senior White House official known to have
contracted the virus. He typically works from a West Wing office steps
away from the Oval Office and, under normal circumstances, may see the
president several times a day.

Speaking to reporters before departing the White House on Monday
afternoon, Mr. Trump said he had heard about Mr. O’Brien but did not
know when he had tested positive. “I haven’t seen him lately,” the
president added.

Mr. O’Brien also traveled to Paris in mid-July, where he met with
several European security officials, visited an American war cemetery
and attended a Bastille Day celebration. It was unclear whether he had
become infected before or after that trip. The White House statement did
not provide further details.

released by the White House.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Larry Kudlow, Mr.
Trump’s top economic adviser, said that Mr. O’Brien believed he had
contracted the virus from his daughter. “Apparently it’s a light case,”
Mr. Kudlow said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Mr. O’Brien assumed his job in September, succeeding [John R. Bolton,
who
resigned](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/us/politics/john-bolton-national-security-adviser-trump.html)
after mounting conflicts with the president over foreign policy.

He is the latest of several White House staff members and others in the
president’s orbit who have tested positive for the coronavirus. They
include a military officer who works as a presidential valet at the
White House, as well as Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary,
Katie Miller, both of whom tested positive in early May. Last week, the
White House [closed two
cafeterias](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/white-house-employee-covid-19.html)
in its extended complex after an employee tested positive.

Mr. Pence postponed a planned trip to Arizona this month after members
of his Secret Service detail tested positive or showed symptoms of the
virus. [Kimberly
Guilfoyle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/kimberly-guilfoyle-trump-campaign-coronavirus.html),
a former Fox News commentator who is dating Donald Trump Jr., also
contracted the virus, [as
did](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-campaign-coronavirus-tulsa.html)
several Trump campaign advance staffers who helped to arrange his June
rally in Tulsa, Okla.

Mr. O’Brien’s deputy on the National Security Council, Matthew
Pottinger, was among the first White House officials to wear a mask. He
accompanied Mr. O’Brien on his trip to Paris this month.

The news of Mr. O’Brien’s infection resonated quickly across the world.

Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalist Beijing newspaper Global Times,
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1287752860021604352)
that the news about Mr. O’Brien, a leading China hawk in the
administration, “shows the pandemic has been completely out of control
in the US. No American is absolutely safe.”

“Novel coronavirus is truly US’ top enemy now,” he added.
