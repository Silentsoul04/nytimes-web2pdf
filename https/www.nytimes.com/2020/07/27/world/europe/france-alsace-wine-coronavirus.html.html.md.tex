\section{Of Wine, Hand Sanitizer and
Heartbreak}\label{of-wine-hand-sanitizer-and-heartbreak}}

Between the coronavirus and the Trump tariffs, the French wine market
has collapsed. So winemakers are --- sadly --- sending their excess
product off to another life as hand sanitizer.

HUNAWIHR, France --- The tanker-truck pulled up and it was time to let
it go. The decision to send the wine to the distillery had been made
weeks ago. It still hurt. Soon the wine would be sanitizing hand gel.

``We've got to load it up now,'' said Jérôme Mader, a 38-year-old
winemaker, muttering to himself. ``OK, I am not even going to think
about it anymore,'' he said quietly. ``It's over.''

Head down, he dragged the hoses out through his shed, affixed them to
the truck's valves with the help of the driver, walked up to his cool
cellar, and turned on the pumps. The wine --- good Alsace white wine,
drinkable wine --- coursed through the hoses and into the truck's belly.
Its fate didn't bear thinking about.

Across the emerald Alsace wine country, now carpeted in deep-green vines
--- and across France's other wine regions as well --- thousands of
winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing similar moments of
heartbreak.

The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus, combined with the
Trump administration's 25 percent tax on French wines in the trade war
dispute with Europe, has collapsed the wine market.

Mr. Mader, whose high-quality Rieslings and Gewürztraminers are sent to
fancy restaurants and shops on both sides of the Atlantic, has lost half
his sales since December.

``Covid is a catastrophe for us,'' he said.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/24/world/00france-wine2/merlin_174871080_804e4be1-60d0-478c-8585-aa8d55bcafae-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

And so some of the succulent and subtle white wine for which this region
is famous, nurtured on the stony, sunbathed Alsace slopes, will wind up
as hand sanitizer.

Like other winemakers, Mr. Mader has no room in his cellar to stock
unsold wine. ``We can't keep stocking what we haven't sold,'' he said.

The precocious 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a
month away. The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The
distillery, for modest compensation, is the only option.

The driver from the distillery had been making the rounds of winemakers
all morning. ``Some of them are taking this quite badly, because this
wine has commercial value,'' the driver, Lucas Neret, noted dryly.

``We're producing more than we can sell,'' said Thibaut Specht, a
winemaker in nearby Mittelwihr. ``We have no choice.''

Marion Borès's family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending
30 percent of its production --- 19,000 liters. ``It's like you are
saying goodbye to somebody who is very dear to you,'' she said.

``This is not exactly the destination we had in mind, when we made this
wine,'' the 27-year-old winemaker added.

The old wine is ending up in the towering steel silos of the nearby
Romann distillery, where it will be boiled down to alcohol.

In Alsace alone, over six million liters of wine, or about 1.5 million
gallons, will end up like this. Mr. Mader is sending 15 percent of his
production, wine he calls ``Edelzwicker,'' or ``noble blend'' in
Alsatian dialect. Usually sold wholesale, ``it's still pretty good,''
Mr. Mader said.

At the distillery, the odor of boiled-down wine, like the essence of a
rich beef burgundy sauce, hung heavy over the establishment on a warm
morning this week.

``We're continuously distilling,'' said Erwin Brouard, the company's
director. ``It's something that's very sad for the winemakers. Their
stocks are too big. They've got to make space. And the harvest is early
this year.''

The French government, anxious to protect its precious wine heritage, is
subsidizing the operation, compensating the some 5,000 winemakers who
have signed up so far at a fraction of the wine's value, less than \$1
per liter, in what the government calls Crisis Distillation.

``My cellar is bursting, ''said Guillaume Klauss, who owns a nearby
winery. ``If I don't send it off, I don't eat. Clearly this is tearing
me up. It's three years of work, and we're not even paid properly.''

Alsace is having to resort to Crisis Distillation for the first time in
its history although it is not unknown in other wine regions. The last
time this happened was in 2009, after the financial collapse.

``A very big majority have been battered by this crisis,'' said Francis
Backert, head of the Independent Winemakers Association of Alsace.
``These people are really hurting.'' he said.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``All the outlets are blocked,'' he added. ``Export is blocked. Trump,
Covid. There's very little going on outside France. The American market,
blocked.''

Wholesale wine traders are facing losses of 70 percent, he said.

But the monetary losses are one thing. There is also the psychological
blow.

``Look, these people have a great deal of circumspection, and shame,''
Mr. Backert said. ``They just don't want to talk about it. Obviously,
this is breaking their heart.''

Some winemakers in the region refused to be interviewed on the subject.

The relationship to their vines, and what is produced from them, is
personal as much as financial. Many live in modest houses, carrying on a
family trade that often goes back centuries. The date carved above the
original Borès cellar is 1723.

On the sun-battered schist and sandstone slopes above Reichsfeld, Ms.
Borès patrolled vines she has worked in since the age of 10, plucking
out dead leaves and pulling shriveled grapes. Her touch was light.

you,'' said Marion Borès, a winemaker.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The
New York Times

``These are vines that we fuss over the whole year round,'' said her
mother, Marie-Claire. ``We do everything by hand. And now, this.
Terrible.''

Climbing the steep slope, Marion said, ``We played in these vines,''
adding that she takes part in the harvest herself.

``The schist is magical,'' she said. ``It is what makes the wine
dynamic. There are moments when you are really glad to be alone in these
vines.''

In his career, Mr. Mader has won prizes, and has faced the opposite
problem he has today --- not having enough wine to satisfy demand.

``To have imagined, a few years ago, that a truck would be passing by
one day \ldots{} it's unimaginable,'' he said, his voice trailing off.

For days he put off making a decision about the distillery.

``I hesitated,'' he said. ``I thought we would get over it. I waited
until the last day to decide. I always think the next day will be
better.''

But the decision couldn't be postponed; the government was pressing with
its sign-up deadline.

Afterward, to console himself and colleagues, he said, ``I called up a
friend and we drank a couple of bottles.''

``As long as the wine is good, there is always hope,'' he added.

Orders have recently picked up, a little. Besides, ``the grapes this
year are truly magnificent,'' he said.
