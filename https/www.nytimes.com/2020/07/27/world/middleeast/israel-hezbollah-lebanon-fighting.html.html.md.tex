JERUSALEM --- The Israeli military said Monday that it had thwarted a
raid by a Hezbollah ``terrorist squad'' in a disputed area along its
northern border with Lebanon, resulting in an exchange of fire that
capped days of mounting tension there.

An Israeli military spokesman said that a small squad armed with assault
rifles had crossed an unfenced section of the boundary into Israel by a
few yards.

Israeli forces responded, firing small arms, tank guns and then
artillery, the spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said. The squad
fled back into Lebanon, he said, and then fired back at Israel.

Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization, denied that there had
been an exchange of fire, saying the only firing had come from the
Israeli side.

``Everything that the enemy's media is claiming in terms of foiling an
infiltration operation'' is ``absolutely not true,'' Hezbollah said in a
statement. ``It is an attempt to invent false and mythical victories.''

No casualties were reported by either side.

Israel had been bracing for retaliation from Hezbollah since the killing
of one of its operatives in a strike in Syria last week that was
attributed to Israel.

Hezbollah said Monday that retaliation was still coming, as well as
retaliation for the shelling on Monday. Lebanese television reported
shelling near the Lebanese village of Kafr Shuba.

``The Zionists only need to continue waiting for the punishment for
their crimes,'' the Hezbollah statement said.

On Monday afternoon, amid preliminary reports of explosions, smoke and
cross-border fire, the Israeli military instructed residents of northern
Israel to remain indoors and closed roads in the area. But the
restrictions were lifted less than two hours later, a sign that calm had
been restored and an apparent indication that Israel did not intend to
prolong the confrontation.

The events took place in the vicinity of Shebaa Farms --- known in
Israel as Mount Dov --- a strip claimed by Israel, Lebanon and sometimes
Syria near the intersection of all three nations and adjacent to the
Golan Heights.

Israel's defense minister, Benny Gantz, had visited the northern border
on Sunday as anticipation of a retaliatory attack by Hezbollah grew.

Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, reported that Israeli aircraft had
fired rockets toward southern Damascus last Monday night, July 20.
Though Israel rarely takes responsibility publicly for specific strikes,
it has acknowledged carrying out scores of attacks aimed, it says, at
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/world/middleeast/israel-iran-shadow-war.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{preventing
the transfer of sophisticated weapons} from Iran to Hezbollah via Syria.

After last week's strike on an ammunition depot near the Damascus
airport, Hezbollah said that one of its operatives, Ali Kamel Mohsen,
was killed in an act of ``Zionist aggression.''

The killing appeared to violate
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/world/middleeast/israel-iran-shadow-war.html}{informal
rules of engagement} between Israel and Hezbollah.

In recent years, Hezbollah has refrained from killing Israelis while
Israel has largely avoided killing Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Both
sides want to press their points while avoiding a war that could
devastate Lebanon and Israel.

In a television interview on Sunday, Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary
general of Hezbollah, described the Hezbollah fighter killed in Syria as
a martyr and said the group would uphold the rules of engagement.

``The deterrence equation with Israel is standing,'' he said on the
Arabic news channel Al Mayadeen. ``Amending or changing the rules of
engagement or the deterrence equation are not on our agenda.''

Israel contends that Hezbollah, with Iran's help, is trying to build a
fleet of precision-guided missiles, which Israel considers a red line.
Last August, an Israeli drone struck a building near Beirut that Israeli
officials said contained machinery for making those missiles.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that officials were
closely monitoring the situation in the north.

``Hezbollah needs to know that it's playing with fire,'' he said.
``Every attack against us will be answered with great might.''

He said that Israel ``will not allow Iran to entrench itself militarily
on our border with Syria'' and warned that ``Lebanon and Hezbollah will
bear responsibility for any attack'' originating from Lebanese
territory.

Israel and Hezbollah fought a devastating, monthlong war in 2006. There
have only been sporadic clashes across the Israel-Lebanon border in
recent years.

Monday's events came as many Israelis, largely barred from traveling
abroad because of a spike in coronavirus infections, were vacationing in
the north.

Beirut.
