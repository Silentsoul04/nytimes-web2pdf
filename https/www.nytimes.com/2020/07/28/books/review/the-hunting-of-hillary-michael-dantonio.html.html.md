**THE HUNTING OF HILLARY**  
**The Forty-Year Campaign to Destroy Hillary Clinton**  
By Michael D’Antonio

In the almost four years since Donald Trump won the presidency, those of
us who weren’t in favor of that particular outcome can sometimes appear
to have sorted into two equally vocal camps. The first group thinks that
Hillary Clinton deserves some significant portion of blame for the
election result because of the campaign she ran, or indeed for running
at all, given the decades-old, baked-in political weaknesses she somehow
persuaded the Democratic Party to ignore. The second group sees that
kind of thinking as antifeminist and anti-establishment, and attributes
the Clinton loss almost entirely to external forces: misogyny,
conservative dark money, media manipulation, conspiracy theorists — the
same forces that have unfairly dogged her throughout her years in public
life. There are, of course, lots of people who fall somewhere in between
those two poles, but [Michael
D’Antonio’s](https://www.michaeldantonio.net)“The Hunting of
Hillary: The Forty-Year Campaign to Destroy Hillary Clinton” is a
document written firmly from the point of view of that second group.

D’Antonio, who won a Pulitzer Prize for local reporting in the 1980s as
part of a Newsday team, has averaged nearly a book a year for the past
20, on subjects ranging from Donald Trump and Mike Pence to the space
race. He is a fluid writer, responsible summarizer and diligent
researcher. This volume is a comprehensive history of the way right-wing
attacks have both replicated and morphed over the decades, and across
technologies. The money of Richard Mellon Scaife gives way to that of
Robert Mercer; Newt Gingrich cedes prominence to Roger Stone; Fox News
grows from the example of Rush Limbaugh; local Arkansas opportunists
seeking publicity and money are eclipsed by internet conspiracists.

But the book is most successful as a work within the terms of its chosen
genre: Clinton defense. Just as the Clinton prosecution — in the manner
of [Edward
Klein](https://www.amazon.com/Edward-Klein/e/B000AP7VCK%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share)
and [Peter<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Schweizer](http://peterschweizer.com) — is a recognizable
literary category (one to which D’Antonio rightly draws critical
attention), so is Clinton defense. (The defense is less given to magical
realism; D’Antonio writes factually and journalistically.) For instance,
the book’s dramatic title seems to be a riff on [Joe Conason and Gene
Lyons’s 2000
book](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/books/conspiracy-theories.html),
“The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and
Hillary Clinton,” which sought to catalog the “vast right-wing
conspiracy” Hillary Clinton so famously blamed for trying to bring her
and her husband
down.

This book goes over a lot of familiar biographical terrain but is at its
most interesting when it relates the details of the complicated, twisty
scandals that have been hyped up and then boiled down into catchphrases:
Whitewater, Benghazi, the email server. Still, anything that happened in
Clinton’s career between the moments when she was most fervidly pursued
by the right is skirted over quickly, unsatisfyingly.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The Hunting of Hillary” is dedicated to “the 50.8 percent,” which I
first guessed might be the percentage of the popular vote Clinton
received in the 2016 election — but as I learned in the acknowledgments
section is in fact the percentage of women in the United States. (Before
he thanks the usual litany of editors, relatives and friends who helped
with the book, D’Antonio spends several paragraphs acknowledging his own
white male privilege and the negative reaction of his fellow white men
to having that privilege pointed out: “These diversions prevent an
empathetic reckoning with both the damage done to women and the many
ways in which society is deprived when they are denied the equal
opportunity to create and contribute.”)

D’Antonio does a certain amount of feminist-inflected analysis in his
text, particularly in the early biographical chapters. (“Powerful women
aren’t given much leeway. Express a little emotion — *any* emotion — and
you risk being written off as unserious. Show too little, and you’re a
bitch.”) It’s impossible to argue with the substance of this — misogyny
*is* hypermagnetized toward Clinton, not to mention virtually every
woman in politics or the public eye — but it’s a comment that’s
certainly been made before. And in places, D’Antonio seems a little
blinkered from noticing sexism that doesn’t target Clinton herself. He
isn’t particularly generous or thoughtful in his assessment of the way
the media treated women like [Paula
Jones](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/paula-jones-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-harassment)
or [Monica
Lewinsky](https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/resources/lewinsky/timeline/),
or [Juanita
Broaddrick](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html),
who made a credible accusation of rape against Bill Clinton that has, in
recent years, become the subject of much feminist reconsideration.

Hillary Clinton’s notorious remark that she “could have stayed at home
and baked cookies” offended plenty of women who weren’t on the right,
but it is similarly glossed over. The fact of Bill Clinton’s
unfaithfulness is mostly used as a launching point for discussing the
right’s exploitation of it. D’Antonio can rarely bring himself to admit
the couple have legitimate *baggage.*

It’s understandable that D’Antonio might shy away from anything that
would seem to feed the trolls — more than three years after Clinton’s
loss, in the midst of a world-historical pandemic and impending economic
ruin, several of the most-shared “news” stories on Facebook in March
involved Hillary Clinton’s emails — but there is little room in this
book for considering that the Hillary Clinton story, in all its
complicated richness and particularity, may not best be presented as a
chapter from the Lives of the Martyrs.
