\textbf{THE HUNTING OF HILLARY}\\
\textbf{The Forty-Year Campaign to Destroy Hillary Clinton}\\
By Michael D'Antonio

In the almost four years since Donald Trump won the presidency, those of
us who weren't in favor of that particular outcome can sometimes appear
to have sorted into two equally vocal camps. The first group thinks that
Hillary Clinton deserves some significant portion of blame for the
election result because of the campaign she ran, or indeed for running
at all, given the decades-old, baked-in political weaknesses she somehow
persuaded the Democratic Party to ignore. The second group sees that
kind of thinking as antifeminist and anti-establishment, and attributes
the Clinton loss almost entirely to external forces: misogyny,
conservative dark money, media manipulation, conspiracy theorists ---
the same forces that have unfairly dogged her throughout her years in
public life. There are, of course, lots of people who fall somewhere in
between those two poles, but
\href{https://www.michaeldantonio.net}{Michael D'Antonio's}``The Hunting
of Hillary: The Forty-Year Campaign to Destroy Hillary Clinton'' is a
document written firmly from the point of view of that second group.

D'Antonio, who won a Pulitzer Prize for local reporting in the 1980s as
part of a Newsday team, has averaged nearly a book a year for the past
20, on subjects ranging from Donald Trump and Mike Pence to the space
race. He is a fluid writer, responsible summarizer and diligent
researcher. This volume is a comprehensive history of the way right-wing
attacks have both replicated and morphed over the decades, and across
technologies. The money of Richard Mellon Scaife gives way to that of
Robert Mercer; Newt Gingrich cedes prominence to Roger Stone; Fox News
grows from the example of Rush Limbaugh; local Arkansas opportunists
seeking publicity and money are eclipsed by internet conspiracists.

But the book is most successful as a work within the terms of its chosen
genre: Clinton defense. Just as the Clinton prosecution --- in the
manner of
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Edward-Klein/e/B000AP7VCK\%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share}{Edward
Klein} and \href{http://peterschweizer.com}{Peter Schweizer} --- is a
recognizable literary category (one to which D'Antonio rightly draws
critical attention), so is Clinton defense. (The defense is less given
to magical realism; D'Antonio writes factually and journalistically.)
For instance, the book's dramatic title seems to be a riff on
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/books/conspiracy-theories.html}{Joe
Conason and Gene Lyons's 2000 book}, ``The Hunting of the President: The
Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' which sought to
catalog the ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' Hillary Clinton so famously
blamed for trying to bring her and her husband down.

This book goes over a lot of familiar biographical terrain but is at its
most interesting when it relates the details of the complicated, twisty
scandals that have been hyped up and then boiled down into catchphrases:
Whitewater, Benghazi, the email server. Still, anything that happened in
Clinton's career between the moments when she was most fervidly pursued
by the right is skirted over quickly, unsatisfyingly.

``The Hunting of Hillary'' is dedicated to ``the 50.8 percent,'' which I
first guessed might be the percentage of the popular vote Clinton
received in the 2016 election --- but as I learned in the
acknowledgments section is in fact the percentage of women in the United
States. (Before he thanks the usual litany of editors, relatives and
friends who helped with the book, D'Antonio spends several paragraphs
acknowledging his own white male privilege and the negative reaction of
his fellow white men to having that privilege pointed out: ``These
diversions prevent an empathetic reckoning with both the damage done to
women and the many ways in which society is deprived when they are
denied the equal opportunity to create and contribute.'')

D'Antonio does a certain amount of feminist-inflected analysis in his
text, particularly in the early biographical chapters. (``Powerful women
aren't given much leeway. Express a little emotion --- \emph{any}
emotion --- and you risk being written off as unserious. Show too
little, and you're a bitch.'') It's impossible to argue with the
substance of this --- misogyny \emph{is} hypermagnetized toward Clinton,
not to mention virtually every woman in politics or the public eye ---
but it's a comment that's certainly been made before. And in places,
D'Antonio seems a little blinkered from noticing sexism that doesn't
target Clinton herself. He isn't particularly generous or thoughtful in
his assessment of the way the media treated women like
\href{https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/paula-jones-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-harassment}{Paula
Jones} or
\href{https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/resources/lewinsky/timeline/}{Monica
Lewinsky}, or
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html}{Juanita
Broaddrick}, who made a credible accusation of rape against Bill Clinton
that has, in recent years, become the subject of much feminist
reconsideration.

Hillary Clinton's notorious remark that she ``could have stayed at home
and baked cookies'' offended plenty of women who weren't on the right,
but it is similarly glossed over. The fact of Bill Clinton's
unfaithfulness is mostly used as a launching point for discussing the
right's exploitation of it. D'Antonio can rarely bring himself to admit
the couple have legitimate \emph{baggage.}

It's understandable that D'Antonio might shy away from anything that
would seem to feed the trolls --- more than three years after Clinton's
loss, in the midst of a world-historical pandemic and impending economic
ruin, several of the most-shared ``news'' stories on Facebook in March
involved Hillary Clinton's emails --- but there is little room in this
book for considering that the Hillary Clinton story, in all its
complicated richness and particularity, may not best be presented as a
chapter from the Lives of the Martyrs.
