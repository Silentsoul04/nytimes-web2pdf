Lawmakers are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/politics/republicans-jobless-aid.html}{continuing
negotiations} over a coronavirus relief package. The Republicans' \$1
trillion opening bid will have to be reconciled with Democrats, who were
pushing a much larger recovery package that would extend \$600 per week
in extra unemployment aid through the end of the year. The Republican
plan would reduce the benefit to \$200.

Here's the latest:

\begin{quote}
Senate Republicans and the White House on Monday threw their support
behind a substantial cut in jobless aid for tens of millions of
Americans laid off amid the pandemic, proposing a weekly reduction of
\$400 to a benefit that has cushioned the nation's economy even as
coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country.

Economists say that the money, slated to expire this week, has provided
a crucial economic buffer for the unemployed, and that lowering the
payments could have a cascade of damaging effects across the economy.
But Republicans contend that it is too generous, discouraging Americans
from returning to work and hampering a recovery.

The Senate Republicans' decision to embrace the decrease reflects the
predicament in which they find themselves during a worsening pandemic
and continued economic recession, little more than three months before
Election Day.
