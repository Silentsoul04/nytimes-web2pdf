This coronavirus vaccine developed by government researchers and Moderna
enabled the animals to quickly clear the infection from their lungs.

Monkeys given the Moderna coronavirus vaccine and then deliberately
infected were able to fight off the virus, quickly clearing it from
their lungs, researchers reported on Tuesday.

The findings do not guarantee that the vaccine will perform the same way
in people, but the results are considered encouraging and a milestone in
the struggle against the pandemic. If an experimental vaccine fails in
monkeys, that is generally seen as a bad sign for its ability to work in
humans. This type of study is considered valuable because
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-vaccine-trials.html?searchResultPosition=1}{infecting
people on purpose}, though sometimes done, is not standard practice.

On Monday clinics around the country
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html?searchResultPosition=1}{began
a Phase 3 trial of the vaccine} candidate from Moderna, a biotech
company based in Massachusetts, with the aim of enrolling 30,000 people
to test for safety and effectiveness.

``The virus was cleared very rapidly in the vaccinated animals,'' said
Dr. Barney S. Graham, the senior author of
\href{https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671?query=RP}{a
report in The New England Journal of Medicine,} and the deputy director
of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. Dr. Graham's scientific team collaborated with
Moderna to develop the vaccine.

Unvaccinated animals in the control group did not quickly get rid of the
virus.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{The
vaccine uses a synthetic form of genetic material} from the coronavirus,
called messenger RNA or mRNA, wrapped in tiny particles of fat that
helps it enter human cells. Then, the mRNA prompts the cells to make a
fragment of the virus, which primes the immune system to attack if it
encounters the real coronavirus.

The study involved 24 Rhesus macaques: eight controls, eight given a low
dose of vaccine and eight given a high dose. Each animal received two
shots, four weeks apart. A month after the second shot, researchers
dripped the coronavirus into their noses, an amount comparable to that
found in the airways of infected people. This type of monkey does not
become very ill from the coronavirus, but does become infected.

The vaccine did not completely prevent infection, but kept the virus
from propagating greatly. The vaccinated animals still had some virus in
their noses, but significantly less than unvaccinated animals did.

``If you get a little infection that is cleared rapidly and doesn't shed
very long, it reduces the likelihood of transmission,'' Dr. Graham said.

Lab tests also found that the vaccine stimulated strong immune
responses, including high levels of antibodies capable of neutralizing
the virus --- more than found in people who had recovered from the
infection.

The lab results were comparable to those seen in people in early tests
of the vaccine.

``This bodes well for the Phase 3 trials,'' said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a
virologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study.
``It's still hard to make predictions on what it's going to do in a
huge, diverse group of people, based on monkeys, but it's reassuring
that it provides protection in this model. Overall, my verdict is
`promising but preliminary.' ''

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

Dr. Rasmussen said that even if a vaccine does not completely prevent
infection, but makes the illness less severe and cuts the risk of death,
it is still a valuable public health measure.

Another outside expert, Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at
the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
said: ``It's always encouraging when things work in nonhuman primates,
but nonhuman primates aren't humans. We really only learn about these
products when they're put in humans.''

Dr. Graham said, ``I think we have a chance of having some protection
from this vaccine, but we have to do the Phase 3 trial to find out.''

He said the study could also help establish guidelines for evaluating
this type of research on other vaccines.

``It kind of puts a stake in the ground for what kind of things might be
needed to see this level of protection in a nonhuman primate,'' Dr.
Graham said. ``We don't know how it will relate to Phase 3. We'll find
out as data builds from this product and others. We'll develop a more
clear picture of which vaccines work and maybe why they work. But we
really need the human data.''
