There are different reasons I adore [“Love &
Basketball”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur83i6_BjbE): its
tenacious athlete-heroine, its twinned belief in female tears and female
ambition, Alfre Woodard’s artful supporting turn. The film won me over
when I first saw it in 2000. But it wasn’t until I looked at it again
for our [Weekend
Watch](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/movies/love-basketball-sanaa-lathan-omar-epps.html)
that I realized that the director [Gina
Prince-Bythewood](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/movies/the-old-guard-gina-prince-bythewood.html)
had given herself a sly cameo. She plays one of our heroine’s opponents,
who dives to the floor alongside her midgame as they scramble for the
ball. It’s such a perfect encapsulation of the movie and its themes that
I watched it again and again.

I bet the moment resonated with our readers who love the movie, too.

This scramble for the ball is also a wryly apt metaphor for the kind of
wild maneuvering that female directors — and particularly women of color
— need to perform to get in the industry game, then stay in and succeed.
Prince-Bythewood has managed to keep directing, for the big and small
screen, despite the industry’s entrenched biases, its racism and sexism.
And now with the Netflix movie [“The Old
Guard”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/movies/the-old-guard-review.html)
she has her biggest hit. Its success makes the 20th anniversary of “Love
& Basketball” especially sweet, and together the movies show how fluidly
Prince-Bythewood has pivoted from intimate drama to full-bore action
cinema.

A classic coming-of-age story, “Love & Basketball” follows Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) as she pursues her passion for basketball while nurturing a
relationship with her next-door-neighbor, Quincy (Omar Epps). They first
shoot hoops together in childhood and later fall in love or, maybe just
succumb to their long-simmering feelings, all while playing very
different gendered games, on and off the court. The film borrows some
familiar genre moves — the kids meet classically cute during a game —
but the intensity of Monica’s athletic drive quickly makes the film skew
serious and heartfelt, not funny and flirty. Part of what’s striking
about “Love & Basketball” is that, as the title announces, her passions
are twofold and not mutually exclusive.

> One nice local detail: the woman who portrayed UCLA’s coach in the

> as an assistant coach, not the head coach) including their
> championship season with Ann Meyers. — [mkt42, Portland,
> OR](https://nyti.ms/330VJEy#permid=108316663)

Unlike many contemporary screen romances, “Love & Basketball”
unapologetically wears its full heart on its sleeve, avoiding easy
laughs and the safe distance of irony. It takes Monica seriously, which
means that it takes her life as an athlete seriously, which is expressed
in all the attention on how her physical, emotional and psychological
struggles on the court reflect — and shape — her life off it, too. The
movie respects Monica’s struggle toward greatness in her sport, even as
those difficulties create static and worse for her with Quincy and her
mother (Woodard, the film’s M.V.P.). And while some have read the happy
ending as wishful thinking, I prefer to see it as a utopian feminist
argument for a life enriched by love and by work.

Prince-Bythewood’s insistence on granting Monica both is deeply
satisfying, and although happy endings may seem awfully corny, they’re
foundational for some of us. American movies are so very good at
violence that we can be overly suspicious of onscreen love, embarrassed
by our sniffles and sobs. Not all of us\! “This has been my favorite
movie forever,” Maria Teresa Alzuru [wrote in a
comment](https://nyti.ms/2ElrGgy#permid=108333899), adding, “I can quote
it word for word.” Another reader, Rhonda, added [a personal
note](https://nyti.ms/3gdHvUI#permid=108310594) that cuts to why so many
of us hunger for romantic stories: “L & B is definitely one of my
all-time faves. It kind of mimics my own earlier life, except mine
didn’t have a happy ending. So, I love it, but it also makes me sigh
each time.” More than one reader underscored the film’s status in
contemporary Black American cinema.

> Chicago, IL](https://nyti.ms/3hMiNei#permid=108346903)
> 
> What a relief to see a movie featuring Black characters who develop on

> Atlanta](https://nyti.ms/3320hL5#permid=108331295)

The genesis of “Love & Basketball” can be traced to Prince-Bythewood’s
own story. She played basketball in high school and ran track at the
University of California, Los Angeles, where she attended film school.
Later, she wrote for television shows like [“A Different
World,”](https://ew.com/tv/a-different-world-where-are-they-now/)but,
yes, what she really wanted to do was direct. When she was developing
the script for “Love & Basketball,” the film she thought of was “When
Harry Met Sally,” [she
told](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-04-21/love-and-basketball-oral-history-20-year-anniversary)
The Los Angeles Times. But, Prince-Bythewood said, “I wasn’t seeing
myself in movies like that in love stories.” In addition, she said,
“there was a semi-autobiographical story in my head about a Black girl
who wanted to be the first girl in the N.B.A.”

One of the strongest, most vivid auteurist threads that runs through
Prince-Bythewood’s filmography is her vision of the fully rounded,
powerful and sovereign female protagonist. [Charlize Theron’s
warrior](https://www.nytimes.com/by/jason-bailey) in “The Old Guard,”
known as Andromache of Scythia (Andy for short), as well as her
Amazonian compatriot, Nile (KiKi Lane), are of a thematic piece with
other memorable Prince-Bythewood female characters, most notably the
self-doubting yet triumphant pop star played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw in
[“Beyond the
Lights”](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/movies/beyond-the-lights-a-divas-romance.html)
(2014). Like Monica, these are women with struggles that are manifested
physically in bodies that are strong, resilient and — instructively —
not hypersexualized or turned into fetishistic spectacles for the
viewer.

These are, then, women who sweat, characters with grace and strength and
arms that, like the rest of them, have been beautifully shaped by a
woman whose [Twitter
bio](https://twitter.com/GPBmadeit?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
reads: “Used to ball. Now I write/direct and watch my boys play.” That’s
characteristically unassuming for a filmmaker who has brought change to
the representation of women and to the stubbornly male, very white
figure of the American movie director. When she made “Love &
Basketball,” Prince-Bythewood belonged to a tiny sorority of Black
women filmmakers that has grown — not a lot, not nearly enough, but
enough to feel significant. There is still a great deal left to do, but
it’s exhilarating to see her help mount a necessary full-court press.
