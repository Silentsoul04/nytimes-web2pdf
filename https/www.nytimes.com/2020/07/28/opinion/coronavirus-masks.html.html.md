When people ask me about my mood these days, I tell them that I feel
like I’m a reporter for The Pompeii Daily News in A.D. 79, and I’m
sitting in the foothills of Mount Vesuvius and someone just walked up
and asked, “Hey, do you feel a rumbling?”

Do I ever.

The summer of 2020 could be remembered as one of those truly important
dates in American history. Everywhere you turn you see parents who don’t
know where or if their kids will go to school this fall, renters who
don’t know when or if they will be evicted, unemployed who don’t know
what if any safety net Congress will put under them, businesses that
don’t know how or if they can hold on another day — and none of us who
know whether we’ll be able to vote in November.

That is a lot of hot, molten anxiety building up beneath our economy,
society, schools and city streets — just waiting to blow the top off our
country — because we have so failed at managing the coronavirus. We have
25 percent of all recorded infections in the world, and we’re only four
percent of the world’s population. In the ultimate irony, Vietnam, which
has a little less than one-third of our population but has reported only
416 cases and no deaths, is feeling sorry for us.

How did we get so inept?

If, God forbid, America were buried under lava the way Pompeii was and
future archaeologists were to come along and dig it out, I have no doubt
that the artifact they’d dust off and hold up first to answer that huge
question would be a simple item that costs pennies to make and is so
easy to wear: the face mask.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For something that’s supposed to cover our mouths it speaks volumes
about how crazy some have gotten. Specifically, that face mask tells how
the world’s richest and most scientifically advanced country generated a
cadre of leaders and citizens who made wearing a covering over their
nose and mouth to prevent the spread of a contagion into a
freedom-of-speech issue and cultural marker — something no other country
in the world did.

There is nothing more demoralizing than this, nothing that set us back
in the fight against Covid-19 further and faster. A society that can
politicize something as simple as a face mask in a pandemic can
politicize anything, can make anything a wedge issue — physics, gravity,
rainfall, you name it. And a society that politicizes everything will
never realize its full potential in good times or prevent the worst in
bad times.

And that’s where we are now. When you compare the sacrifices — including
the ultimate sacrifice — that the Greatest Generation of Americans made
to defend their fellow citizens from the scourge of Nazism with how
little some members of today’s generations will sacrifice to defend
their fellow Americans from the scourge of Covid-19 — by just wearing a
face mask — it leaves you speechless.

It’s inexcusable. Resisting wearing a mask in a pandemic is nothing more
than selfish, libertarian nonsense masquerading as a comic-book defense
of freedom: “Don’t tread on me, but I can breathe on you.”

And yet for months our president and vice president, and most Republican
governors and their followers, equated resisting mask-wearing with
resisting an infringement on personal freedom, rather than the most
effective and cheapest thing we could do to limit the spread of the
virus and get back to work and our kids back to school.

President Trump’s resistance to masks actually had nothing to do with
ideology. It was just his primitive opposition to anything that would
highlight the true health crisis we were in and that therefore might
hurt his re-election.

But Vice President Mike Pence — always happy to put lipstick on Trump’s
piggishness — dressed up his crude mask-resistance in elegant
constitutional garb. When asked by a reporter at Trump’s Tulsa rally a
few weeks ago why the president appeared unconcerned about the absence
of masks and social distancing at his event, Pence solemnly intoned: “I
want to remind you again, freedom of speech and the right to peaceably
assemble is in the Constitution of the U.S. Even in a health crisis, the
American people don’t forfeit our [constitutional
rights](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a32984272/mike-pence-masks-social-distancing-trump-rallies/).”

What a fraud.

As John Finn, professor emeritus of government at Wesleyan University,
[writing on
TheConversation.com](https://theconversation.com/the-constitution-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-mask-mandates-142335),
noted, “There are two reasons why mask mandates don’t violate the First
Amendment. First, a mask doesn’t keep you from expressing yourself. …
Additionally, the First Amendment, like all liberties ensured by the
Constitution, is not absolute. All constitutional rights are subject to
the government’s authority to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the community.”

A [study by the Boston Consulting
Group](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/why-its-not-too-late-to-contain-the-virus)
on which countries not only flattened the curve of the coronavirus but
“crushed it,” found that the key to reopening economies while also
containing virus transmission was “physical distancing, frequent
hand-washing and the widespread use of masks” — and the fact that these
governments developed detailed guidelines for all three when it came to
workplace settings, schools and public transportation.

But our future archaeologists would also be right to focus on face
masks, because the early intense resistance by pro-Trump Republican
leaders and faithful to wearing them was the distilled essence of how
far off track today’s G.O.P. and its enabling media ecosystem have
drifted. In that sense it was yet another stark reminder that we can’t
be at our best as a country — as we need to be most in a pandemic —
without a principled conservative party, grounded in science, not just
cultural markers and mindless, kneejerk libertarianism.

We have a way to go. [Forbes reported last
week](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/07/24/19-states-still-dont-mandate-masks-18-are-run-by-republican-governors/#37bbd2e16243)
that “of the 19 states that have yet to issue a mask mandate, 18 are run
by Republican governors.”

But let’s give a small shout-out to Republican governors Larry Hogan of
Maryland, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Eric Holcomb of Indiana and Kay Ivey of
Alabama, who have been or become pro-mask. It is not only good for their
states’ physical health but also the country’s political health.

Wearing a mask in this pandemic is a sign of respect for your fellow
citizens and neighbors — no matter what their race, creed or political
affiliation. Wearing a mask says: “I’m not just concerned about myself.
I’m concerned about you, too. We are all part of the same community, the
same country and the same struggle to stay healthy.”

A different president would have been urging every American, from the
start of this pandemic, to don a red, white and blue mask. He would have
used such a mask to do double duty — crush Covid-19 and bring us
together for the long march needed to do so.

As I said, a different president.
