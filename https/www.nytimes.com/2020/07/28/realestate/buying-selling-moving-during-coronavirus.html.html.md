# Making a Move During the Pandemic? Not So Fast

</div>

As New York cautiously reopens in the shadow of a potential second wave
of infections, home buyers and sellers are racing to complete the almost
impossible task of closing on time and safely moving.

Last summer, Steve and Ellen Resnick followed their daughter and
son-in-law from the Harlem condominium where both families lived to a
new life in New Jersey. That was the plan, anyway.

The kids were moving to a house in Glen Rock, N.J., so the couple aimed
to upgrade to a three-bedroom in Horizon House, a luxury co-op in nearby
Fort Lee. To sell their Harlem apartment, the Resnicks hired Josh
Lieberman, a broker at Douglas Elliman who had recently handled their
daughter’s condo. He listed theirs for $1.35 million and, after a few
false starts, sold the unit in early March for the original listing
price.

As the coronavirus began its assault on the East Coast, the Resnicks
forged ahead. With an expected closing date on both places in late April
and a move by mid-May, they began packing up. That’s as far as they got.

After Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued the New York Pause order on March 20,
closing all nonessential businesses, both of the Resnicks’ closings were
delayed indefinitely. Neither building was allowing anyone to move in or
out, even though moving companies were considered an essential business.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Nobody was telling us anything and we didn’t know what was happening
from one day to the next,” said Ms. Resnick, who is in her mid-60s. “Our
one saving grace was that the moving company had dropped off some boxes
before the shutdown so we could start getting ready, but then we had no
place to go.”

The Resnicks eventually arranged a virtual closing on the Harlem condo
and were able to lease it back while they waited for their co-op in Fort
Lee to close, which it did June 29. They moved the next
day.

The Resnicks’ plight has been typical in this year of chaos. “It’s had a
domino effect on everyone,” said Michael J. Romer, a Manhattan real
estate attorney. “People weren’t looking to close on an apartment they
couldn’t move into, and then a lot of sellers couldn’t move out either.”

As New York cautiously reopens in the shadow of a potential second wave
of infections, thousands of buyers and sellers are racing to complete
the almost impossible task of closing on time and safely moving — vexed
by a patchwork of rules and guidelines handed down by local governments
and the boards of the buildings themselves.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Paul J. Herman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential
Management, said that many of the city and state’s recommended best
practices for reopening have been confusing, especially as they relate
to apartment buildings. (The city [entered the fourth and final
phase](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/nyregion/nyc-phase-4-reopening-coronavirus.html)
of its reopening plan on July 20, though many indoor activities remain
prohibited.)

“It’s been tough throughout the various phases because the language
about what the specific requirements are coming out of the governor’s
office and other state and city agencies hasn’t been that clear and
we’ve had to interpret a lot of it ourselves,” Mr. Herman said. “For
example, we know what to do with the movers, but we still don’t know the
definition of what a visitor is, whether it’s a nanny, a friend or a
delivery person.”

For those dealing with co-ops and their infamously fastidious boards,
what was already an invasive and tedious process has become an expanding
maze of logistical hurdles.

“Each building has been affected differently by the pandemic and no
single approach is likely going to work,” said attorney Neil B.
Garfinkel, broker counsel to the Real Estate Board of New York, which
issued its own set of guidelines in April. “In my view, boards have the
right to set their own policies as long as they are acting with
uniformity and in the best interest of shareholders.”

Lailani Moody had just begun moving out of her Upper East Side co-op to
a Westchester retirement community when the pandemic arrived and moves
were stopped, forcing her to leave behind clothes and furniture.

Ms. Moody, 77, a former accountant, decided in December to sell her
co-op studio on 72nd Street, where she had lived since 1997. Despite an
already sluggish residential market, it sold briskly. “We already had a
signed contract, and everything seemed fine,” said Ms. Moody’s broker,
Harriet Norris of Douglas Elliman.

But the deal got held up when the co-op board demanded additional
financial information from the buyer. Ms. Moody had hoped to stay in the
studio part-time while she waited for the issue to be resolved, but with
her retirement community under quarantine, she wasn’t able to return to
Manhattan, nor could she complete the move because her old co-op had
banned all outsiders, which meant no moving companies, cleaning services
or visitors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a result, she was saddled with double maintenance fees on top of
moving costs, and many of her possessions were held hostage. “The major
hurdle was that I had to find someone who could finish packing and clean
up, but they weren’t allowing anybody in,” Ms. Moody said.

Finally, in mid-June, she was permitted to retrieve the rest of her
belongings, and closed virtually on the sale of her co-op a month later
— a process that Ms. Norris, her broker, said “was like trying to push
wet spaghetti.”

“What I’ve found the most frustrating is that I’ve had several deals in
contract, whether it’s buyers wanting to buy or sellers trying to sell
and get their money, but we’ve run into issues almost every step of the
way,” Ms. Norris said. “I’ve also had instances where managing agents
were trying to get the boards to do the right thing and be
accommodating.”

Other co-op sellers have told horror stories about wading through
mounting red tape. Gill Chowdhury, an agent with Warburg Realty,
mentioned one client who got an offer in January for $790,000 on her
Gramercy co-op. As the economy soured, the co-op requested a second
review of the buyer’s finances. Finally, after being approved but
prohibited from moving in, the buyer stalled on the closing as he tried
to renegotiate the sale price, something Mr. Chowdhury said “wasn’t as
surprising as it was shocking, given the circumstances.”

Mr. Chowdhury’s client said she would never buy another co-op again.

For their part, co-op boards and managing agents are struggling to
remain accommodating to buyers and sellers as coronavirus cases surge
around the
country.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“It worries me a lot that there could very possibly be a second wave
here,” said Daniel J. Wollman, chief executive of property management
firm Gumley Haft, which “guides boards of cooperatives and condominiums
to become decision-makers,” according to its website. “We’re trying to
do everything we can to prepare for that by making sure our residents
and staff are safe and stocking up on personal protective equipment.”

Many of the city’s more than 6,000 co-ops and condos had already begun
initiating their own protocols in early March. “Before the governor’s
orders came down, we created an internal task force because we didn’t
know how this was going to play itself out,” said Desi Ndreu, chief
operating officer of Charles H. Greenthal & Co., which runs more than
200 co-ops, condos and rentals around the city.

One of the buildings Ms. Ndreu personally manages is the Victoria, a
465-unit co-op in the Flatiron district. Longtime board member Corinne
Arnold said they were among the first to require masks in elevators and
temperature checks for visitors after the pandemic started.
“Particularly in the beginning, we were all very hands-on-deck,” she
said. “I feel extremely confident in our policies and how they’ve
evolved.”

Such practices, including prohibiting open houses, are likely to remain
the norm at most buildings until a vaccine or another widely accepted
treatment is available, said Barbara Fox of Fox Residential, which
mainly does business in Manhattan and Brooklyn. “Advancements in
technology have allowed us to facilitate negotiations, closings and open
houses,” Ms. Fox said. “While not a substitute for the in-person
experience, we are able to bring property showings into the virtual
space as we collectively navigate the new norm.”

Regardless of their size, most buildings are limiting the number of
moves they allow per day, often to just one, along with assigning
separate crews in the apartment and the basement to minimize traffic.
Most are also requiring buyers and sellers to pay for a professionally
licensed cleaning service, while some management companies, like Gumley
Haft, are requiring moving companies to provide Masonite floor coverings
in halls and elevators.

“For us, it’s all been about being proactive about what we’re doing and
explaining why we need to be that way,” said Ms. Ndreu.

Steve Wagner, a Manhattan real estate attorney who represents the
Victoria, said he’s seen an increase in moves and closings over the past
few weeks — likely a reaction to the possibility of another coronavirus
surge later this year, even if it means jumping through hoops and
selling an apartment at a loss.

“If you have to close down again, you have to close down,” he said.
“Safety is the main concern. I have no doubt that co-ops and condos
will continue to do whatever they need to do — and so will
shareholders.”
