\subsection{My Mother, the Universe}\label{my-mother-the-universe}}

After we moved to America from Bahrain, my mother would take my sister
and me to a pond to watch ducks. We were always alone. At 5, I asked
her, ``Are you Allah?'' She seemed to know everything. Little did either
of us know that we were driving three towns over for these ducks,
passing dozens of parks (with ducks) along the way. Now, I'm 26. Because
of the coronavirus, our annual 200-person Eid party is back to just us,
like the days at the pond when I looked up at her beaming face and saw a
universe looking back. --- \emph{Daanish Jamal}

\subsection{This Brave New World}\label{this-brave-new-world}}

Three weeks before the world shut down, a date on a Central Park bench
lasts 16 hours. She, an Afro-Caribbean Ph.D. candidate writing a
dissertation on interracial love in colonial Africa. I, a white, high
school English teacher writing a novel about interracial love in the
American south. Suddenly, people are dying and we are driving to
Atlanta. Time spent with my family and in my hometown with its
Confederate monument. Our love defies power and typical timelines. A
return to Brooklyn's masked marches. Our wedding: May 2021. Our brave
new world. We will raise children in it. --- \emph{Britt Buttrill}

\subsection{My Job to Call}\label{my-job-to-call}}

After I left home for boarding school at 14, my parents never called to
talk. We spoke often, but it was my job to dial: from Toronto (high
school) to Philadelphia (college) to England (graduate school) to New
York (my current home). Daughter: pursuer. Parents: pursued. When they
did call, I was terrified that someone had died. If I went absent for
weeks, testing their resolve, they called to confirm I was alive. But
recently, they complained about not speaking to my children enough. Now,
every Sunday morning, my phone rings and it's them. --- \emph{Maayan

\subsection{A Story That Bloomed}\label{a-story-that-bloomed}}

My family's farm in the west of Ireland had a giant honeysuckle. When
sent to the spring well, I would set down my bucket to smell the
blossoms. When I was 10 and we left the farmhouse for the nearby
village, the honeysuckle was the only thing I missed. Yesterday, in
America, I noticed a honeysuckle outside my office window. When had Ken
planted it? When had I told him? In a trans-Atlantic marriage, there are
so many departures and datelines, so many tales to tell. My story of the
honeysuckle must have taken root in Ken's mind, and bloomed. ---
\emph{Áine Greaney}
