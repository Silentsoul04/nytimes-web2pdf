The death toll in the Rio Grande Valley is forcing funeral directors to

ELSA, Texas — Johnny Salinas Jr., the owner of Salinas Funeral Home,
typically handles five funerals a week. But on a recent day, with the
coronavirus tearing through his community, he saw that many grieving
families in a single day.

A sixth family was waiting, too. His own.

Mr. Salinas changed from a polo shirt into a crisp black suit and left
his office for the chapel next door. The light blue coffin of his
great-uncle, who died of Covid-19, sat at the front of the room, adorned
with white flower arrangements and a wooden crucifix.

“The virus is not sparing anyone,” Mr. Salinas said. “Not even my
family.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, where a surge of virus cases has set
off a flood of deaths this month, funeral homes — like hospitals — are
overloaded and struggling to carry out basic services and keep up with
the expanding crisis. Local funeral homes, officials said, have not
experienced such demand in decades.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

About one in 60 residents of Hidalgo County is known to have had the
virus, and about one of every 2,000 people has died from the virus, a
New York Times database shows. Hidalgo County now has one of the highest
per capita death rates in the state.

At the start of July, fewer than 50 deaths in Hidalgo County had been
attributed to the virus, according to the database. By Monday, there had
been almost 470.

“It’s like a bad dream,” said Linda Ceballos, a co-director of Ceballos
Funeral Home in McAllen. “You want to wake up, but you can’t.”

The death toll is forcing funeral directors to bypass traditional
services such as velorios, viewings that sometimes last for days and are
filled with prayers, hugs and sorrowful Spanish-language songs. Instead,
many funeral homes now are shortening viewing times and limiting
attendance. Some have ordered large refrigerator trucks to store bodies
until they can get to them.

The virus’s spread seemed relatively under control in the area until the
state reopened the economy in time for Memorial Day, local health
officials said. Richard Cortez, the Hidalgo County judge, said the virus
soon was wreaking damage through the region, where chronic disease and
widespread poverty were already significant problems. More than 14,000
people have contracted the virus in El Valle, as the area is known to
its mostly Latino residents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cortez has been a constant presence on Spanish and English TV and
radio, urging people to wear masks, wash their hands and — most
important, he says — keep distant from older and vulnerable
relatives.

At his great-uncle’s velorio, Mr. Salinas, 30, had two roles at once:
funeral director and mourning relative. Before family arrived, Mr.
Salinas paced around the room, making sure it complied with hygiene
guidelines.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ever since Mr. Salinas was a teenager, he knew what work he wanted to
do.

“Death is a journey,” he said. “God is the destination.”

When Mr. Salinas was 16, he had his own brush with tragedy. He said he
was driving his 15-year-old sister and another teenage friend when a dog
suddenly appeared in front of the car. In the chaos, the car flipped,
Mr. Salinas said. His sister was killed.

“Now she’s always here with me, not physically, but spiritually,” said
Mr. Salinas, who keeps an oversize photo of his sister, Deborah Lynn
Salinas, bearing the date of her death — Dec. 6, 2006 — in the funeral
home.

On this day, around the chapel, every other pew was sealed off with blue
tape so people would sit apart. A plexiglass barrier shielded his
great-uncle’s upper body in the open coffin to keep mourners from
leaning in.

“People tend to want to hug and cry on their loved ones,” Mr. Salinas
said.

Not long after, he talked a family member out of placing a rosary in the
hands of Francisco Tafolla Sr., the great-uncle whom Mr. Salinas grew up
simply calling uncle, who died of the virus at 85.

“It’s human instinct to want to touch the body, but they can’t,” he
said. “It’s for their safety.”

White flower arrangements adorned a wall beside a large photo of Mr.
Tafolla. Mr. Tafolla’s daughter, Gloria Tafolla Gomez, stood silently,
nodding her head softly to the lyrics of “Un Dia a la Vez” — “One Day at
a Time” — by the Tejano band Siggno.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He always delivered what he promised, even if that was a spanking,” Ms.
Tafolla whispered to a relative. They both chuckled. “We were so afraid
of him.”

Mr. Tafolla, who worked manual jobs in the gas industry, saved money to
ensure that all of his 12 children went to college, Ms. Tafolla said.
She became a
nurse.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Family members still do not know how he got the virus. “He never left
the house,” said Ms. Tafolla, who is 63 and is Mr. Salinas’s aunt. Even
before the virus, Mr. Tafolla had been battling other medical issues,
and recently had heart surgery, she said. Days after his first virus
symptoms, he was gone.

“We kind of knew that if he ended up getting sick, that he would end up
leaving us,” she
said.

At Ceballos Funeral Home in McAllen, people seeking funerals during the
pandemic have to wait several days, sometimes a week, Ms. Ceballos said.
She has seen young victims, too, she said.

“Nothing is like it used to be,” Ms. Ceballos said.

Aaron Rivera, a funeral director and embalmer at Rivera Funeral Home in
McAllen, said he ordered a refrigerated truck with a capacity for about
100 bodies to avoid turning people away. The volume has tripled in the
last month, he said.

“They don’t get to see their loved ones when they are taken to the
hospital,” Mr. Rivera said. “They should see them at the funeral.”

Mr. Salinas has been working around the clock, sleeping only a handful
of hours a day. He owns two funeral home locations, one in Hidalgo
County and a second in neighboring Cameron County. Smaller funeral homes
have been referring grieving families to him when they have no more
space.

“I tell them, stop sending them,” he said. “We are tired. We haven’t
stopped. We need to
sleep.”

On a recent afternoon, Monica Garcia told Mr. Salinas of the day that
her mother texted her from a hospital, pleading to “get me out of here.”

Relatives rushed to the hospital parking lot, where a doctor explained
that her mother, 61-year-old Sylvia N. Fuentes, had a better chance at
beating the coronavirus in an intensive care unit than at home. They
left feeling hopeful. The next day — Wednesday — her kidneys gave out
and she died.

During a two-hour meeting with Mr. Salinas, Ms. Garcia and other family
members picked out a burial outfit. Ms. Fuentes would be dressed in her
favorite dress. She would wear her favorite hair brooch she wore on
special occasions.

“Peinala to the side,” Ms. Garcia said, mixing Spanish and English, comb
her hair to the side. “She loved taking photos and posing,” Ms. Garcia
said. “She’d like to look pretty.”

The relatives picked a pearl-white coffin adorned with a medallion:
“Querida Madre,” beloved mother. They shared a tender look that, in
some other year, might have turned into a group hug. Instead, they
looked down and returned to Mr. Salinas’s office to complete
paperwork.

For Mr. Salinas, long days have begun to blend, one into the next.

When a call came in on a recent afternoon, it was from inside the
funeral home. The virus had hit close again. The cousin of a funeral
home worker had died from Covid-19. His body waited in the nearby
chapel. Mr. Salinas excused himself and disappeared down the hall.
