WASHINGTON — With the economic and public health toll of the
[coronavirus pandemic continuing to mount across the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
members of Congress are debating another round of federal relief for
individuals and businesses.

But it remains unclear how Democrats and Republicans will reconcile
their vastly different proposals. They are staring down a tight
deadline, with tens of millions of Americans slated to [lose their
enhanced jobless
aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html)
this week.

Senate Republicans and administration officials on Monday unveiled a $1
trillion proposal, narrowly tailored to Republican priorities. It
includes slashing by two-thirds the $600-per-week unemployment payments
that workers have received since April and providing tax cuts and
liability protections for businesses.

House Democrats in May approved a [$3 trillion relief
package](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr6800/BILLS-116hr6800ih.pdf)
that amounts to their opening offer: a sweeping measure that contains a
number of Democratic priorities, including an extension of the jobless
aid, nearly $200 billion for rental assistance and mortgage relief, $3.6
billion to bolster election security and additional aid for food
assistance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said that she plans to fight for
even more funding, particularly for schools, in negotiations with
Republicans. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader,
has warned against letting the price tag rise beyond $1 trillion,
particularly as many Republicans question the merits of approving any
additional
aid.

While administration officials have floated the prospect of speeding
through a short-term, narrow measure to address the looming expiration
of unemployment benefits, liability protections and funding for schools,
Democrats have panned that suggestion in favor of a comprehensive
package.

Here are some of the main points of contrast that are likely to emerge
as sticking
points.

-----

## Democrats want to extend $600 weekly jobless payments, while Republicans want to slash them.

The $2.2 trillion stimulus law added a $600-per-week supplement for
those on unemployment insurance, but conservatives have argued that it
discourages people from returning to work in certain states, because it
exceeds their normal wages. The House bill would extend the full benefit
through January, while the [Senate
measure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/senate-police-bill.html)
would severely curtail it, scaling it back to $200 per week. The lump
sum would eventually be replaced with a newly calculated benefit that,
when combined with state benefits, would be [capped at 70 percent of a
worker’s prior
income](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html).

## Republicans want liability shields for businesses, while Democrats are pressing for protections for workers.

House Democrats are again pushing for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration to establish an enforceable standard, based on guidance
from top federal health agencies, for workplaces to develop
infection-control plans. The House bill would also prevent employers
from retaliating against any employee who reports workplace violations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the Senate, Mr. McConnell has repeatedly said that he views
strengthening liability protections for businesses, schools and
hospitals that remain open during the pandemic as a prerequisite for any
aid bill. The Republican proposal would establish a liability shield for
businesses, schools and hospitals from facing claims over episodes
related to the
coronavirus.

## Democrats would allocate $1 trillion for state and local governments. Republicans left them out entirely.

Funding for state, local and tribal governments is the centerpiece of
the legislation House Democrats approved in May. Democrats argue that
governments will need another major infusion of relief to keep essential
workers on payrolls and make up for the loss of revenue after decreased
tourism and spending during the pandemic.

The bill unveiled by Senate Republicans does not have any aid
specifically set aside for state, local and tribal governments, though
it grants more flexibility for how states spent previously allocated
funds. Several conservative lawmakers note that some of the money
allocated in the March stimulus law has not yet been spent. Others have
warned against states using the coronavirus relief to make up for
pre-existing debt and
expenses.

## Both proposals would provide for another round of direct payments to American families.

Both proposals would again allocate another round of $1,200 direct
payments to American families, duplicating a provision in the stimulus
law enacted in March that would phase out the amount of money for
individual incomes above
$75,000.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

But the Democratic proposal would allow undocumented immigrants to
receive money, undoing language that prohibited payments to anyone who
filed taxes jointly with someone who used an Individual Taxpayer
Identification Number, a common substitute for a Social Security number.
That number is used mostly by immigrants without legal status.

Democrats would also increase the amount of money per child to $1,200
for up to three children per family. The Republican proposal would
maintain the $500 amount set in the first stimulus, but also allow adult
dependents to
qualify.

## The Republican proposal would condition some school funding on reopening, while Democrats would not.

Because the Democratic measure was approved in May, before schools were
contemplating [how to begin another academic year
safely](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/health/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html)
with the virus still surging across the country, Ms. Pelosi has said she
will now push for more than the $100 billion included in the package for
education.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Republican bill would allocate $105 billion for states to put toward
schools. Of that money, $5 billion would be set aside for governors to
use at their discretion, and $30 billion would be set aside for colleges
and universities. The remaining $70 billion would go to elementary and
secondary schools, with two-thirds of the relief designated for schools
that have begun reopening and holding in-person classes.

Democrats have so far balked at the prospect of tying federal relief to
reopening.
