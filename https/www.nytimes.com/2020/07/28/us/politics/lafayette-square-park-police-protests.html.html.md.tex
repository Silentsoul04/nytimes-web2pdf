Lawmakers repeatedly pressed Gregory T. Monahan to square his remarks
with videos showing his officers attacking protesters. He declined.

WASHINGTON --- Confronted by lawmakers multiple times with videos of
Park Police officers advancing on protesters and beating reporters in
Lafayette Square last month,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/park-police-gregory-monahan.html}{Gregory
T. Monahan}, the force's acting chief, refused on Tuesday to acknowledge
the violent clashes and testified that his officers acted with
``tremendous restraint.''

Mr. Monahan and the Park Police are being scrutinized for their role in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{the
June 1 crackdown on protests in front of the White House}, during which
mounted police officers and officers in riot gear advanced on
demonstrators with flash grenades and tear gas just before President
Trump marched across the area to stage a photo op.

An Army National Guard officer who also testified on Tuesday as part of
the House Natural Resources Committee's investigation of the clash said
the Park Police subjected protesters to ``excessive use of force.''

Mr. Monahan
\href{https://naturalresources.house.gov/download/written-testimony-gregory-monahan-fc-ov-hrg-072820-lafayette-square}{told
lawmakers} that his officers were met with ``severe violence from a
large group of bad actors'' and that the response ``centered around
public safety.'' But pressed repeatedly to square his remarks with
evidence captured during the demonstrations that his officers attacked
protesters, Mr. Monahan demurred.

Representative Mike Levin, Democrat of California, played a video of
protesters running away from advancing police officers in riot gear. It
showed officers, in what became a widely circulated clip, attacking an
Australian news crew, punching and hitting the cameraman with a shield
and hitting a reporter on the back with a truncheon as she ran away.

``The officers you saw in those clips, were they surging against the
crowd and assaulting a news crew, yes or no?'' Mr. Levin asked.

``The video shows a moment in time,'' Mr. Monahan replied, adding that
he would not comment on whether his officers attacked reporters, citing
a continuing investigation.

In another instance, Representative Jared Huffman, Democrat of
California, played a video published by The Washington Post of police
officers issuing an inaudible warning to protesters to clear the park
and confused protesters asking one another what the police had said.
Asked by Mr. Huffman if he could hear the warning, Mr. Monahan testified
that he could.

``You must have superhuman hearing, because I don't think any of us
could hear it,'' Mr. Huffman replied.

Mr. Monahan said his force moved appropriately to quell the protesters
in Lafayette Square, calling the episode ``one of the most violent
protests that I've been a part of in my 23 years'' in the Park Police.
He described what he called the ``unprecedented and sustained nature of
violence and destruction'' in which demonstrators lobbed fireworks,
bricks and planks of wood at the police. He told lawmakers that 50 of
his officers were injured in the protests in front of the White House,
though he acknowledged that one officer was harmed on June 1, and not
until after the crackdown began.

``I believe the United States Park Police acted with tremendous
restraint in the face of severe violence from a large group of bad
actors,'' Mr. Monahan said.

Republicans on the committee accused Democrats of spearheading a
partisan investigation.

``This is a hearing about politics, and I apologize to you and the rest
of the officers in the United States Park Police for having to endure a
political attack,'' Representative Bruce Westerman, Republican of
Arkansas, told Mr. Monahan.

Maj. Adam DeMarco, an Iraq war veteran who serves in the District of
Columbia National Guard and was on the ground in Lafayette Square on
June 1,
\href{https://naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Mr.\%20Adam\%20DeMarco\%20-\%20Written\%20Testimony_.pdf}{also
testified on Tuesday}, telling lawmakers that ``at no time'' did he
``feel threatened by the protesters or assess them to be violent.''

``From my observation, those demonstrators --- our fellow American
citizens --- were engaged in the peaceful expression of their First
Amendment rights,'' Major DeMarco said. ``Yet they were subjected to an
unprovoked escalation and excessive use of force.''

Attorney General William P. Barr, who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/william-barr-house-judiciary-hearing.html}{testified
before the House Judiciary Committee} on Tuesday and was pressed by
lawmakers about the June 1 clash, took his own swipe at Major DeMarco,
noting that he ran as a Democratic House candidate in 2018.

``I don't remember Captain DeMarco, who is the same Captain DeMarco who
ran as a Democratic candidate for Congress in Maryland, even being close
to the discussions as to what was going on,'' Mr. Barr said.
