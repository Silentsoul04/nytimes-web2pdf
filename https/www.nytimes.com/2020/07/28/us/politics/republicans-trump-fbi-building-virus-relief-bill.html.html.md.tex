Another chapter in President Trump's quest to shape the future of the J.
Edgar Hoover Building seemed over as Republicans distanced themselves
from the administration's \$1.75 billion demand.

WASHINGTON --- Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader,
\href{https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1288150687109599232?s=20}{looked
startled} on Monday when first asked why Republicans had agreed to a
White House demand that \$1.75 billion for a new F.B.I. building be
tucked into their emergency coronavirus relief bill.

Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, framed the item as a Trump administration priority, not a
Republican one. Other Republicans were more blunt.

``I don't know --- that makes no sense to me'' said Senator Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of President Trump's. ``I'd be
fine, OK, with stripping it out.''

By Tuesday afternoon, another chapter in Mr. Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/us/politics/fbi-building-costs.html}{long,
strange and, to his critics, ethically questionable} odyssey to
personally shape the future of the J. Edgar Hoover Building seemed
headed to a close as Republicans distanced themselves from key elements
of their own coronavirus relief bill.

Senate leaders went so far as to say they hoped the administration's bid
to fund the construction of a new F.B.I. building would ultimately be
discarded from a final agreement, with Mr. McConnell backing away from
the idea, calling that provision, along with some others proposed by
Democrats, ``non-germane.''

It was the latest evidence of the disarray around attempts by
Republicans to come to a common position as they enter talks with
Democrats on another round of federal aid to deal with the economic
devastation of the pandemic.

And it highlighted how the White House and Republicans have injected
unrelated priorities dear to Mr. Trump into a negotiation that was
already going to be complicated and intense. Republicans are also
pressing to use the package to provide more than \$1 billion for the
Pentagon to restore projects that Mr. Trump defunded to help pay for his
wall along the southern border.

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin continued negotiations with Democrats led by Speaker
Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, seeking agreement on a package that can pass
both the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled
House and win Mr. Trump's signature. One key component of the earlier
relief package, expanded unemployment benefits, is scheduled to expire
at the end of the week, adding to the urgency of the talks.

With so much at stake, Mr. Trump's own party seemed to draw a line at
the proposal for the F.B.I. building. Mr. Shelby questioned whether it
was an urgent priority at a time when Americans are struggling to
weather a deadly pandemic and a recession.

``It's needed,'' Mr. Shelby said. ``The question is, is it needed now?''

In recent days, Mr. Meadows had pushed the plan to replace the building,
which is crumbling, out of date --- and long the subject an unusual
fixation for Mr. Trump, a former real estate developer.

As far back as 2013, two years before launching his candidacy, Mr. Trump
expressed his interest in the property, located on Pennsylvania Avenue a
block from the location of what would become the Trump International
Hotel. At that time, the F.B.I. building was the subject of a
long-debated plan that would allow the demolition of the existing
structure and clear the way for commercial development of that location,
allowing the chosen developer to construct an F.B.I. facility in the
Washington suburbs.

An executive at his company later expressed concern that the
redevelopment project could create competition for Mr. Trump's hotel.
After Mr. Trump took office, his administration blocked a plan to move
the building to a suburban campus, then unveiled another that would keep
the building where it is, raising questions about whether he was seeking
to protect his hotel from the possibility of a rival being built on the
site.

His actions triggered an ongoing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/us/politics/fbi-headquarters-inspector-general-investigation.html}{inquiry
by the Justice Department's inspector general} and brought scrutiny by
Democrats on Capitol Hill.

When asked last week why the provision was holding up negotiations among
Republicans, Mr. Trump told reporters that he wanted to keep the
building close to the Justice Department across the street.

``You can renovate the existing building, but it's not a good
building,'' Mr. Trump said. ``Or you could take it down and build a
great building for the F.B.I. for 100 years and have it be incredible.''

A senior administration official familiar with the White House's
negotiation strategy said on Tuesday that Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin
were treating the building provision as a potential bargaining chip to
use later in negotiations with Democrats. Senate Republicans want to
hold the package to around \$1 trillion, while the Democrats are pushing
a \$3 trillion bill that would extend the \$600 weekly enhanced jobless
payments through the end of the year, send \$1 trillion to struggling
state and local governments, and provide \$3.6 billion for election
assistance.

It is unclear how much leverage such a universally unpopular proposal
would have provided Republicans, who are seeking to counter the
Democratic plan by slashing the extra unemployment payments and have
omitted funding for state and local governments as well as money to help
states carry out the general election amid the pandemic. Both proposals
would send another round of \$1,200 direct payments to many Americans.

An official familiar with the negotiations said that Republican
senators, mindful that it had already taken days to reach consensus
among themselves on an opening bid, ultimately stopped resisting the
administration's insistence on including the F.B.I. provision in order
to move on to what are expected to be much more fraught negotiations
with Democrats, who have been publicly united behind their proposal
since May.

A chorus of Republican lawmakers said they were bemused by the demand
for the F.B.I. building, particularly given the amount of energy that
they had spent hammering Democrats for including items they deemed
unrelated to the coronavirus in their opening offer.

``I just don't get it --- how is it tied to coronavirus?'' said Senator
Rick Scott, Republican of Florida. ``I never understood why you're
giving money to the Kennedy Center or National Endowment for the Arts.
During a pandemic, let's focus on solving the problem.''

Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, was also left bewildered.

``Even if the White House wanted it, I'd be against it because that's
certainly not necessary,'' Mr. Braun told reporters.

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

    she later walked back that statement.}

For some Republicans, it was just another aspect of a proposal they
regarded as deeply flawed.

``I'm not inclined to support it now --- it's a mess,'' said Senator
Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said of his party's plan. ``I can't
figure out what this bill is about. I don't know what we're trying to
accomplish with it.''

Mr. Mnuchin's negotiation skills
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/politics/coronavirus-mnuchin-republicans.html}{have
drawn skepticism} from some Republicans, who have fretted privately that
he has been too open to making concessions to Democrats in earlier
rounds of pandemic aid talks. Asked on Tuesday if the money should
remain in the legislation, Mr. Mnuchin told reporters, ``We'll look at
everything in the bill.''

Mr. Meadows, the former congressman from North Carolina and co-founder
of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, is known for just the opposite:
He spent his years in the House opposing large spending deals of the
kind now under discussion, and urging ideological confrontation. In late
2018, he encouraged Mr. Trump to refuse to sign any government spending
bill that didn't fund the border wall, stoking a stalemate that led to
the most prolonged government shutdown in American history.

``There are a number of things in the last bill that had nothing to do
with the coronavirus,'' Mr. Meadows told reporters on Tuesday. ``I think
everybody acknowledges that it's a funding mechanism. And I don't see it
standing in the way of us getting a deal.''

After meeting with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority
leader, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin for a second consecutive day on
Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Pelosi said they were ``airing our differences.
There's discovery of where there might be opportunity or not.''

The White House has again declined to say exactly why the F.B.I.
building is a priority in the middle of coronavirus relief negotiations.

``As President Trump has said, the F.B.I. desperately needs a new
building and this measure provides critical funding for this project
that would keep the building responsibly near the Department of
Justice,'' Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.

But Democrats have long charged that Mr. Trump intervened to make sure
the site was not redeveloped with a project that would compete with his
company's luxury hotel across the street.

``It's outrageous,'' said Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland.
``This has not been a partisan issue. This is a personal issue for the
president.''

Among the very few people in Washington with nothing public to say on
the matter on Tuesday were officials from the General Services
Administration, which handles real estate for the federal government.
And the F.B.I. shared a statement attributed to an unnamed official, who
said, ``the need for a new F.B.I. headquarters facility has not
abated.''
