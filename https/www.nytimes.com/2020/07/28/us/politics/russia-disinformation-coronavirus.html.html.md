# Russian Intelligence Agencies Push Disinformation on Pandemic

WASHINGTON — Russian intelligence services have been spreading
disinformation about the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus), according to
newly declassified intelligence, material that demonstrates how Moscow
is continuing to try to influence Americans as the election draws
closer.

Russian military intelligence, known as the G.R.U., has used its ties
with a Russian government information center, InfoRos, and other
websites to push out English-language disinformation and propaganda
about the pandemic, such as amplifying false Chinese arguments that the
virus was created by the United States military and articles that said
Russia’s medical assistance could bring a new détente with Washington.

The disinformation efforts are a refinement of what Russia tried to do
in 2016. The fake social media accounts and bots used by the Internet
Research Agency and other Russia-backed groups to amplify false articles
have proved relatively easy to stamp out. But it is far more difficult
to stop the dissemination of such articles that appear on websites that
seem legitimate, according to outside experts.

“Russian intelligence agencies are taking a more central role in
disinformation efforts that Russia is pushing now,” said Laura
Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. “It is
not the blunt force” of the operations mounted by the Internet Research
Agency.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two American officials described the newly declassified intelligence but
would not provide the underlying reports about the activities of the
G.R.U. and the S.V.R., Moscow’s equivalent of the C.I.A. They discussed
the information on the condition of anonymity.

Last week, intelligence officials [warned about Russian, Chinese and
Iranian
efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/politics/election-interference-russia-china-iran.html)
to interfere with the election. While Democrats criticized the warning
for a lack of specifics, officials promised to release more information.

While the disinformation efforts outlined on Tuesday by American
officials were focused on the pandemic, security researchers said Russia
continued to push disinformation on a variety of topics.

The government’s accusations came as Mandiant Threat Intelligence, part
of the FireEye cybersecurity firm, reported that it had detected a
parallel influence campaign in Eastern Europe intended to discredit the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including disinformation about the
coronavirus. While the Mandiant report did not specifically name Russia
and its intelligence agencies, it noted that the campaign was “aligned
with Russian security interests” in an effort to undermine NATO
activities.

Facebook has begun labeling stories that appear on state-sponsored news
sites like RT and Sputnik. But it is harder for the social media
companies to identify and label news articles that are posted on
conspiracy-minded sites, according to experts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many of the pieces created by Russian intelligence were published on
InfoRos, a site controlled by the Russian government, and
OneWorld.Press, a nominally independent site that United States
officials said had ties to the G.R.U. American officials said other
sites, such as GlobalResearch.ca, regularly amplify G.R.U. propaganda,
but officials have not directly linked it to Russian
intelligence.

United States government officials mostly described disinformation
focused on the pandemic, but they also outlined ties between Russian
intelligence and a think tank that had published articles on politics.

The Strategic Culture Foundation is directed by another Russian
intelligence agency, the S.V.R., according to two American officials.
The foundation and its ties to Russian intelligence are also being
investigated by the F.B.I., according to another official.

In May, the foundation published [an article critical of Evelyn
Farkas,](https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/05/24/what-evelyn-fakas-trey-gowdy-and-some-others-dubiously-have-in-common/)
a former Obama administration official who lost a primary race in June
in New York for a seat in Congress.

Dr. Farkas said the Russians were continuing to repeat their efforts
from 2016 to try to influence the election.

“They want to sow dissent and reduce confidence among Americans in our
democracy and make democracy look bad worldwide,” she said. “They want
to prevent people who are tough on Russia from coming into power.”

Michael Averko, a contributor to the foundation, did not return a
request for comment, but he said in a recent mass email to reporters
that he had been visited by the F.B.I. Mr. Averko said he told the
F.B.I. that he did not know about any ties between the foundation and
Russian intelligence, but that he doubted they existed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the publication of this article, OneWorld.Press [issued a
statement](http://oneworld.press/?module=articles&action=view&id=1603)
saying any accusation that it worked for Russian intelligence was
“categorically false.” “To the best of our knowledge,” its
contributors have not been charged with crimes for cooperating with any
foreign intelligence agency, the statement said.

Without evidence, OneWorld.Press claimed that the accusations about
Russian intelligence’s propaganda efforts were being spread by officials
who aimed to hurt President Trump’s re-election chances. “Everybody
across the world knows that some members of the ‘deep state’ have their
daggers out for Trump, and the president himself has even said as much
on countless occasions,” it said.

American intelligence officials said the G.R.U.’s psychological warfare
unit, known as Unit 54777 or the 72nd Special Service Center, was behind
the propaganda campaigns that were often devised to obscure Moscow’s
role in creating them. [A 2018 report in The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-russias-military-intelligence-agency-became-the-covert-muscle-in-putins-duels-with-the-west/2018/12/27/2736bbe2-fb2d-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html)
linked InfoRos to the G.R.U.’s Unit 54777.

United States intelligence reports have identified two Russians, Denis
V. Tyurin and Aleksandr G. Starunskiy, with ties to the G.R.U. and who
make sure the messaging and disinformation drafted by the intelligence
officials are pushed by InfoRos and on InfoBrics.org and OneWorld.Press.

Russian officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

Mr. Tyurin and Mr. Starunskiy, the American officials said, were in
essence involved in a kind of information laundering, akin to money
laundering. They take the messages from Russian intelligence and spread
them on InfoRos, OnePress or another website.

The material created by the G.R.U. is then picked up by other websites
that further spread it. Those websites are often on the fringes of the
web, while some, like Global Research, have a significant following,
American officials said.

The stories pushed by Russian intelligence appear to be written by
native English speakers and do not stand out as products of a foreign
influence campaign, American officials said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From late May to early July, about 150 articles on the pandemic were
published by the Russian intelligence-backed effort, American officials
said.

OneWorld published pieces about how the pandemic was an [experiment in
manipulating the
world](https://oneworld.press/?module=articles&action=view&id=1521).
InfoRos, as well as the Tass news agency, published an article that said
the United States was[using the pandemic to impose its view of the
world](http://inforos.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=108952),
according to American officials. InfoBrics.org published reports about
Beijing’s contention that the coronavirus was [originally an American
biological weapon.](http://infobrics.org/post/30541/)

While the specific sites may not receive much traffic, American
officials believe the disinformation written by Russian military
intelligence is amplified, sometimes intentionally, sometimes
unwittingly.

Tracking the influence of Russian disinformation is difficult. While
documents stolen and published by Russian intelligence agencies had an
important effect on the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States,
the social media posts do not seem to have been as consequential.

But propaganda and disinformation published on alternative news sites,
like OneWorld or Global Research, may have more traction, some
researchers believe.

“What we have seen from G.R.U. operations is oftentimes the social media
component is a flop, but the narrative content that they write is shared
more broadly through the niche media ecosystem,” said Renee DiResta, a
research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, who has studied
the G.R.U. and InfoRos ties and propaganda work.

The EU DisinfoLab, an independent nonprofit organization, has previously
[linked](https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/how-two-information-portals-hide-their-ties-to-the-russian-news-agency-inforos/)
OneWorld, InfoRos and a French-language site to Russian propaganda
efforts. Some of that disinformation centered on allied troops spreading
the coronavirus, allegations similar to those in the new Mandiant
report.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mandiant called the threat group it found “Ghostwriter,” since it relied
on false news articles or made-up letters and quotations that appeared
to originate with local politicians or military officials. It relied on
articles written by what it called “at least 14 inauthentic personas,”
meaning reporters or blog writers who were invented by the creators of
the influence campaign. The articles were published by pro-Russian sites
like TheDuran.com, which American intelligence officials have also been
examining.

In one example, a fabricated letter presented as being written by the
secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, perpetuated the false claim
that the alliance was planning to leave Lithuania as the pandemic
spread. Another episode involved a local Lithuanian news site that was
hacked, and attackers posted an article that falsely claimed German
troops had desecrated a Jewish cemetery in Kaunas, a city in central
Lithuania.
