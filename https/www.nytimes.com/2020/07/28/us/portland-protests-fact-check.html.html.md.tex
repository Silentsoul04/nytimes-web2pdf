Protests?}\label{fact-check-how-violent-are-the-portland-protests}}

Attorney General William P. Barr said protesters had used fireworks,
Tasers, pellet guns and lasers to target federal officers in Portland.

PORTLAND, Ore. --- Attorney General
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/barr-testimony.html}{William
P. Barr} forcefully defended the federal response to long-running
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/protests-portland-federal-withdrawal.html}{protests
in Portland} on Tuesday, telling the House Judiciary Committee that the
protests had become violent. The federal intervention has been condemned
by state and city officials, but Mr. Barr argued it was necessary to
prevent violence from spreading to other American cities.

The nightly protests in Portland, which began in late May as a response
to the police killing of George Floyd, have become the backdrop for a
conflict between federal officials and local leaders. Mr. Barr and other
federal officials have drawn attention to vandalism and other reckless
behavior on the part of the protesters, while city officials have said
that federal agents dispatched to the district court in downtown
Portland have exceeded their authority and harmed peaceful protesters.

There are currently 114 federal law enforcement officers in Portland,
according to a legal filing from the U.S. attorney's office, drawn from
various agencies including Customs and Border Protection and the Federal
Protective Service. Their presence has reinvigorated tensions that had
been subsiding, local officials said. Several peaceful protesters have
been seriously injured, including
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html}{a
Navy veteran whose hand} was smashed by officers and a man who was shot
with a projectile that
\href{https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/07/police-shoot-portland-protester-in-head-with-impact-weapon-causing-severe-injuries.html}{fractured
his skull}.

``As I've said from the beginning, these peaceful protests are being
hijacked by a very hard core of instigators, violent instigators,'' Mr.
Barr said. ``Police casualties far exceed anything on the civilian
side.''

\hypertarget{have-protesters-used-violence-against-federal-officers}{%
\subsection{Have protesters used violence against federal
officers?}\label{have-protesters-used-violence-against-federal-officers}}

The crowds have been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/protests-divisions-blm.html}{largely
peaceful} and have included high school students, military veterans,
off-duty lawyers and lines of mothers who call themselves the ``Wall of
Moms.''

Mr. Barr acknowledged in response to questions from representatives that
many protesters had remained peaceful. ``You have a lot of people who
are out protesting and demonstrating,'' he said. ``The particular
violent opportunists who are involved here get into these crowds and
engage in very violent activity and hijack it.''

But he emphasized that some protesters have thrown rocks, water bottles
and fireworks at federal officers. Others have shone lasers at federal
agents and at security cameras surrounding the building, in an effort to
block their view of the crowd. Several fires have been set near the
courthouse, which federal officials have said could spread to the
building and harm the agents inside.

This has been amply documented with photographs, videos, and by New York
Times reporters on the ground.

Mr. Barr also claimed that protesters had used Tasers, pellet guns and
slingshots against the federal officers. The Times could not
independently confirm the use of those weapons.

As federal agents moved beyond the courthouse and into the streets of
Portland --- which experts have said they may not have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/us/portland-federal-legal-jurisdiction-courts.html}{legal
authority} to do --- agents have also been involved in scuffles with
protesters who tried to prevent arrests.

\subsection{Have any federal officers been
injured?}\label{have-any-federal-officers-been-injured}}

In a July 22 court filing, the U.S. attorney's office in Oregon said
that 28 federal law enforcement officers had been injured during
protests in Portland.

``The most serious injury to an officer to date occurred when a
protester wielding a two-pound sledgehammer struck an officer in the
head and shoulder when the officer tried to prevent the protester from
breaking down a door to the Hatfield Courthouse,'' the filing stated.
Other injuries included ``broken bones, hearing damage, eye damage, a
dislocated shoulder, sprains, strains, and contusions.''

The Department of Homeland Security said in daily briefings about the
protests that agents had been burned by fireworks and a ``caustic
substance'' that were thrown over a fence surrounding the courthouse.

The legal filings and daily reports from the Department of Homeland
Security do not make reference to one of the injuries described by Mr.
Barr: that projectiles fired from pellet guns ``have penetrated marshals
to the bone.'' On July 23, the White House press secretary Kayleigh
McEnany referenced a similar incident. ``Another federal agent was shot
with a pellet gun, leaving a wound deep to the bone,'' she said. A
Department of Homeland Security spokesman did not respond to a request
for more information about this injury.

protesters?}\label{has-there-been-violence-used-against-protesters}}

Mr. Barr emphasized the injuries sustained by federal officers and said
that they outnumbered those incurred by protesters.

There is not a comprehensive tally of injured protesters, but at least
\href{https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-protesters-lawsuits-police-brutality/}{five
people have filed civil lawsuits} describing injuries and seeking
damages of up to \$950,000. Other injuries, like those sustained by the
Navy veteran, have been captured on video.

Groups of nurses and doctors have recently joined the protests, voicing
objections to violence from the federal forces. Jillian Trent, an
emergency room nurse who joined a recent march, said that she had seen
an uptick of patients with injuries caused by rubber bullets and other
police munitions. ``People are coming in with their jaws falling off,''
she said.

Under questioning, Mr. Barr said that tear gas and violence were not
appropriate responses to peaceful protesters. In response to a question
about the use of tear gas, he said, ``The problem when these things
sometimes occur is, it's hard to separate people.''

Outrage over the federal agents' actions in Portland extended to Seattle
over the weekend, when thousands of protesters took to the streets on
Saturday against police violence and the deployment of federal agents to
Portland.

Some protesters lit several construction trailers on fire at a youth
detention center, smashed windows of businesses and, according to the
police, injured Seattle police officers with explosive devices. The
Seattle Police Department
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-I2OyGD_A}{released partial body
camera video} that showed explosions erupting near officers and
\href{https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2020/07/26/officer-injuries-precinct-damage-arrest-updates/}{photographs
of cuts and burns} suffered by officers that they said were from
explosives set off by the protesters.

Officers, meanwhile, doused protesters in pepper spray, rushed into
crowds and knocked people to the ground, including some who were trying
to help a woman who had been bloodied by a flash grenade. A
\href{https://twitter.com/slydesilva/status/1287240894219841536?s=20}{video
posted online} showed officers riding on bicycles into a group of
protesters, pushing them to the ground with their bikes and their hands.

The police said 59 officers had been injured, including one who was
hospitalized. Many of the injured officers were able to return to duty.

Kate Conger reported from Portland, Ore., and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs
from New York.
