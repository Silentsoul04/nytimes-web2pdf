Welcome. Life at home seems about where it was a week ago, in this age
where it seems to be Wednesday every day, though where I stay we are
heading into the dog pound of summer, fans whirring everywhere against
the heat. It’s hard to stay focused, hard to seek pleasure against the
pressures of the work day or the day spent looking for work, when so
many of us are still at home as summer beats on.

Now, you might well go see your family, though there’s more stress
involved in that kind of visit than many people imagine. You introduce
risk to their lives. Same deal with visiting friends. I think you go to
the woods instead, if you have the gear to camp. Since June, California
has reopened 85 state parks for camping, [according to the state’s
Department of Parks and
Recreation](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30388). Being outdoors is
beneficial after all this lockdown, and the risks of infection are lower
than at a bunch of friends’ homes. [Leo Carrillo State
Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=616), for one, is just an hour
out of Los Angeles, in Malibu. Try that, and I’ll try to do the same on
the other side of the country. Let’s all of us try.

More good advice for living a good life at home and near it is below,
and [At Home](http://www.nytimes.com/athome). Please let us know what
you’d like to know:

  - Before the pandemic, Anya Kamenetz was a parenting expert who would
    make [bold pronouncements about
    screentime](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/parenting/children-screen-time-games-phones.html).
    The entire situation has forced a dramatic re-evaluation, because,
    as she said, “Now, like Socrates, I know better. I know that I know
    nothing.”

  - At 68, Bob Brody has realized that [it’s good to be
    old](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/well/live/aging-benefits-pandemic.html),
    even during a pandemic. He’s taking better care of himself, and he’s
    occasionally stopping to literally smell the flowers. Even if you’re
    not quite on Brody’s page as far as embracing aging, studies have
    shown there is some [serious value to
    nostalgia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/smarter-living/coronavirus-nostalgia.html)
    in terms of its ability to combat loneliness — so a mental trip back
    to the 1990s might be in order.

  - With so many Americans struggling with finances right now, it is
    time for everyone to get better at [talking to their friends about
    money](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/style/how-to-talk-to-friends-about-money.html).
    It doesn’t have to be
awkward.

  - They key to a fun and inventive meal can be finding unexpected
    combinations. Crunchy cucumbers and creamy yogurt shine in Yewande
    Komolafe’s [cold-marinated
    salad](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/dining/cucumbers-yogurt-recipe.html).
    And cherries get a chance to do something other than fill pies when
    they join up with scallions and pistachios in Angela Dimayuga’s
    [savory
    salad](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/dining/cherry-salad-recipe.html).

  - While cooking for his family during lockdown, Yotam Ottolenghi found
    himself trying to please multiple people with differing tastes. That
    resulted in a [skillet berry and brown butter toast
    crumble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/dining/breakfast-crumble-recipe.html),
    which he says sits happily somewhere between breakfast and dessert.

  - Are you bored with home cooking? Gabrielle Hamilton says a good way
    to break out of a rut is to make [smoky eggplant
    croquettes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/bored-with-your-home-cooking-some-smoky-eggplant-will-fix-that.html).

  - It was a big week in film, with Universal agreeing to a deal with
    AMC Entertainment that will dramatically shorten the time it takes
    for [new movies to be streamed at
    home](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/media/universal-amc-movies-at-home.html).
    Manohla Dargis worked with readers to break down [“Love &
    Basketball,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/movies/love-basketball-viewing-party.html)
    and Jason Zinoman connected three films through their depictions of
    the [horrors of
    isolation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/movies/horror-she-dies-tomorrow-relic-amulet.html).
    And Hollywood said goodbye to [Olivia de
    Havilland](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/arts/olivia-de-havilland-movies-stream.html)
    (above) — take some time to stream her best work.

  - Traveling right now is fairly complicated. One option is a [literary
    road
    trip](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/books/time-for-a-literary-road-trip.html),
    with novels that are so good they truly take you on a journey.
    Another is to [explore modern
    ruins](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/abandoned-properties-to-explore.html)
    through photos and videos of places in our world that have been
    neglected or abandoned. Some are taking the opportunity to [plan
    elaborate
    trips](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/travel/future-travel-bucket-list-coronavirus.html)
    for 2021 — or even 2022 — and the rest of us can get our fix by
    taking a virtual visit to see [the moose of Isle
    Royale](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/travel/moose-michigan-isle-royale.html).

  - And on Thursday, we’re hosting the award-winning author Curtis
    Sittenfeld in an interactive conversation about [learning to write
    short fiction in five, easy-to-digest
    steps](https://timesevents.nytimes.com/astorywritingclasswithcurtissittenfeld/newsletter).
