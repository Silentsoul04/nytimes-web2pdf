Answering a reader's question about what to do with vacation time when
standard travel seems problematic.

Welcome. Life at home seems about where it was a week ago, in this age
where it seems to be Wednesday every day, though where I stay we are
heading into the dog pound of summer, fans whirring everywhere against
the heat. It's hard to stay focused, hard to seek pleasure against the
pressures of the work day or the day spent looking for work, when so
many of us are still at home as summer beats on.

To the mailbag! A reader writes:

\emph{I live in Los Angeles and it is becoming more and more clear that
we are not going to be back in the office for the rest of this year. Yet
at the same time, my boss is encouraging us to take vacation time, even
if we just stay home.In my head I have fantasies of trying to find a
beach house for a month, but that would be a bunch of money for just a
change of scenery.}

\emph{Do I take a road trip and stay with friends in a different part of
the country? But then am I putting them at risk? Do I just go drive out
into the woods and camp? I rarely make it home to see family in the
Midwest --- do I try to spend a month there?}
\end{quote}

Now, you might well go see your family, though there's more stress
involved in that kind of visit than many people imagine. You introduce
risk to their lives. Same deal with visiting friends. I think you go to
the woods instead, if you have the gear to camp. Since June, California
has reopened 85 state parks for camping,
\href{https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30388}{according to the state's
Department of Parks and Recreation}. Being outdoors is beneficial after
all this lockdown, and the risks of infection are lower than at a bunch
of friends' homes. \href{https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=616}{Leo
Carrillo State Park}, for one, is just an hour out of Los Angeles, in
Malibu. Try that, and I'll try to do the same on the other side of the
country. Let's all of us try.

  Before the pandemic, Anya Kamenetz was a parenting expert who would
  make
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/parenting/children-screen-time-games-phones.html}{bold
  pronouncements about screentime}. The entire situation has forced a
  dramatic re-evaluation, because, as she said, ``Now, like Socrates, I
  know better. I know that I know nothing.''
\item
  At 68, Bob Brody has realized that
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/well/live/aging-benefits-pandemic.html}{it's
  good to be old}, even during a pandemic. He's taking better care of
  himself, and he's occasionally stopping to literally smell the
  flowers. Even if you're not quite on Brody's page as far as embracing
  aging, studies have shown there is some
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/smarter-living/coronavirus-nostalgia.html}{serious
  value to nostalgia} in terms of its ability to combat loneliness ---
  so a mental trip back to the 1990s might be in order.

  With so many Americans struggling with finances right now, it is time

  to their friends about money}. It doesn't have to be awkward.

  They key to a fun and inventive meal can be finding unexpected

  While cooking for his family during lockdown, Yotam Ottolenghi found
  himself trying to please multiple people with differing tastes. That
  resulted in a

  berry and brown butter toast crumble}, which he says sits happily
  somewhere between breakfast and dessert.

  It was a big week in film, with Universal agreeing to a deal with AMC
  Entertainment that will dramatically shorten the time it takes for
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/media/universal-amc-movies-at-home.html}{new
  movies to be streamed at home}. Manohla Dargis worked with readers to
  break down
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/movies/love-basketball-viewing-party.html}{``Love
  \& Basketball,''} and Jason Zinoman connected three films through
  their depictions of the

  of isolation}. And Hollywood said goodbye to

  Traveling right now is fairly complicated. One option is a
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/books/time-for-a-literary-road-trip.html}{literary
  road trip}, with novels that are so good they truly take you on a
  journey. Another is to
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/abandoned-properties-to-explore.html}{explore
  modern ruins} through photos and videos of places in our world that
  have been neglected or abandoned. Some are taking the opportunity to
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/travel/future-travel-bucket-list-coronavirus.html}{plan
  elaborate trips} for 2021 --- or even 2022 --- and the rest of us can
  get our fix by taking a virtual visit to see
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/travel/moose-michigan-isle-royale.html}{the
  moose of Isle Royale}.
