## Moscow is accused of spreading pandemic disinformation

Newly declassified U.S. intelligence accuses Russia of [spreading
misinformation about the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/russia-disinformation-coronavirus.html),
as it tries to influence Americans with the November election
approaching.

The English-language propaganda and disinformation pushed by the G.R.U.,
Russia’s military intelligence agency, includes the amplification of
false Chinese arguments that the virus was created by the American
military, as well as articles that say Russian medical assistance could
bring about a new détente with Washington.

Many of the pieces were published on InfoRos, a site controlled by the
Russian government, and OneWorld.Press, a nominally independent site
that American officials said had ties to the G.R.U.

**What this means:** The campaign is a refinement of what Russia tried
to do during the 2016 presidential campaign. The fake social media
accounts and bots it used then are relatively easy to stamp out. It’s
far harder to stop the dissemination of propaganda on websites that seem
legitimate, experts say.

**Russian protests:** As antigovernment rallies swell in the city of
Khabarovsk, 4,000 miles from Moscow, apolitical residents [have turned
into
activists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/world/europe/russias-far-east-protests-putin.html).

**In other news:**

  - **China** recorded 68 new coronavirus infections on Monday, its
    National Health Commission said — 57 in the northwestern region of
    Xinjiang, where a flare-up since mid-July has shown little sign of
    abating.

  - Data released by the **United Nations World Tourism Organization**
    on Tuesday showed that leisure travel fell by 98 percent during the
    first five months of the year, compared with the same period in
    2019.

  - President Alexander Lukashenko of **Belarus** said on Tuesday that
    he had had an asymptomatic case of coronavirus but had since
    recovered. He has been accused of downplaying the virus’s dangers.

## Spain is unhappy about Britain’s blanket quarantine

Spain’s prime minister has called Britain’s [quarantine order for all
arrivals](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/world/europe/spain-britain-quarantine-order.html)
from his country “an error.” The decision [blindsided British
holidaymakers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/europe/Spain-quarantine-UK-travel.html)
and dealt a blow to Spain’s crippled tourism industry.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez argued that because the coronavirus had
spared some regions of Spain, it was actually safer for tourists to
visit those areas than to stay in Britain.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We don’t agree with that assessment,” said Simon Clarke, a junior
minister in the British government, adding that the travel advice was
guided by science.

More countries have issued travel warnings for Spain. The German foreign
ministry warned on Tuesday against going to three northeastern regions
where cases have spiked, and the Dutch government has told citizens to
avoid nonessential travel to Barcelona.

**Context:** Spain’s coronavirus caseload [has grown significantly in
the last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-reopening.html),
with 11,000 new infections putting it back among the worst in
Europe.

## This year, a very different hajj

In any other year, Muslims undertaking the annual pilgrimage to Mecca
would drink from a holy well and kiss the Kaaba’s Black Stone as they
thronged the Grand Mosque. Before they left Mecca, they would collect
pebbles to ritually stone the devil.

During the coronavirus edition of the hajj, which begins today, the
Black Stone is off limits. The authorities in Saudi Arabia are issuing
bottled water from the Zamzam well instead of letting people drink from
the source. The pebbles hurled at the devil will be sterilized. And far
fewer pilgrims will be there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s another example of [a major gathering drastically scaled
back](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-3fa8e195)
to ensure safety. Across the Middle East, celebrations for Eid al-Adha,
the festival that marks the end of the hajj this weekend, will likewise
be toned down.

**Numbers:** Last year, 2.5 million Muslims performed the hajj. This
year, Saudi Arabia said it would allow only 1,000 pilgrims, all from
within the
kingdom.

Scholars have speculated about how Vincent van Gogh, who died from a
gunshot wound in 1890, [spent his last day of
work](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/arts/design/vincent-van-gogh-tree-roots.html).
Now, thanks to a historical postcard, above, a researcher appears to
have found a significant clue: the precise location where the artist
painted “Tree Roots,” which is believed to be his last piece.

“Tree Roots” was painted on a main road in Auvers-sur-Oise, north of
Paris, about 500 feet from the inn where van Gogh spent his final weeks,
says the researcher, Wouter van der Veen. He stumbled across the
postcard and saw the similarities to the tangled, gnarled roots and
stumps of “Tree Roots.” The painting, he said, “is a farewell note in
colors.”

### Here’s what else is happening

**Taliban cease-fire:** The insurgent group said it would observe a
three-day cease-fire this week for Eid al-Adha, as President Ashraf
Ghani of Afghanistan suggested that [long-delayed talks between his
government and the militants could soon

**North Korea:** Kim Geum-hyok, the defector who swam back to the North

Korea, where he had been accused of rape. **** Our correspondent [looked

### And now for the Back Story on …

## Mars is great, but there’s lots more out there

*China and the United Arab Emirates have recently launched missions to
Mars, and the United States plans to send its fifth NASA rover,
Perseverance, to the red planet on Thursday.*

*Scientists are cheering these missions, but many are asking why we’re
going back to Mars yet again. Our Science team invited Rebecca Boyle and
David W. Brown, two space journalists, to* [*discuss the state of space
exploration.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/science/mars-nasa-science.html)
*Here’s an excerpt.*

**Rebecca Boyle:** So we’re going back to Mars. Again, with another
rover. Two, perhaps, if both NASA and China’s space agency succeed.
Sigh.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s not that this is disappointing. But there’s a certain level of déjà
vu with NASA’s Perseverance mission, modeled so closely after the
successful Curiosity rover in 2011. I have written a lot about the value
of exploring Mars and the particularly Earthlike qualities that endear
it to us. But even I can’t help but wonder what’s next in our quest to
explore the solar system, and whether so many journeys to Mars are
blocking other important
science.

**David W. Brown:** There’s an entire solar system waiting to be
explored. Since 2001, NASA has flown eight consecutive successful
missions to Mars, including five landers. Humanity now has a library of
Mars data sitting on servers that no one has had a chance to study. Data
collected from brief encounters by spacecraft with the moons of Jupiter,
on the other hand, or the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, have been
squeezed dry.

**Rebecca:** Meanwhile, as planetary scientists debated how to pay for
their missions, some geologists salivate for a second look at Venus, the
second planet from the sun. Venus is about the same size as Earth, it’s
rocky, it has an atmosphere. And it orbits the sun in a zone where
temperatures are just right for liquid water — and maybe life.

We know Mars had water at some point in its past, but it’s long gone. By
contrast, Venus might have had oceans more recently and for longer
periods, and may have been comfortably livable for billions of years.
