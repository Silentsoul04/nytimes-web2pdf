Good morning. I’ve been cooking two or three squares a day for 133 days
now, surely the longest run of my cooking life, and if it’s sometimes a
chore, I still thrill to the possibilities of an improvisatory session —
a no-recipe recipe made with what’s on hand. I love those “recipes,”
which are really just outlines, notes that others can make into dishes
that become entirely their own.

So, for instance, my pal [Ted
Kim](https://www.nytco.com/person/theodore-kim/)’s gochujang spaghetti?
He sent me the rough instructions: *Thick spaghetti cooked al dente +
sesame oil + a touch of sugar + generous dollops of gochujang + romaine
lettuce cut into pieces + sesame seeds + pepper + chopped scallion to
garnish. Serve with kimchi if you have it.*

It occurred to me, you could make that dish hot, or make it hot, then
fridge it and serve it cold. You could sauté some ground pork for the
gochujang and make a kind of meat sauce with it, with a splash of soy
sauce, or oyster sauce. You could thin out that sauce with stock or
water. You could ribbon some zucchini in there in place of the lettuce.
You could swap out the lettuce for chopped kale. All of these would be
gochujang spaghetti. Go make the one you want. It’s delicious every
time.

I get it, if that guidance is too vague. In these trying times, some
prefer the order of stepped instruction, the glory of a recipe that
holds your hand from beginning to end.

For them, then, for you: Yasmin Fahr’s new recipe for [sheet-pan baked
feta with broccolini, tomatoes and
lemon](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021277-sheet-pan-baked-feta-with-broccolini-tomatoes-and-lemon)
(above). Or the chef Sean Sherman’s slightly older one, for [salmon with
crushed blackberries and
seaweed](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020563-salmon-with-crushed-blackberries-and-seaweed).

You could make Tejal Rao’s recipe for
[keema](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020913-keema-spiced-ground-meat),
a sauté of spiced ground beef that you might accompany with her [gajjara
kosambari](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020909-gajjara-kosambari-carrot-salad),
a simple carrot salad.

Here’s Sarah DiGregorio’s recipe for [pressure cooker red beans and
rice](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020818-pressure-cooker-red-beans-and-rice),
a good way to cook quickly and without heating the kitchen too much
while you do. And Sue Li’s new recipe for [chicken and celery salad with
wasabi-tahini
dressing](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021228-chicken-and-celery-salad-with-wasabi-tahini-dressing),
a worthy dinner and an incredible sandwich filling at lunch.

Take a look, too, at David Tanis’s [sautéed scallops with crushed
peppercorns](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019844-sauteed-scallops-with-crushed-peppercorns),
at Mark Bittman’s [pasta with Gorgonzola and
arugula](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11380-pasta-with-gorgonzola-and-arugula),
at Melissa Clark’s [chilled corn soup with
basil](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016659-chilled-corn-soup-with-basil).

And recall that for many, Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holiday that honors
Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son at God’s command, begins
Thursday night. We have two new recipes for that, both written by
Nargisse Benkabbou: for
[mrouzia](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021280-mrouzia-lamb-shanks),
a Moroccan tagine of lamb shanks; and for [rose and almond
ghriba](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021279-rose-and-almond-ghriba),
crackly-soft cookies of amazing delight. Perhaps you can make one or
both of those, as well. (Here are even [more recipes for the
holiday](https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/1688528-what-to-cook-for-eid-al-adha).)

There are many thousands more recipes to consider cooking waiting for
you on [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/). Simply [subscribe
today](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription/cooking.html?campaignId=6XQHR)
to access them all, if you haven’t already. I’m bold to ask because
subscriptions support our work. They allow it to continue.

And we will be standing by like lifeguards at the reopened community
pool should anything go wrong with your cooking or our technology. Just
write the team at <cookingcare@nytimes.com> and someone will get back to
you, I promise. (You can always escalate matters by reaching out to me
at <foodeditor@nytimes.com>. I read every letter sent, and try to help
where I can.)

Now, it’s a far cry from chocolate chip cookies and discussion of the
very best sort of olive oil, but I think you ought to read [Daniel Riley
on the
Sultans](https://www.gq.com/story/americas-best-wedding-band-the-sultans),
maybe the nation’s best wedding band, in GQ. Weddings\! Remember them?
It’s exciting and fun, a reminder of the world that was.

I’m late to it, and it’s dark, dark, dark, but “[Line of
Duty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2303687/),” the BBC police procedural
you can stream all over the place, is just terrific.

Also old, also transporting: “[The Soho Press Book of ’80s Short
Fiction](https://bookshop.org/books/the-soho-press-book-of-80s-short-fiction/9781616955465).”
The library may not have it, but used copies abound online.

Finally, it’s Geddy Lee’s birthday. He’s 67. Here he is with Rush,
playing “[Time and Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GS3sQxRciY)”
live in 1996. I’ll be back on Friday.
