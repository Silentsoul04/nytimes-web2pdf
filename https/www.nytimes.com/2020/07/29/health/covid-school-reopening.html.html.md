But, experts caution, the findings highlight a period when few

In a new analysis, pediatric researchers have estimated that the states’
decisions to close schools last spring likely saved tens of thousands of
lives from Covid-19 and prevented many more coronavirus infections.

The findings come amid a worldwide debate on whether, when and [how to
reopen
schools](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html),
including for some 56 million American students, kindergarten through
high school.

Outside experts cautioned that the effect of school closings is
extremely difficult to predict because of unknowns like how infectious
children are and because of the difficulty in separating out the effect
of school closures from other measures that states took to control the
virus. In addition, early in the pandemic, testing was especially
limited and spotty, raising questions about how well the number of
confirmed cases reflected actual infections.

The paper, [published Wednesday in
JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.14348),
is likely to remind school districts and policymakers how consequential
their decisions could be for the shape of the pandemic this fall. The
study focuses on a six-week period in the spring and concluded that
school closure “may have been associated with approximately 1.37 million
fewer cases of Covid-19 over a 26-day period and 40,600 fewer deaths
over a 16-day period.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

However, they continued, “these figures do not account for uncertainty
in the model assumptions and the resulting estimates.” The authors
acknowledged that their findings are not broadly applicable today
because before closings in the spring, there were no precautions, such
as smaller classes and the wearing of masks, that are being recommended
for
reopening.

“At the time, there wasn’t any masking in schools, there wasn’t physical
distancing, there wasn’t an increase in hygiene and that sort of thing,”
said Dr. Katherine Auger, an associate professor of pediatrics at
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and the lead author of the study. “The
findings of our studies took place before any of those measures were
in.”

Still, Dr. Auger said, she believed that the conclusions of the study
supported the idea that decisions on reopening schools should strongly
consider the prevalence of Covid-19 cases in the community. “Are there a
lot of cases right now, is it a hot spot, is it an outbreak, is it a
surge?” Dr. Auger said. She said that the [American Academy of
Pediatrics
guidelines](https://mailcastr.com/links/t/MTExMDY2Ojo6MjRkZTk2ZWM3NjNiNDVlNjg1NGI2ZWNhM2MwMmJlNGU6OnYzOjoxNTk1OTg4MDMyOjox/brMxW)“emphasize
making sure that the community numbers are reasonable before trying to
open schools, and I think this manuscript sort of bolsters that a bit.”

Experts not involved in the study said that its findings could reflect
not only reduced infections at schools but broader disruptions due to
students being at home.

“This is a nice study that provides clear interpretations and caveats,”
said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and statistics at the
University of Texas, Austin. Dr. Meyers said that the school closures in
March “not only disrupted daily interactions among students, but also
raised awareness of the emerging threat of Covid-19 and forced parents
to stay home to care for their children.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But other experts noted that the impact of preventive measures taken by
states — including stay-at-home orders, closures of restaurants and
nonessential businesses and limits on large social gatherings —
simultaneously or shortly after school closings, made it hard to
determine the specific role of schools in such analyses.

“I think we have to be incredibly cautious when interpreting estimates
from a study like this,” said Julie Donohue, a professor of public
health at the University of Pittsburgh who co-wrote[an editorial about
the
study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.13092).
“In particular, I think it’s important to emphasize that we really can’t
isolate the impact of school closures from other interventions.”

Dr. Donohue added that “even if these numbers were accurate or valid, we
don’t know how much of the effect would be derived from reducing
contacts among kids at school, versus reducing contacts among parents
who have to stay home from work because their children are out of
school.”

Given that the study is being published just as districts around the
country are struggling with whether and how to reopen schools, some
experts expressed concern that its estimates about the impact of closing
schools early in the pandemic would be seized upon as an argument that
schools should remain closed. Experts on public health and education
have recommended that communities and schools should work toward
reopening with strong health precautions in place, because in-person
schooling has such tremendous value for children’s academic, social and
emotional
development.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“I do worry that these large estimates of the effect of school closures
will lead people to give up because it is going to be challenging to
open schools,” Dr. Donohue said. “I do worry that some districts will
look at these numbers and say, well, it’s just too hard and it’s not
safe to reopen.”

Analyses of [cellphone mobility
data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html)in
March, by The New York Times and others, revealed that people in some
states began spending more time at home and less time congregating in
public spaces days to weeks before official shelter-in-place orders were
enacted.

In the new report, a research team led by Dr. Auger analyzed case counts
and deaths in all 50 states beginning on March 7, before the first
closings, and ending on May 7, six weeks after the last closing orders.
Some states closed their schools a week or more before implementing a
more comprehensive lockdown; others did so simultaneously, or close to
it. Covid-19 prevalence rates also varied widely, with states like New
York and California at the high end and others, like Nebraska and Texas,
on the lower end.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The researchers used these differences to help isolate the probable
effects of closings from those that were the result of other measures,
like closing businesses and stay-at-home policies. The study also
accounted for state differences in population vulnerability to the
virus, according to an index from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention that accounts for household income, demographics, underlying
levels of chronic diseases and other factors. The earlier a state closed
its schools, the fewer cases and deaths accumulated in the weeks that
followed, the study found.

A co-author, Dr. Samir Shah, a professor of pediatrics and director of
the division of hospital medicine at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital,
emphasized the complicated balancing act in deciding whether to reopen
schools. “It’s not simply a decision of, what is the risk of Covid,” he
said. “It also has to factor in what are the benefits versus harms of
not having children in school in person.”
