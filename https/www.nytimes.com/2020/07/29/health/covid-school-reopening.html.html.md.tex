But, experts caution, the findings highlight a period when few
precautions were in place, and do not apply to current discussions about
reopening schools.

In a new analysis, pediatric researchers have estimated that the states'
decisions to close schools last spring likely saved tens of thousands of
lives from Covid-19 and prevented many more coronavirus infections.

The findings come amid a worldwide debate on whether, when and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html}{how
to reopen schools}, including for some 56 million American students,
kindergarten through high school.

Outside experts cautioned that the effect of school closings is
extremely difficult to predict because of unknowns like how infectious
children are and because of the difficulty in separating out the effect
of school closures from other measures that states took to control the
virus. In addition, early in the pandemic, testing was especially
limited and spotty, raising questions about how well the number of
confirmed cases reflected actual infections.

The paper,
\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.14348}{published
Wednesday in JAMA}, is likely to remind school districts and
policymakers how consequential their decisions could be for the shape of
the pandemic this fall. The study focuses on a six-week period in the
spring and concluded that school closure ``may have been associated with
approximately 1.37 million fewer cases of Covid-19 over a 26-day period
and 40,600 fewer deaths over a 16-day period.''

However, they continued, ``these figures do not account for uncertainty
in the model assumptions and the resulting estimates.'' The authors
acknowledged that their findings are not broadly applicable today
because before closings in the spring, there were no precautions, such
as smaller classes and the wearing of masks, that are being recommended
for reopening.

``At the time, there wasn't any masking in schools, there wasn't
physical distancing, there wasn't an increase in hygiene and that sort
of thing,'' said Dr. Katherine Auger, an associate professor of
pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the lead author of the
study. ``The findings of our studies took place before any of those
measures were in.''

Still, Dr. Auger said, she believed that the conclusions of the study
supported the idea that decisions on reopening schools should strongly
consider the prevalence of Covid-19 cases in the community. ``Are there
a lot of cases right now, is it a hot spot, is it an outbreak, is it a
surge?'' Dr. Auger said. She said that the
\href{https://mailcastr.com/links/t/MTExMDY2Ojo6MjRkZTk2ZWM3NjNiNDVlNjg1NGI2ZWNhM2MwMmJlNGU6OnYzOjoxNTk1OTg4MDMyOjox/brMxW}{American
Academy of Pediatrics guidelines}``emphasize making sure that the
community numbers are reasonable before trying to open schools, and I
think this manuscript sort of bolsters that a bit.''

Experts not involved in the study said that its findings could reflect
not only reduced infections at schools but broader disruptions due to
students being at home.

``This is a nice study that provides clear interpretations and
caveats,'' said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and
statistics at the University of Texas, Austin. Dr. Meyers said that the
school closures in March ``not only disrupted daily interactions among
students, but also raised awareness of the emerging threat of Covid-19
and forced parents to stay home to care for their children.''

But other experts noted that the impact of preventive measures taken by
states --- including stay-at-home orders, closures of restaurants and
nonessential businesses and limits on large social gatherings ---
simultaneously or shortly after school closings, made it hard to
determine the specific role of schools in such analyses.

``I think we have to be incredibly cautious when interpreting estimates
from a study like this,'' said Julie Donohue, a professor of public
health at the University of Pittsburgh who
co-wrote\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.13092}{an
editorial about the study}. ``In particular, I think it's important to
emphasize that we really can't isolate the impact of school closures
from other interventions.''

Dr. Donohue added that ``even if these numbers were accurate or valid,
we don't know how much of the effect would be derived from reducing
contacts among kids at school, versus reducing contacts among parents
who have to stay home from work because their children are out of
school.''

Given that the study is being published just as districts around the
country are struggling with whether and how to reopen schools, some
experts expressed concern that its estimates about the impact of closing
schools early in the pandemic would be seized upon as an argument that
schools should remain closed. Experts on public health and education
have recommended that communities and schools should work toward
reopening with strong health precautions in place, because in-person
schooling has such tremendous value for children's academic, social and
emotional development.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``I do worry that these large estimates of the effect of school closures
will lead people to give up because it is going to be challenging to
open schools,'' Dr. Donohue said. ``I do worry that some districts will
look at these numbers and say, well, it's just too hard and it's not
safe to reopen.''

Analyses of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html}{cellphone
mobility data}in March, by The New York Times and others, revealed that
people in some states began spending more time at home and less time
congregating in public spaces days to weeks before official
shelter-in-place orders were enacted.

In the new report, a research team led by Dr. Auger analyzed case counts
and deaths in all 50 states beginning on March 7, before the first
closings, and ending on May 7, six weeks after the last closing orders.
Some states closed their schools a week or more before implementing a
more comprehensive lockdown; others did so simultaneously, or close to
it. Covid-19 prevalence rates also varied widely, with states like New
York and California at the high end and others, like Nebraska and Texas,
on the lower end.

The researchers used these differences to help isolate the probable
effects of closings from those that were the result of other measures,
like closing businesses and stay-at-home policies. The study also
accounted for state differences in population vulnerability to the
virus, according to an index from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention that accounts for household income, demographics, underlying
levels of chronic diseases and other factors. The earlier a state closed
its schools, the fewer cases and deaths accumulated in the weeks that
followed, the study found.

A co-author, Dr. Samir Shah, a professor of pediatrics and director of
the division of hospital medicine at Cincinnati Children's Hospital,
emphasized the complicated balancing act in deciding whether to reopen
schools. ``It's not simply a decision of, what is the risk of Covid,''
he said. ``It also has to factor in what are the benefits versus harms
of not having children in school in person.''
