*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

After serving as dean of women at Florida State University in the late
1960s, Katherine B. Hoffman said that her biggest accomplishment had
been abolishing her own position.

Bringing female students under the same administrators as men belonged
to a larger agenda: creating greater gender equity at the school. As
dean, Ms. Hoffman also eased the dress code for women and abolished
their curfew.

“They had to wear essentially what were like trench coats,” Norris
Hoffman, Ms. Hoffman’s son, recalled. “F.S.U. still thought that the
cars in which women were riding would turn into pumpkins at midnight.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Hoffman, who spent 88 years connected to the university, died on
July 18 at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare. She was 105. Her son said
the cause was Covid-19.

“A couple of people,” Sherrill Ragans, a retired F.S.U. administrator,
said, “have sent an email saying, ‘I thought she was eternal.’”

Katherine Marie Blood was born on Aug. 1, 1914, in Winter Haven, Fla.
Her father, Norman Wyckoff Blood, “used to take rich Yankees on fishing
trips,” Mr. Hoffman said, and later became a citrus grower. Her mother,
Laura (McCrary) Blood, was a schoolteacher.

Katherine, known as Kitty, arrived at Florida State College for Women,
which later became F.S.U., in 1932. It was the Depression, and her
father paid part of her tuition with bundles of oranges.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She went on to become student body president, captain of the women’s
baseball and volleyball teams, a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the
exemplar of “charm,” as chosen by her fellow graduating classmates in
their 1936 yearbook.

Ms. Hoffman had hoped to earn a medical degree from Duke University, but
declined to attend on principle after she learned that the school
ordered female students to sign a pledge not to marry during their
studies. Instead, she obtained a master’s in chemistry from Columbia
University in 1938 and married her high school sweetheart, Harold
Hoffman, who also became a chemist and was Florida’s assistant
commissioner of agriculture.

Ms. Hoffman returned to the Florida State College for Women as a
chemistry instructor in 1940. In 1947, the school renamed itself and
went coeducational to accommodate some of the millions of veterans
seeking to attend college after World War II.

Although she did not have a doctorate, Ms. Hoffman thrived in academia,
gaining notice for her skills as a teacher and administrator and writing
textbooks for Prentice Hall and McGraw-Hill. She was promoted to full
professor in 1959.

When Ms. Hoffman retired, in 1984, it was an occasion to discover new
ways to serve her university. She gave lectures on F.S.U.’s history and
helped run its sesquicentennial celebration. Following what her son
described as moderate donations, the university gave Ms. Hoffman’s name
to a scholarship, a lecture series and a teaching laboratory. When the
lab was rededicated in 2018, she attended the ceremony.

Harold Hoffman died in 1996.

When Ms. Hoffman was 102, her plain-spoken advocacy for women gained a
national audience. Outlets including
[Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/8/13562474/women-right-to-vote-96-years-hillary-clinton)
and
[People](https://people.com/politics/i-waited-96-years-women-born-before-19th-amendment-vote-for-woman-president-hillary-clinton/)
carried comments she had made to [I Waited 96
Years](https://www.iwaited96years.com/), an initiative to collect
interviews with women who were born before the 19th Amendment and who
planned to vote for a female presidential candidate (Hillary Clinton)
for the first time in 2016.

“This election means that women can achieve anything,” Ms. Hoffman
declared.

Well into her 90s, Ms. Hoffman was known to tootle around in a pink
Cadillac driven by a fellow nonagenarian. While her son fished for
largemouth bass in the Wakulla River, Ms. Hoffman rowed their boat. She
hauled gallon jugs of water for the pine trees they had planted.

Norris Hoffman also became a chemistry professor, teaching at the
University of South Alabama in Mobile. He retired in 2013.

During Mr. Hoffman’s boyhood, he and his mother planted seedlings on the
family tree farm. “We would talk about the elements, their names and
their properties in the periodic table,” he said. “She was brainwashing
me for
chemistry.”
