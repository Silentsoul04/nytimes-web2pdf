# U.S. Surpasses 150,000 Coronavirus Deaths, Far Eclipsing Projections

The national toll shows how difficult predicting the virus — or human
behavior — can be. President Trump and leading experts have at times
said that deaths would be much lower.

The United States’ leading authority on infectious disease [expressed
hope in
April](https://www.today.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-virus-death-toll-may-be-more-like-60-000-than-100-000-to-200-000-81825861735)
that no more than 60,000 people in the country would die from the
coronavirus. A revered research center predicted a few weeks later that
the figure would be just over 70,000 people by early August. When the
number of deaths shot up in May, [President Trump
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
that anywhere between 75,000 and 100,000 people could die.

On Wednesday, the nation’s death toll surpassed 150,000.

That the figure, based on [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=STYLN_pharmacy_components&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu),
has soared so soon and so far beyond those estimates illustrates how
difficult it can be to accurately forecast the spread of the virus, or
the way citizens and politicians will respond to it.

“The aspect which is really impossible to predict is human behavior,”
said Virginia Pitzer, a professor of epidemiology at Yale. “To what
extent are people going to socially distance themselves? To what extent
are politics going to influence whether you wear a mask? All of these
factors are impossible to factor in.”

Americans have rarely been as hungry for scientific predictions as they
have been this year. Charts of virus case counts fill social media
feeds; epidemiologists are all over television; Dr. Anthony S. Fauci has
become a household name.

But the statistical modelers who were trying to predict the spread of a
new virus began with very little solid data, experts said, so it was no
surprise that they have had to repeatedly revise their projections. The
revisions have generally been in one direction: up.

As of Wednesday evening, at least 150,909 people were known to have died
of the virus in the United States, out of more than 4.4 million reported
infections. And even these figures are likely to be undercounts, experts
say.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that in some
regions the number of people who have been infected [could be two to 13
times
higher](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html)

toll probably [omits many people whose deaths were

Weekly averages of reported deaths in the United States had fallen
substantially since an early peak in mid-April, when the national death
toll was driven largely by a catastrophic surge in New York State. But
deaths began to climb again this month, and the nation is now reporting
about 1,000 deaths a
day.

The current toll is being felt much more widely across many states,
especially in the South, while New York is down to reporting an average
of 16 deaths a day. Nearly 2,200 deaths have been reported in the past
week in Texas, the state with the highest recent [death toll relative to
its
population](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
followed by Arizona and South Carolina. Florida broke its daily record
again on Wednesday, reporting 216 fatalities and bringing the state’s

“The mortality is going to march in lockstep with our transmission,”
said Dr. Sarah Fortune, the chair of immunology and infectious diseases
at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.

Exactly what percentage of people who get the virus die from it is not
yet clear. The World Health Organization’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya
Swaminathan, said last month that it was [likely to be about 0.6
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/coronavirus-death-rate.html).
If that rate proves accurate, it would mean a vast majority of
infections in the United States have gone unreported.

Dr. Fortune estimated that a mortality rate of 0.5 percent of all
coronavirus cases would be a “best-case scenario,” but that the death
rate could range up to 2 percent of cases, depending on how much the
virus reaches into the highest-risk environments, like nursing homes.

“We have to do better in terms of limiting transmission,” Dr. Fortune
said. “We have this terrible death toll because we have done a lousy job
at limiting transmission.”

How well Americans will adhere to measures meant to limit the spread of
the virus has been one of the hardest things to predict, experts said,
and may be partially to blame for the
underestimates.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s
coronavirus response coordinator, estimated in March that the virus
could kill between 100,000 and 240,000 people in the United States, even
with preventive measures. In early April, Dr. Fauci [said on the “Today”
show](https://www.today.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-virus-death-toll-may-be-more-like-60-000-than-100-000-to-200-000-81825861735)
that he thought deaths may never reach 100,000.

“Models are really only as good as the assumptions that you put into the
model, but when you start to see real data, you can modify that model,
and the real data are telling us that it is highly likely that we’re
having a definite positive effect,” Dr. Fauci said on the show, later
adding: “It looks more like the 60,000 than the 100,000 to 200,000. But
having said that, we’d better be careful that we don’t say, ‘OK, we’re
doing so well, we can pull back.’”

By May 1, [several
states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/us/coronavirus-us-hot-spots-reopening.html)
were [reopening gyms, salons, restaurants and other
businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html).
Mr. Trump, who has [given a wide range of predictions for the ultimate
death
count](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/04/politics/trump-rising-coronavirus-death-estimates/index.html),
said on May 3 that the virus might end up killing 100,000 people, after
saying for much of April that the virus would not kill more than 75,000.

The next day, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, whose
model is closely watched by the White House, [increased its own
projection](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-ihme-forecast-projects-nearly-135000-covid-19-deaths-us),
warning that there would likely be about 135,000 deaths by early August.
The institute’s model, which includes a wide range of possible
scenarios, now [projects about 220,000 deaths by
November](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america).

Adding to the difficulty of predicting human behavior, Professor Pitzer
said, is that public policy can be influenced by the models: seeing a
forecast may prompt officials to take actions that make the forecast
less likely to come true.

“Models are useful for playing out scenarios, but they’re not really
meant to be accurate in generating long-term predictions,” she said.
“They can be good at short-term forecasting — what might happen in the
next couple of weeks. But longer term, knowing exactly what the
trajectory of the epidemic will be —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> 
</span>there are just too many variables.”
