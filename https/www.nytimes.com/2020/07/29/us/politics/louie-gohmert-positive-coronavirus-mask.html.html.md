# Anti-Mask Louie Gohmert Tests Positive, Sending Shudders Through Congress

</div>

The Texas congressman, who frequently refused to wear a mask, said he
had probably contracted the coronavirus because he did so. His diagnosis
raised questions about the spread of the virus on Capitol
Hill.

Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently
refused to don a face covering in the Capitol, confirmed on Wednesday
that he had tested positive for the coronavirus before a planned trip
with President Trump on Air Force One, and he blamed his diagnosis on
wearing a mask.

The results immediately sent a shudder through the Capitol, where this
week Mr. Gohmert has been voting and actively participating in
congressional hearings, including a [Judiciary Committee session on
Tuesday with Attorney General William P.
Barr](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/barr-testimony.html)
and another held by the Natural Resources Committee.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Wednesday a new mandate requiring
lawmakers and staff to wear masks on the House floor and in House office
buildings, on penalty of removal. And at least three colleagues and
several aides who had contact with Mr. Gohmert announced they would
quarantine, while Mr. Barr planned to be tested.

Mr. Gohmert, 66, said he was not experiencing symptoms but had notified
colleagues with whom he may have come into contact.

Smiling in a [video recorded in his Capitol Hill
office](https://twitter.com/replouiegohmert/status/1288522631000489985?s=20),
he declared he had probably gotten the “Wuhan virus” because he had
started wearing a mask over the past week or two — not despite it.

Mr. Gohmert’s use of the term flew in the face of [warnings from medical
historians and public health
experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html)
that associating a pandemic with a particular ethnic group can lead to
discrimination. And his theory for how he contracted the virus
contradicted the overwhelming consensus of medical experts that wearing
a mask is one of the most effective ways to limit the spread of the
disease.

His diagnosis also revived urgent questions about whether it was safe
for Congress — with its 100 senators and 435 representatives, [many of
them
over 65](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/upshot/coronavirus-older-lawmakers-congress-risk.html)
and thus at higher risk for the virus — to continue to meet amid the
pandemic, and whether lawmakers were taking sufficient precautions.
Members have adopted unevenly enforced safety protocols and allowed
themselves to bounce each week between the capital and their home
states, some of which are experiencing surges of the virus, without
getting tested.

House and Senate leaders turned down an offer from the White House in
May for rapid-testing ability, saying that they would prefer that
resources be sent to front-line workers. On Wednesday, their top
deputies said the time had come to reconsider.

“For members of Congress who are going back and forth, they represent
sort of the perfect petri dish for how you spread a disease,” said
Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and the chairman of the Rules
Committee. “Send 535 people out to 535 different locations on about
1,000 different airplanes, and bring them back and see what happens. It
seems to me there’s a better path
forward.”

Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority
leader, said he planned to press Ms. Pelosi and the House Republican
leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, on the matter. Mr. McCarthy urged
his members to wear their masks and renewed previous calls for lawmakers
to be tested regularly.

To date, Ms. Pelosi had required masks be used in House hearings and
encouraged — but not required — their use on the floor. She said
Wednesday that she considered doing so “a sign of respect” and that
failing to wear a facial covering on the House floor going forward would
be treated as “a serious breach of decorum” that could lead to a
member’s removal from the floor.

Mr. Gohmert is far from the first member of Congress to contract the
coronavirus. [A tally maintained by
GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/covid-19#legislators) puts that number
at 10, with dozens more having isolated for a period of time after
coming into contact with someone carrying it. But not since [Senator
Rand Paul of Kentucky tested positive in late
March](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-rand-paul.html)
as senators were trying to cinch a coronavirus relief deal has Congress
been so shaken by signs of the virus circulating among its ranks.

By midafternoon, lawmakers, support staff and journalists were racing to
isolate themselves after possible exposure, as health officials were
left to try to retrace Mr. Gohmert’s steps. It was a daunting task
because Mr. Gohmert is a frequent schmoozer who could have come into
close contact with dozens of fellow lawmakers and aides this week alone.

[Dr. Brian P. Monahan, Congress’s attending
physician](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/politics/congress-doctor-virus-brian-monahan.html),
advised members of the Judiciary Committee that they could be at
elevated risk if they sat near Mr. Gohmert or used the same equipment,
but said Democrats, at least, did not need to quarantine.

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona and the chairman of
the Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement that he would
isolate himself until he could get test results because of extended
contact with Mr. Gohmert in his committee’s hearing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“In the meantime, my work schedule and the lives of my employees are
disrupted,” said Mr. Grijalva, 72. “This stems from a selfish act by Mr.
Gohmert, who is just one member of
Congress.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

A spokeswoman for Representative Kay Granger, 77, a fellow Texas
Republican who sat beside Mr. Gohmert on Sunday evening on a flight from
Texas, said she would quarantine at Dr. Monahan’s direction, “and out of
an abundance of caution.” Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of
Louisiana, [said he would do the same after
dining](https://twitter.com/RepMikeJohnson/status/1288655872953024512?s=20)
with Mr. Gohmert on Monday. Several Republican staff aides for the
natural resources panel also planned to quarantine, [a spokesman

Lawmakers and Mr. Barr were seated more than six feet apart during his
hearing, but reporters spotted a maskless Mr. Gohmert outside the
hearing room exchanging words with Mr. Barr, whose face was also
uncovered. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said that the
attorney general would be tested on Wednesday.

Mr. Gohmert’s spokeswoman and chief of staff did not respond to requests
for comment.

Democrats, in particular, were furious at the news. Mr. Gohmert is among
a group of House Republicans, many of whom form the conservative Freedom
Caucus, who have frequently refused to wear masks on the House floor and
in the halls of the Capitol complex, despite warnings from public health
experts and an outbreak in his home state.

“I’m concerned about the irresponsible behavior of many of the
Republicans who have chosen to consistently flout well-established
public health guidance,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat
of New York and a member of the Judiciary Committee. He pleaded with
Republicans like Mr. Gohmert to put on masks or go home.

Mr. Hoyer urged him to vote by proxy under [new rules pushed through by
Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/politics/remote-voting-house-coronavirus.html)
to allow lawmakers to skip traveling to Washington during the pandemic
and instead deputize a colleague to cast votes on their behalf.
Republicans bitterly opposed the change and have sued in federal court
to have it declared unconstitutional.

Mr. Gohmert said he only found out that he had the virus when he went to
the White House at 7 a.m. Wednesday and was screened in line with the
White House policy of testing anyone who would be near Mr. Trump. Mr.
Gohmert tested positive twice.

In an interview from his office later Wednesday, he told KETK TV, a
Texas Fox affiliate, that he would isolate for 10 days on the advice of
doctors and would wear a mask “religiously” until he was cleared. But he
said his diagnosis had vindicated his skepticism about wearing facial
coverings to guard against the spread of the virus.

“There are an awful lot of people who think it’s the great thing to do
all the time, but I can’t help but think if I hadn’t been wearing a mask
so much in the last 10 days or so, I really wonder if I would have
gotten it,” Mr. Gohmert said. “Moving the mask around, getting it
sitting just right, I am bound to have put some virus on the mask that I
sucked in. That is most likely what happened.”

Mr. Gohmert, who has represented a deeply conservative portion of East
Texas in Congress since 2005, is known for his attention-grabbing,
high-volume invectives against Democrats and for his leveling of
conspiratorial charges toward the F.B.I. and other career government
officials.

suggesting that the congressman’s entire staff had been ordered to
continue going to work amid the pandemic in order to be an example of
how the nation could safely reopen, and that those who wore masks had
been berated for doing so. Many lawmakers have directed staff aides to
work from home, and have instructed those who come in person to wear a
mask at all times.
