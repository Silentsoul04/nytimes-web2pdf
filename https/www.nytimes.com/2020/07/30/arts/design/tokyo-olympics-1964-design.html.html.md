This weekend ought to have been the midway point of the Summer Olympics
in Tokyo, which would have gathered the world’s leading runners,
jumpers, throwers, lifters and — for the first time — skateboarders in
the world’s most populous city. May the Simone Biles fan club forgive
me, but the event I was most excited about was handball.

Not for the sport, but for the stadium: Handball matches were to take
place in the Yoyogi National Gymnasium, a landmark of Japanese modern
architecture designed by Kenzo Tange. The stadium is defined by its
massive, plunging roof, formed from two catenaries — steel cables
stretched between concrete pillars, like a suspension bridge — and the
perpendicular ribs that sweep down from those axes to the floor. Years
ago, biking through Yoyogi Park, I remember stopping dead before the
gymnasium’s soldered roof panels, marveling at its canopies of steel. It
might have been the most glamorous venue of this year’s Olympics, even
though it was built more than half a century
ago.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Olympics’s first postponement:
Tokyo 2020, [its name
unchanged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/asia/japan-olympics-delay.html),
will now take place in July 2021 [if it takes place at
all](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/sports/2021-tokyo-olympics-protocols.html).
Yet all around the Japanese capital is the legacy of another Olympics:
the 1964 Summer Games, which crowned Tokyo’s 20-year transformation from
a firebombed ruin to an ultramodern megalopolis. (Actually, the “summer”
Games were held in autumn; organizers thought October in Tokyo would be
smarter than [sweltering
July](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/sports/tokyo-braces-for-the-hottest-olympics-ever.html).)
Those first Tokyo Olympics served as a debutante ball for democratic,
postwar Japan, which reintroduced itself to the world not only through
sport but also through design.

The preparations turned Tokyo into a citywide construction site. [The
author Robert
Whiting](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/10/10/olympics/olympic-construction-transformed-tokyo/),
who was stationed with the U.S. Air Force in Tokyo in 1962, describes
the pile drivers and jackhammers that delivered an “overwhelming assault
on the senses.” Pedestrians went about with face masks and earplugs, and
salarymen drank in bars protected by dust-blocking plastic sheets. Japan
was just a few years out from becoming the world’s second-largest
economy, and the 1964 Olympics were to be a pageant of economic revival
and honor regained.

Trolleys went out, elevated highways came in. The city got a new sewer
system, a new port, two new subway lines, and serious pollution. Slums,
and their residents, were mercilessly cleared to make room for new
construction, some of it grand — like the exquisite [Hotel
Okura](https://www.studionicholson.com/blogs/features/hotel-okura-tokyo#:~:text=The%20Okura%20was%20built%20in,back%20modernism%20of%20the%20time.),
designed in 1962 by Yoshiro Taniguchi (father of the MoMA architect
Yoshio Taniguchi) — and much forgettable. The new shinkansen, or bullet
train, hurried between Tokyo and Osaka for the first time just one week
before the opening ceremony. Not until 2008, when the Games opened in
booming Beijing, would an Olympics so profoundly alter a city and a
nation.

Tokyo had been awarded the Games once before; it was meant to host the
canceled 1940 Olympics, succeeding the Nazi spectacle in Berlin in 1936.
The architects and designers of the 1964 Games therefore had to satisfy
a clear ideological goal: This was to be a showcase of New Japan,
pacifist and forward-dawning, largely free of classical Japanese
aesthetics or traditional national symbols. No Fuji, no cherry blossoms,
and no calligraphy. And any expression of national pride had to be as
distanced as possible from the old imperial militarism.

Devising the look of Tokyo ’64 fell to [Yusaku
Kamekura](http://adcglobal.org/hall-of-fame/yusaku-kamekura/), the dean
of Japanese graphic designers, who had imbibed modern design from the
Bauhaus-trained professors of Tokyo’s Institute of New Architecture and
Industrial Arts. Where past Olympics posters had relied on figurative,
often explicitly Greco-Roman imagery, Kamekura distilled Tokyo’s
ambitions to the simplest of emblems: the five interlocking rings, all
gold, topped by a huge red disc, the rising sun.

Kamekura’s poster didn’t just spurn western expectations of the “exotic”
Orient for hard, clean modernity. More impressive than that, it rebooted
the Japanese flag — which was all but banned during the first years of
American occupation — as a symbol for a democratic state. The same bold
aesthetic would also characterize Kamekura’s[second (and, for 1964,
technically daunting) Olympics
poster](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/8783), with a full-bleed,
split-second photograph of runners against a black
background.

The main ceremonies and athletic events took place at a nothing-special
stadium that has since been demolished. In the Komazawa Olympic Park in
Setagaya, a control tower designed by [Yoshinobu
Ashihara](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/art/the-yoshinobu-ashihara-architectural-archives-dreaming-modernism)
took the form of a 165-foot-tall concrete tree; it’s still standing,
though its brutalist candor has been softened with a shellacking of
white paint. It was, however, the somewhat smaller stadium in Yoyogi,
designed by Tange — who would go on to build Tokyo’s towering city hall
and its Sofia Coppola-approved Park Hyatt Hotel — that expressed in
concrete what Kamekura and the other designers did on paper.

In 1964 Tange’s stadium hosted the swimming, diving and basketball
events, and its marriage of brawn and dynamism broadcast more loudly
than any other that Japan had been restored, even reborn. From the
outside, it looks like two misconjoined halves of a sliced pair,
rendered in steel and concrete, though its real innovation was the roof.
Its tensile structure elaborates on Eero Saarinen’s recently completed
[hockey rink at Yale
University](https://sportsandrecreation.yale.edu/gallery/ingalls-rink-gallery),
and, even more, the Philips Pavilion at the Brussels World’s Fair,
designed in 1958 by his hero Le Corbusier.

More quietly, the gymnasium nods to Tange’s most significant work up to
this point: [the cenotaph arch in
Hiroshima](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/world/asia/obama-hiroshima-japan.html),
another curve of reinforced concrete. In Hiroshima, Tange’s arcing
concrete became a mausoleum for Japan’s darkest hour; in Tokyo, it
enclosed a festival of new national life. (The legacy of Hiroshima also
suffused the opening ceremony, where the sprinter Yoshinori Sakai — born
on Aug. 6, 1945, the day the first atom bomb fell — lit the
caldron.)

The 1964 Olympics were the first to be [broadcast
worldwide](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/23/archives/tv-satellite-test-to-show-olympics-tokyo-games-to-be-seen-in-us.html),
via the first geostationary satellite for commercial use, and Japanese
families with growing household budgets could even watch the Games in
color. Nevertheless, the most enduring images from Tokyo ’64 appeared in
the cinema, in the director [Kon
Ichikawa](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/19/archives/shooting-an-oriental-olympiad.html)’s
three-hour documentary “[Tokyo
Olympiad](https://www.criterion.com/films/709-tokyo-olympiad).” Shot in
the wide CinemaScope format, in rich color, with newfangled telephoto
lenses, “Tokyo Olympiad” is, by several lengths of the track, the
greatest film ever made about the Olympics. (You can stream it, along
with much drearier movies of the Games from 1912 to 2012, on the
[Criterion
Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/100-years-of-olympic-films-1912-2012).)

Unlike Leni Riefenstahl’s “Olympia,” which prefaced the Berlin Games
with Aryan athlete-gods in Greek drag, “Tokyo Olympiad” plunges us into
modernity from its opening sequence: a blazing white sun against a red
sky — the Japanese flag, inverted — smash-cuts into a wrecking ball
slamming into pylons. Building facades tumble to powder, bulldozers haul
away rubble. We see Tange’s stadium in mist, then the torch relay, and
then crowds jostling to see the young foreigners arriving at Haneda
Airport. Inside the stadiums, the telephoto lens allowed Ishikawa to get
stunning close-ups of the sprinters’ sweat and the swimmers’ gooseflesh,
but just as often he shot nearly abstract sequences of fencers and
cyclists blurred into streams of
color.

There are champions and record-breakers in “Tokyo Olympiad,” but they
share screen time with last-place finishers. Gold-medal matches get
intercut with overlooked details of attendants sweeping the triple jump
track, or shot put officials wheeling away the metal balls. The Japanese
Olympic Committee hated the film and commissioned another; nationalist
boosters called it unpatriotic or worse. But Ichikawa’s distillation of
national ambition into abstract form was the hallmark of Tokyo ’64, and
“Tokyo Olympiad” went on to become Japan’s biggest domestic box office
success, a record that would stand for four decades.

Whether they happen in 2021 or not at all, the upcoming Tokyo Games will
surely have a quieter cultural impact than their predecessor’s. The
first logo for Tokyo 2020 was [thrown
out](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34115750), on grounds of
supposed plagiarism. The first stadium, too: Zaha Hadid’s initial design
got dumped, and was replaced by a more serene and much less expensive
wood stadium, designed by the architect Kengo Kuma.

If Tange’s steel and concrete expressed Japanese ambitions in 1964, now
it is natural materials that point to a vision of a future whose
challenges are as much ecological as economic. But Mr. Kuma, who
attended the 1964 Games as a child, credits Tange’s swooping stadium as
the trigger for his own architectural career. “Tange treated natural
light like a magician,” [Mr. Kuma told the Times two years
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/t-magazine/kengo-kuma-architect.html),
reminiscing on his childhood discovery of Yoyogi National Gymnasium.
“From that day, I wanted to be an architect.”
