August is often a quiet month for publishers, but this year there’s a
lot to look forward to: new books from Akwaeke Emezi and Daisy Johnson;
a timely re-examination of William Faulkner, with a special focus on how
he wrote about race; and an astrophysicist’s (surprisingly soothing)
guide to the end of the universe as we know
it.

### ‘[Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/653196/caste-by-isabel-wilkerson/),’ by Isabel Wilkerson (Random House, Aug. 4)

Wilkerson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of “[The
Warmth of Other
Suns](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html),”
places America’s racism in a global context, linking it to the caste
system in India as well as Nazi ideology. She identifies eight
cornerstones of caste systems throughout history and across the world,
and uses vignettes from real-life people to illustrate how inequality
acts as an invisible, but deeply felt, blueprint for their lives.

A family in southeastern Nigeria confronts what little it knew of — and
was willing to accept about — its son after his body is delivered to his
mother’s doorstep. This mystery, by the author of
“[Freshwater](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/books/review/freshwater-akwaeke-emezi.html)”
and
“[Pet](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/books/review/pet-akwaeke-emezi.html),”
raises an unsettling question: How does a family mourn a young man who
was forced to hide his true self?

### ‘[El Jefe: The Stalking of Chapo Guzmán](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250254528),’ by Alan Feuer (Flatiron, Aug. 25)

El Chapo, the most famous drug trafficker of his generation, [received a
life
sentence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/el-chapo-sentencing.html)
last year. He had evaded the Mexican authorities for years, smuggled
hundreds of tons of drugs and became notorious for his violence and
corruption. Feuer, a Metro reporter for The New York Times who covered
El Chapo’s trial, gives a brisk, rich account of the kingpin’s rise to
power and his
downfall.

### ‘[The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-End-of-Everything/Katie-Mack/9781982103545),’ by Katie Mack (Scribner, Aug. 4)

“In about five billion years, the Sun will swell to its red giant phase,
engulf the orbit of Mercury and perhaps Venus, and leave the Earth a
charred, lifeless, magma-covered rock.” That’s how Mack, a theoretical
astrophysicist, begins her engrossing, elegant timeline of the cosmos.
Despite the book’s sobering title, she sprinkles in delightful esoterica
along the way, while providing a guide to some of the most plausible
scenarios about the end of the
universe.

### ‘[Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/594493/evil-geniuses-by-kurt-andersen/),’ by Kurt Andersen (Random House, Aug. 11)

Starting in the 1970s, according to Andersen, a “cultural U-turn” caused
the nation to abandon the middle class, instead rewarding corporate
interests and capitalist greed. The United States, he writes, might be
“the first large modern society to go from fully developed to
failing.” But for all his grim assessments, he offers solutions
(including stronger unions and a universal basic income), and believes
change is possible — so long as the left adopts tactics the right used
decades
ago.

### ‘[Life of a Klansman: A Family History in White Supremacy](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374186326),’ by Edward Ball (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Aug. 4)

In his National Book Award-winning book “[Slaves in the
Family](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/reviews/980301.01faustt.html),”
Ball tracked down descendants of the people that his ancestors,
plantation owners in South Carolina, had enslaved. Now, he returns again
to his family, focusing on one of his great-great-grandfathers and his
association with the Ku Klux
Klan.

### ‘[Luster](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374910334),’ by Raven Leilani (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Aug. 4)

Edie is a Black woman in her 20s, an artist in Bushwick who is
unfulfilled by virtually every part of her life. When she begins dating
a white man in an open marriage, she becomes entangled in his family’s
life — emotionally, physically and even economically.

It’s been almost 15 years since Meyer published “Twilight,” the
best-selling young-adult vampire novel that sparked a worldwide interest
in paranormal romance. Now she returns to the story of Edward Cullen and
Bella Swan, but this time, she tells it from his point of
view.

By 1976, Ronald Reagan’s political career appeared to be over. In
Perlstein’s new book, the final volume of his series charting the
ascendancy of the right in America, he traces Reagan’s political
comeback and how he reinvigorated the Republican Party’s base with his
pledge to “Make America Great Again.” Perlstein, an engaging
storyteller, offers a clear guide to the intellectual and ideological
debates of the
time.

### ‘[The Saddest Words: William Faulkner’s Civil War](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631491702),’ by Michael Gorra (Liveright, Aug. 25)

Faulkner’s enduring, ubiquitous quote that “the past is never dead”
might be a fitting epitaph for this new book. In this timely
re-examination, Gorra considers how Faulkner should be read in the 21st
century, with a focus on the depiction of Black people and racism in his
fiction.

### ‘[Sisters](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624960/sisters-by-daisy-johnson/),’ by Daisy Johnson (Riverhead, Aug. 25)

With her debut novel “[Everything
Under](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/books/review/daisy-johnson-everything-under.html),”
Johnson became the youngest author shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Her
new book focuses on two teenage sisters, July and September, who arrive
with their mother at a desolate house on the eastern coast of England
after leaving school for reasons that aren’t entirely clear. The sisters
are fiercely close, less than a year apart in age, but their
relationship takes on a sinister tone over time. As their circumstances
and past come into focus, Johnson delivers a shocking
twist.

The final volume in Smith’s seasonal quartet, set during the coronavirus
pandemic, centers on Sacha and Robert, two siblings grappling with the
awakening of their political and cultural consciousness. As she did in
the series’ earlier books, Smith balances timely real-life issues
(Brexit, the refugee crisis, Trump) with her characters’ inner lives —
and characters from the previous books reappear,
too.

of 2015](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/02/books/review/best-books-of-2015.html).
Now, Macdonald returns with a collection of essays, new and previously
published, about the natural world.
