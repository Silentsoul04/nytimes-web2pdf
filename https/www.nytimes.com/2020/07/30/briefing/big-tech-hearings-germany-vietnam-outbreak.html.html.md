## Big tech faces big questions

The chief executives of Google, Apple, Facebook and
Amazon<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>[appeared before
Congress on
Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html),
grilled for more than five hours by a House of Representatives antitrust
panel about the tactics that led to their dominance of the digital
economy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Appearing via videoconference, the executives — Jeff Bezos of Amazon,
Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of
Google — were asked whether their companies had [harmed the economy,
stifled rivals and left
consumers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html)
with few choices. All denied those claims.

There were emotional speeches and technical issues. Democrats accused
the companies of unfairly using their data hoards to kill off
competitors, while Republicans questioned whether their platforms
suppressed conservative voices.

The panel opened an investigation into the companies last year, and
federal and state antitrust officials are also looking into them. But
while the hearing was ripe with theater, any impact will be limited by
century-old antitrust laws that are [imperfect tools for corralling
internet
firms](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html).

We have [details on the
proceedings](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony),
and you can [sign up for our On Tech
newsletter](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT) for more
insights.

**Go deeper:** Mr. Bezos has been [cast in a role he never wanted:
Amazon’s defender in
Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/business/jeff-bezos-amazon-congress.html).
He has taken an unusually hands-off approach with policymakers, our
reporters write.

**What they said:** We [tallied how often the C.E.O.s repeated certain
arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/what-ceos-said)
and catchphrases, like “We are not that big” and “We are good for
America.”

## U.S. to pull 12,000 troops from Germany

The United States plans to [reduce its troop presence in Germany by
nearly 12,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/us-troops-nato-germany.html)
and relocate some units to Belgium and Italy, its defense secretary
announced on Wednesday. About 6,400 troops are to return to the United
States.

The move is certain to rankle European leaders and anger American
lawmakers who see the country’s military presence on the continent,
especially in Germany, as a cornerstone of the post-World War II order.

**What this means:** The Pentagon’s decision, which will leave about
24,000 troops in Germany, is in keeping with President Trump’s “America
First” philosophy. He has called Germany “delinquent” for not meeting
its NATO commitment to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on
defense.

**Quotable:** “This is so clearly a punitive move against Germany that
it’s hard to see any benefit from this,” said Rachel Rizzo, the director
of programs at the Truman Center for National Policy, who focuses on
European security issues. She added that it “will stick in Europeans’
mind well into the
future.”

## Belarus accuses Russia of election meddling

Belarus said on Wednesday that [more than 200 mercenaries from Russia,
disguised as
tourists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/belarus-russian-mercenaries-lukashenko.html),
had infiltrated the country to disrupt its presidential election —
drastically escalating a feud with its longtime ally.

Reports of a Russian mercenary force in Belarus could not be
independently confirmed. They followed months of increasingly tense
exchanges between Minsk and Moscow, whose leaders once bonded over their
wariness of the West. Now, President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has a
record of blaming foreign powers for his troubles, is turning his
propaganda machine on Russia.

The country’s state media said that 33 Russian fighters had been
arrested. The Russian Embassy said it had not received official
information about Russians being detained.

**Context:** Russia has long been Belarus’s main benefactor, and the
nations are bound together by language, similar political systems and a
shared reverence for many aspects of the former Soviet Union. But
relations soured as [President Vladimir Putin pushed Mr.
Lukashenko](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/world/europe/russia-belarus-putin-lukashenko.html)
to form a “union
state.”

Postponed elections. Sidelined courts. A persecuted opposition. Raids on
the homes of journalists.

As the coronavirus pandemic tears through Latin America and the
Caribbean, killing more than 180,000 to date and destroying livelihoods,
[it is also undermining
democracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/americas/latin-america-democracy-pandemic.html).
Leaders are using the crisis to do things that would normally be seen as
authoritarian, but which are now characterized as lifesaving measures.
Above, downtown Caracas, Venezuela, during lockdown.

### Here’s what else is happening

**Vietnam:** It seemed like a miracle: months without a single
coronavirus death, or even a local transmission. But over the weekend,
[the country announced that the virus was lurking after all — and
spreading](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/asia/coronavirus-vietnam.html).

**Notre-Dame:** During the April 2019 fire that nearly destroyed the
cathedral, **** hundreds of tons of lead burned, ending up in Parisian
parks, buildings and playgrounds. Now some has [been detected in the
honey produced by urban
beehives](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/honey-lead-notredame-fire-paris.html),
researchers say.

**Russian bounties:** When President Trump spoke with his Russian
counterpart Vladimir Putin last week, he did not bring up intelligence
that [Russia had offered bounties to kill American troops in
Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html),
Mr. Trump said in an interview published on Wednesday.

**Vatican:** Chinese hackers [infiltrated the Vatican’s computer
networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/china-vatican-hack.html),
a private monitoring group has concluded, in an apparent espionage
effort before talks over Catholicism’s status in
China.

has a [new partnership with The
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/media/new-york-times-serial.html)
— on figuring out how to be apart. “We’re all learning how to be alone
during the pandemic, and the one thing we can take comfort in is that
everyone is in that same boat,” writes Remy Tumin, a journalist on the
Briefings
team.

has written seven novels, with an eighth due in October. All set in
Ireland, they pull you way down rabbit holes and are haunting
diversions, writes our literary critic, who has put together a guide to
reading Ms. French.

**Watch:** Even though they were made before the pandemic, [three new
bold and chilling horror
movies,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/movies/horror-she-dies-tomorrow-relic-amulet.html)
all directed by women, have a kind of topical resonance now, with plots

### And now for the Back Story on …

## Our reporters on the U.F.O. beat

*Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Kean were part of a Times reporting team
that broke the story of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification
Program, a secret Pentagon unit investigating unidentified flying
objects, and they’ve been following it ever since. Here are excerpts
from what they recently wrote* [*about covering
U.F.O.s.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/insider/UFO-reporting.html)

We’re often asked by well-meaning associates and readers, “Do you
believe in U.F.O.s?” The question sets us aback as being inappropriately
personal. But in this case we have no problem responding, “No, we don’t
**** believe in U.F.O.s.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And to be clear: U.F.O.s don’t mean aliens. Unidentified means we don’t
know what they are, only that they demonstrate capabilities that do not
appear to be possible through currently available
technology.

Our previous stories were relatively easy to document with Department of
Defense videos of U.F.O.s and pilot eyewitness accounts backed up by
Navy hazard reports of close encounters with small speeding objects.

But [our latest
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/pentagon-ufo-harry-reid-navy.html?searchResultPosition=1)
provided a more daunting set of challenges, since we dealt with the
possible existence of retrieved materials from U.F.O.s. We were provided
a series of unclassified slides showing that the program took this
seriously enough to include it in numerous briefings. One slide says one
of the program’s tasks was to “arrange for access to
data/reports/materials from crash retrievals of A.A.V.’s,” or advanced
aerospace vehicles.

Our sources told us that “A.A.V.” does not refer to vehicles made in any
country — not Russian or Chinese — but is used to mean technology in the
realm of the truly unexplained.
