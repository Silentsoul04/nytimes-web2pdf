Strong sales in China helped \textbf{Huawei} edge out \textbf{Samsung}
to become the world's biggest smartphone vendor in the second quarter,
according to
\href{https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/Canalys-huawei-samsung-worldwide-smartphone-market-q2-2020}{the
research firm Canalys} --- a milestone for the embattled Chinese tech
giant.

Distrust of Huawei's products is rising all around the world.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html}{The
Trump administration}, concerned that the Chinese government might use
Huawei gear to disrupt telecommunications networks, has restricted the
company's access to American technology.

And
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html}{Britain
this month}said it would bar Huawei equipment from the country's 5G
mobile networks. Other governments have mulled similar moves.

Huawei has doubled down on the Chinese market in response, a strategy
that has paid off during the pandemic. China's economy is recovering
more quickly than others, helping Huawei sell 55.8 million handsets
between April and June, according to Canalys. Samsung sold 53.7 million
devices.

Samsung has for years been the world's largest smartphone seller. But
its major markets, including the United States, Europe and Brazil, are
deeper in the coronavirus-related economic doldrums.

``This is a remarkable result that few people would have predicted a
year ago,'' said Ben Stanton, a Canalys analyst. ``If it wasn't for
Covid-19, it wouldn't have happened.''
