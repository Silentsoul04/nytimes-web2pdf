It has been a comforting refrain in the national conversation about
reopening schools: Young children are mostly spared by the coronavirus
and don’t seem to spread it to others, at least not very often.

But on Thursday, a study introduced an unwelcome wrinkle into this
smooth narrative.

Infected children [have at least as much of the coronavirus in their
noses and
throats](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952)
as infected adults, according to the research. Indeed, children younger
than age 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the virus in the upper
respiratory tract as adults, the authors found.

That measurement does not necessarily prove children are passing the
virus to others. Still, the findings should influence the debate over
reopening schools, several experts said.

“The school situation is so complicated — there are many nuances beyond
just the scientific one,” said Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent, a pediatric
infectious diseases expert at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s
Hospital of Chicago, who led the study, published in JAMA Pediatrics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“But one takeaway from this is that we can’t assume that just because
kids aren’t getting sick, or very sick, that they don’t have the virus.”

The study is not without caveats: It was small, and did not specify the
participants’ race or sex, or whether they had underlying conditions.
The tests looked for viral RNA, genetic pieces of the coronavirus,
rather than the live virus itself. (Its genetic material is RNA, not
DNA.)

Still, experts were alarmed to learn that young children may carry
significant amounts of the coronavirus.

“I’ve heard lots of people saying, ‘Well, kids aren’t susceptible, kids
don’t get infected.’ And this clearly shows that’s not true,” said
Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital.

“I think this is an important, really important, first step in
understanding the role that kids are playing in transmission.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba, said: “Now
that we’re rolling into the end of July and looking at trying to open up
schools the next month, this really needs to be
considered.”

The standard diagnostic test amplifies the virus’s genetic material in
cycles, with the signal growing brighter each round. The more virus
present in the swab initially, the fewer cycles needed for a clear
result.

Dr. Heald-Sargent, who has a research interest in coronaviruses, began
noticing that children’s tests were coming back with low “cycle
thresholds,” or C.T.s, suggesting that their samples were teeming with
the virus.

Intrigued, she called the hospital lab on a Sunday and asked to look
back at test results for the past several weeks. “It wasn’t even
something we had set out to look for,” she said.

She and her colleagues analyzed samples collected with nasopharyngeal
swabs between March 23 and April 27 at drive-through testing sites in
Chicago and from people who came to the hospital for any reason,
including symptoms of Covid-19.

They looked at swabs taken from 145 people: 46 children younger than age
5; 51 children aged 5 to 17; and 48 adults aged 18 to 65. To forestall
criticisms that really ill children would be expected to have a lot of
the virus, the team excluded children who needed oxygen support. Most of
the children in the study reported only a fever or cough, Dr.
Heald-Sargent said.

To compare the groups fairly, the team included only children and adults
who had mild to moderate symptoms and for whom they had information
about when symptoms began. Dr. Heald-Sargent left out people who didn’t
have symptoms and who did not remember when they had started to feel
ill, as well as those who had symptoms for more than a week before the
testing.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The results confirmed Dr. Heald-Sargent’s hunch: Older children and
adults had similar C.T.s, with a median of about 11 and ranging up to
17. But children younger than age 5 had significantly lower C.T.s of
about 6.5. The upper limit of the range in these children was a C.T. of
12, however — still comparable to those of older children and adults.

“It definitely shows that kids do have levels of virus similar to and
maybe even higher than adults,” Dr. Heald-Sargent said. “It wouldn’t be
surprising if they were able to shed” the virus and spread it to others.

The results are consistent with those from a German [study of 47
infected
children](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/health/coronavirus-children-transmission-school.html)
between the ages 1 and 11, which showed that children who did not have
symptoms had viral loads as high as adults’, or higher. And a recent
study from France found that asymptomatic children had [C.T. values
similar](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1044/5876373)
to those of children with symptoms.

C.T. values are a reasonable proxy for the amount of coronavirus
present, said Dr. Kindrachuk, who relied on this metric during the Ebola
outbreaks in West
Africa.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Still, he and others said that ideally researchers would grow infectious
virus from samples, rather than test only for the virus’s RNA.

“I suspect that it probably will translate into meaning that there is
more actual virus there as well, but we can’t say that without seeing
the data,” said Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of
California, Riverside.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some RNA viruses multiply quickly and are prone to genetic errors that
render the virus incapable of infecting cells. Some RNA detected in
children may represent these “defective” viruses: “We need to understand
how much of that is actually infectious virus,” Dr. Schultz-Cherry said.

(The researchers said they did not have access to the type of
high-security lab required to grow infectious coronavirus, but other
teams [have cultivated virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32603290/)
from children’s samples.)

The experts all emphasized that the findings at least indicate that
children can be infected. Those who harbor a lot of virus may spread it
to others in their households, or to teachers and other school staff
members when schools reopen.

Many school districts are planning to protect students and staff members
by implementing physical distancing, cloth face coverings and hand
hygiene. But it’s unclear how well staff members and teachers can keep
young children from getting too close to others, Dr. Kindrachuk said.

“Frankly, I just haven’t seen a lot of discussion about how that aspect
is going to be controlled,” he said.

Observations from schools in several countries have suggested that, at
least in places with mild outbreaks and preventive measures in place,
children do not seem to spread the coronavirus to others efficiently.

Strong immune responses in children could limit both how much virus they
can spread to others and for how long. The children’s overall health,
underlying conditions such as obesity or diabetes, and sex may also
influence the ability to transmit the virus.

Some experts have suggested that children [may transmit less
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-schools-reopening-guidelines-aap.html)
because of their smaller lung capacity, height or other physical
aspects.

Dr. Morrison dismissed those suggestions. The virus is shed from the
upper respiratory tract, not the lungs, she noted.

“We are going to be reopening day care and elementary schools,” she
said. If these results hold up, “then yeah, I’d be worried.”
