An experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson
protected monkeys from infection in a new study. It is the second
vaccine candidate to show promising results in monkeys this week.

The company recently began a clinical trial in Europe and the United
States to test its vaccine in people. It is one of [more than 30 human
trials](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
for coronavirus vaccines underway across the world. But until these
trials are complete — which will probably take several months — the
monkey data offers the best clues to whether the vaccines will work.

“This week has been good — now we have two vaccines that work in
monkeys,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who
was not involved in the studies. “It’s nice to be upbeat for a change.”

But she cautioned that the new results shouldn’t be used to rush
large-scale trials in humans. “We just can’t take shortcuts,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Unlike many other vaccines in development that might require two
injections, the Johnson & Johnson candidate shielded the monkeys with
just one dose, according to a
[study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2607-z) published on
Thursday in Nature.

“It’s a very reassuring level of protection we saw,” said Dr. Dan
Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston
and a co-author of the new study.

The study comes just two days after a similar one was published on a
[vaccine tested by
Moderna](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html)and
the National Institutes of
Health.

But the two vaccines work in very different ways.

The Moderna vaccine delivers a kind of genetic material called
“messenger RNA” into cells.

The cells use the vaccine RNA to produce a protein found on the surface
of the coronavirus, called spike protein, which then hopefully prompts
an immune response.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

RNA-based vaccines are being tested for a number of diseases, but none
have yet been licensed for use in people.

In the Moderna study, researchers vaccinated monkeys by giving them two
shots spaced over four weeks. A month later, they infected the animals
with the coronavirus. In some of the vaccinated monkeys, researchers
could not detect the virus in the nose or lungs. In others, the virus
replicated slowly before disappearing.

[Moderna began Phase 3
trials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
of its mRNA vaccine on Monday, as did Pfizer, which is testing its own
mRNA vaccine.

[The Johnson & Johnson
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html),
in contrast, is based on a virus called Ad26, which researchers have
modified so that it carries the coronavirus spike protein gene. The Ad26
virus can slip into human cells, but cannot replicate once inside them.
Its host cell then uses the spike gene to make the coronavirus proteins.

This month, European regulators approved Johnson & Johnson’s Ad26
vaccine for Ebola. It was the first time this kind of virus-assisted
gene delivery was approved for any disease.

In March, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues designed seven variants of an

gene to see whether they could get cells to make more copies of the
viral protein. They also tested variants that would make the spike
protein more stable, which might prompt a stronger immune response.

to see whether that was enough to provide
immunity.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

After a single injection of the vaccine, they waited six weeks and then
infected the animals with the coronavirus. Six of the seven vaccine
variants offered monkeys partial protection against the coronavirus,
meaning that the virus replicated only at low levels in the animals.

The seventh version proved more powerful than the rest: Five out of six
monkeys that received it had no detectable viruses at all. The sixth had
only low levels in its nose.

“The fact that we could protect with a single shot in animal models was
quite a positive surprise to us,” said Dr. Paul Stoffels, the chief
scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson.

It was this best-performing vaccine that Johnson & Johnson used last
week to begin its first human safety trial, a so-called Phase 1 trial.
If it goes well, the company hopes by September to enter Phase 3 trials,
which test not only whether the vaccine is safe, but also whether it
works.

The company plans on testing both single and double doses. Dr. Rasmussen
said that a vaccine that proved effective with a single dose would make
it far easier to treat the billions of people who need it.
“Theoretically, you would need less of it, so you give it to more
people more quickly,” she said.

Inovio, a company developing a DNA-based vaccine, announced Thursday
that monkeys challenged four months after vaccination had a reduced load
of the virus in their nose and lungs. Their
[report](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.225649v1)
has not yet been published in a scientific journal.

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have developed a vaccine based
on yet [another type of modified
