<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a year of endless viral outbreaks, the details of the Diamond
Princess tragedy seem like ancient history. On Jan. 20, one infected
passenger boarded the cruise ship; a month later, more than 700 of the
3,711 passengers and crew members had tested positive, with many falling
seriously ill. The invader moved as swiftly and invisibly as the
perpetrators on Agatha Christie’s Orient Express, leaving doctors and
health officials with only fragmentary evidence to sift through.

Ever since, scientists have tried to pin down exactly how the
coronavirus spread throughout the ship. And for good reason: The Diamond
Princess’ outbreak remains perhaps the most valuable case study
available of coronavirus transmission — an experiment-in-a-bottle, rich
in data, as well as a dark warning for what was to come in much of the
world.

Now, researchers are beginning to use macroscopic tools — computer
models, which have revealed patterns in the virus’s global spread — to
clarify the much smaller-scale questions that currently dominate public
discussions of safety: How, exactly, does the virus move through a
community, a building or a small group of people? Which modes of
transmission should concern us most, and how might we stop them?

In [a new
report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153049v1),
a research team based at Harvard and the Illinois Institute of
Technology has tried to tease out the ways in which the virus passed
from person to person in the staterooms, corridors and common areas of
the Diamond Princess. It found that the virus spread most readily in
microscopic droplets that were light enough to float in the air, for
several minutes or much longer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new findings add to an escalating debate among doctors, scientists
and health officials about the primary routes of coronavirus
transmission. Earlier this month, after [pressure from more than 200
scientists,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html)
the World Health Organization acknowledged that the virus could linger
in the air indoors, potentially causing new infections. Previously, it
had emphasized only large droplets, as from coughing, and infected
surfaces as the primary drivers of transmission. Many clinicians and
epidemiologists continue to argue that these routes are central to
disease progression.

The new paper has been posted on a preprint server and submitted to a
journal; it has not yet been peer-reviewed, but it was shown by Times
reporters to nearly a dozen experts in aerosols and infectious disease.
The new findings, if confirmed, would have major implications for making
indoor spaces safer and choosing among a panoply of personal protective
gear.

For example, ventilation systems that “turn over” or replace the air in
a room or building as often as possible, preferably drawing on external
air to do so, should make indoor spaces healthier. But good ventilation
is not enough; the Diamond Princess was well ventilated and the air did
not recirculate, the researchers noted. So wearing good-quality masks —
standard surgical masks, or cloth masks with multiple layers rather than
just one — will most likely be needed as well, even in well-ventilated
spaces where people are keeping their
distance.

The computer modeling adds a new dimension of support to an accumulating
body of evidence implicating small, airborne droplets in multiple
outbreaks, including at [a Chinese
restaurant](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/health/airflow-coronavirus-restaurants.html),
a [choir in Washington
State](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132027v2),
as well as [a recent
study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69286-3) at a Nebraska
hospital to which 13 passengers from the Diamond Princess had been
evacuated.

One researcher not involved in the new work, Julian Tang, an honorary
associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of
Leicester in the United Kingdom, said the paper was “the first attempt,
as far as I know, to formally compare the different routes of
coronavirus transmission, especially of short versus long-range
aerosols.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He characterized the distances and the kinds of particles involved with
a simple analogy from everyday life: “If you can smell what I had for
lunch, you’re getting my air, and you can be getting virus particles as
well.”

Another researcher, Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental
engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne transmission of
viruses, had a more vivid description of the finding: the “garlic
breath” effect.

“As you’re close to someone, you smell that garlic breath,” Dr. Marr
said. “As you’re farther away, you don’t smell it.”

The “garlic breath” effect would suggest that powerful ventilation in
buildings — primarily using outside air, or very well filtered — could
reduce the transmission of the virus. The study found that small
particles also had some ability to spread it at longer distances,
presumably beyond the range of breath odor.

From the start of the pandemic, scientists have grappled with the
mechanisms of coronavirus spread. Early on, surface transmission was
widely emphasized; larger droplets, which travel on more ballistic
trajectories, like a stone through the air, and strike mucus membranes
directly, are now favored by a number of researchers.

Other possibilities are candidates as well, said Dr. John Conly, an
infectious disease physician and infection control expert with the
University of Calgary in Canada who has done consulting with the World
Health Organization.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re getting surprises all the way along,” Dr. Conly said. “This paper
I find interesting, but it has a long way to go to be able to get into a
line of credibility, in my mind.”

Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of
California, San Francisco, was equally skeptical. He said that, outside
of hospital settings, “large droplets in my mind account for the vast
majority of cases. Aerosols transmission — if you really run with that,
it creates lots of dissonance. Are there situations where it could
occur? Yeah maybe, but it’s a tiny amount.”

Dr. Tang and other scientists strongly disagree. “If I’m talking to an
infectious person for 15 or 20 minutes and inhaling some of their air,”
Dr. Tang said, “isn’t that a much simpler way to explain transmission
than touching an infected surface and touching your eyes? When you’re
talking about an outbreak, like at a restaurant, that latter seems like
a torturous way to explain
transmission.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

In the new analysis, a team led by Parham Azimi, an indoor-air
researcher at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied the
outbreak on the Diamond Princess, where physical spaces and infections
were well documented. It ran more than 20,000 simulations of how the
virus might have spread throughout the ship. Each simulation made a
variety of assumptions, about factors like patterns of social
interaction — how much time people spent in their cabins, on deck or in
the cafeteria, on average — and the amount of time the virus can live on
surfaces. Each also factored in varying contributions of smaller,
floating droplets, broadly defined as 10 microns or smaller; and larger
droplets, which fall more quickly and infect surfaces or other people,
by landing on their eyes, mouth or nose, say.

About 130 of those simulations reproduced, to some extent, what actually
happened on the Diamond Princess as the outbreak progressed. By
analyzing these most “realistic” scenarios, the research team calculated
the most likely contributions of each route of transmission. The
researchers concluded that the smaller droplets predominated, and
accounted for about 60 percent of new infections over all, both at close
range, within a few yards of an infectious person, and at greater
distances.

“Many people have argued that airborne transmission is happening, but no
one had numbers for it,” Dr. Azimi said. “What is the contribution from
these small droplets — is it 5 percent, or 90 percent? In this paper, we
provide the first real estimates for what that number could be, at least
in the case of this cruise ship.”

The logic behind such transmission is straightforward, experts said.
When a person is speaking, he or she emits a cloud of droplets, the vast
majority of which are small enough to remain suspended in the air for a
few minutes or longer. Through inhalation, that cloud of small droplets
is more likely to reach a mucus membrane than larger ones soaring
ballistically.

The smaller droplets are also more likely to penetrate deeply into the
respiratory system, down to the lungs. It may take a much smaller viral
load — fewer viruses — to cause infection in the lungs than higher up,
such as in the throat. This, at least, is the case for other respiratory
viruses, like the flu.

Brent Stephens, an engineering professor at the Illinois Institute of
Technology in Chicago and a co-author on the paper, said the findings
were important in shaping, for example, measures that should be taken as
college students return to campus.

The first, he said, should be “really enforcing mask policies.” Another,
he said, is to recognize that there is a “huge variability in mask
quality,” and material that actually stops small aerosols when someone
is breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing is crucial. Surgical masks
are good, he said, but single-ply fabrics often are not.

As various transmission routes come into clearer focus, they will
provide specific guidelines on how to reopen schools, offices,
restaurants and other businesses.

“The value of this model is that it allows for recommendations and
guidance to be specific to each unique environment,” said another
co-author, Joseph G. Allen, an expert in indoor air quality and an
assistant professor at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Dr. Allen said those environments ranged from restaurants to dentist
offices. In each case, he said, there are low-cost solutions that
sharply improve ventilation and filtration — most buildings fall well
short of optimal levels — and in turn reduce the risks of airborne
infection.

“To me, this is an all-in moment,” Dr. Allen said. “We need better
ventilation and better filtration, across the board, in all our
buildings.”
