# Food Tourists Trickle In to New York’s Pandemic Dining Scene

Visitors — as long as they don’t come from a quarantine state — are
enjoying the city’s rooftop bars and sidewalk restaurants.

In early July, Bruna Borelli, along with her husband and two other
couples, drove a minivan for 12 hours from Sterling Heights, Mich., to
New York City for a vacation.

Before they left, the friends watched the news carefully, making sure
that Michigan hadn’t been added to the long and growing list of states
whose residents or visitors, heading to New York City, would be asked to
quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. When the coast was clear, they hit
the road.

The stress of visiting the city during the pandemic had its benefits.
The group got rooms at
[Moxy](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycox-moxy-nyc-times-square/?scid=bb6e16b5-1692-44e9-9459-428cef21e75b&ppc=ppc&pId=ustbppc&nst=paid&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzfqa1uvu6gIVCYvICh1WVAGtEAAYASAAEgLHAfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds),
a chic hotel in Times Square with a miniature golf course, featuring
statues of animals in flirty poses, as part of its rooftop bar, for $75
a night. “That’s a really good price, yeah?” said Ms. Borelli, a
30-year-old lawyer.

The group of friends strolled down Fifth Avenue, had a picnic in Central
Park, walked over the Brooklyn Bridge, and stopped for a photograph at
the “Friends” building in the West Village. They went to a different
rooftop bar every night. For lunch one day they picked up pastrami
sandwiches from [Katz’s Delicatessen](https://katzsdelicatessen.com/)
and ate them on the sidewalk. “That was my first time trying that,” she
said. “I loved it.”

Although official tourism numbers [are
dismal](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/nyc-tourism-coronavirus.html)
(Krikor Daglian, owner of [True Tales of NYC Walking
Tours](http://www.truetalesnyc.com/), reopened his business on July 10
but has had no bookings from out-of-towners, he said), some intrepid
visitors are trickling in to enjoy the great outdoors of New York City.

Broadway and the museums might be closed, but there is a booming
sidewalk dining scene, open streets and verdant parks, exciting
architecture on almost every block, and bridges, ferries and bike share
systems that connect the boroughs in the fresh air. If you can get here
safely (or have a few weeks to quarantine before venturing out), a
breezy, somewhat affordable vacation in New York is indeed possible
these days.

For some, the city is providing a stand-in for European destinations
where Americans are currently not welcome. “We went to Rome and
Barcelona on our honeymoon, and eating outdoors and people watching was
our favorite part,” said David Zavac, a government employee from Toledo,
who plans to bring his young family here once Ohio is taken off the
quarantine list. “Now that New York City has that, it’s really
appealing.”

Ms. Borelli’s group even managed to experience some New York interiors
(wearing masks, of course). “We visited Grand Central Terminal and found
all the places that are in so many movies and television shows,” Ms.
Borelli said. They took the subway to get around, something [many locals
haven’t
even](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/nyregion/coronavirus-subways-spread-nyc.html)
started to do. “I loved it because I am from a small city in Brazil, so
I don’t have the subway there, and in Michigan we also don’t,” she said.
“It’s so cheap and easy and nice.”

But New York City during the pandemic is not a destination for the meek.
There are closures, mask requirements, shifting quarantine guidelines,
and the classic directness of New Yorkers who now, more than ever, want
their city to remain as safe as possible. But all of this can be part of
the experience.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“In Times Square we took our masks off to take a picture and someone
told us to put it back on,” Ms. Borelli said. “I thought it was nice. I
wish people would do that in Michigan.”

Helen Nunes, an au pair stationed in Stroudsburg, Pa., was less
enchanted with her visit. She drove to the city July 4 weekend to visit
a friend in Brooklyn. Friday night they went to an outdoor bar where
they drank caipirinhas and ate empanadas. Saturday they took the NYC
Ferry to Manhattan and walked around Times Square.

But Ms. Nunes, 28, never felt like she could relax. “You need to wear
masks and cover your nose, so it’s hard to walk,” she said. “I kept
thinking I would get coronavirus if I touched something. I wanted to
sanitize my hands all the time.”

Those who live in neighboring states and towns who had to cancel more
far-flung travel plans are also visiting the city, curious to see how it
has changed.

Stephanie Pirhala and John Lanning were supposed to visit family in the
Carolinas this summer, but decided not to after it was announced that
they would have to quarantine for 14 days upon their return to Sound
Beach, Long Island, where they live. So they decided to visit New York
City instead.

They started their getaway at the TWA Hotel, part of John F. Kennedy
International Airport, where Mr. Lanning, 39, a court officer, proposed
to Ms. Pirhala, 32, a bank analyst, at sunset on the roof overlooking
the Manhattan skyline on one side and planes taking off and landing on
the other. They were upgraded to the presidential suite because of the
special occasion.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days

Mr. Lanning said one of the best parts of the trip was supporting local
businesses. “The restaurant couldn’t have customers this whole time,” he
said, referring to the city’s shutdown last spring. “You don’t want to
see places close up after all the suffering.”

This is especially true when your favorite restaurants are involved.

In non-pandemic times, Charles King, a photographer and videographer
from Luray, Va., visits New York City at least 30 times a year to shoot
weddings and other events. When he’s here, he always makes a point of
visiting some of his favorite places, including Shake Shack. Since
March, however, Mr. King’s New York gigs have dried up. So in June, when
he was asked to livestream a virtual graduation on Long Island and
passed through La Guardia Airport, he made a beeline for the Shake Shack
there.

“I ordered the Smoke Shack, the one with bacon on it,” he said. “It was
my first Shake Shack in months. I had a moment during the pandemic when
all I wanted were those crinkle fries.”

When Elle Andrews Patt drove 12 hours from Knoxville, Tenn., to help
move her daughter out of her Brooklyn apartment, she kept a low profile,
sleeping in her daughter’s apartment and leaving almost as soon as she’d
arrived. “This was a very different trip,” she said. “We didn’t want to
expose anyone or get exposed by them.”

But the mother and daughter did manage to pick up slices from [Tony’s
Pizza](https://originaltonysofbushwick.com/) and bagels from
[Knickerbocker Bagel](http://www.kbbagel.com/), both in Bushwick. “They
were open and friendly and recognized us,” Ms. Andrews said. “I am glad
they are still there.”

Then there are those who were planning to visit New York, but who have
stayed away because of their new turista non grata status.

Jamie Miller of Miami Beach planned to celebrate her anniversary here
this summer. The 34-year-old attorney and her husband had booked a suite
for two nights at [The
Mark](https://www.themarkhotel.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrKP4jvDu6gIVFaSzCh3SdAsCEAAYASAAEgJM-vD_BwE),
a boutique luxury hotel on the Upper East Side. They were looking
forward to dining at scenic open-air restaurants like [Gitano Garden of
Love](https://grupogitano.com/) in SoHo or [Bryant Park
Grill](https://bryantparkgrillnyc.com/) in Midtown.

But then, coronavirus cases in Florida skyrocketed and the state was put
on the quarantine list. The couple canceled the trip. “It’s so sad,” Ms.
Miller said. “It’s hot, and Covid is everywhere.”
