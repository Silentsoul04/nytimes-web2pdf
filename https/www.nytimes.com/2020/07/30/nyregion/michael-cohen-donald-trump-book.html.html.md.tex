Book}\label{us-backs-down-allowing-michael-cohen-to-write-trump-tell-all-book}}

Mr. Cohen, the president's former lawyer, had been returned to prison in
a dispute over the book, then released after a judge intervened.

Michael D. Cohen now will be allowed to finish his tell-all book about
President Trump after the government said on Thursday that it had given
up a legal battle to prevent him from expressing himself on television,
on social media or in books while he serves a prison sentence at home.

The government, writing to a federal judge in Manhattan, said it would
not challenge a ruling last week that cleared the way for Mr. Cohen, who
once was Mr. Trump's lawyer and fixer, to publish a memoir about his
former boss before the election.

The government said it had agreed to omit a condition in Mr. Cohen's
home-confinement agreement that would have banned him from any contact
with the media, including making posts on social media, appearing on
television or publishing a book.

Federal prosecutors wrote to the judge that the government had agreed
with Mr. Cohen's lawyers that ``a specific provision'' regarding Mr.
Cohen's ``contact with the media is not necessary.'' They also said they
would not further litigate or appeal the judge's ruling.

Mr. Cohen was let of out of prison in May because of the coronavirus and
was expected to serve the rest of his three-year sentence at home, but
officials sent him back to custody after he balked at signing the
agreement.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-book.html}{The
judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court, ruled last
Thursday that the decision to return Mr. Cohen to prison amounted to
retaliation} by the government and ordered him to be released again into
home confinement.

``I make the finding that the purpose of transferring Mr. Cohen from
furlough and home confinement to jail is retaliatory,'' Judge
Hellerstein said. ``And it's retaliatory because of his desire to
exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book and to discuss
anything about the book or anything else he wants on social media and
with others.''

Mr. Cohen has said that his book, which he had been working on in the
prison library while serving his sentence at a minimum-security prison
camp in Otisville, N.Y., will give a glimpse into his ``firsthand
experiences with Mr. Trump.''

In a lawsuit, Mr. Cohen said his book would paint Mr. Trump as a racist
and offer revealing details about ``the president's behavior behind
closed doors.''

``The narrative describes pointedly certain anti-Semitic remarks against
prominent Jewish people and virulently racist remarks against such Black
leaders as President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela,'' the lawsuit
said.

Mr. Cohen's lawyer, E. Danya Perry, declined to comment on Thursday; the
Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
James Margolin, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan,
said, ``We will let the office's filing speak for itself.''

Mr. Cohen, who once bragged that he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump,

guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes}.

When he entered his plea, Mr. Cohen implicated the president, telling
the court that Mr. Trump had directed him during the 2016 election to
arrange hush-money payments to two women who claimed they had had
affairs with Mr. Trump. The president has denied those allegations.
