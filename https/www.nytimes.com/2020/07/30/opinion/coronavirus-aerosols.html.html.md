Finally. The World Health Organization has now formally recognized that
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, [is
airborne](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/health/virus-aerosols-who.html)
and that it can be carried [by tiny
aerosols](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02058-1).

As we cough and sneeze, talk or just breathe, we [naturally
release](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850211001200)
droplets (small particles of fluid) and aerosols (smaller particles of
fluid) into the air. Yet until earlier this month, the W.H.O. — like the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Public Health England
— [had warned
mostly](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations)
about the transmission of the new coronavirus through direct contact and
droplets released at close range.

The organization had cautioned against aerosols only in rare
circumstances, such as after intubation and other [medical
procedures](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-2020.4)
involving infected patients in hospitals.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After [several months of pressure from
scientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00974-w#ref-CR5),
on July 9, the W.H.O. changed its position — going from denial to
[grudging partial
acceptance](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions):
“Further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to
detect viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples from settings where no
procedures that generate aerosols are performed and what role aerosols
might play in transmission.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I am a civil and environmental engineer who studies how viruses and
bacteria spread through the air — as well as [one of the 239
scientists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html)
who signed [an open
letter](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798)
in late June pressing the W.H.O. to consider the risk of airborne
transmission more seriously.

A month later, I believe that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via
aerosols matters much more than has been officially acknowledged to
date.

In [a peer-reviewed
study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69286-3) published in
Nature on Wednesday, researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center found that aerosols collected in the hospital rooms of Covid-19
patients contained the coronavirus.

This confirms the results of [a
study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20115154v1)
from late May (not peer-reviewed) in which Covid-19 patients were found
to release SARS-CoV-2 simply by exhaling — without coughing or even
talking. The authors of that study said the finding implied that
airborne transmission “plays a major role” in spreading the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Accepting these conclusions wouldn’t much change what is currently being
recommended as best behavior. The strongest protection against
SARS-CoV-2, whether the virus is mostly contained in droplets or in
aerosols, essentially remains the same: Keep your distance and wear
masks.

Rather, the recent findings are an important reminder to also be
vigilant about opening windows and improving airflow indoors. And they
are further evidence that the quality of masks and their fit matter,
too.

The W.H.O. defines as a “droplet” [a particle larger than 5
microns](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations)
and has said that droplets don’t travel farther than one meter.

In fact, there is no neat and no meaningful cutoff point — at 5 microns
or any other size — between droplets and aerosols: All are tiny specks
of liquid, their size ranging along a spectrum that goes from very small
to really microscopic.

(I am working with medical historians to track down the scientific basis
for the W.H.O.’s definition, and we have not found a sensible
explanation yet.)

Yes, droplets tend to fly through the air like mini cannonballs and they
fall to the ground rather quickly, while aerosols can float around for
many hours.

But basic physics also says that a 5-micron droplet takes about a
half-hour to drop to the floor from the mouth of an adult of average
height — and during that time, the droplet can travel many meters on an
air current. Droplets expelled in coughs or sneezes also [travel much
farther than one
meter](https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa189/5820886).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Here is another common misconception: To the (limited) extent that the
role of aerosols had been recognized so far, they were usually mentioned
as lingering in the air, suspended, and wafting away — a long-distance
threat.

But before aerosols can get far, they must travel through the air that’s
near: meaning that they are a hazard at close range, too. And all the
more so because, just like the smoke from a cigarette, aerosols are most
concentrated near the infected person (or smoker) and become diluted in
the air as they drift away.

[A peer-reviewed
study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132320302183?via%3Dihub)
by scientists at the University of Hong Kong and Zhejiang University, in
Hangzhou, China, published in the journal Building and Environment in
June concluded, “The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important
the short-range airborne route.”

So what does this all mean exactly, practically?

Can you walk into an empty room and contract the virus if an infected
person, now gone, was there before you? Perhaps, but probably only if
the room is small and stuffy.

Can the virus waft up and down buildings via air ducts or pipes? Maybe,
though that hasn’t been established.

More likely, the research suggests, aerosols matter in extremely mundane
scenarios.

Consider [the case of a restaurant in
Guangzhou](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/health/airflow-coronavirus-restaurants.html),
southern China, at the beginning of the year, in which one diner
infected with SARS-CoV-2 at one table spread the virus to a total of
nine people seated at their table and two other tables.

Yuguo Li, a professor of engineering at the University of Hong Kong, and
colleagues [analyzed video
footage](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067728v1)
from the restaurant and in a preprint (not peer reviewed) published in
April found no evidence of close contact between the diners.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Droplets can’t account for transmission in this case, at least not among
the people at the tables other than the infected person’s: The droplets
would have fallen to the floor before reaching those tables.

But the three tables were in a poorly ventilated section of the
restaurant, and an air conditioning unit pushed air across them.
Notably, too, no staff member and none of the other diners in the
restaurant — including at two tables just beyond the air conditioner’s
airstream — became infected.

Similarly, just one person is thought to have infected 52 of the other
60 people at [a choir
rehearsal](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/health/coronavirus-choir.html)
in Skagit County, Wash., in March.

Several colleagues at various universities and I analyzed that event and
in [a preprint (not peer-reviewed) published last
month](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132027v2)
concluded that aerosols likely were the dominant means of transmission.

Attendees had used hand sanitizer and avoided hugs and handshakes,
limiting the potential for infection through direct contact or droplets.
On the other hand, the room was poorly ventilated, the rehearsal lasted
a long time (2.5 hours) and singing is known to produce aerosols and
[facilitate the spread of diseases like
tuberculosis](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/arrd.1968.98.2.297).

What about the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan
early this year? Some 712 of the 3,711 people on board became infected.

Professor Li and others also [investigated that
case](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059113v1) and
in a preprint (not peer reviewed) in April concluded that transmission
had not occurred between rooms after people were quarantined: The ship’s
air-conditioning system did not spread the virus over long distances.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The more likely cause of transmission, according to that study, appeared
to be close contact with infected people or contaminated objects before
the passengers and crew members were isolated. (The researchers did not
parse precisely what they meant by contact, or if that included droplets
or short-range aerosols.)

But [another, recent,
preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153049v1)
(not peer reviewed) about the Diamond Princess concluded that “aerosol
inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to Covid-19 transmission”
among the ship’s passengers.

It might seem logical, or make intuitive sense, that larger droplets
would contain more virus than do smaller aerosols — but they don’t.

[A paper published this
week](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600\(20\)30323-4/fulltext)
by The Lancet Respiratory Medicine that analyzed the aerosols produced
by the coughs and exhaled breaths of patients with various respiratory
infections found “a predominance of pathogens in small particles” (under
5 microns). “There is no evidence,” the study also concluded, “that some
pathogens are carried only in large droplets.”

A [recent
preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20041632v2)
(not peer reviewed) by researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center found that viral samples retrieved from aerosols emitted by
Covid-19 patients were infectious.

Some scientists [have
argued](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396) that
just because aerosols can contain SARS-CoV-2 does not in itself prove
that they can cause an infection and that if SARS-CoV-2 were primarily
spread by aerosols, there would be more evidence of long-range
transmission.

I agree that long-range transmission by aerosols probably is not
significant, but I believe that, taken together, much of the evidence
gathered to date suggests that *close-range* transmission by aerosols is
significant — possibly very significant, and certainly more significant
than direct droplet spray.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The practical implications are plain:

  - **Social distancing really is important**. It keeps us out of the
    most concentrated parts of other people’s respiratory plumes. So
    stay away from one another by one or two meters at least — though
    farther is safer.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Wear a mask.** Masks help block aerosols released by the wearer.
    [Scientific
    evidence](https://ucsf.app.box.com/s/blvolkp5z0mydzd82rjks4wyleagt036)
    is also building that [masks protect the wearer from breathing in
    aerosols](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html?campaign_id=154&emc=edit_cb_20200727&instance_id=20696&nl=coronavirus-briefing&regi_id=65413713&segment_id=34503&te=1&user_id=bd32fbf008e5183a7928ed61c60669f7)
    around them.

When it comes to masks, size *does* matter.

The gold standard is a N95 or a KN95 respirator, which, if properly
fitted, filters out and prevents the wearer from breathing in at least
95 percent of small aerosols.

The efficacy of surgical masks against aerosols varies widely.

[One study from 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23498357/) found
that surgical masks reduced exposure to flu viruses by between 10
percent and 98 percent (depending on the mask’s design).

A recent paper found that surgical masks can completely block seasonal
coronaviruses [from getting into the
air](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2).

To my knowledge, no similar study has been conducted for SARS-CoV-2 yet,
but these findings might apply to this virus as well since it is similar
to seasonal coronaviruses in size and structure.

My lab has been testing cloth masks on a mannequin, sucking in air
through its mouth at a realistic rate. We found that even a bandanna
loosely tied over its mouth and nose blocked half or more of aerosols
larger than 2 microns from entering the mannequin.

We also found that especially with very small aerosols — smaller than 1
micron — it is more effective to use a softer fabric (which is easier to
fit tightly over the face) than a stiffer fabric (which, even if it is a
better filter, tends to sit more awkwardly, creating gaps).

  - **Avoid crowds.** The more people around you, the more likely
    someone among them will be infected. Especially avoid crowds
    indoors, where aerosols can accumulate.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Ventilation counts.** Open windows and doors. Adjust dampers in
    air-conditioning and heating systems. Upgrade the filters in those
    systems. Add portable air cleaners, or install germicidal
    ultraviolet technologies to remove or kill virus particles in the
    air.

It’s not clear just how much this coronavirus is transmitted by aerosols
as opposed to droplets or via contact with contaminated surfaces. Then
again, we still don’t know the answer to that question [even for the
flu](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008704),
which has been studied for decades.

But by now we do know this much: Aerosols matter in the transmission of
Covid-19 — and probably even more so than we have yet been able to
prove.
