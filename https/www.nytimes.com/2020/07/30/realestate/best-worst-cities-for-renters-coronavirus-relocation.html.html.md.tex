A guide for renters on the move, whether fleeing the pandemic,
considering a professional change or just looking for a change.

Like coronavirus, relocation is in the air. The pandemic has sent many
Americans packing, often
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/realestate/buying-selling-moving-during-coronavirus.html}{moving}
from highly infected areas to places with lower infection rates or with
more
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/realestate/forget-the-suburbs-its-country-or-bust.html}{green}
space. Others have been forced to move in with friends or
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/realestate/more-adults-than-ever-live-with-parents-or-grandparents.html}{family}
because of job losses.

As more companies discover that having employees work from home is
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/upshot/is-the-five-day-office-week-over.html}{feasible},
and as some who have already moved begin to see the benefits of their
new locales, more permanent relocation could follow.

For now, a recent study by
\href{https://wallethub.com/edu/best-cities-for-renters/23010/}{Wallethub}
considered the options for renters in this period of ``pandemic
pricing,'' with lower rents attracting new customers in a volatile
market. The study weighed the pros and cons of hundreds of rental
markets across the country, including the 150 largest U.S. cities along
with other highly populated areas for a total of more than 180 rental
markets covering every state.

The rankings (the source for this week's chart) were determined by
rating each market in two categories: quality of life and attractiveness
of the rental market. Within each, 24 separate factors were considered
and individually weighed.

Quality-of-life rankings took into account, among other factors, the
local job market, school systems, weather, recreation friendliness,
crime and the availability of coronavirus support. Attractiveness of
rental market included the area's share of renters, vacancy rates,
median square footage, median rents and incomes, laws protecting
renters, and the cost of living.

Although the study didn't examine coronavirus infection rates, current
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{data}
show that among its top 10 rated cities --- most in less densely
populated states like the Dakotas and Maine --- the infection rate is
about 15 per 100,000 residents, while in the bottom 10, largely in
coronavirus hot-spot Southern states, the average is about 44 cases per
100,000.

A general takeaway, for now and possibly for the long term: Head out to
where there are fewer people.
