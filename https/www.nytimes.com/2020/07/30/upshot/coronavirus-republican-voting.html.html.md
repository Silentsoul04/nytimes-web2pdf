With the coronavirus spreading into red America, policymakers there have
been forced to change course.

Some reopening plans have been scuttled; Republican leaders in
Washington have [broken
ranks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/politics/republicans-contradict-trump-coronavirus.html)with
President Trump on response policy; and the president himself eventually
declared that Americans should wear protective masks.

At the grass-roots level, however, it’s not clear if the partisan
differences in how people view the pandemic have changed much at all.

There is some evidence of a narrowing on some fronts, but other survey
data suggests that Americans disagree about the severity of the crisis
as much today as they did two months ago, when people in Democratic
counties were taking the [brunt of the
damage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/us/politics/coronavirus-red-blue-states.html).

The New York Times recently published a detailed
[map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html)
on geographic variations in the use of face coverings, and here also
there is a partisan difference. People who identify as Democrats more
consistently report they use face coverings, regardless of whether they
live in a county with a high case rate, while for Republicans,
self-reported mask use goes up where the crisis is
worse.

If the presence of the virus is driving these changes, the infection
data shows why.

Through late May, counties that supported President Trump in 2016
accounted for just 26 percent of reported cases and 21 percent of
deaths, despite making up 45 percent of the nation’s population.

Over the past two months, however, Republican-leaning counties have
accounted for 43 percent of new cases and a third of deaths. Of the 100
counties that have seen the most case growth per capita over the past
two months, 71 of them backed Mr. Trump in the last
election.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Moreover, at the state level, where policy is made, the relationship
also shifted. Survey data shows Republican governors are more likely to
be [taking
criticism.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-increasingly-dislike-how-republican-governors-are-handling-the-coronavirus-outbreak/)

“New cases per capita were higher in redder states than in bluer states
in June and July, even after controlling for a wide range of
demographic, geographic and weather variables,” said Jed Kolko, an
economist and Upshot contributor. “Deaths per capita, too, were higher
in redder states than in bluer states in July.”

Still, it’s less clear how these changes affected perceptions on an
individual level.

“Perhaps people who are skeptical about mask-wearing in the abstract
might change their minds when the virus is an immediate threat,” he
said.

Matthew Gentzkow, a Stanford economist who studies partisan behavior,
led an [early
study](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/social_distancing.pdf)
based on cellphone records that showed “that areas with more Republicans
engage in less social distancing, controlling for other factors
including public policies, population density, and local Covid cases and
deaths.”

Two months later, he said, there are still differences, but not as
large.

“They’re strongly significant in a statistical sense but modest in
magnitude,” he said. “People do appear to be behaving differently by
party, but it’s not as dramatic as all Republicans are going to the
beach and having parties while Democrats stay home.”

It’s still not hard to

pandemic [naysayers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhx_XBUTOI0) in
conservative-leaning media. And several surveys show that on broader
questions, a large difference remains. Even as the virus spreads,
Republicans and Democrats differ in their concerns about the health
impacts.

Polling data from Civiqs shows Democrats are nearly three times as
likely to be concerned about a virus outbreak in their area. Republican
response to this question budged only slightly even as virus outbreaks
actually multiplied in Republican counties in June and
July.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

A recent[Pew
survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/22/republicans-remain-far-less-likely-than-democrats-to-view-covid-19-as-a-major-threat-to-public-health/)
found that Republicans and Democrats agreed on one aspect of the
pandemic — that it has a severe impact on the economy. But when asked
whether the virus posed a major threat to their personal health, or the
health of their community, Democrats were twice as likely to say yes.

The authors concluded that the partisan divide over all was about the
same as it was in May, before cases and deaths surged into red counties.

The extent to which firsthand experience drives these ideological
differences among Americans, and how much the differences in behavior
contribute to the virus’s spread, is hard to disentangle with much
precision.

But it’s more clear that shifts at the policy level have not come out of
nowhere. They’ve aligned with the changing geography of the pandemic.
