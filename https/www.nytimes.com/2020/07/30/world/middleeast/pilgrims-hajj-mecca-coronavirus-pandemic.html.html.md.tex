Annual
Hajj}\label{pilgrims-fewer-and-socially-distanced-arrive-in-mecca-for-annual-hajj}}

The coronavirus pandemic has curtailed the annual pilgrimage to the holy
city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, limiting the number of people and barring
people from outside the kingdom.

BEIRUT, Lebanon --- In any other year, Muslims undertaking the hajj, the
annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca that all Muslims are
supposed to perform at least once, would drink from a holy well. They
would kiss the sacred
\href{https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Stone-of-Mecca}{black
stone} embedded in the Kaaba, the holiest shrine in Islam, as they
thronged the Grand Mosque. Before they left Mecca, they would collect
pebbles to ritually stone the devil, casting them at a series of
symbolic pillars.

During the coronavirus edition of the hajj that began Wednesday,
however, the black stone is off limits to kissing and touching. The
authorities in Saudi Arabia are issuing personal prayer rugs and bottled
water from the
\href{https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2018/08/16/Hajj-pilgrims-consume-8-mln-liters-of-Zamzam-water}{holy
Zamzam well} instead of letting pilgrims drink from cups at the mosque.
Even the pebbles pilgrims
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-haj/muslim-pilgrims-converge-on-jamarat-for-ritual-stoning-of-the-devil-idUSKCN1V109D}{hurl
at the devil} have been sterilized, all in an effort to prevent a
coronavirus outbreak from marring a pilgrimage which tradition holds
stretches back thousands of years.

But the chief public health measure the Saudi government has taken to
protect the hajj is to limit attendance, shrinking one of the world's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/23/world/middleeast/hajj-attendance-expansion.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{most
famous crowds} to a select, socially distanced few.

Last year, some 2.5 million Muslims from around the world performed the
hajj. This year, Saudi Arabia
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/middleeast/hajj-pilgrimage-canceled.html}{said
it would allow} just 1,000, all from within the kingdom, though some
news reports suggested the final number could be higher.

Adnan Hassan, 31, a Moroccan maintenance technician who lives in Saudi
Arabia, was among those whose application to go to Mecca had been
granted.

``I felt like I was the luckiest person in the history of people,'' he
said. Despite his joy, Mr. Hassan said he hesitated over fears that he
might get infected with the coronavirus.

But he and several other pilgrims said the government-mandated
precautions had reassured them and that, so far, they felt safe. ``My
confidence in God is great,'' Mr. Hassan said. ``I am going to the house
of God.''

As the custodian of Mecca and Islam's second-holiest city, nearby
Medina, Saudi Arabia both enjoys the prestige of hosting millions of
Muslim faithful each year and bears the responsibility of keeping them
safe.

Crowds have led to tragedy in the past --- hundreds, sometimes thousands
of pilgrims have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/06/world/middleeast/2015-hajj-stampede.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{died
in stampedes} over the past century --- but rarely have they posed such
a danger as during the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the kingdom to
restrict the hajj to its smallest size in modern history.

Since Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 the hajj has never been canceled.
But plagues, war and political disputes have
\href{https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/pandemic-isnt-first-time-hajj-has-been-disrupted-muslims-180974735/}{led
to restrictions} in the past.

Attendees this year are required to self-isolate before and after the
pilgrimage and to maintain social distancing while performing it. Videos
and photos from Mecca this week showed pilgrims placed in neatly spaced
concentric circles around the black-clad Kaaba, which authorities said
had been sterilized and perfumed by 3,500 workers.

The pilgrims wore white garments and masks, carried personal prayer rugs
and shaded themselves with colorful branded umbrellas, all provided by
the hajj authorities in advance.

Foreign residents of Saudi Arabia are expected to make up 70 percent of
this year's pilgrims, the kingdom announced this week, with the rest
drawn from Saudi health care workers and security personnel who had
recovered from Covid-19 --- a gesture of appreciation for their service,
officials said. The government did not say how the pilgrims were chosen,
though it previously said it would give priority to healthy residents
between 20 and 50 years old who had tested negative for the virus and
had never performed the hajj before.

The hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is required for all Muslims
who are physically and financially able to go at least once in their
lifetimes. Because of constraints on how many can participate, millions
of Muslims around the world wait and save up for decades before they can
perform the hajj, making this year's effective cancellation especially
devastating for those who were scheduled to attend.

The restrictions have also caused economic injury, wiping out the huge
sums hajj pilgrims spend each year on travel agency packages, hotels and
meals in Mecca and Medina and visa fees charged by Saudi Arabia.
