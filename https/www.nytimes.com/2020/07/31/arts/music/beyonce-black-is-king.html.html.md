When Beyoncé took a speaking role as Nala — the eventual queen — in the
2019 remake of [“The Lion
King,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/the-lion-king-review.html)
she decided to delve beyond Disney’s Hollywood version of Africa. She
added a new, gospel-charged song,
[“Spirit,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/arts/music/playlist-beyonce-billie-eilish-justin-bieber-ed-sheeran.html)
to the film’s soundtrack, and gathered an international coalition,
featuring up-and-coming African songwriters and producers, to join her
on a full-length album, [“The Lion King: The
Gift.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/arts/music/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-review.html)
Now she has turned songs from the album into a film of her own, working
with various directors as she did on her visual albums
[“Beyoncé”](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/arts/music/beyonces-new-album-is-steamy-and-sleek.html)
and
[“Lemonade.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/arts/music/beyonce-lemonade.html)

## Wesley Morris, critic at large

Let’s take a moment, shall we, to appreciate that beauty will make you
tolerate anything, including waking up at the crack of dawn to behold
it. Very little compares to the rising sun. Often not much tops Beyoncé
and the extremes sometimes required to experience her (canceling an
evening, dropping everything, getting filthy at Coachella). “Black Is
King” is rather humane. You simply drag yourself from bed, head to
Disney+, and the beauty begins.

Well past the halfway point, Beyoncé is just facing Kelly Rowland,
serenading her, *beaming* at her. The sincerity is so intense, Rowland
has to avert her eyes. She’s girlishly overcome. The sunrise is too
much. Not for me. Most of this film ripples with that kind of love — of
people, of bodies, of the elements, of self, of stuff. (Someone involved
really loved the death car from the great “[Holy
Motors](https://sgtr.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/holy-motors2.png)”; a
tricked-out homage rides here, too.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

My usual qualm with the Beyoncé visual experience applies to this one:
The people who’ve edited it don’t allow us to savor a single shot for
longer than a few seconds. It adheres to ancient music-video ideas of
chaos, incoherence and looks. Steadiness was part of the thrill of her
[at
Coachella](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/arts/music/beyonce-coachella-review.html).
The stagecraft transfixed the cameras; the editing deferred to motion.
What if the songs here were wedded to full-blown set pieces, in addition
to kaleidoscopic exuberance? That, I suppose, would make the project a
musical. And that’s not what this wants to be. But I’m greedy. When I
see a handful of dancers and Beyoncé awash in so much whiteness that all
the other color comes from skin and flowers, I just want five minutes of
that.

Tableaux do exist here, minced as they are. (That brown-on-white passage
is from “Nile.”) The strongest come during “My Power,” and “Mood 4 Eva.”
The latter finds itself on somebody’s estate and features the
Knowles-Carters a-floss and a-flex. There’s a real Baz Luhrmann zaniness
working here, from the synchronized, [Esther Williams pool
party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsp-LE_agns) (everybody
side-dives in except our star) to the manic instant grins that Beyoncé,
the movie’s wee boy-prince and her mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, flash.
You could sense that those were good afternoons for everybody. It hits
the spot.

“Beyoncé” and “Lemonade” were triple-impact shocks (new music, new
images, new ideas). “Black Is King” extends more than innovates. It’s
playing. Beauty is a reason this film exists. The interstitial language
that Beyoncé recites hails, just as it did in “Lemonade,” in part, from
the earthen [poetry of Warsan
Shire](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/warsan-shire). “We were
beauty before they knew what beauty was” and “your skin is not only
dark” are two of the recital’s most exhilarating lines. They offer the
beauty of correction. They approach another of the film’s strengths:
rebuke — of, in its title and closing sequence, the gospel opportunism
in Kanye West’s film [“Jesus Is
King.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/arts/music/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review.html)

</div>

</div>

And, perhaps, of “The Lion King.” What else is this but a restoration of
flesh and blood to cartoon landscapes? There are references to [Julie
Dash](https://www.criterionchannel.com/daughters-of-the-dust) and [David
Hammons](https://www.google.com/search?q=African+American+Flag+david+hammons&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk03IfUCPOgFtGYIYz_4RbNgFsPggpw:1596203835640&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX2PLU0vfqAhVsRN8KHVcvAb4Q_AUoAnoECBgQBA&biw=1694&bih=957#imgrc=xTZg8oh2K3EHwM)

Akech](https://www.instagram.com/adutakech/?hl=en) and the dancehall
star [Shatta Wale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatta_Wale): a
motherland connection. Many a notable Black American has managed
amazement in Africa: Malcolm X, James Brown and Muhammad Ali, Nina
Simone, her ashes. Beyoncé’s trip feels like a search for confirmation:
a living myth roving terrain where myths were made.

## Jon Pareles, chief pop critic

“The Lion King: The Gift,” Beyoncé’s companion album to the “Lion King”
soundtrack, was a [grand statement of African-diaspora
unity](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/arts/music/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-review.html),
pride and creative power. It presented modern African voices and
contemporary African sounds — among the most kinetic productions in pop
— not as exotic guests of their American collaborators, but as equals
reinforcing each other, an international brotherhood and sisterhood.

“Black Is King,” Beyoncé’s visual album built on that album’s songs,
goes even further. The deluxe version of “The Lion King: The Gift” only
slightly extends the original album; its major addition is two versions
(one with marching band-style horns) of [“Black
Parade,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/arts/music/playlist-beyonce-prince.html)
a song that addresses current Black Lives Matter protests and much more.
The deluxe version also, mercifully, eliminates the original album’s
snippets of “Lion King” dialogue.

There’s still some “Lion King” material in the “Black Is King” visual
album to detail some of its messages, along with bits of lectures that
equate kingship with responsible manhood. Beyoncé also recites Warsan
Shire’s poetry to insist on Africa’s ancestral legacies and the glories
of Black beauty. Other transitions use African traditional music from
Smithsonian Folkways recordings, tacitly suggesting the continuity of
old and new. And now and then, there are glimpses within the music, like
a magnificent, purple-suited choir joining Beyoncé to sing “Spirit” a
cappella.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Beyoncé is unquestionably the star of “Black Is King.” She’s presented
as a panoply of archetypes — mother, boss, clubgoer, biker, queen — with
an apparently infinite wardrobe that draws on ancient African
iconography alongside extravagant haute couture. She places herself in
glorious open landscapes, a mansion, a gritty warehouse and a
leopard-patterned Rolls-Royce.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But she shares the screen with African and Black American faces:
dancers, tribal elders, city hustlers, judges in wigs and robes,
hoop-skirted debutantes and their beaus. And she willingly lets herself
be upstaged by African collaborators whose faces her American fans may
not yet have seen, like Busiswa from South Africa, Salatiel from
Cameroon and Yemi Alade and<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Mr
Eazi from Nigeria. It puts her pan-African solidarity incontrovertibly
onscreen.

## Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic

To describe the amount of fashion on display in “Black Is King” as an
“extravaganza” or a “feast” or any of the other words used generally
to convey exciting haute-runway content doesn’t even begin to come close
to the reality of the production. “Overwhelming” might be more like it.
Beyoncé contains multitudes when it comes to artistic collaboration, and
when it comes to designers, too. They span the famous and the
little-known, as well as the globe.

An incomplete list of brands represented, for example, would include
Valentino couture (cheetah-print bodysuit); Erdem (rose-festooned giant
flounce tea dress); Burberry (cowhide cow print); Thierry Mugler
(rainbow printed jersey draped minidress); Molly Goddard (explosive
fuchsia tulle confection); and Marine Serre (moon-print bodysuit). Also
newish names such as the London-based [Michaela
Stark](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDTR8fsA1Y_/) (denim corset and
puddling jeans), the Ivory Coast-based Loza Maléombho (graphic print
gold-buttoned jacket) and the Tel Aviv-based Alon Livné (white crocheted
gown). Also — well. You get the idea.

There’s not even one look per song; more like dozens. Especially when
you include the dancers and special guests like Naomi Campbell and Adut
Akech. I started taking notes and then gave up and just abandoned myself
to the visual excess.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s dazzling, but also carefully calculated. Because what so much
muchness means is that no single designer ever reaches critical mass;
blink and you miss them as one more lavish creation strobes into the
next. All of them exist to serve the vision of one woman; to elevate the
imagery of Beyoncé, rather than their own.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a result you are left with fleeting impressions rather than the
remembrance of any specific garment past: the tropes of majesty, Africa,
the natural world, the power shoulder, and the goddess, stretching from
the Nile to Versailles to Vegas.

They tap into our aesthetic memory archive via jewel tones, billowing
robes, drapes of diamanté and pearls. Via taffeta, silk and tulle;
fringe and cleavage and animal print. Via piles of accessories:
rhinestone sunglasses and gleaming, wearable circles of life.

Sorry, bangles and hoop
earrings.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s a highly effective strategy in a world where artists tend to link
up with a single brand to define and redefine their public styles
(Ariana Grande and Versace; [Elton John and
Gucci)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/style/elton-john-farewell-tour-wardrobe-gucci.html),
and one Beyoncé has been [honing over the last
decade](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/fashion/fashion-beyonce-lemonade.html).
She spreads her beneficence and beauty around, which has the effect of
both reinforcing her position as the ultimate cultural tastemaker and
rendering her subjects abjectly grateful for her patronage.

It also serves to concentrate all the power in her own hands, making the
garments into tools to reinforce her message. Or part of it, anyway.

What the clothes in “Black Is King” do not do, though, unlike the rest
of the film, is reimagine or reclaim the narrative of fashion as written
by Black designers; many of the brands involved are run by white
creatives. Perhaps it’s because the movie was made before George Floyd’s
death transformed the summer, but in her [Instagram
statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCAMxfrHjAL/) on the work,
Beyoncé has directly connected the film to the moment. Which makes the
fashion credits, fabulous as they are, seem like the rare oversight on
her part and that of her stylist and costume designer, Zerina Akers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Perhaps that’s unfair; she does, after all, amalgamate them into a world
of her own making. But while Black may be king, this project and all its
trappings position its auteur, as the voice-over says in the film, as
the “divine archetype.” In that context, she raised the stakes herself.

## Salamishah Tillet, contributing critic

A little over an hour into “Black Is King,” Beyoncé, with tears in her
eyes, places a baby boy, wrapped in a blanket, up a river inside a reed
basket. Unlike the mélange of sounds — Afropop, dancehall, hip-hop, and
soul — that I’d heard up to this point, the accompanying ballad,
“Otherside” was such a sonic break from the high-tempo energy that I
paused the stream several times. I was moved by this scene of maternal
sacrifice, for even though I knew the plot of “The Lion King,” I found
myself hoping that this baby would survive the currents of the rushing
river.

This is because that baby was never just a baby, and this story was
never really simply the human version of Simba’s journey into manhood,
much less kingship. On the surface, this river bed scene is an update of
that Old Testament story in which Jochebed, the mother of Moses, placed
him in the Nile River to protect him from being killed. But, the waters
here also invoke the Middle Passage, with each ripple break recalling
the fateful journey in which New World slavery, and America itself, was
born.

Moses has always loomed large among African-Americans seeking freedom.
It is why Harriet Tubman sang the spiritual “Go Down, Moses” as a code
to identify herself to those enslaved people who wanted to go with her
to the Promised Land. And while “Black Is King” shares those
19th-century aspirations of equality and Black dignity, it, in our age
of Black Lives Matter, knows it has to resort to mythmaking since racial
justice remains as firm as the shifting sands that backdrop so much of
this visual
album.

A few years before he sailed from Brooklyn for West Africa in 1923, the
young African-American writer Langston Hughes penned “The Negro Speaks
of Rivers,” an 11-line poem that traverses the Euphrates, the Nile and
the Mississippi River, and ends up in New Orleans. And Beyoncé would one
day feature that city in “Lemonade,” her film from 2016.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Much will be debated about whether “Black Is King” is an
African-American fantasy of Africa, or a homage to those contemporary
artists from Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Cameroon and Mali with whom
she collaborated, or whether the “other side” is the New World or a
prodigal return of the descendants of the enslaved to the Old World. I
saw her rivers, like Hughes’s, as somewhere in between. Ancient. Dusky.
But also decidedly modern, and fuchsia, teal and gold. An in-between
space that is the hyphen, and the Diaspora, one that Black people have
had to continually create as resistance, and community. As Beyoncé says
in one scene, “This is how we journey — far — and can still find
something like home.”

## Jason Farago, art critic

It’s been a long road for me and Beyoncé: We’re now 20 years from the
day I leeched “Bills, Bills, Bills” from Napster. But this new film is
the kitschiest thing she’s done in a while, and in “Black Is King” her
evident passion for African art keeps getting drowned in an ocean of
melodrama.

Ms. Knowles-Carter, and even more her husband, often showcase
contemporary art in their videos as markers of their cultural and
economic clout, and in the sequence devoted to “Mood 4 Eva,” a
Jay-and-Bey duet with samples from the great Malian diva Oumou Sangaré,
the walls of a hacienda are hung with a large portrait of Black models
by the American artist Derrick Adams, and another in the manner of the
British painter Lynette Yiadom-Boakye. I caught multiple direct
quotations of the French fashion photographer Jean-Paul Goude — most
overtly his cover art for [Grace Jones’s “Island
Life,”](https://www.discogs.com/Grace-Jones-Island-Life/master/45107)
remade by multiple dancers here in the film’s best sequence, for the
gqom banger “My Power.”

Other sequences seem to channel (to be generous) or crib (to be less so)
the work of contemporary African artists. The Ethiopian photographer
[Aïda
Muluneh](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/aida-muluneh-the-world-is-9/588061/)
is a clear influence on several tableaux of African models posing in
bright colors with painted faces. The film’s recurrent character of a
topless, green-painted dancer seems to be borrowed from the Nigerian
artist Jelili Atiku, whose 2018 procession “[Festival of the
Earth](http://m12.manifesta.org/festino-della-terra-alaraagbo-xiii-2018/)”
brought performers slicked with green to the streets of Sicily. The
cinematography, throughout, is of a notably lower standard than the
careful lensing of her self-titled visual album and, especially,
“Lemonade.” The beachfront posing in “Bigger,” the opening number,
feels uncannily like a perfume ad.

Traditional African art, or imitations of it, gets screen time too.

raffia costume, familiar from Mende masquerades. And there’s a knowing
flash of a catalog of Yoruba masks and sculpture by Robert Farris
Thompson, the influential historian of West African art.

Late in “Black Is King” comes a maudlin apotheosis: The Simba stand-in,
sporting a leopard-print dinner jacket, arises to heaven inside
Johannesburg’s apartheid-era Ponte Tower. It’s a sequence stripped of
history, and confirms that we are nowhere near any contemporary African
city; we are in a cartoon fairyland, still rooted in source material
appropriate, per Disney, for children 6 years and older. At least, then,
there is Beyoncé’s endless string of citations, a rope ladder for those
fans of hers ready to graduate into artistic adulthood.

## Gia Kourlas, dance critic

The choreographic feat of “Black Is King” isn’t in its flashes of
dancing, exuberant as they are. Those fleeting infusions of footwork and
swirling arms leave behind rich afterimages, but what drives this lavish
visual spectacle is its rush of bodies and how the whole thing moves:
from swift changes of scenery, which are frequent yet never frenzied, to
boldly spare moments of stillness.

One seemingly quiet moment that made me gasp? An overhead shot during
“Brown Skin Girl,” in which dancers playing debutantes etch a diagonal
line across the screen. The angle gives their voluminous ball gowns the
look of tutus and turns their white gloves into wings as they slowly
arch back. Opening their arms, they are transformed into beautiful Black
swans.

Later in the number, they return, reaching their gloved hands into the
center of a circle. “Keep dancing/They can’t control you,” Beyoncé
sings. It’s simply put, yet so empowering.

In this celebration of the Black body, there is music worthy of a
thousand dances (and, judging by the credits, 11 choreographers). In
“Already” (performed by Beyoncé, Shatta Wale and Major Lazer), we see
the body on a pedestal, with sculptural moments that range from emphatic
to dreamy as women stand on wooden crates. Like Beyoncé, they wear
unitards that make it seem as if their bodies are covered in scales;
finding a hypnotic groove, they shift their weight from side to side
with elbows as bent as their
knees.

They also pause in arresting, stationary balancing poses, whether
kneeling or with a leg extended high to the side; when Beyoncé bends
backward, the others wrap around her body like a pile of tangled snakes.
In another scene, dancers from the DWP Academy in Ghana perform a
driving unison line dance with the intense, passionate [Dancegod
Lloyd](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDTRa6wByKt/) front and center. It
points to the mix of African and American that Beyoncé seems intent on
getting right.

But she also looks at her own history. In the fantastic and fantastical
“Mood 4 Eva,” she and Jay-Z stand before a painting, just like they
did in their [video for
“Apes\*\*t,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbMqWXnpXcA)set [at
the
Louvre](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/arts/design/louvre-jay-z-beyonce-video.html);
here, instead of the Mona Lisa it’s a rendering of Beyoncé in Madonna
and Child. Within the song’s scene is another clever twist: a Busby
Berkeley-inspired synchronized swimming number led by Black bodies. In
that underwater dance, they slip sideways into the water like jewels. Of
course, Beyoncé rises from the center — the most powerful body of all.

Her dancing is luminous throughout “Black Is King.” I love the contrast
of how peaceful she remains as her hands perform a dazzling dance with
one wrist flitting over the other in “Find Your Way Back” and how,
seconds later, her body follows, bowing and rippling to the sweeping
rhythm. In the majestic “My Power,” she pushes with force yet not
without freedom. She never holds back, but this time it’s different:
It’s as if she’s trying to move beyond her body, and that brings a
line from Childish Gambino’s bridge in “Mood” to life. She dances with
ancestors in her step.
