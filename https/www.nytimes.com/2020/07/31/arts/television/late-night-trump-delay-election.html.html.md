# Jimmy Fallon to Trump: ‘How Long a Delay Are We Talking About?’

</div>

Fallon wonders just how far back he wants to push the election: “Months,
like your response to Covid? Years, like your response to Putin? Or
decades, like a hug for Don Jr.?”

*Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s
highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

## Like ‘a Group Text to Bail on Happy Hour’

Trailing badly in the polls, President Trump on Thursday [floated the
idea of postponing the
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-delay-2020-election.html)
(which he can’t do), claiming on Twitter that voting by mail would cause
major problems (for which there’s no evidence).

<div class="css-nj25e3">

> With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good),
> 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It

“It’s the presidential election. It’s not the release date for ‘Bill &
Ted 3,’” Jimmy Fallon said on “The Tonight Show.” He compared Trump to
“that friend who’s been crashing at your house for a while but keeps
dropping hints he might need some more time.”
