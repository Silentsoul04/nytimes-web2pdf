Some straightforward advice for a reader who feels directionless

Welcome. We started \href{https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/at-home}{At
Home} to help readers lead a full and cultured life during the pandemic,
featuring great reads and helpful advice alongside recommendations for
things to do and watch and listen to and see.

Four months into the experiment, we see a hunger, as well, for
direction. One reader wrote recently to ask if we might suggest to her,
forcefully, that she clean her oven, her washing machine. She wanted,
she wrote, ``something along the lines of `At Home: This Week Clean
\emph{This.}'''

It's too hot for oven cleaning, though, in most parts of the country,
and not everyone has a washing machine. (If you do, just run it with no
clothes at its hottest water setting, with bleach. Easy win.)

No, this weekend, you should clean your \emph{stove}. Take the grates
off if your stove has grates, and get them soaking in warm, soapy water.
Make a paste out of baking soda and water to scrub the stovetop ---
don't use anything abrasive. Get all the gunge off everything with elbow
grease and time. Wipe down the front of the stove with all-purpose
cleaner. Clean up the grates and dry them. Put everything back together.
The gleaming result is its own satisfaction.

And here's your soundtrack:
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/arts/music/the-go-gos-documentary.html}{The
Go-Go's},
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f55KlPe81Yw\&feature=youtu.be}{We
Got the Beat}.''

More good advice for living a good life at home and near it is below.

  If you're looking for an adventure this weekend,
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/style/randonautica-app.html}{you
  may be considering Randonautica}, an app that generates coordinates
  and sends users off exploring. Before you try it, you may want to dive
  into its history, its success and its potential drawbacks. If you want
  something with a more reliable payoff, our culture reporters put
  together a list of
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html}{seven
  things to do this weekend}, including an audio tour of Green-Wood
  Cemetery in Brooklyn.

  Our
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/arts/music/playlist-billie-eilish-snakehips-a-boogie.html}{latest
  playlist} has a new track from Billie Eilish, among others. Jon
  Caramanica says of Eilish, ``For a full minute and a half, she leans
  into her crooner side, singing deep exhales with heavy flutter.'' To
  go even deeper into the music, check out our latest ``Diary of a
  Song,'' in which
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/arts/music/phoebe-bridgers-kyoto.html}{Phoebe
  Bridgers opens up} about what it was like to write a song outside of
  her comfort zone.

  And in 2020,

  is no longer an ``easy name.''} We explored the history of the name
  and how it has evolved in pop culture.

  In ``Palm Springs,'' Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti (above) have a
  memorable meet-cute. For our
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/movies/palm-springs-clip-hulu.html}{``Anatomy
  of a Scene}'' series, the film's director, Max Barbakow, narrates the
  scene and explains how it came together.
\item
  As always, our television critic Margaret Lyons has her eye on the
  clock. If you have 30 minutes this weekend, and you're feeling
  hopeful, she wants you to give
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/arts/television/muppets-disney-errol-morris-first-person.html}{``Muppets
  Now''} a try, if only for the chance that the series could improve in
  the future. In the ``already good'' category of shows, Mike Hale has
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/arts/television/in-my-skin-hulu.html}{five
  series from Britain that you can try}, including the brilliant ``In My

  Travel looks a lot different in 2020 than it has at any point in the
  recent past. That has people asking a lot of questions about

  they should and shouldn't do}. We can help you figure out if you

  Everyone wants what's best for their kids' education. But who gets to
  decide what's best for everyone?
