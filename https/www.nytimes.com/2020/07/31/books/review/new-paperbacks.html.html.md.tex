\textbf{\textbf{WE ARE THE WEATHER: Saving the Planet Begins at
Breakfast,}} \emph{by Jonathan Safran Foer. (Picador, 288 pp., \$18.)}
The central argument of this ``eye-opening'' essay collection of
``Foer's thoughts about life and crisis,'' as our reviewer, Mark
Bittman, described it, is that the very least we can do to reduce our
carbon footprint is refrain from eating animal products except in the
evening.

\textbf{\textbf{BECAUSE INTERNET: Understanding the New Rules of
Language,}} \emph{by Gretchen McCulloch. (Riverhead, 336 pp., \$17.)} A
linguist, McCulloch argues that the internet makes it easier for people
to contribute in real time to the evolution of language, which she calls
humankind's largest open-source project. As our reviewer, Clay Shirky,
put it, it's now a network: ``fluid, collectively negotiated, constantly
altered.''

\textbf{\textbf{THIS LAND IS OUR LAND: An Immigrant's Manifesto,}}
\emph{by Suketu Mehta. (Picador, 320 pp., \$18.)} Mehta makes a case for
wealthy countries taking in migrants as reparation for economic and
climate damage done to their homelands. A win-win: In the United States,
immigrants constitute 40 percent of home-buyers and help create new
jobs. ``The immigrant armada that is coming to your shores is actually a
rescue fleet.''

\textbf{\textbf{TIME SONG: Journeys in Search of a Submerged Land,}}
\emph{by Julia Blackburn. (Vintage, 320 pp., \$18.)} ``Tantalizing
objects, be they fossils or faxes \ldots{} bridge the living to the
dead,'' in our reviewer Hillary Rosner's words, as Blackburn comes to
terms with her husband's death through the poetic lens of a once
inhabited land bridge between Britain and the Continent that sank into
the ocean 8,000 years ago.

\textbf{\textbf{THE SECRETS WE KEPT,}} \emph{by Lara Prescott. (Vintage,
368 pp., \$16.95.)} The ``we'' of the title refers not only to Boris
Pasternak and his lover, Olga Ivinskaya --- on whom Lara in ``Doctor
Zhivago'' was based --- but to Prescott's ``Greek chorus, the C.I.A.'s
female typing pool,'' quipped the Times book critic Janet Maslin about
this novel that weaves together ``bombshell espionage'' with `` `Mad
Men'-era feminism and sexual bigotry.''

\textbf{\textbf{YOUR HOUSE WILL PAY,}} \emph{by Steph Cha. (Ecco, 320
pp., \$17.99.)} Written by the author of the Juniper Song detective
series and based on a real-life racial incident, this thriller about two
families --- one Korean-American, one African-American --- dealing with
the reverberations of a shooting that took place almost three decades
earlier won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.
