Good morning. Here’s the beginning of Gabrielle Hamilton’s [Eat
column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/bored-with-your-home-cooking-some-smoky-eggplant-will-fix-that.html)
in The Times this week, and I think she’s speaking for a lot of us:

*Lately I’ve been worn out by my own home cooking. It’s not the toil
that’s getting to me; it’s more that I feel fatigued by the familiarity
of it: the predictability of my own kitchen habits, the recognizability
of my own cooking voice, the monotony of what I always throw in my cart
as I zigzag the aisles at the grocery store on autopilot. Everyone I
know has had a similar malaise recently — all of us feeling rather short
on enthusiasm for this monogamous intimacy with our three-ingredient
tendencies and our everything-shoved-on-a-sheet-pan ways, no matter how
beloved and delicious the results have reliably been. And so I’ve begun
reaching for new ideas, new paths, new routes to new pleasures.*

What that means in practice is, she’s been shopping differently, and
cooking differently, too. She’s found it animating, she wrote, to get
out of the groove.

Take eggplant, which she’s been cooking the same way for decades,
scorching the skin directly on the grate of her stove, then allowing the
black and ruined vegetable rest in a bowl so that it weeps delicious
smokiness as its interior steams and softens. Gabrielle ordinarily
scoops the collapsed flesh out with a spoon and uses it to serve as a
base for dips and spreads, most often framed by bright flavors, or as a
side dish for grilled lamb.

But now? She uses it for [eggplant
croquettes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021285-smoky-eggplant-croquettes)
(above) that you might serve as finger food at a cocktail party if you
could ever imagine having such a thing, or as a principal dancer in an
elegant eggplant Parm that, she concludes, “dissolves on the tongue and
stuns your children into loving awe.” I’m doing that this weekend even
if it requires an untoward number of steps. I trust the process. I think
it’ll jumpstart me. I hope it does you.

Other things to cook this weekend that might reset your brain: I’m
thinking [grilled
paella](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016085-grilled-paella) if
you can manage a grill, or a [coconut layer
cake](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017257-coconut-layer-cake) if
you can’t. (Triple points for making both.) Tonight you could cook one
of our [recipes to celebrate Eid
al-Adha](https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/1688528-what-to-cook-for-eid-al-adha),
which comes to an end tonight.

It’d be neat to cover a table in reams of newsprint, steam up [a bunch
of
crabs](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013173-steamed-blue-crabs),
eat them with leisure or in a frenzy, depending on the heat of the day.
You might do similarly with some [oven-baked
ribs](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014252-balsamic-glazed-oven-baked-ribs).
And I’d love a [grapefruit
fluff](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013319-grapefruit-fluff) for
dessert on Saturday night, whatever I’m cooking. Or a [crème brûlée
pie](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020556-creme-brulee-pie)\!
That’d be great as well.

This could be your weekend for [Ina Garten’s coquilles
St.-Jacques](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017099-ina-gartens-make-ahead-coquilles-st-jacques),
for [Shaun Lewis’s jerk chicken with pickled
bananas](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020376-jerk-chicken-with-pickled-bananas),
for [Melissa Clark’s caramelized tomato tarte
Tatin](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017616-caramelized-tomato-tarte-tatin).
You could bake a [peach
pie](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017525-perfect-peach-pie), or
spin up some [tangerine
sherbet](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012424-tangerine-sherbet),
or assemble [a pistachio and cherry
bombe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020443-pistachio-and-cherry-bombe).
Any of those will leave you thrilled and a little breathless, ready for
a rejuvenated week of cooking to come.

Now, it’s nothing to do with roasted squab or the taste of Bologna on
white bread with mayonnaise and raw onion, but I liked reading [Ian
Frazier in
Outside](https://www.outsideonline.com/2415424/comfort-in-motion-traveling),
on the yearn to road-trip, even now.

Our Tina Jordan and Marilyn Stasio teamed up to produce this invaluable
[guide to Nordic
noir](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/books/review/nordic-noir-guide.html),
which may come in handy as you plan your weekend reads.

Kind of excited to read “[The
Anthill](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622669/the-anthill-by-julianne-pachico/),”
by Julianne Pachico.

Finally, see what you make of this Laura Poppick story [about a Maine
seed collector and his
farm](https://downeast.com/land-wildlife/rare-heirloom-seeds/), in Down
East. I’ll see you on Sunday.
