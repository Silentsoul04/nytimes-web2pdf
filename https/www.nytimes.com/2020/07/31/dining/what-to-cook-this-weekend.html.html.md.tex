Good morning. Here's the beginning of Gabrielle Hamilton's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/bored-with-your-home-cooking-some-smoky-eggplant-will-fix-that.html}{Eat
column} in The Times this week, and I think she's speaking for a lot of
us:

\emph{Lately I've been worn out by my own home cooking. It's not the
toil that's getting to me; it's more that I feel fatigued by the
familiarity of it: the predictability of my own kitchen habits, the
recognizability of my own cooking voice, the monotony of what I always
throw in my cart as I zigzag the aisles at the grocery store on
autopilot. Everyone I know has had a similar malaise recently --- all of
us feeling rather short on enthusiasm for this monogamous intimacy with
our three-ingredient tendencies and our everything-shoved-on-a-sheet-pan
ways, no matter how beloved and delicious the results have reliably
been. And so I've begun reaching for new ideas, new paths, new routes to
new pleasures.}

What that means in practice is, she's been shopping differently, and
cooking differently, too. She's found it animating, she wrote, to get
out of the groove.

Take eggplant, which she's been cooking the same way for decades,
scorching the skin directly on the grate of her stove, then allowing the
black and ruined vegetable rest in a bowl so that it weeps delicious
smokiness as its interior steams and softens. Gabrielle ordinarily
scoops the collapsed flesh out with a spoon and uses it to serve as a
base for dips and spreads, most often framed by bright flavors, or as a
side dish for grilled lamb.

But now? She uses it for
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021285-smoky-eggplant-croquettes}{eggplant
croquettes} (above) that you might serve as finger food at a cocktail
party if you could ever imagine having such a thing, or as a principal
dancer in an elegant eggplant Parm that, she concludes, ``dissolves on
the tongue and stuns your children into loving awe.'' I'm doing that
this weekend even if it requires an untoward number of steps. I trust
the process. I think it'll jumpstart me. I hope it does you.

Other things to cook this weekend that might reset your brain: I'm
thinking
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016085-grilled-paella}{grilled
paella} if you can manage a grill, or a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017257-coconut-layer-cake}{coconut
layer cake} if you can't. (Triple points for making both.) Tonight you
could cook one of our
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/1688528-what-to-cook-for-eid-al-adha}{recipes
to celebrate Eid al-Adha}, which comes to an end tonight.

It'd be neat to cover a table in reams of newsprint, steam up
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013173-steamed-blue-crabs}{a
bunch of crabs}, eat them with leisure or in a frenzy, depending on the
heat of the day. You might do similarly with some
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014252-balsamic-glazed-oven-baked-ribs}{oven-baked
ribs}. And I'd love a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013319-grapefruit-fluff}{grapefruit
fluff} for dessert on Saturday night, whatever I'm cooking. Or a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020556-creme-brulee-pie}{crème
brûlée pie}! That'd be great as well.

This could be your weekend for
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017099-ina-gartens-make-ahead-coquilles-st-jacques}{Ina
Garten's coquilles St.-Jacques}, for
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020376-jerk-chicken-with-pickled-bananas}{Shaun
Lewis's jerk chicken with pickled bananas}, for
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017616-caramelized-tomato-tarte-tatin}{Melissa
Clark's caramelized tomato tarte Tatin}. You could bake a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017525-perfect-peach-pie}{peach
pie}, or spin up some
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012424-tangerine-sherbet}{tangerine
sherbet}, or assemble
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020443-pistachio-and-cherry-bombe}{a
pistachio and cherry bombe}. Any of those will leave you thrilled and a
little breathless, ready for a rejuvenated week of cooking to come.

Now, it's nothing to do with roasted squab or the taste of Bologna on
white bread with mayonnaise and raw onion, but I liked reading
\href{https://www.outsideonline.com/2415424/comfort-in-motion-traveling}{Ian
Frazier in Outside}, on the yearn to road-trip, even now.

Our Tina Jordan and Marilyn Stasio teamed up to produce this invaluable
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/books/review/nordic-noir-guide.html}{guide
to Nordic noir}, which may come in handy as you plan your weekend reads.

Kind of excited to read
``\href{https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622669/the-anthill-by-julianne-pachico/}{The
Anthill},'' by Julianne Pachico.

Finally, see what you make of this Laura Poppick story
\href{https://downeast.com/land-wildlife/rare-heirloom-seeds/}{about a
Maine seed collector and his farm}, in Down East. I'll see you on
Sunday.
