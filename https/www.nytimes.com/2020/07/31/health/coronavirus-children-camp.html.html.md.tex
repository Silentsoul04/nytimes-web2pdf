Camp}\label{the-coronavirus-infected-hundreds-at-a-georgia-summer-camp}}

The camp took precautions but did not require campers to wear masks, the
C.D.C. reported. Singing and cheering may have helped spread the virus.

As schools and universities plan for the new academic year, and
administrators grapple with complex questions about how to keep young
people safe, a new
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6931e1.htm?s_cid=mm6931e1_w}{report
about a coronavirus outbreak at a sleepaway camp in Georgia} provides
fresh reasons for concern.

The camp implemented several precautionary measures against the virus,
but stopped short of requiring campers to wear masks. The virus blazed
through the community of about 600 campers and counselors, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday.

The staff and counselors gathered at the overnight camp in late June.
Within a week of the camp orientation, a teenage counselor developed
chills and went home.

The camp, which the C.D.C. did not name, started sending campers home
the next day, and shut down a few days later. By then, 76 percent of the
344 campers and staffers whose test results were available to C.D.C.
researchers had been infected with the virus --- nearly half the camp.

The study is notable because few outbreaks in schools or child care
settings have been described to date, said Caitlin Rivers, an
epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

``The study affirms that group settings can lead to large outbreaks,
even when they are primarily attended by children,'' she said.

``The fact that so many children at this camp were infected after just a
few days together underscores the importance of mitigation measures in
schools that do reopen for in person learning,'' Dr. Rivers added.

Physical distancing, universal mask use, hygiene and ventilation are
essential to reducing transmission, she noted.

While the role children play in the spread of the virus has been
questioned, the authors of the report said the research adds to evidence
that children of all ages are not only susceptible to infection, but may
play an important role in transmission.

Dr. Preeti Malani, the chief health officer at the University of
Michigan who was not involved in the study, called the report ``a
cautionary tale.''

``It's difficult when you have a gathering this large,'' she said.
``Young people want to be with other young people. They want to
socialize. It just takes one person for it to spread to lots of
people.''

Of the 344 campers and staff for whom test results were available, 260
tested positive. Of children ages 6 to 10, over half were infected; 44
percent of those ages 11 to 17 were infected, as were one-third of those
ages 18 to 21. Only seven staffers were older than 22, and two of them
tested positive.

Those who had been at the camp longest had the highest rate of
infection; overall, more than half of the staff, who had arrived before
the campers, were infected.

Additional cases may have been missed, because the researchers did not
have access to data about 253 other campers and staff.

    Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without
    symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more
    than 200 other experts, who
    \href{https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798}{have
    outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health
    Organization}.

\end{itemize}

Campers and staff members were required to show proof that they had
tested negative for the coronavirus no more than 12 days before arriving
at the camp. Cleaning and disinfection of communal areas were enhanced;
the camp required physical distancing outside cabins, and it staggered
the use of communal spaces.

But while staff were required to wear cloth masks, the camp did not ask
campers to do so, and did not open windows and doors to increase air
circulation in buildings. The campers stayed overnight in cabins, with
an average of 15 occupants in each.

Many camp activities --- which took place indoors as well as outdoors
--- included ``vigorous singing and cheering,'' which can enhance spread
of the virus, the report said.

The case highlights the limitations of asking for proof of negative
coronavirus tests before large gatherings, Dr. Malani said.

``Testing doesn't always mean safety,'' she added. ``It has to be
combined with individuals adhering to strict quarantine. And that's hard
to do for young people, on a college campus, and in K through 12.''

Inconsistent mask wearing is also problematic, she said.

``Even if the staff were wearing masks around the campers, it's likely
that when they were back in their quarters at night, they weren't ---
because that's what happens,'' Dr. Malani said. ``It's hard to do,
because it's not natural to have to distance all the time and wear a
mask.''

In a recent
\href{https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.29.2001352\#html_fulltext}{study
of an outbreak at a high school in Jerusalem} that began 10 days after
in-person classes resumed in late May, 13 percent of the student body
and 16 percent of the staff ultimately tested positive.

Though the students were supposed to wear face masks and practice social
distancing, researchers concluded crowded classrooms of up to 38
students made distancing impossible. Air conditioning may have
accelerated the spread of the virus.
