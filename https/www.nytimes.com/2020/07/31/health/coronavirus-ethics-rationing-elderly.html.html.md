If medical rationing becomes necessary, some older adults are prepared

In April, as the coronavirus was rampaging through the Northeast, Larry
Churchill considered what he would do if the pandemic caused medical
shortages. Should he, a 75-year-old, direct care to younger people
before him if he got sick?

He was in a good position to raise the question. A bioethicist retired
from Vanderbilt University, he published an
[essay](https://www.thehastingscenter.org/on-being-an-elder-in-a-pandemic/)
on the Hastings Center’s bioethics forum saying that he intended to
avoid hospitals if they became overwhelmed and forgo a ventilator if
equipment grew scarce. When a vaccine became available, he would move to
the end of the line.

Fortunately, Dr. Churchill has not had to face such decisions. He
remains healthy, writing and teaching, and hiking in the Blue Ridge
Mountains. And enough ventilators were produced to meet demand.

But as new cases surge across the country and the flu season looms, the
prospect of rationing has resurfaced. Some policies adopted by states or
health care systems to allocate medical resources — equipment, drugs,
critical care and intensive-care beds — specifically make age part of
the equation. Other guidelines appear more neutral, but incorporate
factors that nevertheless disfavor older people, like other health
conditions or life expectancy.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After much discussion of what younger people owe their elders, who are
at greater risk from Covid-19, some older adults are contemplating their
obligations to the young.

“Part of the moral meaning of aging lies in a sense of reciprocity
across generations,” Dr. Churchill wrote in his essay.

He does not believe that older people are less deserving of care, nor
would he want his personal philosophy to become public policy, he said;
other older adults will reach different
conclusions.

But he subscribes to a “life span approach” to ethics, sometimes called
the “fair innings” approach: He has had his turns at bat. Younger people
have had less time to experience life’s opportunities and pleasures.

“That’s why the death of a 40-year-old is tragic — we see so much
unfulfilled potential,” he said in an interview. “My death at 75 would
be sad for the people who love me, but not tragic.”

His is a minority opinion among those considering medical ethics and
legal protections in a pandemic. Professional associations like the
American Geriatrics Society and advocacy groups like Justice in Aging
have focused more on the opposite possibility: They want to prevent
older and disabled people from being arbitrarily sent to the rear of the
line.

“You can have a fairly young individual who is frail and behaves like an
85-year-old, and 85-year-olds who are running marathons,” said Dr.
Timothy Farrell, the vice-chair of the American Geriatrics Society’s
ethics committee and a geriatrician at University of Utah Health. “So to
say that 85-year-olds don’t have a claim on resources seems unjust.”

In June, the society published a [position
statement](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.16537)
aimed at government policymakers and hospital administrators. It warned
that age categories, which some states apply to determine access to care
in disease outbreaks, natural disasters and other crises, should never
be used to exclude patients from treatment.

The statement also opposes criteria like “life-years saved” and
long-term life expectancy, which similarly disadvantage the older
population. Instead, it recommends treating patients based on the
likelihood of being discharged from the hospital and surviving for six
months.

“Our ability as physicians to prognosticate is generally poor,
particularly in the heat of the moment,” Dr. Farrell said. Short-term
predictions are more accurate.

The society took no position on whether age should serve as a
“tiebreaker,” as some ethics guidelines permit in cases where two
patients are deemed equally likely to survive. But “that would be bias,
in our view,” said Regan Bailey, the director of litigation for Justice
in Aging.

Her organization, along with others representing disabled people and
older adults, has filed several complaints with the Office of Civil
Rights at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, charging
that state policies for allocating health care during a crisis violate
federal civil rights laws.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

In March, the Office of Civil
Rights[reaffirmed](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/28/ocr-issues-bulletin-on-civil-rights-laws-and-hipaa-flexibilities-that-apply-during-the-covid-19-emergency.html)
that the Affordable Care Act and other federal statutes prohibit
discrimination, in health facilities receiving federal funds, on the
basis of age, disability and other characteristics.

Nevertheless, the coalition has argued that guidelines in Oregon,
[Arizona and northern
Texas](https://www.justiceinaging.org/older-adults-and-people-with-disabilities-challenge-discriminatory-surge-care-guidelines-in-covid-19-hotspots-arizona-and-texas/)

guidelines in June, includes long-term mortality as a consideration,
along with the ability to experience “life stages.” While those cases
are pending, other civil rights complaints have brought changes in

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

None of these efforts, however, prevent individuals like Dr. Churchill
from voluntarily declining treatment to benefit the young, or for any
other reason. Specifying one’s choices, using an advance directive, is
of greater importance than ever during a pandemic.

For those who want to yield their place in the health care line, an
organization called [Save Other Souls](https://www.saveothersouls.org/)
has developed a document that takes effect during a declared state of
emergency for Covid-19. Vetted by lawyers, it allows people of any age
to cede medical equipment, drugs or hospital care to others. The
directive lapses when the emergency ends, or after 18 months.

“It’s akin to the person who runs into a burning building or gives up
the last seat on the lifeboat,” said Dr. Andrea Kittrell, an
otolaryngologist in Lynchburg, Va., who created the organization in
March. “There are those people who are selfless and generous and value
other people’s lives as much or more than their own.”

Winnona Merritt, for example, works daily in her vegetable garden in
High Point, N.C., sharing cucumbers and squash with her neighbors.
Vigorous at 82, Ms. Merritt said she would welcome more good years. But
in a pandemic, “I’m afraid I could go to the head of the line, ahead of
someone younger, with a family,” she said. “I don’t need that. I’ve had
a wonderful life.” With her family’s support, she signed an S.O.S.
directive.

Research suggests that altruism and [generosity increase at older
ages](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/1/52/3105859).
For example, in recruiting volunteers for Experience Corps, which trains
seniors to assist in public schools, the [most effective recruiting
messages](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.169151)
appealed to a person’s desire to help the next generation.

Successful programs like Experience Corps also point to a common
criticism of the fair innings philosophy: The last innings of the game
can be among the most significant. “We may be missing out on the
contributions people make later in life,” Dr. Farrell said. Moreover,
some individuals, for reasons including race, gender or poverty, never
got their fair innings.

Of course, forgoing health care isn’t the only altruistic response to
Covid-19. Jeffrey Balkind, 73, a retired World Bank administrator in
Washington, has [volunteered for clinical vaccine
trials](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/). Mr. Balkind has
had two close encounters with death, as a hostage during a [1981
airliner](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/09/23/amateur-chronicles-crisis/0a961fb6-af41-4857-8884-5bfc0a3511fd/)hijacking,
then after a 2017 accident with his Vespa scooter. Injured and
hospitalized, he resolved that “if I ever had a chance, I would try to
do something useful in the medical field.”

It wasn’t simple. For the initial trial of [a vaccine candidate
developed by the biotech company
Moderna](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
and the National Institutes of Health, Mr. Balkind underwent a health
screening by phone and a two-hour physical exam, then signed a 23-page
consent form. He was deeply disappointed to be placed on a standby list.

But he was accepted into the much larger Phase 3 trial now underway, and
expected to receive his first dose on Monday. “I am thrilled,” he said.
“I feel I’m on a fascinating adventure.”
