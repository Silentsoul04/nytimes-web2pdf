\section{Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Snag Biggest Coronavirus Vaccine
Deal
Yet}\label{sanofi-and-glaxosmithkline-snag-biggest-coronavirus-vaccine-deal-yet}}

The arrangement brings the Trump administration's investment in
coronavirus vaccine projects to more than \$8 billion. The head of the
federal effort is a former GSK executive.

The French drug maker Sanofi said on Friday that it had secured an
agreement of up to \$2.1 billion to supply the U.S. federal government
with 100 million doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccine, the
largest such deal announced to date.

The arrangement brings the Trump administration's investment in
coronavirus vaccine projects
\href{https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx?filter=vaccine}{to
more than \$8 billion}. This sprawling, multiagency effort, known as
Operation Warp Speed, is placing bets on multiple vaccines and is paying
companies to manufacture millions of doses before clinical trials have
been completed.

``The global need for a vaccine to help prevent Covid-19 is massive, and
no single vaccine or company will be able to meet the global demand
alone,'' Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president and global head of
Sanofi Pasteur, the company's vaccine division, said in a statement.

Also on Friday, the European Union said it was working on a deal with
Sanofi to buy up to 300 million doses of potential vaccines to
distribute to citizens in its 27 member countries. The announcements
came two days after
\href{https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-07-29-07-00-00}{a
deal} with the British government to supply up to 60 million doses of
the vaccine. Financial details of those deals were not disclosed.

Under the U.S. deal, Sanofi and its partner, the British pharmaceutical
company GlaxoSmithKline, will receive federal funding to pay for
clinical trials as well as for manufacturing the vaccine. Sanofi said
the deal also includes an option for the company to supply an additional
500 million doses. The company expects to begin clinical trials to test
for safety in September, followed by late-stage efficacy trials before
the end of this year. Sanofi said it could apply for regulatory approval
in the first half of next year.

If the vaccine is successful, it would be made available to Americans at
no cost, other than what providers charge to administer it, the federal
government said in a statement.

The head of Operation Warp Speed, Moncef Slaoui, is a former GSK
executive who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html}{as
of May held just under \$10 million} in GSK stock. Dr. Slaoui's
financial ties to some of the companies that are pursuing coronavirus
vaccines
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/us/politics/vaccine-Slaoui-coronavirus-trump.html}{have
raised questions} about conflicts of interest.

Dr. Slaoui is not a federal employee, instead working under a \$1
contract that exempts him from federal rules that would require him to
list his outside positions, stock holdings and other potential
conflicts. Dr. Slaoui said in an interview in May that he was determined
to avoid any conflicts of interest, but that his GSK stock represented
his retirement from 29 years at the company, and that he had told
federal officials he would not take the job if he had to sell it.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/31/science/31VIRUS-SANOFI2/merlin_172533156_c85ca1a5-94fb-4e96-a712-70b425f62086-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Sanofi and GSK did not say how much of the federal money would go to
each company --- only that Sanofi would receive the most. GSK did not
comment on whether Dr. Slaoui had recused himself from negotiations over
the deal. A senior administration official said all agreements were
negotiated by federal ``acquisition professionals'' and that Dr. Slaoui
did not play a role in the negotiations.

A handful of other vaccine candidates are already in late-stage clinical
trials and some, such as AstraZeneca and Moderna, have said a vaccine
could be ready before the end of this year.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Sanofi's coronavirus vaccine relies on a protein-based technology that
the company already uses to produce an influenza vaccine. It is similar
to a technique used by another company, Novavax, that will
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html}{receive
up to \$1.6 billion} **** from the Defense Department and the Department
of Health and Human Services **** to develop its experimental vaccine.
GSK is supplying the Sanofi vaccine with an adjuvant, an ingredient used
in many vaccines that boosts the immune response.

Sanofi is also developing a separate vaccine in partnership with
Translate Bio that uses so-called messenger RNA to provoke an immune
response in the body. That vaccine is expected to enter clinical trials
in the fall.

As a French company, Sanofi has had to carefully navigate the
geopolitics of vaccine development. In May, the company's chief
executive, Paul Hudson, faced backlash after
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/u-s-to-get-sanofi-covid-vaccine-first-if-it-succeeds-ceo-says?sref=Bq9vyGd4}{he
said the United States would get the largest number of doses} because
they were investing the most.

The remarks caused the company to backpedal, explaining that ``We have
always been committed in these unprecedented circumstances to make our
vaccine accessible to everyone.''

Matina Stevis-Gridneff contributed reporting from Brussels.
