# Contact Tracing Is Failing in Many States. Here’s Why.

Inadequate testing and protracted delays in producing results have

In Arizona’s most populated region, the coronavirus is so
[ubiquitous](https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/contact-tracing-important-but-less-useful-with-spiking-cases-maricopa-county-says/article_57d55328-bb4b-11ea-8718-8b1cf4ab4137.html)
that contact tracers have been unable to reach a fraction of those
infected.

In Austin, Texas, the story is much the same. Just as it is in North
Carolina, where the state’s health secretary recently told state
lawmakers that its tracking program was hiring outside workers to [keep
up](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-selects-first-vendors-expand-testing-and-contact-tracing-covid-19)
with a steady rise in cases, as [a number of other
states](https://www.nashp.org/state-approaches-to-contact-tracing-covid-19/)
have done.

Cities in Florida, another state where Covid-19 cases are surging, have
largely[given up on tracking
cases](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-beach-mayor-urges-desantis-to-address-failures-of-floridas-contact-tracing-program/2268324/).[Things
are equally dismal in
California.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-ravaged-florida-as-ron-desantis-sidelined-scientists-and-followed-trump/2020/07/25/0b8008da-c648-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.htmlhttps://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2020/07/california-covid-contact-tracers-video-los-angeles/)
And in [New York City’s tracing
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/nyregion/new-york-contact-tracing.html),
workers complained of crippling communication and training problems.

Contact tracing, a cornerstone of the public health arsenal to tamp down
the coronavirus across the world, has largely failed in the United
States; the virus’s pervasiveness and major lags in testing have
rendered the system almost pointless. In some regions, large swaths of
the population have refused to participate or cannot even be located,
further hampering health care workers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are not doing it to the level or extent that it should be done,”
said Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin, echoing the view of many state
and city leaders. “There are three main reasons. One is the sheer number
of people, the second is the delay in getting test results back, the
third is the wide community spread of the disease.”

The
[goal](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-tracing.html)of
contact tracing for Covid-19 is to reach people who have spent more than
15 minutes within six feet of an infected person and ask them to
quarantine at home voluntarily for two weeks even if they test negative,
monitoring themselves for symptoms during that time. But few places have
reported systemic success. And from the very beginning of the U.S.
epidemic, states and cities have struggled to detect the prevalence of
the virus because of spotty and sometimes rationed diagnostic testing
and long delays in getting results.

“I think it’s easy to say contact tracing is broken,” said Carolyn
Cannuscio, an expert on the method and an associate professor of family
medicine and community health at the University of Pennsylvania. “It is
broken because so many parts of our prevention system are broken.”

Tracking those exposed is so far behind the virus raging in most places
that many public health officials believe the money and personnel
involved would be better spent on other resources, like increasing test
sites, helping schools prepare for reopening and educating the public
about mask wearing. Some public health experts now believe that, at the
very least, testing and contact tracing need to be scaled back in places
with major outbreaks. In some places, they say the effort may never
succeed.

“Contact tracing is the wrong tool for the wrong job at the wrong time,”
said Dr. David Lakey, the former state health commissioner of Texas who
helped oversee the Ebola response in Dallas in 2014.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Back when you had 10 cases here in Texas, it might have been useful,”
said Dr. Lakey, who is now the chief medical officer for the University
of Texas System. “But if you don’t have rapid testing, it is going to be
very difficult in a disease with 40 percent of people asymptomatic. It
is hard to see the benefit of it right
now.”

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the C.D.C. who is a strong
advocate for robust contact tracing programs, largely agreed that it is
impossible to do meaningful or substantial contact tracing with huge
numbers of cases. He noted that when testing results lag as much as they
have, it becomes almost impossible to keep up with the high volume of
infected individuals and those who have been in contact with them.

“At some point when your cases are very high, you have to dial back your
testing and contact tracing,” said Dr. Frieden, who now runs Resolve to
Save Lives, a nonprofit health advocacy initiative. “We may be in that
situation in some parts of the country today.”

Others argue that contact tracing efforts around the country are still
nascent, and many workers fanning out in particular zones are still too
inexperienced to call it quits. These experts contend that tracking
remains an important mechanism that can help as flare-ups continue over
the next year and beyond.

[Crystal
Watson](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/C%20Watson/),
a risk-assessment specialist at the Center for Health Security at the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said she had hoped more
contact tracers would be trained and in place before states started
reopening. For now, she expects it to be feasible only in Massachusetts,
New York, North Dakota and the District of Columbia. Massachusetts,
where the nonprofit group Partners in Health leads the efforts, has done
particularly well.

Contact tracing has been used as a tool for hundreds of years to contain
diseases like
[tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/laboratory/contact-investigation/en/),
yellow fever and Ebola. A rudimentary form was even used to track [the
route](https://theconversation.com/contact-tracing-how-physicians-used-it-500-years-ago-to-control-the-bubonic-plague-139248)
of a syphilis outbreak in the 16th century. Countries like [South

and

used the method to successfully control the spread of the coronavirus,
too.

The C.D.C. has [sent about $11
billion](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/05/18/hhs-delivers-funding-to-expand-testing-capacity-for-states-territories-tribes.html)
in relief funds to states and local jurisdictions for expanding
coronavirus testing and contact tracing. A survey of state health
departments [by National Public
Radio](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/18/879787448/as-states-reopen-do-they-have-the-workforce-they-need-to-stop-coronavirus-outbre)
last month found they had roughly 37,000 contact tracers in place, with
an additional 31,000 in reserve for when they would be needed. The work
force — a mix of government employees, volunteers and contract workers
hired by outside companies or nonprofit organizations — still falls
short of the 100,000 people that the C.D.C. has recommended.

The contact tracers, whose training varies considerably in length and
content depending on what state they are in, have struggled to keep up
with the rising number of cases.

“The challenge is that we are not dealing with ones and twos,” said Fran
Phillips, a deputy Secretary for Public Health for Maryland, a state
that has largely kept the virus in check but still faces over 900 new
cases daily. For every new case, there are several if not dozens of
people to contact, especially in large cities, which further strains the
system.

Contact tracing generally works best, public health experts say, when a
disease is easily detected from its onset. That is often impossible with
the coronavirus because a large percentage of those infected have no
symptoms.

“When you have a situation in which there are so many people who are
asymptomatic,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at a recent Milken
Institute event, “that makes that that much more difficult, which is the
reason you wanted to get it from the beginning and nip it in the bud.
Once you get what they call the logarithmic increase, then it becomes
very difficult to do contact tracing. It’s not going well.”

Perhaps most harmful to the effort have been the persistent delays in
getting the results of diagnostic tests. Often by the time an individual
tests positive, it’s too late for the health care workers tracking that
person to do anything.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a race against time,” Ms. Phillips said. “And if we have lost days
and days of infectious period because we didn’t get a lab result back,
that really diminishes our ability to do contact tracing.” In Maryland,
like many states, some labs are taking as long as nine days to turn
around results. “We are getting some assurances from national
manufacturers this lag is short term,” she said. “I am not confident.”

In contrast, when sports teams and staff of the White House test people
constantly, with fast turnarounds, contact tracing is i[nstant and
effective.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-executive-office-cafeteria-closed-after-positive-coronavirus-test-n1234662?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Even as health care workers leap over these hurdles, they are also
finding that it can be difficult not just to reach people who were
potentially exposed to the virus but to get them to cooperate. Sometimes
there is no good phone number, and in the cellphone era, unrecognized
numbers are often ignored; 25 percent of those called in Maryland don’t
pick up. Others, suspicious of contact tracers or fueled by
[misinformation about
them](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/14/890628203/conspiracy-theories-aside-heres-what-contact-tracers-really-do),
decline to cooperate, a stark contrast with places like Germany where
compliance with contact tracers is viewed as a civic duty.

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, contact tracers employed by the state
have reached only 18 percent of those infected over the last two weeks,
according to Mayor Dan Gelber of Miami Beach; many of the others were
never even called. Mr. Gelber [wrote a
letter](https://twitter.com/CBoomerVazquez/status/1287841499422629889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1287850787830468613%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.local10.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fcoronavirus-in-miami-dade-contact-tracing-failures-and-talk-of-how-to-spend-federal-money%2F)
to Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday decrying the state of the program.

“You think it’s a natural situation where people will say, ‘Oh of
course, I’ll cooperate,’” Dr. Fauci said. “But there’s such pushback on
authority, on government, on all kinds of things like that. It makes it
very
complicated.”

In Seattle, tracers found 80 percent of the people they reached [were
not in
quarantine](https://komonews.com/news/coronavirus/only-1-in-5-isolating-when-covid-symptoms-develop-king-county-says),
even if they had symptoms. And there is little appetite in the United
States for intrusive technology, such as electronic bracelets or
obligatory phone GPS signals, that has worked well for contact tracing
in parts of Asia. Although Americans are free to cross state lines, no
national tracing program exists.

“We need federal leadership for standards and privacy safeguards, and I
don’t see that happening,” said [Dr. Luciana
Borio](http://leighbureau.com/speakers/lborio), a former director of
medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council.

Many epidemiologists believe fixing the program in the United States to
combat and contain the coronavirus outbreaks is essential.

**“**We have to start by supporting people in getting tested, which
means making it easy enough for those exposed to someone or has symptoms
to just show up and not worry about a doctor’s order,” Ms. Cannuscio
said. “People in the Covid era have a hard time telling you what day it
is.”

Dr. Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer at Partners in Health, the
group in charge of the Massachusetts effort, outlined the principles her
group insisted on: Tracers must come from the hardest-hit communities
and be able to speak Spanish, Haitian Creole or whatever language the
communities do.

Every tracer must be paid, not a volunteer. And Massachusetts had to put
in enough money to let the tracers “support” anyone expected to
self-quarantine.

“We ask: Do you need food? Infant formula? Diapers? Cab fare?
Unemployment insurance? And we help them get it,” Dr. Mukherjee said.
“That way people feel it’s care, not surveillance.”

Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer at the Association of
State and Territorial Health Officials, said that despite the failures
so far, it was too soon to surrender. States need more time to build up
a tracing work force and the infrastructure to do it well, he said, and
Americans need to grow more comfortable with the concept, similar to
becoming accustomed to wearing masks.

Dr. William Foege, a former director of the C.D.C., [said
recently](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/sunday-review/coronavirus-contact-tracing.html)
that effective tracers should be “psychiatrists, detectives and problem
solvers all at once,” and that will also take time for many who are new
to the job.

But in the meantime, Dr. Plescia said, even finding a fraction of cases
through contact tracing will help slow the virus’s spread.

“We don’t have to strive for perfection on this,” Dr. Plescia said.
“It’s a heavy lift and it’s going to take some time. We need to hang
in there and keep at it.”
