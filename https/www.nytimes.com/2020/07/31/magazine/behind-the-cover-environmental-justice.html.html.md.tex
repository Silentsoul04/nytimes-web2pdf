\textbf{Kathy Ryan, director of photography:} ``This week's cover story
about environmental justice focuses on the Grays Ferry neighborhood of
Philadelphia. A refinery there exposed the neighborhood's residents to
toxic emissions for years. We feel that this image of the refinery, made
by Hannah Price on a cloudy day, has an ominous mood that interacts well
with the grave statistic in the cover line, emphasizing the immense
suffering inflicted on surrounding communities by refineries like
this.''
