Killer robots may not seem like soothing fare, but unlike real life, the
world's horrors come to an end when the movie does.

Like everyone, I lose track of time these days. Some people react to
that kind of limbo with comfort viewing that creates a familiar routine,
like detective series or cooking shows. But I turn to a George H.W.
Bush-era blockbuster about time travel and killer robots so I can feel a
bit better about the world.

The movie is
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/03/movies/review-film-in-new-terminator-the-forces-of-good-seek-peace-violently.html}{Terminator
2: Judgment Day},'' and I know what you're thinking. What is so
comforting about Arnold Schwarzenegger exchanging endless rounds of
gunfire with a relentless liquid-metal android? Why don't I just catch
up on prestige television, say, or bask in the complete works of the
Criterion Channel? (Which, full disclosure, I also do.)

First let's make sure we're on the same page, since I'm hearing reports
that this franchise may have several sequels. ``Terminator 2'' (1991) is
the one where Arnold's Terminator is sent from the future to protect the
eventual savior of humanity, a 10-year-old named John Connor (Edward
Furlong). Skynet, the A.I. computer that will nuke civilization,
dispatches a shape-shifting assassin called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick)
to kill John and look really cool.

What follows is essentially
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/movies/movie-car-chase-scenes.html}{a
feature-length chase scene}, like a bad dream. After taking the form of
a police officer, the T-1000 pursues John and his mother, Sarah
(\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/movies/linda-hamilton-terminator.html}{Linda
Hamilton}), who's sprung from a mental asylum. Explosions, fusillades
and eye-popping special effects ensue. I never said this was a quiet,
meditative gem. But I watch all of it compulsively, as if I didn't
already know the plot's future.

In all honesty, I'm a bit surprised to be mooning over ``Terminator 2''
in public. As the top-grossing movie release of 1991 and part of the pop
culture vocabulary, it's no discovery. Many admirers of
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIcomuI1j7I}{James Cameron's 1984
original}, ``The Terminator,'' look askance at his sequel's catchphrases
and sheer size. Not to mention that much of my career as a critic and as
editor at Film Comment has involved spotlighting much lesser-known
movies --- often small-budget or foreign, very few starring
Schwarzenegger.

But if I may gratuitously quote Jean Renoir from ``The Rules of the
Game'': ``Everyone has his reasons.'' Here are mine.

It's reassuring to watch a movie where the stakes are apocalyptic at all
times. After a day's hassles and ongoing catastrophes, I like to settle
into my couch and watch a seemingly invincible quicksilver angel of
death hold the fate of humanity in the balance.

The appeal is simple. I look at imminent nuclear Armageddon and the
subsequent hopeless war with unfeeling, self-replicating machines who
possess murderous capabilities that might as well be necromantic magic.
And I think to myself, ``Eh, I guess things could be worse.''

You know where you stand in ``T2'' --- namely, on the brink of global
annihilation and entirely dependent on the survival of a moody, erratic
preteen whose hobbies include arcade games and credit card fraud. Some
might object that the real world also faces ample mortal threats,
pandemic and otherwise. Why subject oneself to this robotic
unpleasantness to relax? Chamomile tea, for example, is reliably
soothing, and, prepared correctly, does not involve mass casualties.

I think the difference with the world's horrors is that every single
time I watch ``T2,'' it comes to an end. The nightmares remain in the
realm of fiction. (So far.)

``Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' is a breathtaking peak during a pivotal
moment in blockbuster filmmaking: a dazzling combination of highly
expressive digital effects and thrilling analog effects --- stunt work,
chases, and action set pieces whose influence can be seen to this day.

These visual wonders still dazzle. I love the peculiar unnerving heft of
the T-1000's liquid metal: you feel as if you could reach out and touch
it, a physicality that's rare in digital effects. The mind-bending
metamorphoses serve as the shimmering physical embodiment of the story's
cold-sweat paranoia: the enemy inspires awe and fear and could be
anyone, anything, anywhere.

For its technical accomplishments, the movie went on to win four Academy
Awards, out of six total nominations. It's a rare sequel with all
pistons firing, when so many franchise installments today feel belabored
and airless (including later ``Terminator'' visits).

Enough about liquid metal. I love the energy and detail brought by the
actors who populate ``T2.'' Patrick gives us one of cinema's very finest
androids, a model of patient menace. Hamilton is a ferocious action
hero, in a movie starring Schwarzenegger. (Some quibble over her
character's voice-over, but if I went through all that Sarah Connor
does, I'd want to talk, too.) Furlong makes for a credibly awkward kid.
And as the tech guru Miles Dyson, Joe Morton conveys the wholesome
curiosity that unwittingly hastens doomsday.

Finally, there are the note-perfect walk-ons --- hapless people who
cross paths with the unthinkable while getting coffee or answering the
door. In my mind, they all get their own friendly Terminators who come
back and save them (and give a cornball thumbs-up while lowering into
molten steel). I don't think too much about the possibility of
time-travel paradoxes. I'm just getting through the day.
