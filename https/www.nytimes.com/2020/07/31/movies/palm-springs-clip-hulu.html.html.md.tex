So many wedding receptions (and their depictions in movies) have a
predictable list of ingredients: speeches, dancing, awkwardness,
drunkenness. The one
\href{https://www.hulu.com/movie/palm-springs-f70dfd4d-dbfb-46b8-abb3-136c841bba11?\&cmp=13289\&utm_source=google\&utm_medium=SEM\&utm_campaign=CM_SEM_PalmSprings\&utm_term=palm\%20springs\%20hulu\&gclsrc=aw.ds\&ds_rl=1251123\&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnybUMcE3YTcib1lAhH7G55y9vQXLZS-uwYcHjUIxOKwWbiAJGnAxRboaAtwlEALw_wcB}{in
the Hulu comedy ``Palm Springs''} includes those things, but with some
clever, off-kilter tweaks.

Cristin Milioti plays Sarah, the sister of the bride. And Andy Samberg
plays Nyles, a plus-one wedding guest who's taking a notably different
approach to the situation. He gives a surprising (and surprisingly
poignant) wedding speech. At key moments, he appears to be directly
addressing Sarah, who doesn't know him. Then he has moves on the dance
floor that seem like he himself has choreographed all those around him.

This series of oddities has Sarah, and the audience, wondering exactly
what is going on, and shifts this comedy into a different gear. But
couched inside the scene is a meet-cute that is as charming as it is
weird.

In this video, the director Max Barbakow talks about the ways he leans
into the strangeness while also playing the familiar for laughs. Plus,
he breaks down that hilarious, and meticulously coordinated wedding
dance that just may make you do a double take.
