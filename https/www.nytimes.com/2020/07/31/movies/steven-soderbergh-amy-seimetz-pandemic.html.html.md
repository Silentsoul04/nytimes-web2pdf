# Steven Soderbergh and Amy Seimetz Made the Pandemic Movies of the Moment

</div>

His 2011 “Contagion” and her new thriller “She Dies Tomorrow” have added
resonance now. “Why is this kind of imagery so compelling?” Soderbergh
asked.

The directors Steven Soderbergh and Amy Seimetz had prepared for a
significant spring. Her new film [“She Dies
Tomorrow”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcMFjCPkP3M) was intended
to debut at the South by Southwest film festival in March, after which
she’d fly to Detroit to act in Soderbergh’s crime drama “Kill Switch.”

Those plans were made pre-pandemic, of course. As the spread of the
coronavirus in the United States reached alarming levels, [South by
Southwest](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/arts/music/sxsw-cancelled.html)
was canceled, and “Kill Switch” was halted two weeks before shooting.
Hollywood had come to a standstill.

“I knew nothing was going back to normal anytime soon,” Seimetz said.
“It was an interesting process to watch everyone face the facts.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But a funny thing has happened to Soderbergh and Seimetz in lockdown, as
two of their movies have found new resonance during the Covid-19 era.
“Contagion,” Soderbergh’s 2011 pandemic thriller starring Matt Damon,
[rocketed up the iTunes rental
charts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/business/media/coronavirus-contagion-movie.html)
in March, while “She Dies Tomorrow,” out Friday in drive-ins and next
week on digital, offers a more subjective take on going viral: An
anxious young woman (Kate Lyn Sheil) is convinced she will die the next
day, and anyone she tells is soon gripped by the same fearful prophecy.

“‘Contagion’ is relentlessly objective in its style and its formal
structure whereas Amy’s film, by design, is this sort of fever dream in
both its style and its storytelling,” Soderbergh told me this week
during a pandemic-focused Zoom call with Seimetz. “It’s interesting to
me as an example of how you can give artists the same central idea and
they will go off on two completely different tangents just because of
who they are.”

These are edited excerpts from our conversation.

**What were the first few months of lockdown like for both of you?**

**STEVEN SODERBERGH** I knew in January from talking to my friends in
the world of epidemiology that this was serious. I would call them and
say, “So what do you think?” and their entire quote was “It’s going to
be bad.” But you’re trying to balance these very conflicting, primal
reactions to what’s happening with the virus and your own career
advancement, so it’s a really strange collision of your civic duty and
your ego. I had moments of trying to check myself.

**AMY SEIMETZ** Another thing that’s evolved is my conversations with
executives. At the beginning of this, they were like, “We’re not in the
office anymore, so we’re just going to call you all the time and ask
when things will be ready.” It’s been interesting to see how those calls
all dropped off in silence, which I prefer because it allows me to do
the work. The other side product of this is that I have an entire
freezer full of vegetable stock from the beginning of quarantine. Like,
huge lifetime supplies of lentils.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What did you make of all the people who were drawn to “Contagion”
during the early days of the pandemic?**

**SODERBERGH** It does pose a larger question about why we’ve had this
attraction to disaster movies. Why is this kind of imagery, this
spectacle of destruction, so compelling to us? Is it pure fantasy, or is
it something darker that’s wound into us that we don’t fully understand?

**SEIMETZ** I have a theory about that, because I actually witnessed
myself doing this. When the pandemic first started, in order to not feel
anxious, I was binge-watching completely mindless crap like [“Too Hot to
Handle”](https://www.netflix.com/title/80241027) and [“Love Is
Blind,”](https://www.netflix.com/title/80996601) and I was like, “Why
do I feel so ill after? I’m just trying to take my mind off things.” And
then I was like, “I’ll watch [‘After
Life,’](https://www.netflix.com/title/80998491) with Ricky Gervais,”
and I was just sobbing the entire time, but I felt so much better\!

I needed to feel those emotions, like loss and sadness and fear. I think
suppressing them sort of makes you more anxious, so there’s a cathartic
element to watching something like “Contagion,” which I found strangely
comforting.

take](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2011/09/contagion-portrays-extreme-not-impossible-scenario)**
**on “Contagion” published back in 2011: “It’s one of the most accurate
movies I have seen on infectious disease outbreaks of any type … very
dramatic, tense, exciting.” Do you know who said that about the film?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**SODERBERGH** No, who?

**It was Dr. Anthony Fauci.**

**SODERBERGH** Oh wow\! That’s nice. We tried to be really rigorous
about the science, obviously, and I think I can defend most of that. The
biggest conceit that we indulged in was how quickly the vaccine was
found — we compressed that timeline greatly, especially given what was
technologically possible then.

**Is there anything happening now that you didn’t foresee when making
the film?**

**SODERBERGH** What I couldn’t have predicted was the fracturing of
society that it would generate, and all of the things it would expose
when the tide goes out, so to speak. I didn’t anticipate that it would
reveal so starkly the sort of economic disparity that we’re aware of
intellectually but that a lot of us are able to insulate ourselves from
being directly affected by. Now, nobody escapes this. There are very few
people whose lives will not be completely altered by Covid.

The other thing we’re all dealing with, that the movie doesn’t address
because of its focus, is the general psychological effect on the public
because of an event like this. A cure, a vaccine, mitigating therapies —
all that stuff is hugely important, but there’s going to be an
incredible psychological toll that we’re going to have to figure out how
to address. It’s not like we can just turn a switch and have it be like
it never happened.

**Amy’s film is more about that psychological toll, and how quickly
anxiety can become contagious itself.**

**SEIMETZ** The tricky thing about anxiety is sharing that you have it
can make other people anxious, and there’s a feeling that you’re
burdening them by doing so. Your anxiety then becomes their anxiety, in
a way that’s very literal in this movie. It’s happened with the news
cycle, too: I found myself becoming completely addicted to the news,
getting anxious from it, and then compulsively watching it more. So it’s
also about news cycles spreading panic and the addiction to
panic.

**That reminds me of the Jude Law character from “Contagion,” who
capitalized on the country’s panic to hawk a fake miracle cure. I’ve
seen people reference that character when President Trump touts the
unproven hydroxychloroquine as a cure for the coronavirus.**

**SODERBERGH** It was amusing to me that at one point, there was a
suggestion from outside the creative team that we cut that character out
of the film. We’d have these test screenings and people would hate him\!
The cards would come back and I’d say, “I know\! He’s supposed to be
polarizing.” But we felt pretty confident that the issues brought up by
Jude Law’s character in this film would be very central to the narrative
when this thing does happen.

He’s also not wrong all the time, like with his rant on the park bench
where he describes how they’re rushing the trials for the vaccine and
how the pharmaceutical companies are going to be the ones who benefit.
Look, I’m obviously pro-vaccine, but when you’re talking about putting
something into the bodies of everyone on the planet, that’s a very, very
serious thing. You could have a side effect that goes down to a decimal
point you can barely see, but if you’re going to give it to everyone,
that can still be tens of millions of people that have a negative
reaction. In everybody’s rush to get to the other end of this, we really
do have to be careful
here.

**Steven, you’re heading a Directors Guild committee to figure out how
to get Hollywood back to work safely. What are the problems you’re
facing?**

**SODERBERGH** I think the biggest issue now is because of the
resurgence \[of the virus\], how do we get access to the resources and
the personnel that we need to run these protocols to keep a set safe?
It’s one thing to do one or two projects and see how it goes, but
there’s a movement in the last two or three weeks to get lots of
productions back up and running at the same time. That’s going to be
tricky.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**With baseball, they got it back up and running but there’s already
been** **[a pretty significant
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/sports/baseball/marlins-game-canceled.html).
Could Hollywood face the same risk?**

**SODERBERGH** Having spent a lot of the weekend very happily watching
baseball, I was not happy about the Marlins, but I think that’s a much
more difficult situation than we’re confronting because of the nature of
the game and the fact that they’re traveling all over the place. We have
an ability on a project to control how we move, where we move, how many
people come with us — it’s something that can be manipulated to keep
people safe.

I think if we can withstand the economic surcharge that’s going to come
with keeping a project safe — which I estimate is between 15 to 20
percent of the budget, depending on the project — and if we can scale
this quickly enough, then I know we can keep people safe. If you follow
these protocols we’re about to finish up with, I feel pretty confident
saying that you’re not going to get sick at work. If you got sick on one
of our projects, it was during the 12 to 14 hours when I didn’t have you
and I couldn’t control your behavior. That’s going to be the trick, is
all of this downtime when you don’t know what people are up to.

**But what happens if people** ***do*** **get sick in that downtime and
then come to set?**

**SODERBERGH** Look, it’s complex, but Joel Coen is shooting “Macbeth”
in L.A. right now, and there’s a crew member who’s been \[keeping\] a
pretty detailed diary. And it seems to be working\! They’re using the
rapid testing, which isn’t as accurate as the full-blown nasal [PCR
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html),
but they’re making up for that by testing a lot, eight times for every
five-day workweek. That’s a good approach.

**Amy, is the surcharge Steven mentioned going to limit the amount of
independent films that can be made over the next year?**

**SEIMETZ** I think there’s going to be a conversation with unions to
ease up on some of the crewing mandates, because you can’t really shoot
with a larger crew when you don’t have enough of a budget for those
protocols. From talking to other filmmakers, they’re thinking about
small crews and small casts and shooting outside, so there’s ways to do
it. With “She Dies Tomorrow,” the \[Directors Guild\] was very gracious
in allowing me to have a pared-down crew of about six people — we were
pretty much following protocol \[long before there was a\] protocol.

**What about bigger films? How will “Kill Switch” change when you resume
shooting that?**

**SODERBERGH** I’ll tell you in eight weeks. A lot of this is all
abstract until you get on set and actually see how this stuff works, and
I intend to be very public in my experience of making that movie in
order to educate people. I’m sure I’m going to learn a lot, and I’m sure
a lot of the assumptions that we’re making will turn out to need
adjustment. This is a living thing, and it’s going to have to evolve,
but in what way won’t be clear until we get out there.
