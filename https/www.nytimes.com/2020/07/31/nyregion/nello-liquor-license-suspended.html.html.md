Nello, an Italian restaurant and celebrity hot spot on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan, has long been a showroom for wealthy New Yorkers
undeterred by its lofty prices.

When the coronavirus pandemic forced the venue to shut its dining room,
its flamboyant spirit was on full display.

To promote public health, the restaurant placed large, ruby-hued [teddy
bears wearing face
masks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAWO_ptHZkY/?igshid=1hs6i7mj6zg5i) at
its sidewalk tables. When outdoor dining resumed, the plush animals
remained, huddled around a bottle of hand sanitizer and signs
encouraging patrons to stay six feet apart.

But this week, state officials said that Nello violated the same state
guidance it had urged customers to follow, when it served at least eight
people indoors despite a citywide ban on doing so.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a result, the [State Liquor Authority](https://sla.ny.gov/) suspended
Nello’s liquor license, adding the high-profile restaurant to a list of
dozens of establishments that have been penalized as the state agency
mounts a crackdown on social-distancing violations.

Nello’s management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For weeks, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has denounced crowds gathering outside
New York City restaurants and bars, in what he has deemed flagrant
violations of the state’s social-distancing guidelines.

“What they’re doing is stupid and reckless for themselves and for other
people,” Mr. Cuomo said last week. “And it has to
stop.”

In June, as warmer weather brought more New Yorkers outdoors, Mr. Cuomo
shifted the burden on bar and restaurant owners to control the crowds
outside their buildings.

He also gave the State Liquor Authority the power to suspend the liquor
licenses of businesses that were not doing enough to comply with rules.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As cases of the virus began surging in the rest of the country, Mr.
Cuomo sounded the alarm more frequently. Two weeks ago, the state told
bars and restaurants that they [could not serve alcohol to people who
did not buy
food](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/nyregion/ny-bars-open-cuomo.html?module=inline).

Last week, the state created a task force, led by the liquor authority
and the State Police, that promised to send investigators to respond to
reports of social-distancing violations.

Mr. Cuomo has cast the crackdown as an effort to reduce outdoor crowds
and prevent a potential second spike in cases. But [bar and restaurant
owners have
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/nyregion/nyc-phase-4-reopening-bars.html?module=inline)
the mounting regulations are confusing and unnecessarily burdensome.

Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality
Alliance, an industry group, said businesses that were already suffering
because of the pandemic had been struggling to adapt to shifting
guidelines.

“They’re losing their livelihoods, they’ve laid off employees and
they’re trying to survive,” Mr. Rigie said. “And now they’re trying to
operate in an extremely difficult situation where the guidance continues
to change.”

Even so, most of the city’s restaurants and bars are complying with the
guidance, Mr. Rigie said. He called those violating the rules “a few bad
operators.”

Since the state’s shutdown and social-distancing orders went into effect
in March, 64 businesses have had their liquor licenses suspended for
violations, officials said. The vast majority of those suspensions — 41
— have come in the last two weeks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The crackdown has overwhelmingly targeted establishments in New York
City. Of the 41 businesses, all but three are in the city’s five
boroughs, and 27 of them — about two-thirds — are in Queens.

Across the state, 549 businesses have been charged with violating the
state orders since March, and 408 of them are in New York City.

The majority of the businesses that have been penalized have been
accused by the liquor authority of violations related to outdoor dining
and
drinking.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Mr. Rigie said that restaurant and bar owners felt particularly
frustrated by the state guidance making them responsible for controlling
the spaces outside their premises.

“When you see police having trouble dispersing large crowds of people,
how do we expect restaurant workers to do it?” Mr. Rigie said. “And why
would we expect them to be able to?”

Against a backdrop of bars and restaurants accused of improper outdoor
drinking, Nello, which was accused of serving patrons inside, would seem
to stand apart.

In the decades since the restaurant opened uptown in 1992, it has become
a favorite of boldfaced names and well-heeled New Yorkers drawn to its
elegant atmosphere.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nello’s immoderate prices — [specials can cost hundreds of
dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/your-money/at-nello-a-case-of-restaurant-bill-shock-the-haggler.html),
and many online reviews have complained of sticker shock — have made it
a bastion for the city’s upper crust. It has been the background of many
paparazzi photos and has made [frequent appearances on Page
Six](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/fashion/27nello.html), The New
York Post’s gossip column.

Time has not softened the restaurant’s appeal. Donald Trump Jr., the
president’s eldest child, [spent Valentine’s Day at
Nello](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt4w89HA8Hv/?utm_source=ig_embed)
last year, and the cast of “The Real Housewives of New York” filmed a
scene at the eatery [that was broadcast in
May](https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/real-housewives-of-new-york-city-recap-season-12-episode-6.html).

Yet Nello’s glitzy trappings and hefty price tag have not, apparently,
matched the caliber of Nello’s food. In a [New York Times review of the
restaurant
in 2010](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html),
Sam Sifton offered the rather plain assessment that “the food is not
very good,” describing dishes as tasting like “shirt cardboard” and
“sliced shoe.”

Mr. Sifton gave the restaurant zero stars, but did note its clublike
atmosphere. “The restaurant’s customer base is built of the richest and
most coddled people in the city, who love it for its elegance and,
perhaps, simplicity,” he wrote.

On Friday, Bill Crowley, a spokesman for the State Liquor Authority,
said inspectors found patrons sitting inside Nello, a violation of
regulations in place since March that forbid indoor dining.

A waiter at the restaurant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to talk to the news media, said that
inspectors took issue with two tables set up at the edge of the
restaurant where its doors open onto the street.

The waiter, who said he was there when inspectors arrived, said Nello
had been told twice this month that the tables were consistent with
state guidelines.

Mr. Crowley disputed that account, saying that the eight customers were
clearly seated indoors.
