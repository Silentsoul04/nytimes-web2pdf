# How an Urban Flower Farmer Spends Her Sundays

</div>

On a quest for sunlight and soil, Christina Clum approached Brooklyn
residents about growing flowers in their yards. It worked.

Three years ago, Christina Clum left the corporate world to become an
urban flower farmer.

Her backyard in Kensington, Brooklyn, however, “is the size of a postage
stamp,” she said. “And it doesn’t get good light.” So in February 2018,
she put the word out to other Brooklyn residents about doing plantings
in their yards. The exchange would be simple: They would get to enjoy
the flowers, and then she would cut them and sell them through her
company, [Spry Flower Farm](https://spryflowerfarm.com/).

Ms. Clum, 51, settled on five yards. “I had certain criteria,” she said.
“I didn’t want to have to walk through someone’s home, because it would
be weird and invasive.” She needed sunlight and an outside water source.
Ms. Clum also made it clear that she wasn’t a landscaper. “Some people
still don’t get that,” she said.

“I have developed quite a fondness for my hosts and have attended
barbecues and plays in which they are involved,” said Ms. Clum, who
visits her hosts’ properties several times a week to dig up weeds, plant
new seeds, and water the flowers, which she sells through a subscription
service and to two stores. “I think it definitely takes a certain type
of person to volunteer their yard and put their trust in strangers.”

Ms. Clum lives with her husband, Christopher Longworth, 51, who is an
architectural metal fabricator; their daughter Cora, 15; a dog, Ida Mae;
and three cats.

**BREAKFAST WITH IDA MAE** I get up early, around 6 a.m. If I was a real
farmer I would probably have to get up even earlier. I have one cup of
French-press coffee, and I will make myself a hearty breakfast, because
I will be outside for several hours. There are almost always eggs, maybe
some sautéed greens. On Sundays everyone in the house sleeps in, and
it’s really quiet and lovely. My dog will get up. though, and if she’s
staring at me, I will have to give her a walk before I leave. She almost
always wins.

**WEEDING AND WATERING** I try to visit two yards one day, three yards
the next day. Now that it’s July, most everything is planted. When I go
to the yards, I am mostly weeding and watering and cutting. I do what
they call succession planting, which means planting seeds so there is
always something blooming. That way I will have flowers throughout the
season. I currently have black-eyed Susans, zinnias, cosmos,
snapdragons, and chocolate lace flowers blooming.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING** I spend from two to four hours in each yard.
During the pandemic when everyone was at home, I saw people more often
than I did previously. Sometimes they would stay behind their door, and
I would talk to them. Sometimes they would come out and maintain a
distance. People are lonely and craving human
interaction.

**BEAT THE HEAT** On Sundays I’m usually able to get to two houses
before the heat of the day comes. You don’t want to cut flowers in the
heat because they wilt and can’t recover. I drive between all my houses
and carry a backpack along with all my tools. I bring clipping scissors,
my kitchen knife, my hoe, planting seeds, and buckets that I put all the
cut flowers in. I also bring my handy-dandy garden hat, because I don’t
want to get too much sun. I will wear masks whether I run into people or
not because I want to be
responsible.

**HOMEWORK** On Sundays I cut flowers for two shops that I sell to,
[GRDN](https://grdnbklyn.com/) and [Thank You Have a Good
Day](https://www.thankyouhaveagoodday.com/), both in Brooklyn. I
typically come home and clean the flowers off, which consists of cutting
or breaking off leaves from the flowers. I’ll separate them out by type
and arrange them into the numbers each shop
wants.

**FAMILY ERRAND** Each Sunday around noon my husband and daughter and I
go to the farmer’s market on Cortelyou Road. It’s a smaller market, not
a big one, so I find it to be more manageable. We spend about an hour
getting food for the weekly meals. We get fresh vegetables, fresh fish,
whatever looks good.

**DELIVERIES** Around 2 p.m. I’ll take the cut flowers to the two
stores. One of them usually has a specific order for how much she wants
to get, and the other is less specific and will take what looks good. I
used to take my buckets of flowers on the subway, but now I am kind of
avoiding the subway because of coronavirus, so I
drive.

**BACKYARD HANG** The rest of Sunday is pretty relaxed. We will sit in
the backyard and maybe have a glass of wine and discuss what is
happening in the world. We talk a lot about what will happen with school
next year or what is going on with the presidential election. We’ve kind
of stopped talking about the absurdity of what is going on with the
pandemic; it’s too much in your face every day.

**FATIGUE SETS IN** I’ll go to bed around 11, but sometimes I fall
asleep watching television before that. I feel the physical stress of
being a farmer. I am in positions when I am weeding that aren’t normal
for the body. Or I’ll stretch my legs in a contorted way to not knock
over flowers. It’s not terrible though, and my body definitely loosens
up by the next day.
