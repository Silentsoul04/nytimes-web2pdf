Sheltering in place may mean avoiding stores, but online shopping for
certain home-related items has increased.

Even as parts of the country start to reopen after several months of
coronavirus lockdown, many of us are still focused on making our homes
as comfortable as possible while we weather the pandemic. We surveyed
several furniture and design companies to find out what people have been
buying since mid-March.

The best-selling items included the usual top sellers, like IKEA's
classic Billy bookcase, as well as other, newly popular items --- things
that might help you become a better cook, improve your outdoor space or
liven up an interior space that's become a little too familiar.

``In the last several weeks, our bread makers have sold more than the
entire year in 2019,'' said Samara Tuchband, Crate \& Barrel's vice
president of merchandising. They were never best-sellers in the past,
she added: ``These are such specific specialty items within the cookware
and prep-tools space.''

Other homeowners began looking for ways to remake outdoor space in the
spring, and that trend has continued into the summer. Overstock has seen
an increase in sales of outdoor toys, said Ron Hilton, the site's chief
sourcing and operations officer.

``One category that has seen significant growth is outdoor recreation,''
he said. ``Customers are buying play sets, hot tubs, trampolines, pool
toys and yard games now more than ever.''

At Wayfair, one of the most popular items is a pop-up movie theater,
complete with a projector, portable screen and speakers, for movie
nights in the backyard.

Many homeowners also seem to be on a quest to stay cheerful, sprucing up
their spaces with quirky and colorful decorative items.

Anna Brockway, a founder and the president of Chairish, an online
marketplace for décor and furniture, said she was ``delighted'' by the
demand for statement-making dining pieces, linens and tabletop
accessories: ``This speaks to shoppers' newfound desire to make everyday
moments of life beautiful and special.''

One of the best-selling items at One Kings Lane, another home-décor
site, is a white sofa with a blue-and-white pattern. ``We're seeing it
sell extremely well, and noticing a lot of customers showing off their
spotted sofas on Instagram,'' said Ann Haagenson, the company's vice
president of buying.

Remodeling a house when the entire family is stuck at home may seem like
a crazy idea. But it has been happening, said Mr. Hilton, of Overstock,
who noted a jump in sales of kitchen appliances and dining furniture:
``We see customers revamping their kitchens amid all this quarantine
cooking and family time.''

Alexa Battista, a public relations specialist at Wayfair, said she has
seen an increase in sales related to bathroom renovations, including
vanity sets, light fixtures and faucets.

Her theory? ``Given the pandemic, it's also likely that many have found
a new appreciation for their home and are even more interested than ever
in making enhancements to their space.''
