# The Romans Called it ‘Alexandrian Glass.’ Where Was It Really From?

</div>

Trace quantities of isotopes hint at the true origin of a kind of glass
that was highly prized in the Roman Empire.

Glass was highly valued across the Roman Empire, particularly a
colorless, transparent version that resembled rock crystal. But the
source of this coveted material — known as Alexandrian glass — has long
remained a mystery. Now, by studying trace quantities of the element
hafnium within the glass, researchers have shown that this prized
commodity really did originate in ancient Egypt.

It was during the time of the Roman Empire that drinks and food were
served in glass vessels for the first time on a large scale, said
Patrick Degryse, an archaeometrist at KU Leuven in Belgium, who was not
involved in the new study. “It was on every table,” he said. Glass was
also used in windows and mosaics.

All that glass had to come from somewhere. Between the first and ninth
centuries A.D., Roman glassmakers in coastal regions of Egypt and the
Levant filled furnaces with sand. The enormous slabs of glass they
created tipped the scales at up to nearly 20 tons. That glass was then
broken up and distributed to glass workshops, where it was remelted and
shaped into final products.

But what many people really wanted was colorless glass, so glassmakers
experimented with adding different elements to their batches. Producers
in the Levant are known to have added manganese, which reacts with iron
impurities in sand. The manganese-treated glass still retained a bit of
color, however, said Gry Hoffmann Barfod, a geoscientist at Aarhus
University in Denmark who led the study, which was [published this
month](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68089-w) in Scientific
Reports. “It wasn’t perfect,” she said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Glassmakers also tried adding antimony, with much better results. “That
made it completely crystal clear,” Dr. Barfod said.

And expensive: A price list issued by the Roman emperor Diocletian in
the early fourth century A.D. refers to this colorless glass as
“Alexandrian” and values it at [nearly double the
price](https://www.cmog.org/article/glass-price-edict-diocletian) of
manganese-treated glass. But the provenance of Alexandrian glass,
despite its name, had never been conclusively pinned to Egypt.

“We have the factories for the manganese-decolorized glass, but we don’t
have them for the Alexandrian glass,” Dr. Barfod said. “It’s been a
mystery that historians have dreamed of solving.”

Motivated by that enigma, Dr. Barfod and her colleagues analyzed 37
fragments of glass [excavated in northern
Jordan](https://projects.au.dk/internationaljerashexcavation/). The
sherds, each no longer than a finger, included Alexandrian glass and
manganese-treated glass from the first through the fourth centuries A.D.
The sample also included other specimens of glass known to have been
produced more recently in either Egypt or the Levant.

The researchers focused on hafnium, a trace element found in the mineral
zircon, a component of sand. They measured the concentration of hafnium
and the ratio of two hafnium isotopes in the sherds.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Glass forged in different geographic regions had different hafnium
signatures, Dr. Barfod and her collaborators showed. Egyptian glass
consistently contained more hafnium and had lower isotopic ratios than
glass produced in the Levant, the team found.

These differences make sense, Dr. Barfod and her colleagues propose,
because the zircon crystals within sand are inadvertently sorted by
nature.

After being expelled from the mouth of the Nile, sand sweeps east and
north up the coast of the Levant, propelled by water currents. The
zircon crystals within it are heavy, so they tend to settle out early in
the journey on Egyptian beaches. That explains why glass forged in
Egyptian furnaces tends to contain more hafnium than Levantine glass,
the researchers suggest.

When researchers analyzed the sherds of Alexandrian and
manganese-treated glass, they again found distinct differences in
hafnium. The manganese-treated glass had hafnium properties consistent
with being produced in the Levant, as expected. And Alexandrian glass,
the clearest of the clear when it came to transparent glass, chemically
resembled Egyptian glass.

It’s rewarding to finally pin down the provenance of Alexandrian glass,
Dr. Barfod said, adding, “This has been an open question for decades.”

But it’s still a mystery why glasses from Egypt and the Levant exhibit
different ratios of hafnium isotopes. One possibility is that the
zircons containing certain isotopic ratios are bigger, denser, or
bulkier, which affects their movement, Dr. Barfod said. “We don’t know.”

Analyzing the chemistry of Egyptian and Levantine beach sand would be a
logical way of confirming these findings, Dr. Barfod said. “The next
step would obviously be to go out and get sand from both places.”
