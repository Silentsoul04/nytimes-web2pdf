# In 1920, Native Women Sought the Vote. Here’s What’s Next.

</div>

The 19th Amendment did not bring the right to vote to all Native women,
but two experts in a conversation said it did usher in the possibility
of change.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Native women were highly visible in early 20th-century suffrage
activism. White suffragists, fascinated by Native matriarchal power,
invited Native women to speak at conferences, join parades, and write
for their publications. Native suffragists took advantage of these
opportunities to speak about pressing issues in their communities —
Native voting, land loss and treaty rights. But their stories have
largely been forgotten.

After the 19th Amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920, and celebrated
by millions of women across the country, the Indigenous suffragist
Gertrude Simmons Bonnin, also known as Zitkala-Sa, a citizen of the
Yankton Sioux Tribe, reminded newly enfranchised white women that the
fight was far from over. “The Indian woman rejoices with you,” she
proclaimed to members of Alice Paul’s National Woman’s Party, but she
urged them to remember their Native sisters, many of whom lacked the
right to vote. Not only that, she explained, many were not U.S.
citizens, but legally wards of the government, without a political voice
to address the many problems facing their communities.

Bonnin and other Native suffragists would continue to remind audiences
that federal assimilation policy had attacked their communities and
cultures. Despite treaty promises, the United States dismantled tribal
governments, privatized tribally-held land, and removed Native children
to boarding schools. Those devastating policies resulted in massive land
loss, poverty and poor health that reverberate through these communities
today.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Native suffragists’ activism contributed to Congress passing the Snyder
Act of 1924, which extended U.S. citizenship to all Native people;
though in response many states enacted Jim Crow-like policies aimed at
disfranchising Indians. The Native suffragists also aided the push for
the Wheeler-Howard Act of 1934, which stopped the breakup of tribal
lands and emphasized tribal self-governance.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the centennial of the 19th Amendment approaches, it is worth taking
up Bonnin’s call to remember Native women and their full range of
political experiences. With this in mind, Prof. Cathleen D. Cahill, a
historian who has written about Native suffragists, joined Prof. Sarah
Deer, a scholar of Native law and a citizen of the Muscogee (Creek)
Nation, to talk about issues Native women face today. The conversation
has been edited for length and clarity.

**Cathleen D. Cahill**:

You have spent much of your career addressing the issue of violence
against Native women, including in your book, “The Beginning and End of
Rape.” Native women have been calling attention to this kind of violence
for more than a century. **Why are Native women especially vulnerable?**

**Sarah Deer:**

I’m a citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma and I have been
working to address violence against Native women for over 25 years. I
started when I was 20 years old as a volunteer advocate for survivors of
sexual assault, and that experience inspired me to go to law school. It
was in federal Indian law classes that I began to understand the reasons
for the high rate of violence. Quite simply, the criminal legal system
in Indian Country is broken. What else could explain these statistics:
Over 84 percent of Native women have experienced violence in their
lifetime, and over 56 percent of Native women have experienced sexual
violence. This is data directly [from the federal
government](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/violence-against-american-indian-and-alaska-native-women-and-men)
— and these are probably low estimates.

To make matters worse, in 1978 the Supreme Court ruled that tribal
nations lack authority to prosecute non-Natives — again, for any crime.
Many experts believe this is one of the reasons Native people experience
the highest rates of interracial violence in the nation. A system that
doesn’t hold people accountable sends two message — to victims, it says
“don’t bother to report” — and to perpetrators, it says “keep
victimizing people.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Cahill**: That’s really awful. In the 1920s Gertrude Simmons Bonnin
drew similar connections between violence against Native women and the
fact that federal policies had dismantled tribal governments and made
Indian people “wards” without any political power. That seems like such
a long time ago, but **the July 9** **[Supreme Court
ruling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/supreme-court-oklahoma-mcgirt-creek-nation.html)**
**in McGirt v. Oklahoma demonstrates that the past is so clearly present
in Indian Country.** **Can you talk about the ruling’s ramifications?**

**Deer:** Indian law scholars are calling this the greatest win for
tribal governments in the last 50 years. It also hits close to home — it
was a victory for my own tribal nation.

Our Nation signed a peace treaty with the United States in 1866 which
established specific boundaries for our reservation — about 3 million
acres. The United States promised that this reservation would “be
forever set apart as a home for said Creek Nation.” Seems simple, right?

Throughout the 20th century, though, the state of Oklahoma ignored the
treaty and gradually began exercising criminal and civil authority over
the reservation, denying its
existence.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision, written by Justice Gorsuch, determined
that the Creek reservation boundaries were never disestablished; the
reservation promised to the Creek people in 1866 is still in full force.

Tribal issues don’t fare well in the U.S. Supreme Court — losing over 75
percent of the time — so this was an unlikely win, and a tremendous win;
the legal reasoning in this decision will have far-reaching implications
for many different tribal nations who are attempting to preserve land
and resources. **Your research has looked into the role of Native women
in the American suffrage movement. I’d love to learn more.**

**Cahill:** White feminists were inspired by the matriarchal traditions
of Native people. They especially looked to Haudenosaunee (or Iroquois)
women’s power to appoint male political leadership, control their
property, and have custodial rights to their children — those were legal
rights white women did not have. They wanted to hear more and often
invited Native women to speak at their meetings. This gave Native
activists a chance to educate their audiences and while they did proudly
talk about their traditions, they also insisted on talking about the
problems that faced “the Indian woman of today,” as Bonnin put
it.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A good example of this is when organizers asked Marie Louise Bottineau
Baldwin, a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, to put
together a float for the 1913 suffrage parade in Washington. They wanted
the float to portray Native women as they were in the past, you know,
wearing buckskin with their hair in braids, that kind of thing. Baldwin
was deeply aware of the power of imagery in shaping public perceptions
of Native Americans, so she used her image strategically. She decided
not to organize the float, and instead marched with her classmates and
teachers from the Washington College of Law. I think she was making a
statement that Native women were modern New Women who were looking to
the future. She also thought it was important for Native people to study
law to protect their land and treaty rights. She was one of the first
Native woman to graduate from law school, in 1914. **You’re also an
attorney (and a tribal court justice). What do you think is the role of
legal training for Native women in the 21st century?**

**Deer**: Access to legal education is a critical step to strengthening
tribal sovereignty. There are still relatively few Native attorneys in
the United States, but the numbers are increasing. There are also only a
handful of Native women law professors. Nonetheless, Native people are
actively litigating important questions of tribal jurisdiction, land
rights and criminal authority. Native women serve on tribal courts, but
there are also Native women who serve on state benches. Diane Humetewa
(Hopi) became the first Native woman appointed to the federal bench in
2014. Some Native attorneys focus their work on legislation like the
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) which contains significant provisions
that directly affect tribal justice systems. Native women have also been
leading the movements to address environmental abuses and pipelines. At
[Standing Rock Sioux
Reservation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/magazine/the-youth-group-that-launched-a-movement-at-standing-rock.html),
in particular, women were doing most of the organizing and
decision-making in the fight over the Dakota Access
Pipeline.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Cahill:** One striking thing just in the past few years is the
[growing
number](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/04/625425037/record-number-of-native-americans-running-for-office-in-midterms)
of Native women running for state and federal offices. The [first Native
women](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/elections/native-americans-congress-haaland-davids.html)
in Congress were just elected in 2018: Deb Haaland of the Laguna Pueblo
represents New Mexico and Sharice Davids, a Ho-Chunk citizen, represents
your state of Kansas. Native men have served in Congress for well over a
century, but they are the first Native women to hold office in
Washington. **What does it mean to have Native women in Congress or
other elected offices?**

**Deer:** Native women have served in state legislatures for many years,
but we are now seeing a critical mass of new Native women politicians.
Today, we have one Native woman in the Kansas House, and another young
Native woman is campaigning for the Kansas House as well. In Minnesota,
White Earth citizen Peggy Flanagan, became the first Native women to be
elected as a lieutenant governor in the United States in 2018.

When Haaland and Davids were elected as the first two Native women in
Congress, it was seen as a tremendous victory for Native people. It
seems fitting that there were two women elected together. From my
perspective, being the “first” or “only” Native woman serving in
Congress could be a lonely experience. A “partnership” of two Native
women perhaps makes it easier to achieve great things in Congress. For
far too long, Congress has been passing laws to limit the power of
tribal governments without any tribal input. It is far past time for us
to have a seat at the table.

**Cahill**: Absolutely. And that is so important to remember when we
think about the anniversary of the suffrage amendment. For all
suffragists, getting the vote wasn’t an end point, it was the
possibility for change that voting opened up. Native suffragists saw the
vote as a way to change the awful circumstances that faced Native
communities at the time. **One hundred years later, what’s next for
Indigenous feminism?**

**Deer**: I’m still basking in the afterglow of the McGirt decision, so
I’m optimistic about the future for Native women and tribal nations. I
hope to see more Native women elected to public office — at all levels,
tribal, state, and national. We have been politically and symbolically
disenfranchised for too long. I’m so glad our issues are getting more
national attention.
