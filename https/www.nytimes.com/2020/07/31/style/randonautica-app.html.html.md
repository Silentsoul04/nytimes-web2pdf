# What Is Randonautica Really About?

</div>

An app that generates coordinates for adventurers claims to turn your
thoughts into reality. TikTok and YouTube creators want you to believe
it — but you
shouldn’t.

The app led one person to a [friendly dog in the
desert](https://vm.tiktok.com/JNK12b4/) and another to a [field of
wildflowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/hjfwea/first_time_intention_was_pretty_flowers_took_me/).
One young woman, after making her college decision, followed the app to
a field where her school’s initials had been [mowed into the
grass](https://vm.tiktok.com/JNKFyW3/).

And then there were the friends who followed the app to a [suitcase full
of human remains](https://vm.tiktok.com/JNKJHA5/).

That is the gamble one takes with
[Randonautica](https://www.randonautica.com/), which claims to channel
users’ “intentions” to produce nearby coordinates for exploration.
Think: The [law of
attraction](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Chabris-t.html?searchResultPosition=5)
meets
[geocaching](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/nyregion/new-york-city-geocachers-paradise.html?searchResultPosition=3).

Randonautica makes a few asks of users — “What would you like to get?”
“Choose your entropy source” — before prompting them to “focus on your
intent” while it fetches coordinates. This process relies on location
settings and a random number generator, which, despite what the company
says, cannot be directly affected by human thoughts.

Many of the places users have been sent to since Randonautica became
available in February are unremarkable: parking lots, grasslands, many
bodies of water. However, interest has been driven by the spooky and
often synchronistic “randonauting” stories many have shared on social
media. While several of them appear to be fake, others have raised some
cause for concern.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The creators of Randonautica say the app has evolved beyond their
intentions. But what *were* those intentions?

## A Brief History of Randonauting

Before Randonautica, there were the Randonauts: Strangers who swapped
stories about their bot-assisted adventures into the unknown. They
wanted to open their minds to the world around them and make meaning of
life’s coincidences.

The bot’s code came from a group of programmers called the Fatum Project
who were interested in, among other things, using the technology to
ensure the randomness of [online
gambling](https://medium.com/@fatum_project/introducing-fatum-ab676e3c83d)
outcomes.

Joshua Lengfelder, 29, discovered the Fatum Project on the messenger app
Telegram in January 2019, in a fringe-science chat room. He absorbed the
project’s theories about how random exploration could break people out
of their predetermined realities, and how people could influence random
outcomes with their minds.

Mr. Lengfelder, a former circus performer, thought the code and its
underlying ideas could be used to explore the relationship between
consciousness and technology. In February 2019, while caring for his
father, who had just suffered a stroke, he created a
[Telegram](http://t.me/randonauts) bot that used the Fatum Project’s
code to generate random coordinates. In March, he created a [Randonauts
subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/randonauts), which now has 125,000
members. And in October, a developer named Simon Nishi McCorkindale
created a [web page](https://bot.randonauts.com/) for the bot.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That same month, Auburn Salcedo, the chief executive of [Presley
Media](https://www.presleymedia.com/), an agency that creates brand
integrations for TV, found the Randonauts on Reddit and offered to help
Mr. Lengfelder get the word out. On Jan. 24, Ms. Salcedo and Mr.
Lengfelder incorporated Randonauts, L.L.C., with her as C.O.O. and him
as C.E.O. (She remains the chief executive of Presley Media, which
handles P.R. for Randonautica.) They released a beta version of the app
on Feb. 22.

Since its release, Randonautica has been downloaded 10.8 million times
from the App Store and Google Play, according to the research firm
Sensor Tower. After a few months of rapid growth, much of it propelled
by TikTok, its downloads have started to taper off, according to data
from the analytics firm App Annie.

In an interview in July, Mr. Lengfelder described Randonautica as “a
multimedia storytelling platform” that encourages “performance art.” He
said the overwhelming response has not surprised him.

“I kind of figured it was inevitable,” he said. “Because basically what
it is is like a machine that creates memes and legends, and it kind of
virally propagates on its own.”

On social media, the most popular randonauting videos feature eerie and
seemingly dangerous situations that are dramatized through editing. Some
creators have capitalized on the trend by posting exaggerated or false
accounts of their randonauting adventures. The 27-year-old YouTuber Josh
Yozura, for instance, claimed to have been led [to a crime
scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdw_ykwq9Pg). (Mr. Yozura did not
respond to multiple requests for comment.)

Ms. Salcedo denounced such videos in an interview with the YouTube
creator [Billschannel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z43KYpejDNQ). In
a phone interview this month, she spoke further about the proliferation
of fake videos. “It’s so hard to manage, because people are really
taking creative liberties after seeing how much traction the app is
getting in that fear factor,” she said.

## So How Does It Work?

On first use, Randonautica offers a brief intro and some tips (“Always
Randonaut with a charged phone,” “Never trespass”) before prompting you
to share your location.

Then it will ask you to choose which type of point you would like it to
generate (the differences between which only matter if you believe the
app can read your thoughts) before fetching coordinates from a random
number generator. The user can then open that location in Google Maps to
begin their journey.

Randonautica throws big words like “quantum” and “entropy” around a lot.
Its creators believe that quantum random numbers are more likely to be
influenced by human consciousness than non-quantum random numbers. This
hypothesis is part of a theory Mr. Lengfelder refers to as “mind-machine
interaction,” or M.M.I.: It posits that when you focus on your intent,
you are influencing the numbers.

“Basically if you’re looking for any kind of peer-reviewed, scientific
consensus, that does not exist yet in the literature,” Mr. Lengfelder
said in a [TikTok video](https://vm.tiktok.com/JF7gotD/) in June,
speaking about the theory. Instead, he pointed to the work of Dean
Radin, a prominent figure in the pseudoscientific field of
parapsychology, and the [Princeton Engineering Anomalies
Research](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/nyregion/mind-over-matter.html?searchResultPosition=1)
(PEAR) program, which has cited Dr. Radin’s research, as evidence.

Randonautica [claims](https://old.reddit.com/r/randonauts/wiki/theory)
that a 1998 PEAR experiment supported the idea that people can control
random number generation with their thoughts. That
[study](http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pear/fieldreg2.pdf) was
published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, which includes work
about the paranormal, spirit possessions, poltergeists and questions
about Shakespeare’s authorship. In the study, PEAR’s researchers wrote
that the experiment was far from conclusive.

“It looks like they saw some kind of correlation, but they admit that it
was weak and it needed to have further research associated with it,”
said Casey Schwarz, an experimental physicist and assistant professor at
Ursinus College who reviewed Randonautica’s claims for this article. She
said she did not know of any quantum system that could be influenced by
human thoughts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lisa Fazio, an assistant professor of psychology at Vanderbilt
University, said that the more synchronous experiences were likely
coincidences colored by confirmation bias, or the tendency to look for
information that affirms one’s beliefs and tune out contradictory
evidence.

She pointed to a story shared on Reddit, in which an Australian poster
described being led to a map of the London underground. “Things like
that happen all the time, it’s just that you don’t notice that map of
London if you didn’t have the intention already to be thinking of
London,” Dr. Fazio said. She also noted that coincidences are far more
common than people realize.

Mr. Lengfelder dismissed such criticisms, stating that the app was not
created to prove a hypothesis. “I would say it’s not some kind of
academic science work,” he said. “We’re more like inventors than
academic scientists.”

An update coming in August will feature improved graphics and, Mr.
Lengfelder said, a custom random number generator that would have a
higher “rate of entropy.” “So technically our M.M.I. effects should be
higher,” he said. Of course, as noted above, M.M.I. is a theory that is
not supported by science.

Daniel J. Rogers, a physicist who has worked with quantum random number
generators, called Randonautica’s M.M.I. theory “completely absurd.”

“There is no quantum physics here,” said Dr. Rogers, a founder of the
Global Disinformation Index. “This is just people using big science
words to sound magical. There is no actual science here.”

## ‘Do Not Go Randonauting’

Randonauting became popular partly because of reverse psychology; young
people approach it with a sense of foreboding. “Do not go randonauting”
has become a popular title for videos.

Several people who shared unsettling stories about the app say they have
since sworn it off. Adrian Chavez, 21, was led to an ominous beach near
his home in Orange County, Calif. A video of his journey, posted on
[TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/JF1tNLR/) in early June, has been viewed
4.5 million times.

“I deleted the app right after that and never used it again since,” Mr.
Chavez said in an interview in July.

The 18-year-old TikTok user who posted the viral video about finding a
suitcase of human remains on a Seattle beach, @UghHenry, wrote in the
comments of his video: “The moment I got back home, I broke down. I
still can’t sleep.”

In an interview with [The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/randonautica-app-tiktok-body-reddit-quantum/614401/),
Mr. Lengfelder was blasé about the story, which was covered by news
outlets including [KING 5
News](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/remains-found-on-west-seattle-beach-identified/281-d3a505c4-1ea2-4e72-984a-f5bb4f8fa843)
and The [New York
Post](https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/reward-money-raised-after-seattle-tiktokers-find-bodies-in-suitcase/).
“It’s not the best press, but I’m not really that upset about it,
because it’s kind of cool,” he said. “I kind of wish it was me who found
it.”

Some adults have expressed concerns about the app’s lack of safety
precautions for children. Though Randonautica’s terms of use specify
that anyone who is a minor must obtain parental consent to use the app,
such consent is collected by email, making it easy for young users to
bypass.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Know and Tell, a child protection education program with the Granite
State Children’s Alliance in New Hampshire, has posted on Instagram
telling parents to keep young people off the app, or at least supervise
their use.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was very apparent that these were young teenagers that were going to
undisclosed areas in the middle of the night,” said Jana El-Sayed, the
outreach project manager for the Granite State Children’s Alliance. She
described these circumstances as “a perpetrator’s dream.”

Concerns about human trafficking and personal data use are addressed in
Randonautica’s [F.A.Q.](https://www.randonautica.com/got-questions),
which specifies that all location data is anonymized and only made
available to developers, and that starting locations are never saved by
the app.

Pokémon Go, which uses augmented reality to encourage local exploration,
has handled safety concerns by putting PokéStops and Gyms in notable,
public locations, and encouraging users to remain vigilant.

Randonautica’s [safety
tips](https://www.randonautica.com/be-a-responsible-randonaut) are
similar: Avoid dangerous areas, do not trespass, try to explore during
the day or with friends. Randonautica’s
[website](https://www.randonautica.com/be-a-responsible-randonaut)
repeatedly urges users to “use common sense.” The latest version of the
app will feature multiple screens and pop-ups reminding users to use the
app safely.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Randonautica’s executives say they don’t understand why people would use
the app to seek out risk or harm.

“You wouldn’t go out on a walk and say, ‘Let me think about seeing
death,’” Ms. Salcedo said in an interview, referring to a [viral TikTok
video](https://www.tiktok.com/@mykenarae/video/6842171161585945862) in
which an 18-year-old user claims she set her intention as “death” and
then happened upon a shooting victim.

“Yeah, ‘Let’s see if I get stalked,’” Mr. Lengfelder added.

Ms. Salcedo said Randonautica’s legal counsel reassured her and Mr.
Lengfelder that the app would not be liable for any user misconduct.

“Is Google Maps liable too, for giving them directions?” Mr. Lengfelder
said. “At a certain point, if somebody wants to really go out of the way
and harm themselves, they’re going to do it. Whether it’s with
Randonautica or not.”
