*Q: My husband died recently. It was as good a death as could have been
expected: He had been ill for a year, so we had time to prepare and to
mourn together, he died at home under palliative care and in very little
pain (he said), and our family, close friends and I had time for
goodbyes. We had a good life together, and cleared up any prospective
messes in advance of his departure. We wrote his obituary together.*

*My question is this: People who knew neither of us very well fall upon
me in public places with hugs and kisses and sad faces. I am not a huggy
sort of person, and I know they’re trying to be sympathetic, but the
intrusions and the intimations that I must be very sad and lonely drive
me to distraction. I loved my husband, but we each grieve in our own
way, and mine is to get my life in order, circle around close friends
and move on to the next adventure, project or quiet time. How do I best
deal with these intrusions without hurting acquaintances’ feelings? —
Signed, Getting On With It*

A: All of us, but maybe especially women, have experienced what it’s
like to feel like a screen for someone else’s projections. The
over-the-top reactions of your acquaintances, perhaps well intentioned,
only serve to communicate to you that you have just suffered their worst
nightmare. I can understand your impatience with them as you open
yourself to the world again and consider your life, fundamentally
reordered. These people mire you in your sense of loss just as you are
ready to discover what remains to be found.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Such exchanges trouble you because they’re about much more than
navigating social awkwardness. The fact is, when we suffer loss, we
often look to those around us to help affirm who we are, to give us a
sense of continuity and possibility. We need to have those conversations
in order to imagine a way forward, so that we don’t feel like we’re
stepping off a cliff, legs wheeling in thin air. How wonderful that you
were able to prepare for this, to the extent that one can, with your
husband. You were able to have a sense of an ending, something that
often, even under normal circumstances, just isn’t possible. These days,
with families barred from hospitals and memorial services severely
limited, it’s all the more rare and wonderful.

But, as you know, part of the complexity of grief is that it’s not only
about missing the person who knew you in a way that no one else quite
does; it’s also about grieving the loss of yourself in that shared
context. You aren’t the same person you were during your marriage or
before you got married. The next few years will be filled with trial and
error, and having friends — old and new — who actively listen as you
test out new plans and ideas is essential. “Starting a new chapter” is
an appealing euphemism for a time like this because it implies a
continuity, a grander scheme, an awareness that life is what we live
along the way, and for that reason, it can never truly be
“lost.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Once, in my 30s, faced with losses, I embarked on a new chapter in a
very mechanical way: I got on a plane to Berlin, a city well suited for
reinvention and its accompanying grief. I found there the kind of new
friends who would sit with me for dozens of hours over the course of a
year in cafes, drinking wine and helping me through the messy process of
eking out a new version of myself. I lived in a series of sublet
apartments, all of them with views of a cemetery. I dated an earnest
German who believed the internet would save democracy. How many wrong
turns, I often thought, grandiose with solipsism, had I made for it to
come to this.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In that time of odd suspension, I was spending a lot of time wandering
around museums, places that relieved me of my solipsism. At the
[Hamburger
Bahnhof](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/arts/berlin-hamburger-banhof.html),
the popular former train station turned contemporary art venue, the word
“Schmerz” greeted me in enormous letters, the English translation ****
in smaller font below: “Pain.” I wandered numbly through the
meticulously curated exhibit, with its Anselm Kiefer erosions in browns
and grays, the contorted pale bodies of a Francis Bacon, *objets* like
Nietzsche’s death mask and a biting stick once used in operations
without anesthesia. “Art is not just there to be understood,” Joseph
Beuys once said; it is there to be experienced. I didn’t find the
exhibit painful, though, just pedantic and
depressing.

I found what I needed instead while visiting the
[Gemäldegalerie](https://www.smb.museum/museen-einrichtungen/gemaeldegalerie/home/),
home to the (rather less fashionable) old masters: a Bruegel teeming
with life here, a weary-faced Mantegna Madonna there; Vermeer’s women
aglow at their open windows, Holbein’s officious burghers. The museum
was almost always empty, the silence inside had a velveteen density, and
there were little alcoves at the end of certain galleries where one
could sit and reflect. I thought I could really sense something of the
people in these portraits, who became familiar to me — the tender
mothers and infants, the satin-sleeved merchants, the young women who
themselves seemed to be seeking a new view. The emotion of the subjects
was to me indistinguishable from that of their creators, each painting
representative of a moment in time and the effort of making it. I felt
myself poised there, on this tension between their time and mine,
absorbing the feeling of the artists, centuries after their deaths, the
canvases places to explore and amplify aspects of themselves that
perhaps went otherwise unexpressed. I returned many times, sometimes
several times a week, to be reminded that while they were now dead I was
still very much alive, that life was fragile and finite and not to be
squandered.

The fact is, nothing really prepares us for loss; we outgrow our lives
faster than we can quite catch up. “The art of losing isn’t hard to
master,” Elizabeth Bishop wrote, with pained irony, in her 1976
villanelle “[One
Art](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art),” in which
she recounts a continuum of losses, from house keys to those things
immeasurable and unrecoverable. We will all, someday, lose everything we
love. But this impermanence is also what makes us understand that the
time we have is something to be cherished. No one — not new friends or
old, and certainly not I — can tell you precisely what the next steps
will be or just what experiences of art and friendship might open a
window in your mind. But I can tell you that openness to life’s
possibilities is a stance, a perspective on the world that we should all
try to cultivate, wherever we are in it. All of us, in ways small and
vast, have been knocked off balance, and are questioning the certainty
of certain futures. We’re all engaged in a process of self-reckoning,
reconsidering our lives and priorities.

While there are many beautiful memoirs capturing the textures of grief —
Elizabeth Alexander’s, Joan Didion’s, Yiyun Li’s, Sarah Manguso’s — I
often think there isn’t enough written about what comes after: the
in-between times in life, before things are sorted, when we’re still at
an impasse with ourselves. And here I’m thinking of Rachel Cohen’s
“[Austen
Years](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/books/review/austen-years-rachel-cohen.html)”
(2020), a memoir written in a period of dramatic change, including the
death of her father and birth of her children, time she navigated with
the companionship of an author seeking answers in her own tumultuous
era; and Helen Macdonald’s “[H Is for
Hawk](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/books/review/helen-macdonalds-h-is-for-hawk.html)”
(2014), in which the author mourns her father while training a goshawk,
a hunting bird, a process that involves great patience, a freezer-full
of dead mice and a certain wildness of vision. Both these books are
forthright about the effort and risk, but also the thrill and pleasure,
of working out those next chapters. I’m not suggesting you run out and
acquire a flesh-eating pet (though that’s one way to keep those
spaniel-eyed “friends” at arm’s length), but that something of your own
searching thoughts may stand more fully illuminated in the light of
another’s.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another idea: to go a step further, via books that reexamine our common
present context in light of everything that has come before. Sarah
Broom’s memoir, “[The Yellow
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/books/review-yellow-house-sarah-broom.html)”
(2019), does exactly that, connecting her family history, and the story
of her childhood home in New Orleans, to our American story, with its
entrenched racial inequality. Saidiya Hartman’s “[Wayward Lives,
Beautiful
Experiments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/books/wayward-lives-beautiful-experiments-saidiya-hartman.html)”
(2019) also traces the echoes between private losses and public life in
a social history that explores the lives of young Black American women
in the early 20th century, unhailed Modernists who were defining for
themselves what life could be. These were women who understood the
imaginative work of self-authorship better than any of
us.

Any real grieving process will always involve looking back to move
forward. I want you to honor this in-between time, but also to find good
company for it, literary or otherwise, of the kind that inspires you to
take up more space in the world, not less. Whether you are in lockdown
in your home or protesting in the streets, you can lay the groundwork
now as concretely as possible. You can make new friends by getting
involved in any number of initiatives, local or national. Your emotional
and energetic capital will be valuable in ways that you probably can’t
yet know. Fear and freedom, like love and loss, will always be two sides
of the same coin, and there’s no time to waste.
