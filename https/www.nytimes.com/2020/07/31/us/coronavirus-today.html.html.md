## Measuring back-to-school risk

How risky will in-person education be this fall? Researchers at the
University of Texas at Austin have new estimates that provide a rough
gauge of the risk that students and teachers could encounter [in each
county in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html).

Based on infection rates, more than 80 percent of Americans live in a
county where at least one infected person would be expected to show up
to a school of 500 students and staff members in the first week of
classes, if school started today. (One big caveat: The analysis treats
adults and children as equally likely to be infected.)

In the highest-risk areas — including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Nashville
and Las Vegas — at least five students or staff members would be
expected to show up infected with the virus at a school of 500 people.
The high numbers reflect the rapid spread of the virus in those areas,
where more than 1 in 70 people are estimated to be infected.

Education officials in New York City, [one of the few large districts in
the country that are still planning to open schools in the
fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html),
laid out a plan on Thursday for what would happen in the seemingly
inevitable event that cases of the coronavirus are confirmed in a
classroom. The protocol means it is likely that at many of the city’s
1,800 schools, some classrooms or even entire buildings will be closed
at points during the school year.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New York City is currently planning to[reopen its schools on a hybrid
model starting
Sept. 10](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html),
with students reporting to classrooms one to three days a week to allow
for social distancing. Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that school
openings would proceed only if the city’s test positivity rate —
currently between 1 percent and 2 percent — stays below a 3 percent
threshold.

## Fine dining in the Covid era

It’s hard at the best of times to open a high-end restaurant, but during
the pandemic, it’s downright punishing.

To [open the new restaurant Ever in
Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/dining/ever-chicago-restaurant-coronavirus.html)
this week, the chef Curtis Duffy had to rethink everything, including
how to greet guests (handing out an Ever-branded tote bag of P.P.E. was
deemed too unsettling) and how to improvise ingredients (because who
knows when the supply of fennel, lamb tongue, or tapioca chips will run
dry).

During the pandemic, upscale dining venues may actually have advantages
over midpriced restaurants: The tasting-menu format removes
uncertainties in food ordering, checks are guaranteed to be high and the
highly ritualized style of service can help keep safety measures on
track.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Other restaurants are taking note.** Our [food critic in
Australia](https://www.nytimes.com/column/australia-fare) noticed that
midpriced restaurants in Melbourne have been serving pricier meals. Some
chefs say it’s the most viable way forward, and[the trend could be a
bellwether for other cities around the
world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/dining/melbourne-restaurants-coronavirus.html).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

**Cold comfort.** Restaurant owners hit hard by the pandemic in France
are facing a new challenge: The government said it would [ban outdoor
heaters at cafes and
restaurants](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/world/europe/france-heated-terraces-coronavirus.html)
as part of an effort to fight climate change. But the ban won’t go into
effect this winter in order to give owners time to recover and adapt to
the new law.

## Resurgences

  - For the fourth day in a row, **Florida** [broke its single-day
    record for coronavirus
    deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-650428f9),
    reporting 257 on Friday.

  - In **New Jersey**, the average daily case count [has jumped by 28
    percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/nyregion/coronavirus-cases-nj.html)
    from two weeks ago, to 416, a trend largely driven by young
    partygoers on the Jersey Shore.

  - **Britain** [postponed
    reopenings](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-20ec72b0),
    added new regional restrictions and made masks mandatory in more
    places after an uptick in cases and deaths.

  - **Vietnam** [reported its first
    death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53606917) from the virus
    as it battles a new outbreak.

[*Here’s a roundup of restrictions in all 50
states*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)*.*

## What else we’re following

  - More than 30 states and many U.S. cities have put in place mask
    requirements, but [enforcement has been an uphill
    battle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-masks-enforcement-key-west.html).

  - The Senate [failed to extend unemployment
    benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/senate-virus-aid.html)
    that expire today, as Republicans and Democrats continue to clash
