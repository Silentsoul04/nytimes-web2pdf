\subsection{Measuring back-to-school
risk}\label{measuring-back-to-school-risk}}

How risky will in-person education be this fall? Researchers at the
University of Texas at Austin have new estimates that provide a rough
gauge of the risk that students and teachers could encounter
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html}{in
each county in the United States}.

Based on infection rates, more than 80 percent of Americans live in a
county where at least one infected person would be expected to show up
to a school of 500 students and staff members in the first week of
classes, if school started today. (One big caveat: The analysis treats
adults and children as equally likely to be infected.)

In the highest-risk areas --- including Miami, Fort Lauderdale,
Nashville and Las Vegas --- at least five students or staff members
would be expected to show up infected with the virus at a school of 500
people. The high numbers reflect the rapid spread of the virus in those
areas, where more than 1 in 70 people are estimated to be infected.

Education officials in New York City,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html}{one
of the few large districts in the country that are still planning to
open schools in the fall}, laid out a plan on Thursday for what would
happen in the seemingly inevitable event that cases of the coronavirus
are confirmed in a classroom. The protocol means it is likely that at
many of the city's 1,800 schools, some classrooms or even entire
buildings will be closed at points during the school year.

New York City is currently planning
to\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html}{reopen
its schools on a hybrid model starting Sept. 10}, with students
reporting to classrooms one to three days a week to allow for social
distancing. Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that school openings
would proceed only if the city's test positivity rate --- currently
between 1 percent and 2 percent --- stays below a 3 percent threshold.

\subsection{Fine dining in the Covid
era}\label{fine-dining-in-the-covid-era}}

It's hard at the best of times to open a high-end restaurant, but during
the pandemic, it's downright punishing.

To
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/dining/ever-chicago-restaurant-coronavirus.html}{open
the new restaurant Ever in Chicago} this week, the chef Curtis Duffy had
to rethink everything, including how to greet guests (handing out an
Ever-branded tote bag of P.P.E. was deemed too unsettling) and how to
improvise ingredients (because who knows when the supply of fennel, lamb
tongue, or tapioca chips will run dry).

During the pandemic, upscale dining venues may actually have advantages
over midpriced restaurants: The tasting-menu format removes
uncertainties in food ordering, checks are guaranteed to be high and the
highly ritualized style of service can help keep safety measures on
track.

\textbf{Other restaurants are taking note.} Our
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/column/australia-fare}{food critic in
Australia} noticed that midpriced restaurants in Melbourne have been
serving pricier meals. Some chefs say it's the most viable way forward,
and\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/dining/melbourne-restaurants-coronavirus.html}{the
trend could be a bellwether for other cities around the world}.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
