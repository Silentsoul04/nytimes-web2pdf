BOSTON --- A federal appeals court on Friday overturned the death
sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the 2013 Boston
Marathon bombings, and ordered a new penalty-phase trial.

The ruling, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,
concluded that the presiding judge in the 2015 trial, George A. O'Toole
Jr., ``did not meet the standard'' of fairness, because he did not
sufficiently scrutinize sitting jurors for bias.

In arguments in December, lawyers for Mr. Tsarnaev, 27, had pointed
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/boston-marathon-bombing-appeal.html}{to
22 Twitter posts and retweets by the jury's forewoman} --- one referring
to Mr. Tsarnaev as ``that piece of garbage'' --- that had not been
voluntarily disclosed as part of jury screening.

Another juror said on Twitter, on the day of the sentencing, that Mr.
Tsarnaev was ``scum'' and ``trash'' and that he belonged in a ``dungeon
where he will be forgotten about until his time comes.''

The federal
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/us/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-death-sentence.html}{death
sentence that Mr. Tsarnaev received} was a rare event in Massachusetts,
which has no death penalty for state crimes, and has now been at least
temporarily revoked.

Mr. Tsarnaev's defense had argued that it was impossible to select an
impartial jury in Boston, a city that was gripped by powerful emotions
and deluged with pretrial publicity. But Judge O'Toole denied three
motions for a change of venue, arguing that he could select impartial
jurors.

``A core promise of our criminal justice system is that even the very
worst among us deserves to be fairly tried and lawfully punished,''
Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote for the appeals court.

``Despite a diligent effort, the judge here did not meet the standard
set by Patriarca,'' a rule that requires judges to investigate jurors'
exposure to pretrial publicity, the decision said.

The ruling went on to say that ``to be crystal clear,'' Mr. Tsarnaev is
still subject to multiple life sentences and ``will remain confined to
prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being
whether the government will end his life by executing him.''

Liz Norden, the mother of two men who lost legs in the bombings, said
the decision was a bitter disappointment.

``If this case didn't deserve the death penalty, what would?'' she said.
``He admitted to it. His attorney admitted to it. I'm in disbelief.''

A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling's office said
prosecutors were reviewing the opinion and had no comment. Prosecutors
could ask for a hearing from the full appeals court or go to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

But George Vien, a former federal prosecutor, said the appeals court
seemed to hold Judge O'Toole, whom he called a ``very experienced and
conscientious judge,'' to an impossible standard.

He said the judges applied the Patriarca rule ``in a way that required
something close to perfection,'' which he said was not the standard in
jury selection. ``The idea that he is going to be able to pick a jury
and monitor all their Twitter feeds is ridiculous, and it's
unrealistic.''

The backpack bombings near the finish line of one of the world's most
famous races killed three people and injured 260 more, many of them
grievously. Seventeen people lost limbs. A fourth person, a law
enforcement officer, was killed as Mr. Tsarnaev and his older brother,
Tamerlan, fled **** a few days later; Tamerlan
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/us/autopsy-says-boston-bombing-suspect-died-of-gunshot-wounds-and-blunt-trauma.html}{died
in a shootout with the police}.

At the appeals hearing in December, Mr. Tsarnaev's team zeroed in on
Judge O'Toole's decision not to further question two jurors who had
failed to disclose tweets and Facebook posts about the crime.

Juror 286, a restaurant manager who had been chosen as forewoman of the
jury, retweeted a post praising ``all of the law enforcement
professionals who went through hell to bring in that piece of garbage.''
Juror 138, who worked for the Peabody water department, had posted on
Facebook that he was in the jury pool for the case, prompting a friend
to comment that ``if you're really on jury duty, this guys got no shot
in hell.''

Prosecutors pushed back against those arguments, saying that Juror 138
``never endorsed'' the ``flippant and joking remarks'' left by his
friends on Facebook, and that Juror 286 may have failed to disclose her
Twitter posts because she misunderstood the instruction.

In the decision, the appeals court said the judge relied too heavily on
jurors' self-reporting whether they were biased.

``The judge qualified jurors who had already formed an opinion that
Dzhokhar was guilty --- and he did so in large part because they
answered `yes' to the question of whether they could decide this
high-profile case based on the evidence,'' Judge Thompson wrote, calling
it ``an error of law and so an abuse of discretion.''

The decision could have repercussions for how judges screen jurors in
death penalty trials, with greater attention to social media, said Carl
Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

``We may be seeing a different way in which to look at social media in
trying to seat a jury,'' he said. ``It may be that this was such a huge,
horrific case that it should not have been tried in Boston.''

The ruling also found that Judge O'Toole improperly excluded evidence
that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been involved in a triple murder in 2011,
which could have supported the defense's argument that he had dominated
and intimidated his younger brother.
