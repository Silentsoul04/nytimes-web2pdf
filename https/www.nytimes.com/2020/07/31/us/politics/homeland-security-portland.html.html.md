WASHINGTON — The acting secretary of homeland security said on Friday
that he had shut down an intelligence examination of the work of
reporters covering the government’s response to protests in Portland,
Ore., beginning an investigation into what he suggested was an
infringement on First Amendment rights.

The effort by the Department of Homeland Security’s intelligence and
analysis directorate — first revealed by [The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html)
— in part targeted [The New York Times’s
release](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/federal-agents-portland-seattle-protests.html)
of an intelligence analysis indicating that even as federal agents in
camouflage deployed to quell the protests in Portland, the
administration had little understanding of what it was facing.

The acting secretary, Chad F. Wolf, “is committed to ensuring that all
D.H.S. personnel uphold the principles of professionalism, impartiality
and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it
relates to the exercise of First Amendment rights,” said Alexei
Woltornist, the department’s spokesman.

The intelligence office issued three “open-source intelligence reports”
in the past week that summarized the Twitter posts of a Times reporter
and the editor in chief for the blog Lawfare, noting that they had
published leaked unclassified documents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Wolf ordered the intelligence arm to “immediately discontinue
collecting information involving members of the press" once he found out
about the practice, Mr. Woltornist said.

One of the primary responsibilities of the Department of Homeland
Security is sharing information about national security threats to
state, local and federal law enforcement agencies. The gaps in
communication about such threats were among the motivating factors in
creating a central cabinet department to coordinate security efforts
after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The department often distributes
reports to information-collecting “fusion centers,” which then
disseminate the intelligence to relevant agencies and police departments
across the United States.

But such efforts were intended to focus on those with connections to
terrorists or criminals, not journalists.

The directive comes as the agency and its leaders face backlash and
investigations for their actions in Portland, where tactical teams of
agents used tear gas and batons against protesters and forced
individuals into unmarked vehicles. Some in the large crowds have also
thrown rocks, bottles and commercial-grade fireworks at officers
guarding a federal courthouse in the city.

“This is highly disconcerting if true, which is why these things need to
be investigated,” said John Cohen, who used to run the intelligence
office during the Obama administration. “At the very least, they have a
perception problem because at no time should an intelligence community
organization be collecting and disseminating intelligence products on
U.S. journalists.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The politicization of intelligence or law enforcement activities is
highly problematic and there always has to be a separation between the
intelligence-gathering law enforcement activities from the political
agenda of the administration,” added Mr. Cohen, who was also a senior
adviser for the Bush administration.

It is not the first time the department has used resources to focus on
journalists. A Border Patrol agent, Jeffrey A. Rambo, [was the subject
of a federal
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/business/jeffrey-rambo-james-wolfe-leaks.html)
for obtaining the confidential travel records of a Washington journalist
and using them to press her about her sources in 2017.

Emails obtained from Customs and Border Protection by the Reporters
Committee and the Committee to Protect Journalists showed that Mr. Rambo
was in touch with the F.B.I. around the time that he pressured the
journalist, who now works for The Times.

The reports issued by the department in recent days summarized tweets by
Benjamin Wittes, the editor in chief of Lawfare, who had shared multiple
internal documents, including one post on July 24 showing a memo warning
intelligence officers not to leak to the press.

The reports also included another tweet by Mr. Wittes showing an email
from Brian Murphy, the current acting under secretary for intelligence
and analysis, telling officers to begin referring to individuals
attacking federal facilities in Portland as “VIOLENT ANTIFA ANARCHISTS.”

Mr. Murphy said he and other leaders in the intelligence office made the
conclusion after reviewing so-called baseball cards of arrested
protesters to understand their motivations. It came just days after
officers with [the department issued an intelligence
report](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/portland-intelligence-assessment/65e0a41de45b7abc/full.pdf)
saying the agency had “low confidence” that the attacks against the
federal courthouse reflected a broader threat.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We lack insight into the motives for the most recent attacks,” they
admitted in the briefing, which was first reported by The Times.

The Senate intelligence committee [sent a
letter](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/eaa5a194-d357-475b-a880-f7aae8437437/204A4D77A82B5684AF04EACAB1D37719.2020-07-31-intelligence-to-ia-murphy-letter.pdf)
on Friday to Mr. Murphy, pressing him for more information about the
matter.

Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The Times, said that it was
critical that the department not use such tactics on journalists.

“The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged that its
intelligence reporting system, designed to combat terrorism, has instead
been misused to target journalists who were reporting on the
controversial activities of federal law enforcement officers,” she said
in a statement. “It is imperative that D.H.S.’s investigation determines
how this happened and ensures it does not happen again.”

Mr. Wittes said there was nothing wrong with the agency sharing
information about his tweets, noting that it prepared daily news
clippings. “But to frame it as intelligence work product is a really odd
thing,” he said.

“If you’re allowed to do this, what else are you allowed to do? If
you’re allowed to keep tabs on and file reports about my social
media,” he added, “are you allowed to gather all the other public
record material that exists about me and create a dossier?”

The American Civil Liberties Union denounced the agency’s actions on
Friday, saying they were part of a larger pattern.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Under Wolf’s leadership, D.H.S. was [caught just last
year](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/freedom-press/government-detaining-and-interrogating-journalists-and-advocates-us)
unconstitutionally targeting and building dossiers on journalists
reporting on conditions at the border,” the group’s senior legislative
counsel, Neema Signh Guliani, said in a statement. “For weeks, D.H.S.
agents have been deliberately and brutally attacking journalists
covering the Portland protests. And documents show that D.H.S.
intelligence arm appears to be claiming authority it does not have. This
administration’s assault on the First Amendment continues to escalate.”

Gabe Rottman, a lawyer at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, said that the department’s focus on journalists had broader
implications.

“Federal law prohibits the creation of ‘dossiers’ on journalists
precisely because doing so can morph into investigations of journalists
for news coverage that embarrasses the government, but that the public
has a right to know,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Woltornist said Mr. Wolf found out about the practice from news
reports on Thursday night, prompting former officials to question the
stability of leadership in the agency. The Department of Homeland
Security has not had a Senate-confirmed secretary since President Trump
[ousted Kirstjen Nielsen in
April 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/us/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-dhs-resigns.html).

“I’m concerned that what’s happening is there’s a lack of control and
when there’s a lot of turnover, it takes a while to learn the DNA of the
department,” said Michael Chertoff, a former secretary for homeland
security under President George W. Bush. “It’s very hard to get a hold
of the various components.”

Zolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Washington, and Marc Tracy from New
York.
