China}\label{us-adds-sanctions-over-internment-of-muslims-in-china}}

The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a powerful government
entity that runs companies and farms in the Xinjiang region, where
officials carry out the mass internment of Muslims.

WASHINGTON --- The Trump administration announced sanctions Friday on a
powerful government entity and two senior officials who have helped
manage it, citing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politics/china-uighurs-arrest.html}{systemic
human rights abuses} against
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/asia/uighur-muslims-china-detainment.html}{predominantly
Muslim ethnic minorities} in the Xinjiang region in China's far
northwest.

The sanctions, imposed by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control, name the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/asia/07xinjiang.html}{Xinjiang
Production and Construction Corps}, an economic and paramilitary
organization that plays
\href{https://www.andrewerickson.com/2019/11/the-xinjiang-production-construction-corps-key-policy-tool-from-mao-to-xi/}{a
central role} in the development of the Xinjiang region, and two
associated officials, Peng Jiarui and Sun Jinlong. The order is designed
to prevent them from accessing American property and the financial
system, as well as to ban any economic transactions between them and
American companies and citizens.

``The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its
financial powers to hold human rights abusers accountable in Xinjiang
and across the world,'' Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said
in a statement.

The sanctions most likely will have little or no practical impact on Mr.
Peng, the deputy party secretary and commander of the development group,
and Mr. Sun, one of its former political commissars. It was not
immediately clear what effect they would have on trade and international
commerce done by the group, which oversees some state-run companies that
export products such as tomato paste.

The group's direct exports to the United States were worth \$43 million
in 2018, the most recent year for which detailed official data were
available. Much more of its crops and other raw materials may end up
processed by Chinese companies for exports that are not counted under
the group's numbers.

In particular, the group is a big cotton grower. Last year, it produced
\href{http://www.xjbt.gov.cn/c/2020-04-26/7346731.shtml?ad_check=1}{two
million metric tons of cotton}, about a third of China's
\href{http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/zxfb/201912/t20191217_1718007.html}{total
production}, according to official statistics. In 2018, its direct
imports from the United States were worth \$102 million.

Ties between the United States and China have been fraying as the Trump
administration takes an increasingly hard line on China's handling of
the initial
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus}{coronavirus}
outbreak, its growing repression in Hong Kong, its maritime claims and
miliary expansionism in the South China Sea, its efforts to export 5G
next-generation telecommunications equipment and its systemic abuses of
largely Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

The Chinese government has carried out a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html}{campaign
of mass detentions} in Xinjiang, placing one million or more members of
the Uighur ethnic group and others into large internment camps that aim
to indoctrinate the detainees with propaganda about the Communist Party
and eradicate core parts of their Muslim and Uighur identities.

From 2018 onward, senior administration officials
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/world/asia/us-china-sanctions-muslim-camps.html}{debated
whether and how to punish China} for the abuses.

China hawks in the administration blamed Mr. Trump and top economic
advisers, including Mr. Mnuchin, for holding back on sanctions in order
to avoid jeopardizing trade talks with China and to cozy up to Xi
Jinping, the Chinese leader. But now, as the pandemic roils the United
States and endangers the president's prospects of re-election, Mr. Trump
has begun to sour on maintaining cordial relations with China, and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/world/asia/us-china-trump-xi.html}{the
hawks have greater leeway} to pursue tougher actions on China and to try
to set the two nations
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/podcasts/the-daily/china-trump-foreign-policy.html}{on
a long-term course for confrontation}.

Mr. Trump's campaign strategists have also urged him to attack China in
an attempt to turn the spotlight away from
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html}{the
president's failures on the pandemic and the economy}.

``Today's designations are the latest U.S. government action in an
ongoing effort to deter human rights abuse in the Xinjiang region,''
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the most vocal of the China hawks, said
in a statement on Friday.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/asia/07xinjiang.html}{Xinjiang
Production and Construction Corps} was founded in 1954 as a group
entwined with the People's Liberation Army that would oversee the
deployment of large numbers of ethnic Han citizens, many of them
military veterans, to Xinjiang to build farms, factories and towns that
would allow China to consolidate control of the important border region
and the many ethnic minority groups there.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

As of 2009, the group, which reports directly to Beijing, had an annual
output of goods and services of \$7 billion, and the settlements and
entities overseen by the bingtuan, or soldiers corps, included five
cities, 180 farming communities and 1,000 companies. They also run their
own courts, universities and media organizations.

On July 9, the United States
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/asia/trump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html}{imposed
sanctions} on four Chinese officials associated with Xinjiang policy,
including Chen Quanguo, the party chief of the region and a member of
the Chinese Communist Party's 25-member ruling Politburo. That move was
largely symbolic, but it sent a stronger message than an
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/business/china-human-rights-technology-xinjiang.html}{October
2019 action} in which the administration placed 28 Chinese companies and
police departments deemed to be associated with Xinjiang abuses on a
blacklist that forbids American companies from selling technology and
other goods to them without a license. At that time, the State
Department also announced visa restrictions on some Chinese officials.

On July 20, the Trump administration
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/business/economy/china-sanctions-uighurs-labor.html}{added
11 new Chinese entities}, including companies supplying major American
brands like Apple, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, to the list that
restricts them from purchasing American products, saying the firms were
complicit in human rights violations in Xinjiang. That brought to 48 the
total number of Chinese companies and security units on the U.S. entity
list for violations related to Xinjiang.

On July 1, the administration warned businesses with supply chains that
run through Xinjiang to consider the reputational, economic and legal
risks of doing so.

The Associated Press
\href{https://apnews.com/fff5fc7925f09916bf6b9d5f79bb4132}{reported} on
July 3 that agents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in New York had
seized 13 tons of hair weaves and other beauty products suspected of
having been made by detainees in a Xinjiang internment camp. The
products were worth an estimated \$800,000. In May, the agency conducted
a seizure of similar products that were being imported by companies in
Georgia and Texas, to be sold to salons and individuals across the
United States.
