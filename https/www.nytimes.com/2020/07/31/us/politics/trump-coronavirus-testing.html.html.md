# Trump’s Coronavirus Testing Chief Concedes a Lag in Test Results

With the reopening plans of schools and businesses hinging on rapid test
results, the Trump administration’s testing czar says a two- to
three-day turnaround “is not possible.”

WASHINGTON — With schools, universities and businesses pinning their
hopes for reopening on rapid coronavirus testing, the Trump
administration’s testing czar told Congress on Friday that getting test
results within two to three days “is not a possible benchmark we can
achieve today.”

But even that sober assessment from Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the assistant
secretary for health, most likely did not fully reflect the mounting
frustration among patients and health professionals just as the school
year struggles to get started.

During a lengthy House hearing with top government health officials, Dr.
Giroir told lawmakers that the nation was averaging about 820,000 tests
daily, up from 550,000 earlier this month. But the raw numbers belie the
testing crunch that officials around the country are facing amid soaring
caseloads, particularly in the South and West.

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Turnaround times are definitely improving,” Dr. Giroir insisted, adding
that it was “very atypical” to wait more than 12 days for results.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But many researchers are still grappling with severe shortages of the
testing supplies needed to collect samples from patients and process
them in laboratories. That leaves state and local officials without
information they need to make critical health decisions, and it creates
lags in contact tracing — a necessary tool for controlling the
pandemic’s spread.

“We’re doing so many tests, sometimes it takes seven to 10 days to get
the results back,” Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida noted on Friday evening
in a briefing there with President Trump.

Coronavirus testing is essential to opening the economy and getting
people back to work and school, but it is almost useless if long lag
times keep people unnecessarily quarantined for days or allow them to
spread the virus while they await their results.

Dr. Giroir insisted that over all, 59 percent of tests report results
within three days, and 76 percent within five.

“I’m sure there’s an outlier at 12 to 16 days because that happens,” he

Dr. Giroir’s comments, during a hearing of the House Select Subcommittee
on the Coronavirus Crisis, were met with puzzlement by public health
experts, who say testing shortages persist. In some places, tests cannot
be processed at all because of a lack of reagents — the chemicals needed
to detect whether the virus is present — or lab capacity.

And anxious patients around the country paint a far bleaker picture.
Shawn Jain, who was tested along with several family members on July 7
in Nashville, waited 16 days for his results after they were processed
by Quest Diagnostics. Some of his family members still have not heard
back.

“I honestly thought they had lost the test,” said Mr. Jain, who tested
negative for the virus. He added, “It made me feel like, well if in the
future I do worry I have it, I can’t even rely on something as basic as
testing.”

On Friday, the [National Institutes of Health
announced](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-delivering-new-covid-19-testing-technologies-meet-us-demand)
awards totaling $248.7 million for seven companies to ramp up test
production and deliver millions more weekly tests as early as September.
The N.I.H. director, Dr. Francis Collins, described the announcement as
the “first of more awards to come.” Three of the tests are simple enough
to deliver results in 30 minutes or less.

At the hearing, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said again that a safe and
effective coronavirus vaccine would most likely be ready by the end of
this year or early next, and cast doubt on efforts by Russia and China.

“I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the
vaccine before they’re administering the vaccine to anyone,” Dr. Fauci
said.

will not come soon enough for the fall semester at universities and
colleges around the country. Many have decided to transition to online
classes in part because administrators cannot be assured that enough
testing will be available to keep students, faculty and staff safe.

“Covid-19 testing capacity and delays in reporting results remain a
challenge,” Sylvia M. Burwell, a health secretary in the Obama
administration who is now the president of American University, [wrote
this
week](https://www.american.edu/president/announcements/july-30-2020.cfm),
in announcing that there would be “no residential experience” for
students this fall.

“The ability to test and support contact tracing is critical to reducing
community spread of Covid-19,” she added, “and the ambiguity in this
area presents a significant hurdle for all.”

Other colleges were in the same position.

“The increased spread of the virus nationwide, the impact that this
resurgence has had on the availability of testing supplies needed to
satisfy our testing protocols, and the strong national trend of rising
rates of infection in younger populations lead us to conclude that our
community is best served by maintaining social distancing in miles
rather than feet,” Alison R. Byerly, the president of Lafayette College
in Pennsylvania, wrote last week.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

Democrats seized on reports of testing delays to demand a national
testing strategy.

“We once again call upon the president to get serious about this — no,
testing is not overrated,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters as the
hearing was underway.

Testing delays hurt efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
Diagnostic tests reflect only a person’s health status on the day a
sample is collected. While those who visit testing sites are typically
told to quarantine at home while they await their results, that advice
becomes harder to take the longer people are forced to wait — especially
for those who work essential jobs that cannot be done remotely.

“It is an issue if you can’t get it within a 24-to-48-hour period,” Dr.
Fauci said.

And diagnostic tests alone are not enough. Experts say that in order to
stop the pandemic, the country will have to expand testing in the
broader community — not just to identify sick people, but to assess the
prevalence of disease in the general population and to catch
asymptomatic people who might be unknowingly carrying the virus.

About half of all coronavirus tests, Dr. Giroir said, are conducted in
so-called point-of-care settings — like doctor’s offices or urgent care
clinics, without the need to route samples through laboratories — or
hospitals. Point-of-care tests, intended to be fast and simple enough to
obviate the need for specialized equipment or highly trained personnel,
can yield results in 15 minutes, he said, while hospital tests take
around a day.

The remainder of coronavirus tests are conducted by large-scale
commercial laboratory companies, like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics,
which are strained near their limits.

This month, Daniel Larremore, a mathematician and infectious disease
modeler at the University of Colorado, Boulder, collected data about
testing delays via an [informal survey on
Twitter](https://larremorelab.github.io/covid19testgroup), showing that
residents in multiple states were experiencing prolonged test result
turnaround times.

What is more, turnaround times do not reflect “how long it takes for
people to get a test in the first place, and how convenient it is to get
the testing done,” Dr. Larremore said. He also pointed out that many
places were still prioritizing patients with symptoms for testing.

But mounting evidence suggests that about 40 percent of coronavirus
infections could present without symptoms entirely. Tests are also still
failing to reach many of those who need it the most, including
communities marginalized by race and ethnicity, who have been
[disproportionately affected by the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html).

Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease
Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the
administration needed a “national dashboard for testing” where data was
collected and made publicly available.

“We need to know how many people are tested, by which test, how long
does it take to get a result back and where there is testing capacity
available, but they can’t be done because there is an absence of reagent
or other critical components,” he said.

While the country’s capacity for testing has certainly increased, Dr.
Larremore said, “That doesn’t mean that we are where we need to be —
just that we’re continuing to accelerate.”

Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from Washington, and Katherine J. Wu from
Boston.
