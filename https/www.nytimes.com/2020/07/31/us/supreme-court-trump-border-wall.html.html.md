# Supreme Court Lets Trump Keep Building His Border Wall

The court refused to lift a year-old stay notwithstanding an appeals
court ruling that the construction was unlawful.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday [rejected a
request](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a60_bqm1.pdf)
from environmental groups to stop construction of President Trump’s
border wall while the administration seeks review of an appeals court
loss.

The vote was 5 to 4, with the court’s more conservative members in the
majority. Its brief order was unsigned and gave no reasons, which is
typical when the court acts on emergency applications.

In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote that he feared that the
court’s action effectively decided the case before the justices even
considered whether to hear the administration’s appeal. Justices Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent.

A year ago, by the same 5-to-4 vote, the court [allowed the
administration](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/19a60_o75p.pdf)
to start using $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to build the wall on the
southwestern border while the case moved forward in the lower courts. In
June, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, [ruled against the
administration](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/06/26/19-16102.pdf),
saying Congress had not authorized the spending.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the Supreme Court’s earlier order allowing the construction remains
in place and will not expire until the court either denies the
administration’s petition seeking review or agrees to hear the
administration’s appeal and rules on it.

On July 22, the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities
Coalition, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, [asked the
justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A60/148405/20200722140912601_2020.07.21%20stay%20lift%20motion%20FINAL.pdf)
to lift their earlier stay. The alternative, the groups said, was to
allow the administration to run out the litigation clock and complete
construction in Arizona, California and New Mexico even in the face of
an appeals court ruling that the work was unlawful.

The administration’s deadline for filing its appeal is 150 days from the
appeals court’s judgment. As a practical matter, the environmental
groups told the court, the disputed portions of the wall would be built
before the administration had to file its petition seeking review, in
late
November.

“A stay should be just that: a stay,” the brief said. “Not a victory for
the party that has lost ** before every court that has adjudicated the
wall’s legality.”

[In
response](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A60/148956/20200729131434023_19A60%20Sierra%20Club%20-%20Govt%20Opp%20to%20Motion%20to%20Lift%20Stay%20-%20final.pdf),
Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting solicitor general, said nothing of
significance had changed since the Supreme Court issued its stay last
year.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He added that the administration planned to file its petition by Aug. 7,
far ahead of the deadline. That would allow the justices to consider
whether to hear the case at their first private conference after their
summer break, on Sept. 29.

In a [second
brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A60/149072/20200730130006392_2020.07.30%20stay%20lift%20reply%20FINAL.pdf),
the environmental groups said that the quicker timeline contemplated by
the government was too slow and “still means that they will complete the
very border wall construction in dispute before this court can hear
argument on the case, much less render a decision.”

“Only by lifting the stay will the court ensure that it will have the
opportunity to resolve plaintiffs’ claims on the merits before the wall
is built,” the brief said.

The Supreme Court’s earlier order was unsigned and only one paragraph
long, but it indicated that the groups challenging the administration
may not have a legal right to do so. That suggested that the court’s
conservative majority was likely to side with the administration in the
end.

The lawsuit arose from Mr. Trump’s efforts to make good on a campaign
promise to build the barrier. In early 2019, he [declared a national
emergency along the Mexican
border](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html?module=inline).
The declaration followed a two-month impasse with Congress over funding
to build the wall, a standoff that gave rise to the [longest partial
government
shutdown](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/09/us/politics/longest-government-shutdown.html)
in the nation’s history.

After Congress appropriated only a fraction of what Mr. Trump had
sought, he announced that he would act unilaterally to spend billions
more.

Soon after, the environmental groups sued to stop the president’s plan
to use money meant for military programs to build barriers along the
border in what he said was an effort to combat drug trafficking.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Judge Haywood S. Gilliam
Jr.](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/gilliam-haywood-stirling-jr), of
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, blocked the effort in [a
pair](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6026005/California-Border-Wall-20190524.pdf)
of
[decisions](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6177180/Sierra-Club-Ruling.pdf)
that said the statute the administration had relied on to justify the
transfer did not authorize it.

“The case is not about whether the challenged border barrier
construction plan is wise or unwise,” [Judge Gilliam
wrote](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6026005/California-Border-Wall-20190524.pdf).
“It is not about whether the plan is the right or wrong policy response
to existing conditions at the southern border of the United States.
Instead, this case presents strictly legal questions regarding whether
the proposed plan for funding border barrier construction exceeds the
executive branch’s lawful authority.”

The Ninth Circuit affirmed Judge Gilliam’s injunction, saying that “the
Constitution delegates exclusively to Congress the power of the purse.”

“The executive branch lacked independent constitutional authority to
authorize the transfer of funds,” Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote for the
majority. “Therefore, the transfer of funds here was unlawful.”

In their first brief, the environmental groups urged the Supreme Court
to act before it was too late.

“Although some of plaintiffs’ injuries can be reversed by taking down
the unlawful construction,” the brief said, “much of the damage
defendants are inflicting on the borderlands will be beyond repair.”

In a statement after the court acted on Friday, Dror Ladin, a lawyer
with the A.C.L.U., said “the fight continues.”

“We’ll be back before the Supreme Court soon to put a stop to Trump’s
xenophobic border wall once and for all,” he said. “The administration
has admitted that the wall can be taken down if we ultimately prevail,
and we will hold them to their word and seek the removal of every mile
of unlawful wall
built.”
