# Gambling on College Football Almost Fixed My Dysfunctional Family

If Covid takes the football season away from us, we’re in danger of
losing the bond we’ve taken so many years to
build.

My first mistake was feeling sorry for him.

The first season my brother and I bet on college football against each
other, I beat him so badly I often bragged I could have lost every
single game we gambled on for the rest of the decade and still finished
in the money.

Each week, we would agree to disagree on five games across the N.C.A.A.
schedule. Each win was worth a dollar. Whoever won the most games of the
five we selected cashed an additional five bucks. Best out of five,
winner takes all for a maximum potential profit of $10 for the weekend.

He couldn’t have owed me more than $100 — we weren’t kids anymore,
making outrageous wagers on games of blackjack at the kitchen table
neither of us could have paid off in three lifetimes — but I still
didn’t have the heart to make him pay up.

The next year, after torching him a second season in a row, I gave him a
book as a joke — “Handicapping College Football for Beginners,” which he
told me he relegated to the washroom magazine basket.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I didn’t realize it then, but he was setting me up.

Later he admitted to reading it every chance he got. Studying. Formulas,
strategies, all of it. By season three, he cleaned my clock. Our father
soon inserted himself into the competition, which, over the past almost
20 years, came to represent our relationship: We went from being a
dysfunctional trio of man-children who didn’t have the language to
express our feelings to discovering that our mutual love of competition
and one-upmanship gave us the language we needed to reconnect.

And then came the coronavirus.

As of June, in response to concerns over the coronavirus, the N.C.A.A.
Division I Football Oversight Committee
[announced](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29325130/ncaa-division-council-approves-six-week-practice-plan-football)
their approval of a plan that would allow teams to transition from
voluntary workouts to mandatory meetings and preseason camps — just like
any other year. But by the end of July,[five Division I conferences had
canceled their
seasons](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/covid-19-college-football-conferences-canceled-season-2020/19mroowdygu9z1tv54mul2vxgw)
outright. Others, in a last-ditch effort to play *something* in 2020,
are leaning toward playing “[conference only” or “plus one”
schedules](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sec-acc-big-12-considering-plus-one-scheduling-model-with-shortened-2020-season-becoming-an-inevitability/)
to minimize travel and mitigate risk. The closer we got to August, the
more it seemed that Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been clear in his
position from the outset, may have been right after all: “[Football may
not
happen](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/football-happen-fauci-spt-trnd/index.html)
this year.”

My little brother and I remain hopeful that won’t be the case. Five
years apart, we were never especially close. Growing up, I’d put him
through the
wringer.

When I was 8, and he was 3, I nearly took his eye out with a dead tree
branch. He still has a scar above his brow. In high school, my friends
and I would wrestle him to the ground, strip him down to his Fruit of
the Looms, force him onto the front lawn, and make him run around the
block in his skivvies before we let him back in the house. He still
delights in telling that story to showcase what kind of brother I was,
but there are plenty of other examples. I’ve made Baby Bro steal beer
from a convenience store ice cooler, thrown him in the trunk of a
friend’s car and done doughnuts in a snowy church parking lot, and run
him over with a golf cart.

As adults, even when we both became dads, we weren’t doing much better,
and I felt guilty. College football seemed like a good way to connect.
But I had no idea what I was in for. It was payback time, and every win
he tallied was sweet revenge.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Hey. Who’s winning this week?” he would call any Saturday he was ahead,
pretending not to know.

“Really,” I’d say. “You know good and well who’s winning.”

As much as I hated losing, I did my best to be happy for him.

The kid was due.

When he won in Season Four, evening the series at 2-2, I wasn’t bothered
(much), and I wasn’t all that surprised either. After all, we’d both
been raised in the same ultracompetitive, winner-takes-all environment.

Our dad never let us win at anything when we were kids. Not golf, not Go
Fish. I tell myself now, he only wanted his boys to succeed — his desire
to win was that great — but to say that my dad was an *enthusiastic*
spectator was putting it mildly.

Looking back, I imagine in my dad’s mind he was only teaching us to be
tough, to never quit or back down — it was the 1970s and ’80s when a
spanking was considered a valuable life lesson. So, it made sense after
watching our competition from the sidelines for a couple of years the
old man wanted in.

“You donkeys worried I’ll beat you too badly?” my dad goaded my brother
one summer afternoon as he casually flipped through the pages of his
Street & Smith’s “College Football Annual.”

I knew this was going to be a problem.

The man loved sports almost as much as he loved being right, which was
*a lot*. Not only did we have to mastermind a way to manage a
three-person, round robin format, but also keep our heads as my father
continued what he’d done our entire childhood: reveling in every moment
he won.

After every victory he took great pains to remind us, it would be a
*long* time before we beat him at anything.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

We showed we cared by needling each other unmercifully anytime one of us
wound up on the wrong end of the point spread.

Like the year my dad gave my brother and me second and third place
medals to make sure we didn’t forget who had come out on top that
season.

Or when visiting my parents once, my father introduced me to friends of
his and my mother’s as “the one who finished in last place” the year
before.

I still don’t know half of what I should about my brother, or agree with
all the things he believes in. But I’m learning. That ratio skews much
higher when it comes to my dad. I’ve realized my brother, dad and I
aren’t all that different. We all want to be heard, each of us wants
to be seen, and above all, each of us wants to win. After almost 20
years of this, our bonds are stronger than ever.

As disappointing as the prospect may be, whether college football
happens this year or not, at least now I have a reason to call.

The bonds we’ve worked so hard to build — even if they’ve come from
trash talking each other over our latest win-loss records — are in
danger of being lost. If Covid takes that away from us, we’ll just have
to find something else to fight, I mean, connect over.
