# Zimbabwe Locks Down Capital, Thwarting Planned Protests

</div>

Three years after the fall of the strongman Robert Mugabe, the country
is in free fall and his successor is clamping down by arresting
opposition activists — including an author just nominated for the Booker
Prize.

HARARE, Zimbabwe — When Robert Mugabe was ousted as president of
Zimbabwe in [a coup
in 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/world/africa/zimbabwe-mugabe-mnangagwa.html),
many in the country hoped for an end to the repression and mismanagement
that had characterized his 37 years in office.

But when protesters tried to gather on Friday in the capital, Harare,
the security services reacted in a manner reminiscent of the Mugabe era.
They shut down most of the city, arrested several government critics and
forced more than a dozen others into hiding — highlighting how the
country has, in the eyes of the opposition, slipped from bad to worse
under Mr. Mugabe’s successor, [President Emmerson
Mnangagwa](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/africa/zimbabwe-president-emmerson-mnangagwa-mugabe.html).

Mr. Mnangagwa took power on a promise of renewal, but his critics
associate him with the same excesses that defined Mr. Mugabe’s legacy:
[authoritarian
rule](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/world/africa/zimbabwe-protests-emmerson-mnangagwa.html),
financial missteps, rampant graft, [plummeting living
standards](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/world/africa/zimbabwe-water-crisis.html)
and a teetering economy.

“In reality, there is nothing new,” said Obey Sithole, a leading
opposition campaigner who went into hiding days before the planned
protests. “Instead, we have seen the perfection of the art of
repression.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the government’s halting response to the coronavirus pandemic, which
has exposed the awful state of the country’s health care system and led
to further allegations of corruption, has fueled widespread anger.

[In an interview with The Times last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/africa/zimbabwe-president-emmerson-mnangagwa-mugabe.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article),
Mr. Mnangagwa, 77, described himself as a leader with a “new
dispensation.” But in some respects, Mr. Mnangagwa — a veteran of the
guerrilla war that ended white-minority rule, and one of Mr. Mugabe’s
most trusted sidekicks — has proved to be an even harsher president than
Mr. Mugabe.

The number of opposition activists charged with a form of treason during
Mr. Mnangagwa’s three years in office is already higher than during Mr.
Mugabe’s entire tenure, according to research by a coalition of 22
Zimbabwean rights groups.

Opposition activists hoped to hold mass rallies on Friday, partly in
response to a new wave of arrests and abductions that began in May, when
three female opposition activists, including a lawmaker, were abducted,
beaten and sexually assaulted by people they say were plainclothes
government agents. (The government denied involvement and, after being
treated in hospital, the women were charged with false accusations.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Mnangagwa’s government refused to allow even this largely
symbolic expression of dissent.

To deter protesters in the prelude to the demonstrations, the police
seized the leader of an opposition group who had been helping to
organize the rally and a prominent investigative journalist who had
helped reveal a possible corruption scheme involving the country’s
health minister, Obadiah Moyo. More than a dozen opposition politicians,
activists and union leaders, including Mr. Sithole, then went into
hiding after the police named them on a wanted
list.

And on Friday, the police deployed personnel across the city, shutting
down most major transit routes and deterring most would-be protesters
from gathering. Several of those who did try to assemble said that they
had been detained, including the author Tsitsi Dangarembga, three days
after her novel “This Mournable Body” was [longlisted for the Booker
Prize](https://thebookerprizes.com/books/mournable-body-by-tsitsi-dangarembga),
a prestigious British literary award.

“During President Mugabe’s era, there were serious, gross human rights
violations,” said Robson Chere, the head of a major teachers’ union, and
one of those now in hiding. “But the current so-called new dispensation
has gone several gears up.”

The situation has led to tensions within Mr. Mnangagwa’s political
party. A party official was fired this week after being accused of
helping to promote the protests, and the government itself has been
forced to deny that the military that brought Mr. Mnangagwa to power was
now seeking to oust him.

Those hoping to demonstrate on Friday had an extra grievance — Mr.
Mnangagwa’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which critics see as
reflective of his government’s wider faults.

Already close to collapse before the pandemic, hospitals lack enough
drugs, ventilators, personal protection equipment and staff, because
many doctors and nurses have moved abroad in search of better pay or
gone on strike to protest their low wages.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Police officers have used coronavirus restrictions as a pretext to
arrest the government’s political opponents, according to Zimbabwe
Lawyers for Human Rights, a watchdog group based in Harare.

Mr. Moyo, the health minister, was fired in July after buying
coronavirus supplies at inflated prices through a multimillion-dollar
contract with an obscure foreign firm that was signed without the
approval of the relevant state authorities, according to court
documents.

Mr. Moyo, who has yet to be replaced, was arrested and is on trial.

“The system has collapsed under our president,” said Dr. Peter
Magombeyi, a former head of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, a
labor union. “We are noticing that there are no doctors, there are no
nurses, there are no drugs, not enough personal protective equipment, no
hospital C.E.O.s, no health care minister.”

The leadership of Mr. Mnangagwa’s party had urged supporters to “take
on” the protesters, and attempted to portray the possibility of
demonstrations as a Western plot.

“None of it is coming from Zimbabweans,” said Tafadzwa Mugwadi, the
party’s director of information.

Another party official, Patrick Chinamasa, said that the American
ambassador to Zimbabwe, Brian A. Nichols, might be expelled from the
country, after the U.S. Embassy [issued a series of
tweets](https://twitter.com/usembassyharare/status/1285856222579699713?s=20)
criticizing some of the arrests this month.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Chinamasa said at a news briefing on Monday that if Mr. Nichols were
to continue “engaging in acts of mobilizing and funding disturbances,
coordinating violence and training fighters,” then “our leadership will
not hesitate to give him marching
orders.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The situation is compounded by international sanctions on Zimbabwean
individuals and institutions, which are potential obstacles to loans
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Dr. Magombeyi, the former doctors’ union head, provoked widespread
horror this week when he shared an image on social media of what he said
were the corpses of seven stillborn infants at a single hospital in
Harare. Citing doctors at the hospital, Dr. Magombeyi said that the
seven had all died on the same night, after a staffing shortage caused
delays to their mothers’ prenatal care.

Stagnant wages and rampant inflation have made basic medicines
unaffordable to most patients.

In June, the annual inflation rate was more than 700 percent, devaluing
salaries and making common household goods beyond the reach of many
citizens. Since the end of Mr. Mugabe’s rule, which was itself marked by
profound economic upheaval, the cost of a loaf of bread has risen
roughly 70-fold, turning it from a staple into a
luxury.

In recent months, the country’s electricity crisis has ebbed: Most
households no longer face daily power outages, partly because the
coronavirus restrictions have caused a drop in demand.

But Zimbabweans still face daily water shortages. Parts of Harare
receive running water only once or twice a week, forcing many to line up
for hours at wells, springs and streams.

Against this backdrop, Mr. Mnangagwa caused further anger this week by
announcing a plan to raise $3.5 billion through government bond sales to
compensate white farmers who were violently expelled from their land
under Mr. Mugabe. But there has been no similarly ambitious plan to
finance improvements to the health system or water infrastructure.

“We have suffered enough,” said Denis Chengeto, a 55-year-old unemployed
teacher, speaking ahead of the protests on Thursday. “We have a
government that doesn’t care.”

But after the government locked down the city on Friday, Mr. Chengeto
said he was now too frightened to protest.

“Nobody may hear my voice today,” he said on Friday. “I know soldiers
won’t hesitate to shoot at anyone if we go on the streets.”

Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare; and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.
