# Hong Kong Delays Election, Citing Coronavirus. The Opposition Isn’t Buying It.

HONG KONG — The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it would
postpone the city’s September legislative election by one year because
of the coronavirus pandemic, a decision seen by the pro-democracy
opposition as a brazen attempt to thwart its electoral momentum and
avoid the defeat of pro-Beijing candidates.

“It is a really tough decision to delay, but we want to ensure fairness,
public safety and public health,” said Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief
executive.

She cited the risk of infections, with as many as three million or more
people expected to vote on the same day; the inability of candidates to
hold campaign events due to social distancing rules; and the
difficulties faced by eligible voters who are overseas or in mainland
China and cannot return to cast ballots because of travel restrictions.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The delay was a blow to opposition politicians, who had hoped to ride to
victory in the fall on a wave of deep-seated dissatisfaction with the
government and concerns about a sweeping new national security law
imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong. And it was the latest in a quick series
of aggressive moves by the pro-Beijing establishment that had the effect
of sidelining the pro-democracy movement.

On Thursday, [12 pro-democracy candidates said they had been barred from
running](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/asia/hong-kong-arrests-security-law.html),
including four sitting lawmakers and several prominent activists like
Joshua Wong. Mr. Wong said he was barred in part because of his
criticism of the new security law.

“Clearly it is the largest election fraud in \#HK’s history,” Mr. Wong
[wrote on

The explanation that Hong Kong must delay the vote because of the
pandemic is likely to fall flat among the wider public, said Ma Ngok, an
associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of
Hong Kong.

“I think it will be seen as a kind of manipulation, that the government
is afraid of losing the majority and that is why they postponed the
election,” he said.

Mrs. Lam denied that the decision had been influenced by political
concerns. “It is purely on the basis of protecting the health and safety
of the Hong Kong people and to ensure that the elections are held in a
fair and open manner,” she said.

While Hong Kong has been a world leader in controlling the coronavirus,
in recent days it has seen its worst surge of infections yet, with more
than 100 new cases reported daily for more than a week. The government
has unfurled several new lockdown and social-distancing
[measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/world/asia/hongkong-dining-lunch-coronavirus.html).

“We face a dire situation in our fight against the virus,” Mrs. Lam
said.

Under Hong Kong law, an election can be delayed for up to 14 days if
there is a “danger to public health or safety.” But Mrs. Lam postponed
the election until Sept. 5, 2021, under emergency powers that allow the
chief executive to make any regulations considered to be “desirable in
the public interest.”

Those powers, which date to the British colonial era, were invoked last
year when the government [banned the wearing of masks in an effort to
stem
protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/world/asia/hong-kong-emergency-powers.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s central government said it supported Mrs. Lam’s decision to
delay the election, [the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported](https://xhpfmapi.zhongguowangshi.com/vh512/share/9292212).

Mrs. Lam acknowledged that the move created a “rather thorny issue”
under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution, which limits the terms of
Legislative Council members to four years — meaning that the current
lawmakers’ terms will soon expire.

That matter will be referred to the standing committee of the National
People’s Congress in Beijing, which has the power to interpret the Basic
Law, for a decision on how to deal with the gap, Xinhua
reported.

The postponement will likely be met with criticism from the United
States and other countries that have expressed sharp disapproval of
China’s tightening grip on Hong Kong. [This month, President Trump
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/politics/trump-hong-kong-china-WHO.html)
that because of the national security law, the United States would begin
to curb its special treatment of Hong Kong and deal with it more in line
with the rest of China.

The elections “must proceed on time,” [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
said](https://www.state.gov/secretary-michael-r-pompeo-with-simon-conway-of-the-joe-pags-show/)
on Thursday in a U.S. radio interview. “They must be held. The people of
Hong Kong deserve to have their voice represented by the elected
officials that they choose in those elections.”

“If they destroy that, if they take that down, it will be another marker
that will simply prove that the Chinese Communist Party has now made
Hong Kong just another Communist-run city,” he added.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said
on Friday that the Hong Kong election was “a local election in China and
is purely China’s internal affair.”

The national security law targets activity that it describes as
secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. It
has stirred concerns in Hong Kong because it allows mainland security
services to operate openly in the city and makes some speech, such as
advocating Hong Kong’s independence,
illegal.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

On Wednesday, in a sign that officials would strictly enforce the
law,[the police arrested four activists, ages 16
to 21,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/asia/hong-kong-arrests-security-law.html)who
were accused of supporting separatism in social media posts.

And the next day, in barring the 12 opposition candidates, the Hong Kong
government said that the grounds for disqualifying them included
advocating for Hong Kong’s independence or self-determination,
soliciting intervention from foreign governments, expressing an
objection in principle to the national security law Beijing imposed last
month, or vowing to indiscriminately vote against government proposals.

Opposition candidates say the moves suggested that pro-Beijing officials
were concerned about a resounding defeat in the September election. Even
establishment candidates have been quietly discussing the potential for
a pan-democratic wave.

Elections for neighborhood-level offices, [held last
November,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/asia/hong-kong-election-results.html)
were seen as a warning: The opposition took control of 17 out of 18
district councils, which had normally been controlled by pro-Beijing
parties.

This year, the opposition set its sights on a bigger target: to take at
least half the 70 seats in the Legislative Council, the top lawmaking
body in the
territory.

While the protests have abated in recent weeks under the authorities’
crackdown, discontent with the government has remained strong since
Beijing imposed the security law on Hong Kong, a semiautonomous city
that maintains its own local government and legal system.

Two weeks ago, [more than 600,000 people
participated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/asia/hong-kong-elections-security.html)
in the opposition camp’s primary election, despite warnings from local
officials that it might be illegal. Voters generally preferred
candidates closely associated with the past year’s protests.

In barring the candidates for the September elections, election
officials questioned whether candidates who had previously lobbied
foreign governments would continue to do so, which could potentially
violate the new security law’s prohibitions on foreign influence.
Another question asked was whether candidates, if elected, would veto
the government’s budget. Under Hong Kong’s system, if the legislature
blocks the budget twice in a row, the chief executive is forced to step
down.

Kwok Ka-ki, a legislator who was one of the 12 candidates disqualified
Thursday, replied that such a question was political in nature, and that
he was unsure why an election official had any business asking it.
“After all, this is why there are elections in the first place,” he
wrote.

Just half the seats in the legislature represent geographic districts in
Hong Kong, another barrier for the pro-democracy camp. The other half
are functional constituencies largely set aside for candidates from
various commercial sectors, which tend to vote for establishment
candidates.

The opposition has pointed to other places that have held successful
elections during the pandemic, including [South
Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-election.html)
and
[Singapore](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/world/asia/singapore-election-results.html).

“I don’t think many people in Hong Kong will be convinced,” Mr. Ma said,
referring to the official justification for delaying the election. “They
are allowed to go to work, take the subway, take the bus, stand in long
queues and then not allowed to vote? It won’t be very convincing.”
