City officials did a quick U-turn in the face of public anger, after

HONG KONG — Hong Kongers have rarely seen their government react so
swiftly to public opinion.

On Thursday, city officials lifted a ban on dining in restaurants —
imposed just a day earlier, to fight the spread of the coronavirus —
after a public outcry sparked by
[pictures](https://twitter.com/yvonne_tg/status/1288356001519869952) of
workers and older people eating outside in the punishing July heat, on
pavements, curbs and the steps of footbridges.

Hong Kong is battling its worst community outbreak since the pandemic
began, after initial success in containing the coronavirus. This month,
the death toll nearly doubled in a week — as of Friday, it stood at 27 —
and infections sharply spiked.

Some new clusters were linked to nursing homes and restaurants, while
scores of other cases had no known origin. The government’s initial
response included limits on restaurants’ opening hours, with dining in
allowed until 6 p.m. but forbidden after that.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But with case numbers staying high, dine-in service was banned
altogether on Wednesday — leaving many working-class residents, used to
grabbing a quick bite during the lunch hour at one of Hong Kong’s
countless inexpensive restaurants, with nowhere to go.

Photos of the results quickly went viral, including one of

cleaner](https://twitter.com/hkcnews_com/status/1288336602721181696)
eating in a park during a downpour, huddled under an umbrella. (“What
can I do; I can only blame myself for being poor,” a local news outlet,
Citizen News, quoted the man as saying.)

Chan Chun-heung, 50, who sells vegetables at a wet market in the Wan
Chai District, said she had to eat her Wednesday lunch sitting on the
ground.

“I had to cover my food whenever someone walked past me, otherwise the
dust would get everywhere,” Ms. Chan said. “And it was so hot.”

Critics accused the government of failing to think about working people
who can’t spend their lunch breaks in air-conditioned offices. Stung by
the reaction, officials scrambled to open 19 community centers across
the city as makeshift shelters where people could go for lunch.

Then, on Thursday, it reversed the policy altogether, announcing that
dining in for breakfast and lunch could resume the next day. (Dinner is
still limited to takeout or delivery.)

The mini-furor tapped into longstanding perceptions that Hong Kong’s
policymakers, many of them well-heeled, are out of touch with how most
people live. (Carrie Lam, the city’s unpopular leader, was once mocked
for [not knowing where to buy toilet

Daphne Ho, the organizing secretary of the Construction Site Workers
General Union, said many construction workers had crowded together in a
covered area for lunch on Wednesday. Others ate at dust-filled, poorly
ventilated construction sites, and some opted to skip lunch altogether,
she said.

“Many people thought, why couldn’t Hong Kongers even have the dignity to
eat a meal?” Ms. Ho said. “Why did they have to squat in the
streets?”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Ms. Chan, the vegetable seller, was relieved on Thursday to be able to
eat at one of the converted shelters near her market. A few other
residents ate takeout at sparsely distributed tables, all facing the
wall, while a pack of reporters waited outside to interview
them.

Before the shelters were opened, a wide variety of venues — including
churches, hotels, clinics, hair salons and art studios — had offered to
let people eat in their facilities free. Critics of the government were
quick to tie that spirit of grass-roots solidarity to the city’s
pro-democracy protest movement, which has seen a variety of [mutual aid
networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html)
spring up.

Health officials have tied Hong Kong’s current surge to incoming
travelers who had been exempted from quarantine requirements, including
airline crew, sailors and some business executives. (Quarantine rules
have since been tightened.)

Ben Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the
University of Hong Kong, said that unless crowds were present, eating
lunch outdoors was a “low-risk activity, but not very comfortable.”

But the risks of dining in are also limited, he said, “given the
measures that had already been put in place in restaurants, including
screens between tables, temperature checks and hand
sanitizers.”
