## Tens of millions of jobless Americans are losing a benefit that helped keep them afloat.

A $600 weekly jobless benefit from the federal government that became a
lifeline for tens of millions of unemployed Americans, while also
helping prop up the coronavirus-ravaged economy, expired at midnight as
officials in Washington failed to agree on a new relief bill.

The loss of the aid will leave millions struggling to make ends meet at
a precarious moment when nearly 11 percent of Americans have said that
they live in households where there is not enough to eat, according to a
[recent Census Bureau
survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html?utm_campaign=20200727mspuls1ccdtanl&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery),
and more than a quarter have missed a rent or mortgage payment.

And it comes as unemployment remains at record levels. More than 1.4
million Americans filed new for state unemployment benefits last week,
the [Labor Department said
Thursday](https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/073020.pdf). It was the
[19th straight week that the tally exceeded one
million,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)an
unheard-of figure before the pandemic. Some 30 million people are
receiving unemployment benefits.

The benefit’s expiration will force Louise Francis, who worked as a
banquet cook at the Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans for nearly two decades
before being furloughed last spring,[to get by on just state
unemployment benefits, which for her come to $247 a
week.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“With the $600, you could see your way a little bit,” said Ms. Francis,
59. “You could feel a little more comfortable. You could pay three or
four bills and not feel so far behind.”

The aid lapsed as Republicans and Democrats in Washington [remained far
apart on what the next round of virus relief should look
like](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html).

Democrats wanted to extend the $600 weekly payments through the end of
the year, as part of an expansive $3 trillion aid package that would
also prop up state and local governments that are weighing layoffs and
service cuts to offset dwindling tax revenues. Republicans, worried that
the $600 benefit left some people with more money than they earned when
they were working, sought to scale it back to $200 per week as part of a
$1 trillion proposal.

White House officials and Democrats blamed each other on Friday for the
benefit’s expiration.

At a White House news conference, Mark Meadows, President Trump’s chief
of staff, accused Democrats of playing “politics as
usual.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>At the
Capitol,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Nancy Pelosi, the
House Speaker, declared that administration officials “do not understand
the gravity of the situation.”

Both said they planned to continue discussions, possibly into the
weekend, to find a compromise. But the talks will come too late to help
laid-off workers set to lose their aid.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the deadline neared, Republicans proposed continuing the $600 benefit
for one week while<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>talks
continue. Democrats rejected the short-term extension.

“When you have a six-day, one-week extension on a provision, it is
usually — has always been — to accommodate a legislative topic if you’re
on the verge of having an agreement,” Ms. Pelosi said. “Why don’t we
just get the job done? Why don’t we just get the job
done?”

## California’s summer outbreak makes it the first state with half a million cases.

California passed a grim milestone on Friday, becoming the first state
to report more than 500,000 cases of the coronavirus, according to a
[New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#states).

In per capita terms, both the infections and deaths in California
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the country’s most populous
state, with 40 million residents —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>remain lower than in many other states, including Florida, where
the concentration of cases is the worst in the
nation.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Three more states have
reported more than 400,000 cases — Texas, Florida and New York — and no
other had more than 200,000 as of Friday.

And though California has the third-highest number of
coronavirus-related deaths, with slightly over 9,000, its total is
significantly lower than that of New York, which has over 32,000. New
Jersey has the country’s second-highest total, with more than 15,000. On
Friday, California officials reported 213 new deaths for its single-day
record, surpassing the previous high, 192, recorded on Wednesday.

California locked down its residents relatively early, on March 19,
buying time for hospitals and public health workers to prepare for an
expected onslaught. The state’s weekly average number of infections in
late April was less than 20 percent of what it is today.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But while the restrictions led to [early
success](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-shutdown.html)
in the state, which has the world’s fifth-largest economy, they
eventually wore on residents reeling from spikes in unemployment.
Resistance mounted to the restrictions.

After a phased reopening that began in May, which some health officials
warned was premature, the number of infections [began to
soar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html).
Gov. Gavin Newsom has since [made face masks
mandatory](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html),
closed the state’s bars and banned indoor dining, [rolled back reopening
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
for most Californians and begun withholding federal relief funds from
cities that refuse to enforce public health orders.

Municipalities have stepped up enforcement as well. Los Angeles County
this week [shut
down](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-29/county-shuts-three-businesses-for-failing-to-report-coronavirus-outbreaks)
three food distribution facilities for failing to report outbreaks, and
Palm Springs ordered a [midnight
curfew](https://www.palmspringsca.gov/home/showdocument?id=75670).

Nonetheless, the state reported a record 197 new coronavirus deaths on
Wednesday. The average weekly fatalities have doubled since the
beginning of July. **** The virus also officially spread to the last of
the state’s 58 counties, with two cases reported in remote Modoc County,
which is at the Nevada and Oregon borders.

“It’s here,” the county’s director of health services [said in a news
release](http://modochealthservices.org/corona-virus), “and we could see
the number of cases increase in the next few
weeks.”

## Giroir, Trump’s testing czar, said most virus test results were coming back quickly. Public health experts disagree.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As schools, universities and businesses struggle to reopen without the
coronavirus testing they need to curb outbreaks, the Trump
administration’s testing czar testified to Congress on Friday that it
was currently impossible to get all tests back within three days.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The testing czar, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, told lawmakers that getting all
coronavirus tests back between 48 and 72 hours, which many health
officials have said is critical, “is not a possible benchmark we can
achieve today, given the demand and the supply.”

Admiral Giroir said that it would be “absolutely” achievable in the
future, and that half of all test results were being processed within 24
hours. While not all tests can be turned around within three days, he
said, the average wait time for the rest was around that time or less —
an assessment that is sharply at odds with what patients and health
professionals around the country say they are experiencing.

He told lawmakers that the nation was now averaging about 820,000 tests
each day, and that roughly half were “done in either point-of-care
technologies with results in 15 minutes or less or at local hospitals
for which the turnaround time is generally within 24 hours.”

And he said that three-quarters of tests from commercial labs were
coming back within five days.

The remainder, he said, are processed by commercial labs like Quest
Diagnostics and LabCorp. Three-quarters of those tests were coming back
within five days, he said.

Admiral Giroir spoke alongside Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top
infectious disease expert, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during a hearing of the
House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, a special panel
created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to oversee the Trump administration’s
coronavirus response.

His comments on testing turnaround times were met with puzzlement by
public health experts, who say that even if the figures are accurate,
they do not reflect the reality on the ground. Reporting test results
and wait times in aggregate, these experts say, does not indicate things
are getting better. Testing shortages persist. And in some places, tests
cannot be processed at all because of a lack of reagents — the chemicals
needed to detect whether the virus is present — or lab capacity.

“Across the board, the supply chain is still fragile and fragmented,”
said Amanda Harrington, director of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory
at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill. “We have assays we
don’t know if we can run tomorrow.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease
Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the
administration needed a “national dashboard for testing” where data is
collected and made publicly available.

Later Friday in an evening briefing in Florida with President Trump,
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida noted: “We’re doing so many tests,
sometimes it takes seven to ten days to get the results back, ”He said
that the state was trying to speed tests for symptomatic people, and
that new point-of-care tests from the federal government should help the
state get faster results.

In Alabama, the average wait time for coronavirus test results is
currently seven days — significantly longer than the two or three-day
turnaround window advised by public health officials for making
quarantine and care decisions.

In [a
statement](https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/news/2020/07/31e.html)
released by the state’s department of public health on Friday, officials
asked health care providers to limit testing to “the elderly, those in
congregate living settings, health care personnel, those with symptoms
consistent with COVID-19 and those with underlying medical conditions
that place them most at risk.”

Democrats on the House panel wasted little time in pointing out that the
caseload is much lower in Europe and Asia than in the United States. Dr.
Fauci said countries in those parts of the world were more aggressive
about shutting down as the pandemic raged.

“When they shut down, they shut down to the tune of about 95 percent,
getting their baseline down to tens or hundreds of cases a day,” Dr.
Fauci said. By contrast, he said, only about 50 percent of the United
States shut down, and the baseline of daily cases was much higher — as
many as 20,000 new cases a day — even at its lowest. More recently, the
United States has recorded as many as 70,000 new cases a day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Fauci also cast doubt on a study promoted by Mr. Trump and other
conservatives. Conducted by Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, it showed an
apparent benefit for hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug that
President Trump has touted as a Covid-19 treatment. “That study is a
flawed study,” Mr. Fauci said. ([Read more about the most-talked-about

The rapid spread of the virus this winter among the church’s worshipers
in Daegu, a city in the southeast, briefly made South Korea home to the
world’s largest coronavirus outbreak outside China. As of Friday, more
than 36 percent of the country’s 14,300 coronavirus patients were
members of Shincheonji or their contacts, according to government data.

Prosecutors say Mr. Lee and other church officials obstructed the
government’s efforts to fight the epidemic by not fully disclosing the
number of worshipers and their gathering places. Seven church officials
were indicted last month on the same charge.

Mr. Lee, 88, has also been accused of embezzling 5.6 billion won, or
$4.7 million, from church funds to build a luxurious “peace palace”
north of Seoul. The Shincheonji church has broadly denied all the
charges against him, and he could face years in prison if convicted.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Intense criticism from the South Korean public [forced Mr. Lee to
apologize](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-shincheonji.html)
in March.

In a statement on Saturday, the church said that Mr. Lee never intended
to hamper the government’s efforts to control the epidemic, and that he
had only expressed concern over what he felt were excessive demands for
personal data on church worshipers.

“He has emphasized the importance of disease control and urged the
church members to cooperate with the authorities,” the church said. “We
will do our best to let the truth be known through trial.”

But parents who accused the church of luring and brainwashing their
children with its unorthodox teachings welcomed his arrest on Saturday,
calling Mr. Lee a “religious con
artist.”

## Florida, already reeling from the virus, faces a new threat from Hurricane Isaias.

Florida’s Atlantic coast braced for

this weekend after the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>storm
raked the Bahamas, parts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic on
Friday.

Preparations for the storm were complicated by the state’s battle with
the coronavirus, which could make evacuating homes and entering
community shelters especially risky. Friday was the third consecutive
day that Florida set its record for the most deaths reported in a single
day, according to a New York Times database.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference on Friday that the division
of emergency management had been working at [its most active
level](https://www.floridadisaster.org/sert/eoc-activation-levels/)
since March, “allowing them to actively plan for hurricane season even
while responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Considered a cornerstone of the public health arsenal to suppress the
virus, [contact tracing has largely failed in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html),
as the virus’s pervasiveness and major lags in testing have rendered the
system almost pointless.

The
[goal](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-tracing.html)of
contact tracing is to reach people who have spent more than 15 minutes
within six feet of an infected person and ask them to voluntarily
quarantine at home for two weeks, even [if they test
negative](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html),
monitoring themselves for symptoms during that time. On Friday, Dr.
Fauci said that if someone gets tested, “they should assume that it
might be positive and should essentially isolate themselves before they
go back and get the result of the test.”

In some of the hardest-hit regions, contact-tracing efforts seem futile,
as many people have refused to participate or cannot even be located,
further hampering health care workers.

In Arizona’s most populated region, for example, the virus is so
[ubiquitous](https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/contact-tracing-important-but-less-useful-with-spiking-cases-maricopa-county-says/article_57d55328-bb4b-11ea-8718-8b1cf4ab4137.html)
that contact tracers have been unable to reach a fraction of those
infected. In Austin, Texas, the story is much the same. Cities in
Florida, which has been seeing an average of more than 10,000 new cases
a day in the past week, have largely[given up on contact
tracing](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-beach-mayor-urges-desantis-to-address-failures-of-floridas-contact-tracing-program/2268324/).
Things are equally dismal in California. And in [New York City’s tracing
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/nyregion/new-york-contact-tracing.html),
workers have complained of crippling communication and training
problems.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From the very beginning, states and cities have struggled to detect the
prevalence of the virus because of spotty and sometimes rationed
diagnostic testing and long delays in getting results. For the tests
currently available and in high demand, there is not a consensus on [who
should get
them.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/coronavirus-test-ethics.html)
Some experts say everyone should get tested, even those without
symptoms. Others say the tests should be reserved for the people who
have symptoms or are more vulnerable to infection.

There is broad consensus, however, that more tests are needed.

On Friday, the [National Institutes of Health
announced](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-delivering-new-covid-19-testing-technologies-meet-us-demand)
that seven companies have received $248.7 million to ramp up test
production and deliver millions more weekly tests as early as September.

The tests, which include three simple “point of care” tests that[don’t
need to be shipped to
laboratories](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html),
were selected as promising candidates to address the serious shortages
that have plagued testing efforts since
March.

## A large outbreak at a Georgia summer camp adds to the evidence that children are susceptible to the virus.

As schools and universities plan for the new academic year, and
administrators grapple with complex questions about how to keep young
people safe, a new[report about a coronavirus outbreak at a sleepaway
camp in
Georgia](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6931e1.htm?s_cid=mm6931e1_w)
provides fresh reasons for concern.

The camp implemented several precautionary measures against the virus,
but stopped short of requiring campers to wear masks. The virus blazed
through the community of about 600 campers and counselors, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday.

The study is notable because few outbreaks in schools or child care
settings have been described to date, said Caitlin Rivers, an
epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The study affirms that group settings can lead to large outbreaks, even
when they are primarily attended by children,” she said.

“The fact that so many children at this camp were infected after just a
few days together underscores the importance of mitigation measures in
schools that do reopen for in person learning,” Dr. Rivers added.

While the role children play in the spread of the virus has been
questioned, the authors of the report said the research adds to evidence
that children of all ages are not only susceptible to infection, but may
play an important role in transmission.

Of the 344 campers and staff for whom test results were available, 260
tested positive, meaning at least 43 percent were infected, though the
figure may well be higher, the C.D.C. said.

Of children ages 6 to 10, over half were infected; 44 percent of those
ages 11 to 17 were infected, as were one-third of those ages 18 to 21.
Only seven staffers were older than 22, and two of them tested positive.

Those who had been at the camp longest had the highest rate of
infection; overall, more than half of the staff, who had arrived before
the campers, were
infected.

## Fitch Ratings downgrades its outlook on U.S. debt as the deficit soars.

The credit rating firm Fitch left the United States’ AAA rating
untouched, but downgraded its outlook on what’s effectively the national
credit score, suggesting the country’s status as one of the world’s most
trustworthy borrowers could be put at risk by the enormous deficits the
federal government is running to combat fallout from the pandemic.

“The outlook has been revised to negative to reflect the ongoing
deterioration in the U.S. public finances and the absence of a credible
fiscal consolidation plan,” [Fitch analysts
wrote](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-revises-united-states-outlook-to-negative-affirms-at-aaa-31-07-2020)
on Friday in a report announcing the decision.

Cratering tax revenues and surging expenditures have driven record
levels of red ink for the federal government in recent months. The
[United States budget deficit hit a
record](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/13/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#the-us-budget-deficit-hits-another-monthly-record)
$864 billion in June as the government continued pumping money into the
economy to support workers and businesses slammed by the pandemic. Some
analysts expect monthly deficits to soon top $1 trillion.

Ballooning deficits have led to an explosion of new borrowing. Fitch
noted that the Treasury Department borrowed just under $3 trillion
dollars from the end of February to the end of June.

Much of the supply of new government bonds was, [essentially, purchased
by the Federal
Reserve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/business/coronavirus-stimulus-money.html),
which has bought $2.6 trillion in financial assets since the middle of
March, Fitch noted.

The presence of the Federal Reserve, which can essentially create
whatever money it wants and use it to buy assets, such as U.S.
government debt, has depressed yields on government bonds even as its
debts and deficits rise sharply.

On Friday, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 0.53 percent, one of
[the lowest levels in recorded
history](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-year-treasury-yield-plunged-to-its-lowest-in-234-years-says-deutsche-bank-11596214464#:~:text=The%2010%2Dyear%20Treasury%20note,scurrying%20into%20safe%20haven%20assets.),
suggesting there is virtually no concern among investors about the
country’s ability to service its growing debts.

When the virus erupted in the West, Italy was [the nightmarish
epicenter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html),
a place to avoid at all costs and a shorthand in the United States and
much of Europe for uncontrolled contagion.

Fast forward a few months, and the United States has had tens of
thousands more deaths than any other country in the world. European
states that once looked smugly at Italy are facing new flare-ups.

And Italy? Its hospitals are basically empty of Covid-19 patients. Daily
deaths attributed to the virus in Lombardy, the region that bore the
brunt of the pandemic, hover around zero. The number of new daily cases
has plummeted to “one of the lowest in Europe and the world,” said
Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the
National Institute of Health.

How Italy has gone from being a global pariah to a model — however
imperfect — of viral containment holds fresh lessons for the rest of the
world, including the United States.

Italy has consolidated, or at least maintained, the rewards of a tough
nationwide lockdown through a mix of vigilance and painfully gained
medical expertise.

  - Its government has been guided by scientific and technical

  - The country set aside economic pressures and only began easing its
    exceptionally tight lockdown based on case counts.

  - Italy continues to limit travel from elsewhere.

  - Local doctors, hospitals and health officials collect more than 20
    indicators on the virus daily and send them to regional authorities,
    who then forward them to the National Institute of Health.

The result is a weekly X-ray of the country’s health upon which policy

Here are other developments from around the globe:

  - Across **Europe**, the economy tumbled into its worst recession on
    record in the second quarter. From April to June, gross domestic
    product fell by 11.9 percent from the first quarter in the European
    Union, and by 12.1 percent in the core group of countries that use
    the euro currency. On an annualized basis, European Union economies
    shrank by 14.4 percent, and eurozone economies by 15 percent, the
    sharpest contractions since statistics started being kept in 1995.

  - As of Saturday morning, **Mexico’s confirmed death toll** of 46,688
    was [the world’s third
    highest](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/americas/mexico-coronavirus-cases.html)
    behind the United States and Brazil. [Britain ranked
    fourth](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html),
    with 569 fewer deaths. The number of new reported infections in
    Mexico has been climbing since May and topped 8,000 on Friday,
    bringing the country’s caseload to nearly 425,000.

  - Britain has barred millions of people in northern **England** from
    meeting other members of other households at their homes, paused
    reopenings set for Aug. 1 and moved to make face masks mandatory in
    more places, after a day on which it reported 38 [new coronavirus

    of the virus appeared in Danang and quickly spread to other parts of
    the country. Vietnam reported its first death from the coronavirus
    on Friday. It now has 558 cases, although many are returnees from
    other countries who tested positive in quarantine.

    “It is a really tough decision to delay but we want to ensure

    Kong’s chief executive.

  - On Saturday, **Japan** announced 1,579 new cases, breaking a record

As the virus surged this spring, health care workers in the United
States and the United Kingdom scrambled to make do with scarce personal
protective equipment. The consequences to their own health were stark.

According to a[new
study,](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667\(20\)30164-X/fulltext)
these workers were 3.4 times more likely to report a positive
coronavirus test than the general population. Workers who described
their equipment — including masks, gloves and gowns — as insufficient
were 1.3 times more likely to report positive tests than their
colleagues who deemed their equipment appropriate.

Using self-reported data collected through[a Covid-symptom monitoring
app](https://covid.joinzoe.com/us), researchers at Harvard Medical
School and Massachusetts General Hospital surveyed 99,795 front-line
health care workers and two million other people from March 24 through
April 23. Health care workers who were Black, Asian or other races were
1.81 times more likely to report a positive test result than
non-Hispanic white health care workers, the study found.

“Minority front-line health care workers tend to be in higher-risk
settings and have less access to protective equipment,” said [Dr. Erica
T. Warner,](https://cgvh.harvard.edu/people/erica-warner) a co-author of
the study and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School. “This is a microcosm of the larger disparity we see in health
care in general.”

New York City public schools, the nation’s largest school system, will
be able to reopen its school buildings in September only if the city
maintains a test positivity rate below 3 percent, Mayor Bill de Blasio
announced on Friday. That conservative threshold is even lower than the
5 percent test positivity rate which has been set by Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo as [a cut-off for school reopening and recommended by public
health
experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html).

The average positivity rate for New York City has generally remained
lower even than the new city threshold, according to city and state
figures. But even a modest uptick in cases over the next few weeks could
nudge that rate higher, which raises fresh questions about [whether city
schools will open part-time on Sept. 10 as
planned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html).
On Friday, the school system [submitted its reopening plan to the
state](https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/nyc-doe---state-doh-reopening-plan-7-31.pdf).

New York is one of the only large districts in the country that is
planning to reopen its buildings at all: Children will report to school
one to three days a week to allow for social distancing. All staff
members will be asked to take tests before the start of school, with
expedited results. Education officials in the city laid out a plan on
Thursday for what would happen in the seemingly inevitable event that
cases are confirmed in a classroom.

The protocol means it is likely that at many of the city’s 1,800
schools, individual classrooms or even entire buildings will be closed
at points during the school year.

Officials said confirmed infections among students, teachers and staff
members would be treated the same. One or two cases in a single
classroom would require those classes to close for 14 days; all students
and staff members in that classroom would be ordered to self-quarantine,
and students would learn remotely. The rest of the school would continue
to operate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But if two or more people in different classrooms in the same school
tested positive, the entire building would close while city disease
detectives were brought in to investigate the cases, which could take
several days. Depending on the results of the investigation, the
building could reopen, but the classrooms with positive cases would
remain closed for 14 days.

Elsewhere in the U.S.:

  - **Cases in New Jersey**, which just a week ago had plunged to their
    lowest levels since the pandemic began, [are rising
    again](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/nyregion/coronavirus-cases-nj.html),
    fueled in part by outbreaks among young adults along the Jersey
    Shore. As of Thursday, the state had recorded an average of 434
    cases per day over the last week, an increase of 35 percent from the
    average two weeks earlier, according to a Times database. On Friday,
    there were 699 new cases, the governor said.

  - Airbnb will start cracking down on house parties in **New Jersey**
    after state health officials warned that the parties were leading to
    Covid-19 clusters. The vacation rental company said it would remove
    35 listings from the site, according to [The Associated
    Press](https://apnews.com/c64053bb7f7b60001a314526da06732e). It took
    police nearly five hours to break up a gathering of more than 700
    people at an Airbnb rental property in Jackson, N.J., last weekend.

  - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the first two tests
    capable of estimating the quantity of coronavirus antibodies in a
    patient’s blood. Both tests were developed by Siemens, according to
    [a
    statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-tests-estimate-patients-antibodies-past-sars-cov-2)
    released by the F.D.A. on Friday. The agency cautioned against
    interpreting the results from the tests, or any serology test, as a
    sign of immunity to the virus.

  - The French drug maker Sanofi said on Friday that it had secured an
    agreement of up to $2.1 billion to supply the **U.S. federal
    governmen**t with 100 million doses of its experimental coronavirus
    vaccine, the largest such deal announced to date. The arrangement
    with Sanofi and its partner, the British pharmaceutical company
    GlaxoSmithKline, brings the Trump administration’s investment in
    coronavirus vaccine projects [to more than $8
    billion](https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx?filter=vaccine).
    This effort, known as Operation Warp Speed, is placing bets on
    multiple vaccines and is paying companies to manufacture millions of
    doses before clinical trials have been completed.

  - **The Trump administration** wasted around $500 million by
    overpaying for ventilators through negotiations that were “inept,” a
    panel of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said in a report
    released Friday. It faulted Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump’s top trade
    adviser, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, for
    negotiating a deal in which the panel said they paid almost five
    times the price per device than under a previous contract with the
    same vendor.

  - **Florida** broke a record — the most deaths the state reported in a
    single day — for the fourth day in a row: On Friday, the state
    announced 257 additional fatalities. **Mississippi, Idaho and
    California** all reported their highest numbers of deaths in a
    single day from the virus.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
    </span>**North Dakota** and **Tennessee** reported new single-day
    case records.

  - Even with significant gaps in the available data, there are strong
    indications that **Native American people** [have been
    disproportionately affected by the
    virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/native-americans-coronavirus-data.html).
    The rate of known cases in the eight counties with the largest
    populations of Native Americans is nearly double the national
    average, a Times analysis has found.

  - **Greenwich, Conn.**, one of the wealthiest suburbs in the country,
    is experiencing what health officials have called a “mini surge” of
    infections, an outbreak that has cascaded through the community and
    underscored how social gatherings among young people are posing
    fresh challenges to containing the virus. More than 20 people
    between the ages 16 and 21 have tested positive for the virus, with
    more cases expected as testing continues, according to Greenwich
    health officials.

  - **[Black

    in juvenile justice
    facilities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/juvenile-detainees-coronavirus.html)
    have been released at a far slower rate than their white peers in
    response to the coronavirus, according to a new report that also
    found that the gap in release rates between the two groups had
    nearly doubled over the course of the pandemic. The
    [report](https://www.aecf.org/blog/youth-detention-admissions-remain-low-but-releases-stall-despite-covid-19/),
    released this month by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, illustrates
    one more disparity the coronavirus has exacerbated for Black
    children, who are disproportionately funneled into the juvenile
    justice
system.

White House officials and Democrats blamed each other on Friday for the
looming expiration by day’s end of a $600 weekly jobless aid payment
that has become a critical lifeline for tens of millions of Americans,
as they remained at an impasse on passing another round of federal
pandemic relief.

At a news conference at the White House, Mark Meadows, the chief of
staff, accused Democrats of playing “politics as usual” on Capitol Hill.
At the other end of Pennsylvania at the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of
California declared that administration officials “do not understand the
gravity of the situation.”

Both said they planned to continue discussions on Friday, and
potentially into the weekend to find a compromise. But the talks will
come too late to help laid-off workers set to lose their aid. Many state
unemployment systems have already stopped sending payments.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Economist have said the faltering economy is likely to face further
devastation without the security of additional payments.

Grasping for more time to reach an agreement, Republicans on Thursday at
first proposed extending the benefit at a much lower rate through the
end of the year, and then proposed continuing the $600-per-week benefit
for one week. But Democrats, who want to extend the $600 weekly payments
through the end of the year, rejected those alternatives. Ms. Pelosi
said on Friday that they would do nothing to address the magnitude of
the problem or bridge the deep divides separating her party’s $3
trillion aid proposal with at $1 trillion plan endorsed by Republicans.

“When you have a six-day, one-week extension on a provision, it is
usually — has always been — to accommodate a legislative topic if you’re
on the verge of having an agreement,” Ms. Pelosi said. “Why don’t we
just get the job done? Why don’t we just get the job done?”

Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, said on
Friday that lawmakers who were to begin their annual August recess would
be on call to return to Washington for potential votes on the recovery
package, should lawmakers and the White House reached an
agreement.

running](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/asia/hong-kong-arrests-security-law.html),
including four sitting lawmakers and several prominent activists like
Joshua Wong. Mr. Wong said he was barred in part because of his
criticism of the new security law. He called the disqualifications “the
most scandalous election fraud ever in Hong Kong

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Even as Hong Kong cast the decision as one made for public health

has accused the government of using social-distancing rules to clamp
down on the protest movement that began more than a year
ago.

The French drug maker Sanofi said on Friday that it had secured an
agreement of up to $2.1 billion to supply the U.S. federal government
with 100 million doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccine, the
largest such deal announced to date.

The arrangement with Sanofi and its partner, the British pharmaceutical
company GlaxoSmithKline, brings the Trump administration’s investment in
coronavirus vaccine projects [to more than $8
billion](https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx?filter=vaccine).
This effort, known as Operation Warp Speed, is placing bets on multiple
vaccines and is paying companies to manufacture millions of doses before
clinical trials have been completed.

“The global need for a vaccine to help prevent Covid-19 is massive, and
no single vaccine or company will be able to meet the global demand
alone,” Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president and global head of
Sanofi Pasteur, the company’s vaccine division, said in a statement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also on Friday, the European Union said that it was working on a deal
with Sanofi to buy up to 300 million doses of potential vaccines to
distribute to citizens in its 27 member countries. The announcements
came two days after Sanofi said it had [a
deal](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-07-29-07-00-00)
with the British government to supply up to 60 million doses of the
vaccine. Financial details about those deals were not disclosed.

Under the U.S. deal, the companies will receive federal funding to pay
for clinical trials as well as for manufacturing the vaccine. The
company expects to begin clinical trials to test for safety in
September, followed by late-stage efficacy trials before the end of this
year. Sanofi said it could apply for regulatory approval in the first
half of next year.

If the vaccine is successful, it would be made available to Americans at
no cost, other than what providers charge to administer it, the U.S.
federal government said in a statement.

The head of Operation Warp Speed, Moncef Slaoui, is a former GSK
executive who [as of May held just under $10
million](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html)
in GSK stock. Dr. Slaoui said in an interview in May that he was
determined to avoid any conflicts of interest, but that his GSK stock
represented his retirement from 29 years at the company, and that he had
told federal officials he would not take the job if he had to sell it.

A handful of other vaccine candidates are already in late-stage clinical
trials and some, such as AstraZeneca and Moderna, have said a vaccine
could be ready before the end of this
year.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The European economy tumbled into its worst recession on record in the
second quarter, as quarantines across the continent brought business,
trade and consumer spending to a grinding halt.

From April to June, gross domestic product fell by 11.9 percent from the
first quarter in the 27 member states of the European Union, and by 12.1
percent in the core group of countries that use the euro currency,
according to figures released on Friday by Eurostat, the E.U. statistics
agency.

On an annualized basis, European Union economies shrank by 14.4 percent,
and eurozone economies by 15 percent, the sharpest contractions since
statistics started being kept in 1995.

Over the same period, the United States economy shrank by 9.5 percent on
the previous quarter and by 32.9 percent on an annual basis, [according
to figures published on
Thursday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html).

But in Europe, there were signs that the worst may have passed, and that
a tentative recovery has been gaining some traction as governments
unleash enormous stimulus spending. Lengthy lockdowns, while painful for
business and industry, have helped curb a widespread resurgence of the
pandemic in most countries, easing reopening.

The figures were especially grim for nations on Europe’s southern rim,
which were among the worst affected by the virus and which faced longer
quarantine periods than northern European countries.

In Spain, which has had one of Europe’s highest death tolls, the economy
shrank by a staggering 22.1 percent from a year ago and by 18.5 percent
from the first quarter. France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy,
shrank by 19 percent from a year ago and by 13.8 percent from the first
quarter; and Italy, the third-largest economy in the zone, contracted by
17.3 percent from a year ago and by 12.4 percent from the first quarter.
France is officially in recession, with three straight quarters of
contraction.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Thursday, the authorities reported that the German economy, Europe’s
largest, shrank by 11.7 percent from the same period last year and by
10.1 percent from the previous quarter.

European Union leaders last week agreed to [a landmark stimulus of 750
billion
euros](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/world/europe/eu-stimulus-coronavirus.html),
or about $884 billion, to rescue their economies and to anchor a mild
turnaround that had started to take hold after lockdowns began to be
lifted.

But risks abound as surges in new cases are reported, increasing the
possibility of more quarantines.

“The hard part of this recovery is set to start about now,” Bert Colijn,
senior economist for the eurozone at ING Bank, said in a note to
clients.

## The House Oversight Committee charged that the Trump administration wasted $500 million by overpaying for ventilators.

The Trump administration wasted around $500 million by overpaying for
ventilators through negotiations that were “inept,” a panel of the House
Oversight and Reform Committee said in a report released Friday.

“The American people got ripped off, and Donald Trump and his team got
taken to the cleaners,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of
Illinois and the chairman of the panel’s economic and consumer policy
subcommittee. “The Trump administration’s mishandling of ventilator
procurement for the nation’s stockpile cost the American people dearly
during the worst public health crisis of our generation.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The report faulted Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump’s top trade adviser, and
Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, for negotiating a deal
to acquire ventilators quickly in which the panel said they paid almost
five times the price per device than under a previous contract with the
same vendor.

“The Trump negotiators
[appeared](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/1122-1125_Redacted.pdf)
gullible and conceded to Philips on all significant matters, including
price,” the report said, referring to Philips North America Corporation,
which had a federal contract to supply ventilators to the national
stockpile. “The
[documents](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/298-299_Redacted.pdf)
show that the administration accepted Philips’ first offer without even
trying to
[negotiate](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/1251-1280_Redacted.pdf)
a lower price.”

The committee launched an investigation in April to determine why the
country was without much-needed ventilators during the initial months of
the coronavirus pandemic.

In January, Philips approached the Trump administration about speeding
up the long-delayed delivery of ventilators it had agreed to supply, but
the administration failed to respond to for six weeks, the panel found.
When it did, the report said, rather than insist on the delivery of the
devices by the deadlines in its original contract, officials led by Mr.
Navarro and Mr. Kushner negotiated a new deal at an inflated
rate.

New York City public schools, the nation’s largest school system, will
be able to reopen its school buildings in September only if the city
maintains a test positivity rate below 3 percent, Mayor Bill de Blasio
announced on Friday. That conservative threshold is even lower than the
5 percent test positivity rate which has been set by Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo as [a cut-off for school reopening and recommended by public
health
experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html).

The average positivity for New York City has generally remained lower
even than the new city threshold, according to city and state figures.
But even a modest uptick in cases over the next few weeks could nudge
that rate closer to the new threshold, which raises fresh questions
about [whether city schools will open part-time on Sept. 10 as planned
in a hybrid
model](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I want to set that very very tough standard,” the mayor said, adding,
“this is a way of proving that we will do things the right way.”

New York is one of the only large districts in the country that is
currently planning to reopen its buildings at all: Children will report
to school one to three days a week to allow for social distancing. All
staff members will be asked to take tests before the start of school,
with expedited results. Education officials in the city laid out a plan
on Thursday for what would happen in the seemingly inevitable event that
cases are confirmed in a classroom.

The protocol means it is likely that at many of the city’s 1,800
schools, individual classrooms or even entire buildings will be closed
at points during the school year.

Officials said confirmed infections among students, teachers and staff
members would be treated the same. One or two cases in a single
classroom would require those classes to close for 14 days; all students
and staff members in that classroom would be ordered to self-quarantine,
and students would learn remotely. The rest of the school would continue
to operate.

But if two or more people in different classrooms in the same school
tested positive, the entire building would close while disease
detectives from the city’s Department of Health were brought in to
investigate the cases, which could take several days. Depending on the
results of the investigation, the building could reopen, but the
classrooms with positive cases would remain closed for 14 days.

If disease detectives were not able to find a link between two or more
confirmed cases in a building, including exposure to the virus outside
of school, the entire building would remain shuttered for two weeks.

Mr. de Blasio’s administration[faced enormous criticism for waiting
until mid-March to close
schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/nyregion/nyc-school-reopening-plan.html),
after the virus had already begun to spread significantly throughout the
city, which soon became a global center of the crisis. Throughout March,
when a student or staff member tested positive, the school would
automatically close for 24 hours for cleaning, a protocol that many
parents and teachers said was too lax.

Other states, including California, have announced less stringent
policies for how to manage positive cases in schools. But most
California school districts will begin the academic year exclusively
online because of the high numbers of cases in their communities.

    new additional cases, according to the state, sending the week’s
    average number of daily cases to 550, well above the rate from a
    month ago.
    
    “The numbers are setting off alarms,” Gov. Philip D. Murphy said at

trials before the end of this year. Sanofi said it could apply for
regulatory approval in the first half of next year.

If the vaccine is successful, it would be made available to Americans at
no cost, other than what providers charge to administer it, the federal
government said in a statement.

The head of Operation Warp Speed, Moncef Slaoui, is a former GSK
executive who [as of May held just under $10
million](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html)
in GSK stock. Dr. Slaoui’s financial ties to some of the companies that

about conflicts of interest.

Sanofi and GSK did not say how much of the federal money would go to
each company — only that Sanofi would receive the most. GSK did not
comment on whether Dr. Slaoui had recused himself from negotiations over
the deal. A senior administration official said all agreements were
negotiated by federal “acquisition professionals” and that Dr. Slaoui
did not play a role in the negotiations.

Britain has barred millions of people in northern England from meeting
other households at their homes, paused reopenings set for Aug. 1 and
moved to make face masks mandatory in more places, after a day on which
it reported 38 [new coronavirus
deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html)
and nearly 900 known new infections, its highest case numbers in a
month.

At a news conference on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had
promised to put on the brakes at any sign of an increase in cases, and
added: “Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal.”

Britain — which has suffered [Europe’s worst coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/world/europe/UK-deaths-coronavirus-europe.html),
with nearly 56,000 confirmed deaths — has been gradually easing
restrictions, with [pubs, restaurants, museums and hair
salons](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html)
allowed to reopen early this month.

On Saturday, the government had planned to allow reopening of
higher-risk settings in England including casinos, bowling alleys and
skating rinks, and to permit small wedding receptions and some indoor
performances. All that will now be pushed back until at least August 15.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We simply cannot take the risk,” Mr. Johnson said. “We will of course
study the data carefully and pay attention to open up as soon as we
can.”

Measures to encourage more people to return to their places of work
would go ahead, he said. Mr. Johnson also added that mask wearing,
already mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England, would be
extended to include more indoor settings where social distancing was not
an option.

The moves came suddenly, with the restrictions in northern England
implemented at midnight, less than three hours after [the authorities’
initial
announcement](https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1288931464168591371)
Thursday night, and with [official guidance on what the rules
cover](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/north-west-of-england-local-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do)
not published until the following morning.

Those restrictions affect Manchester and its surrounding towns and
suburbs, plus areas in East Lancashire and West Yorkshire.The
announcement came just before Eid al-Adha, and several of the affected
areas have large Muslim communities. Places of worship will remain open
with social distancing measures but the authorities recommended praying
outdoors.

Here are other developments from around the globe:

  - **Vietnam**, which has been [fighting a fresh virus
    outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/asia/coronavirus-vietnam.html)
    after more than three months without reporting a locally transmitted
    case, has announced its first death from the coronavirus. The victim
    was a 70-year-old resident of the city of Hoi An who had been living
    with kidney disease for more than a decade. The man was admitted to
    a hospital on July 9 with chest tightness and fatigue, and tested
    positive for the virus on Sunday. He died Friday morning.

<!-- end list -->

  - On Friday, **Japan** announced 1,305 new cases, breaking a record
    set the day before. As cases spike in Tokyo, Gov. Yuriko Koike has
    requested that karaoke venues and bars and restaurants serving
    alcohol close by 10 p.m. from Aug. 3 through the end of the month.
    Businesses that cooperate will be offered 200,000 yen, or about
    $1,900.

## Many African countries are testing too little to track the virus, an aid group warns.

A stark lack of testing in many African countries has kept officials
from being able to track the pandemic, prompting fears that a recent
surge in cases across the continent may be just the “tip of the
iceberg,” according to the International Rescue Committee.

Each country in Africa where the committee works has conducted fewer
than 8,000 tests per million people, the group said. By contrast,
Britain has conducted 205,782 tests per million, the United Arab
Emirates 472,590 per million, and Singapore 199,904 per million, the
committee said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The committee cited Tanzania (63 tests per million), Niger (373 tests
per million), Chad (383 tests per million), Democratic Republic of Congo
(467 tests per million) and Burundi (563 tests per million) as having
the lowest testing rates among the African countries where it works.

The committee, a global humanitarian aid organization, said that testing
in many African countries was falling far short of the rate of at least
one test per 1,000 people per week recommended by the World Health
Organization.

The organization said many African nations needed international support
to increase their testing capacity or the continent could face “an
undetected and uncontrolled spread — and a response fighting with a hand
tied behind its back.”

“The testing shortfalls make it nearly impossible to understand the
extent of the pandemic — let alone put measures in place to stop it,”
Stacey Mearns, a senior technical adviser on emergency health at the
committee, said in a
statement.

## Native Americans appear to be hit particularly hard by the virus, though the data is incomplete.

Even with significant gaps in the available data, there are strong
indications that Native American people [have been disproportionately
affected by the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/native-americans-coronavirus-data.html).

The rate of known cases in the eight counties with the largest
populations of Native Americans is nearly double the national average, a
New York Times analysis has found. The analysis cannot determine which
individuals are testing positive for the virus, but these counties are
home to one in six U.S. residents who describe themselves in census
surveys as non-Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And there are many other smaller counties with significant populations
of Native Americans that have elevated case rates, including Yakima
County, Wash. The Times identified at least 15 counties that have
elevated case rates and are home to sizable numbers of Native American
residents, ranging from large metropolitan areas in Arizona to rural
communities in Nebraska and Mississippi.

“I feel as though tribal nations have an effective death sentence when
the scale of this pandemic, if it continues to grow, exceeds the public
resources available,” said Fawn Sharp, the president of the Quinault
Indian Nation and of the National Congress of American Indians.

The trends are troubling enough that congressional leaders have asked
the [U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/us-commission-on-civil-rights-agrees-to-warren-haaland-request-to-update-broken-promises-report-and-examine-pandemic-impacts-on-indian-country)
to examine them.

In New Mexico, Native American and Alaska Native people have accounted
for [nearly 40 percent of virus
cases,](https://cvprovider.nmhealth.org/public-dashboard.html) though
they make up 9 percent of the population.

[Hospitalization rates
published](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html)
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also suggest that
Native American people are overrepresented among those who become
seriously ill from the virus. Federal data tracking individual
coronavirus cases often omits race and ethnicity information.

Native Americans — particularly those living on reservations — are more
prone to contract the virus because of crowded housing conditions that
make social distancing difficult, said Allison Barlow, director of the
Center for American Indian Health at Johns Hopkins University. And years
of underfunded health systems, food and water insecurity and other
factors contribute to underlying health conditions that can make the
illness more severe once contracted.
