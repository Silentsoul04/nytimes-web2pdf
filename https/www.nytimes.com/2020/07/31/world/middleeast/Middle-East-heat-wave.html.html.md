BAGHDAD — A sweltering 125 degrees Fahrenheit in Baghdad on Tuesday; a
record 115 degrees in Damascus on Wednesday. And extreme levels of heat
in Israel and Lebanon.

Several countries in the Middle East experienced record high
temperatures this week as many marked the Muslim celebration of Eid
al-Adha amid the coronavirus pandemic. The heat wave left cities
sweltering in scorching temperatures of 120 degrees (48 degrees Celsius)
or more for days, raising concerns it was a sign of future misery under
the warming effects of climate change.

Iraq has been hit especially hard, with Baghdad recording its all-time
highest temperature on Tuesday, followed by its second hottest day on
record on Wednesday.

The southern city of Basra also recorded temperatures of 120 degrees and
higher for days, with the mercury hitting 122 degrees on Thursday, a
temperature also recorded in Amara, in the southeast.

“The heat is unbearable,” said Ahmed Hashim, a 30-year-old Baghdad
resident. “There’s a psychological pressure, people can easily get into
a fight.”

Mr. Hashim said he had seen people faint from the heat in the streets of
the Iraqi capital. Some have tried to find respite from the scorching
temperatures in public fountains.

The heat wave is hitting Iraq as the country struggles with a worsening
shortage of electricity, which has pushed people to rely even more on
private generators to power refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans.
Mr. Hashim said generators were being switched off every few hours
because of power cuts, worsening the misery.

“The cooler in the house cannot cool the rooms — electricity is a
disaster,” he added.

Two protesters were killed by security forces in Baghdad on Monday in
demonstrations over the worsening lack of electricity. The killings were
the first in months near [Tahrir
Square](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/world/middleeast/iraq-protests-sadr-city.html),
which became a symbol of [protests against endemic corruption and

last year during a monthslong period of unrest.

Meteorologists define a heat wave as a prolonged period of unusually
high temperatures that span across several days, usually three. Combined
with high humidity or the lack of cool temperatures at night, extreme
temperatures pose risks to the elderly and children.

With average worldwide temperatures rising as a result of carbon dioxide
emissions and other heat-trapping gases, periods of extreme heat are
becoming more frequent and more intense, with the situation particularly
dire near the Equator.

But cooler regions have not been spared. Intense heat afflicted Europe
this week, a year after [extreme temperatures soared across the
continent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/world/europe/europe-heat-wave.html),
and several cities like Paris and Glasgow [recorded all-time high
temperatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/world/europe/heatwave-record-temperatures.html).

And a study of a [prolonged heat wave in
Siberia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/climate/siberia-heat-wave-climate-change.html)
earlier this year found that global warming made the extreme
temperatures 600 times more likely there.

Temperatures regularly go above 115 degrees in the summer in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia; Amman, Jordan; and Baghdad; 120-degree days are no longer
exceptional. But meteorologists have warned that the current heat wave
may be longer and [more widespread across the
region](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/above-normal-temperatures-likely-over-arab-region).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Temperatures also soared across much of Israel this week, reaching 111
degrees at the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, and 103 in the northern
city of Tiberias.

Climate experts said the heat wave was part of a trend of warmer summer
temperatures across Israel.

“This heat wave didn’t break any records,” said Hadas Saaroni, a
professor of climatology at Tel Aviv University. “But over the past
three decades, we have witnessed higher temperatures as well as longer
summers and heat waves.”

Even as countries in the Middle East deal with the crippling heat, they
are struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected
hundreds of thousands of people in the region.

In May, the [World Meteorological
Organization](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/global-partnership-urges-stronger-preparation-hot-weather-during-covid-19)
warned that the pandemic would increase health risks caused by high
temperatures, forcing people to congregate indoors in air-conditioned
public spaces, while leaving vulnerable people more exposed to heat
stroke.

In Saudi Arabia, where the temperature hit 115 degrees in its capital,
Riyadh, the pandemic has pushed authorities to sharply reduce the number
of pilgrims undertaking the hajj, [the annual pilgrimage to the holy
city of
Mecca](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/world/middleeast/pilgrims-hajj-mecca-coronavirus-pandemic.html).

In Iraq, Jowdat Abdul Rahman, a spokesman of the country’s civil defense
forces, said the heat wave’s impact had been aggravated by the pandemic.

“Iraqis used to go to swimming pools when temperatures would rise, while
now, they can’t,” he said.

And for the first time, he said, birds are dying because of the heat. “I
had never seen such a thing before.”
