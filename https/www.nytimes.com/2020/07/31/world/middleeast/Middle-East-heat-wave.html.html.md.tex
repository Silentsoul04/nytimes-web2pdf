Celebrations}\label{scorching-temperatures-bake-middle-east-amid-eid-al-adha-celebrations}}

Record high temperatures were recorded in Baghdad and Damascus, and
experts warned of the effects of prolonged heat waves as the planet
warms.

BAGHDAD --- A sweltering 125 degrees Fahrenheit in Baghdad on Tuesday; a
record 115 degrees in Damascus on Wednesday. And extreme levels of heat
in Israel and Lebanon.

Several countries in the Middle East experienced record high
temperatures this week as many marked the Muslim celebration of Eid
al-Adha amid the coronavirus pandemic. The heat wave left cities
sweltering in scorching temperatures of 120 degrees (48 degrees Celsius)
or more for days, raising concerns it was a sign of future misery under
the warming effects of climate change.

Iraq has been hit especially hard, with Baghdad recording its all-time
highest temperature on Tuesday, followed by its second hottest day on
record on Wednesday.

The southern city of Basra also recorded temperatures of 120 degrees and
higher for days, with the mercury hitting 122 degrees on Thursday, a
temperature also recorded in Amara, in the southeast.

``The heat is unbearable,'' said Ahmed Hashim, a 30-year-old Baghdad
resident. ``There's a psychological pressure, people can easily get into
a fight.''

Mr. Hashim said he had seen people faint from the heat in the streets of
the Iraqi capital. Some have tried to find respite from the scorching
temperatures in public fountains.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/31/world/31heatwave05/merlin_175029189_80afc09d-7cd8-4724-9f27-fb1741d9711f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The heat wave is hitting Iraq as the country struggles with a worsening
shortage of electricity, which has pushed people to rely even more on
private generators to power refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans.
Mr. Hashim said generators were being switched off every few hours
because of power cuts, worsening the misery.

``The cooler in the house cannot cool the rooms --- electricity is a
disaster,'' he added.

Two protesters were killed by security forces in Baghdad on Monday in
demonstrations over the worsening lack of electricity. The killings were
the first in months near
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/world/middleeast/iraq-protests-sadr-city.html}{Tahrir
Square}, which became a symbol of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/world/middleeast/Iraq-protests-Iran.html}{protests
against endemic corruption and foreign interference} last year during a
monthslong period of unrest.

On Thursday, Iraqi authorities ordered a nationwide eight-day holiday
for Eid al-Adha to bring some relief across the country.

Meteorologists define a heat wave as a prolonged period of unusually
high temperatures that span across several days, usually three. Combined
with high humidity or the lack of cool temperatures at night, extreme
temperatures pose risks to the elderly and children.

With average worldwide temperatures rising as a result of carbon dioxide
emissions and other heat-trapping gases, periods of extreme heat are
becoming more frequent and more intense, with the situation particularly
dire near the Equator.

But cooler regions have not been spared. Intense heat afflicted Europe
this week, a year after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/world/europe/europe-heat-wave.html}{extreme
temperatures soared across the continent}, and several cities like Paris
and Glasgow
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/world/europe/heatwave-record-temperatures.html}{recorded
all-time high temperatures}.

And a study of a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/climate/siberia-heat-wave-climate-change.html}{prolonged
heat wave in Siberia} earlier this year found that global warming made
the extreme temperatures 600 times more likely there.

Temperatures regularly go above 115 degrees in the summer in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia; Amman, Jordan; and Baghdad; 120-degree days are no longer
exceptional. But meteorologists have warned that the current heat wave
may be longer and
\href{https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/above-normal-temperatures-likely-over-arab-region}{more
widespread across the region}.

A report about
\href{https://www.unescwa.org/sites/www.unescwa.org/files/events/files/riccar_main_report_2017.pdf}{climate
change in the Middle East} published by the United Nations in 2017
estimated that average temperatures could increase nearly 10 degrees in
certain areas of the region by the end of the century, and that the
number of days over 104 degrees would increase significantly.

The number of nights per year where temperatures remain above 68 degrees
Fahrenheit may also jump from 40 to 80 or 90 by the end of the century
in the region, said Paolo Ruti, a meteorologist and the director of the
World Weather Research Program at the World Meteorological Organization,
a United Nations agency.

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

At Houche al Oumara in Lebanon, temperatures rose to nearly 114 degrees
--- one of the hottest temperatures ever recorded in the country.
Temperatures also soared across much of Israel this week, reaching 111
degrees at the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, and 103 in the northern
city of Tiberias.

Climate experts said the heat wave was part of a trend of warmer summer
temperatures across Israel.

``This heat wave didn't break any records,'' said Hadas Saaroni, a
professor of climatology at Tel Aviv University. ``But over the past
three decades, we have witnessed higher temperatures as well as longer
summers and heat waves.''

Even as countries in the Middle East deal with the crippling heat, they
are struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected
hundreds of thousands of people in the region.

In May, the
\href{https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/global-partnership-urges-stronger-preparation-hot-weather-during-covid-19}{World
Meteorological Organization} warned that the pandemic would increase
health risks caused by high temperatures, forcing people to congregate
indoors in air-conditioned public spaces, while leaving vulnerable
people more exposed to heat stroke.

In Saudi Arabia, where the temperature hit 115 degrees in its capital,
Riyadh, the pandemic has pushed authorities to sharply reduce the number
of pilgrims undertaking the hajj,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/world/middleeast/pilgrims-hajj-mecca-coronavirus-pandemic.html}{the
annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca}.

high temperatures.Credit...Saudi Ministry of Media, via Associated Press

In Iraq, Jowdat Abdul Rahman, a spokesman of the country's civil defense
forces, said the heat wave's impact had been aggravated by the pandemic.

``Iraqis used to go to swimming pools when temperatures would rise,
while now, they can't,'' he said.

And for the first time, he said, birds are dying because of the heat.
``I had never seen such a thing before.''
