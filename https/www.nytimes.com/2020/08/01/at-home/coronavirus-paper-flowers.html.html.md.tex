You can make paper flowers as elaborate or a simple as you'd like. A
simple bloom is a good place to start.

Paper flower-making is a popular craft that can result in blooms as
complex and realistic as you want, from dahlias with 100 or more
hand-cut, hand-curled crepe petals to coffee filter pom-pom carnations.

A newspaper rose is a great entry-level project. Using our template
makes creating your blooms almost foolproof. Once you get the hang of
it, you can draw your own templates in any size you'd like, or even
create flowers without a template. They don't need to be perfectly cut.
There is beauty in the handmade; Mother Nature takes care of perfection.

If you'd like, paint the newspaper. Water down the paint a bit first if
you'd like to be able to see the newspaper print through it.

Cut out
\href{https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/paper-flower-template/ebd2fc94ecae6b22/full.pdf}{the
template here}, or, even better, make a sturdy reusable template: Tape
the paper to a piece of thin cardboard (like from a recycled cereal box)
and cut through the template and cardboard at the same time. Trace the
design onto a piece of newspaper and cut it out.

Roll the end, starting at the outside, around a toothpick. Line up the
straight bottom as you roll; the curved top will flare out a bit. You
can add a few dots of glue inside the roll as you're going if you'd
like, or just glue the end closed. Gently slide the rolled-up paper off
the toothpick and squeeze some glue into the roll and on the bottom.

Curl the petals open and use a toothpick to curl the edges of petals.

To make a wreath, cut a ring base out of a heavy paper plate (or trace a
bowl). The one used to make our wreath is about a ½ inch thick and 6½
inches in diameter. Hot-glue the flowers to the ring. Cut out some
almond-shaped leaves and fold them in half to give them some dimension.
Glue a few leaves under the flowers.
