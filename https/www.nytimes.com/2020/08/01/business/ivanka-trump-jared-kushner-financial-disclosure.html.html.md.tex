Three years into their new careers as White House officials, Ivanka
Trump, the president's eldest daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner,
reported income of at least \$36 million in 2019, according to financial
disclosure reports made public on Friday.

The couple's investments, mostly in real estate, were worth at least
\$204 million and as much as \$783 million, roughly the same as their
maximum value of \$786 million in 2018.

The documents, like other federal disclosure reports, show ranges of
income and asset values. In some cases, they require only a minimum
figure, making it impossible to discern a precise maximum figure for
income. (President Trump also released
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/trump-financial-disclosure.html}{his
annual financial disclosure report} on Friday.)

During 2019, the couple's income could have been as much as \$157
million, and possibly more. That compares with a range in 2018 of \$29
million to \$135 million.

Mr. Kushner's continued stake in his family real estate firm, Kushner
Companies, has drawn criticism, as the company has sought investments
from around the world, despite his government position, including his
role as an unofficial diplomat in the Middle East.

Although he has shed some assets, he has retained the vast majority of
properties that were in his portfolio when he entered government
service. Mr. Kushner stepped down from his position with Kushner
Companies before he started working in the government.

Mr. Kushner's firm remained active in the real estate market in 2019,
selling and buying properties in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and
Ohio.

Overall, the couple's income was also down compared with 2017, when they
reported at least \$82 million.

Mr. Kushner disclosed a new loan of \$5 million to \$25 million with
Bank of America, an obligation he holds jointly with other members of a
limited liability company.

Ms. Trump stepped down from her positions at her family's company as
well as her fashion business when her father became president. She said
in 2018 that she
was\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/business/ivanka-trump-brand-clothing.html}{shutting
down her fashion brand}. She did retain stakes in some of the family's
businesses and continues to draw income from them.

She earned \$3.95 million from the Trump International Hotel in
Washington, the same as she earned in 2017 and 2018. The property has
drawn criticism over concerns that guests there are using their hotel
stays as a way to influence the administration.

All told, Ms. Trump reported 2019 income of at least \$5.5 million
compared with a minimum of \$6.7 million in 2018.
