*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

Patricia Negrón and Diane Larsen have been best friends since
kindergarten, so Ms. Larsen was always ready to step in and help her pal
with Eddie, that dancing husband of hers.

“He’d never tire, and I didn’t either,” Ms. Larsen recalled in a
telephone interview. “Pat would say, ‘Here, you take him for a while.’
He was a fabulous dancer.”

He was a great jokester, too.

“Always a fun, humorous kind of guy,” another friend, Dick Roberts,
said, “until it was time to get serious about ‘You need to do this
medically.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Roberts wasn’t just a friend; he was also a patient: Fun-loving,
dancing Eddie was Dr. Eddie A. Negrón, a longtime internist in [Fort
Walton Beach](https://www.fwb.org/), along the Florida Panhandle’s
Emerald Coast.

If Dr. Negrón was a good dancer, he was an even better doctor. Mr.
Roberts’s niece in Ohio was once having a problem that her own doctors
couldn’t diagnose and that turned out to be an extremely rare condition.
Dr. Negrón, Mr. Roberts said, diagnosed it from 800 miles away.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I said, ‘Eddie, have you ever had a patient with this condition?’” Mr.
Roberts said. “And he said, ‘No, but I remember it from medical
school.’”

Dr. Negrón contracted the Covid-19 virus in early July. His daughter
Marisa Hutchinson said the family doubts that his medical work was the
source of the infection.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As a physician he’d been wearing a mask in public for months now,” she
said. “Gloves, everything.”

Dr. Negrón died of the disease on July 23 at the Fort Walton Beach
Medical Center. He was 69. His death startled friends and family
members, who said it should be a warning to those not taking the disease
seriously.

“If there’s anybody who knows how to stay away from infectious diseases
and to treat them,” Mr. Roberts said, “Eddie was one of them.”

Eddie Alberto Negrón was born on Sept. 9, 1950, in [Vega
Baja](https://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/vegabaja.shtml), on Puerto
Rico’s north central coast, to David and Ana Lydia (Rosado) Negrón. When
he was 10 the family moved to the Bronx, and his parents soon divorced.
His mother, a certified nursing assistant, raised him and his two
siblings. He spoke no English when he had arrived in New York.

“He always told me that’s where his love of science and math began,” Ms.
Hutchinson said, explaining that those subjects were not as
language-intensive as others.

Eddie shined shoes to earn a little money and worked hard in school,
where he also took up the cello. After graduating from Dewitt Clinton
High School in the Bronx, he earned a scholarship to the [University of
Wisconsin-Platteville](https://www.uwplatt.edu/), where he earned a
bachelor of science degree in 1972.

Dr. Negrón was a laboratory technician at a Wisconsin hospital when he
met his future mother-in-law, who worked in the cafeteria. She
introduced him to her daughter, Patricia Renee Wright, a respiratory
technician; they married in 1976.

Eventually he returned to school to get his medical degree at the
University of Wisconsin School of Medicine. After he completed his
residency in 1986, the family settled on the Emerald Coast, where he
worked at the White-Wilson Medical Center for 14 years before starting
his own practice.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by three other
children, Jason Negrón, David Schurman and Renae Cruz; and seven
grandchildren.

“He was raised by a strict single mother with high expectations,” Ms.
Hutchinson said. “He fulfilled all of
them.”
