Wilford Brimley, a portly actor with a walrus mustache who found his
niche playing cantankerous coots in “Absence of Malice,” “The Natural,”
“Cocoon” and other films, died on Saturday at age 85.

Mr. Brimley had been sick for two months with a kidney ailment, said his
agent, Lynda Bensky. He died in a hospital in St. George, Utah, where
the actor had a home.

Mr. Brimley had played the Walton Mountain resident Horace Brimley in a
recurring role on the television series “The Waltons” when Michael
Douglas, the producer of “The China Syndrome,” gave him his breakthrough
role: Ted Spindler, an assistant engineer at a nuclear plant.

In the film’s climactic scene, in which he is being interviewed by a
crusading television reporter played by Jane Fonda, Mr. Brimley
delivered an impassioned defense of his boss (Jack Lemmon), who had
precipitated a crisis to draw public attention to defects at the plant.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an article for The New York Times singling out Mr. Brimley as a
talent to watch, Janet Maslin called him “the mustachioed man who very
nearly steals the ending of ‘China Syndrome’ from Jane Fonda.”

Mr. Brimley followed up with a small but memorable performance as a
pugnacious district attorney in [“Absence of
Malice”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqBJJF2yvE "Brimley in \"Absence of Malice\"")
and with supporting roles in “The Natural,” as the put-upon manager of a
losing baseball team, and “The Firm,” in which he played the sinister
head of security at an unsavory law firm.

In Ron Howard’s 1985 fantasy film “Cocoon,” Mr. Brimley delivered one of
his most engaging performances, as a Florida retiree who, with Don
Ameche and Hume Cronyn, regains his youth after swimming in a magic
pool.

“Wilford’s a testy guy, not an easy guy to work with all the time, but
he has great instincts,” Mr. Howard told The Times in 1985. “Many of his
scenes were totally improvised.”

In the 1980s and 1990s Mr. Brimley was a television fixture as a
spokesman for [Quaker
Oats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOLXnkbfEuo "Brimley Quaker Oats commercial"),
gruffly telling viewers to eat the cereal because “it’s the right thing
to do,” and [Liberty
Medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K93EPoO7is "Brimley commercial for Liberty Medical"),
a company selling diabetes-testing supplies. Mr. Brimley learned that he
had the disease in the late 1970s.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When interviewed, Mr. Brimley played down his talent; he described
himself as “just a guy, just a feller” to The [Powell
Tribune](http://www.powelltribune.com/news/item/12188-%E2%80%98just-a-feller%E2%80%99-actor-wilford-brimley-reflects-on-long-career-stars-he%E2%80%99s-known-and-the-music-he-loves-to-sing "Powell Tribune profile of Brimley")
of Wyoming in 2014. “I can’t talk about acting,” he said. “I don’t know
anything about it. I was just lucky enough to get hired.”

Anthony Wilford Brimley was born on Sept. 27, 1934, in Salt Lake City.
His father, a real estate broker, sold the family farm in 1939 and moved
his family to Santa Monica, Calif.

Tony, as he was known, dropped out of school at 14 and worked as a
cowboy in Idaho, Nevada and Arizona before enlisting in the Marine
Corps, which sent him to the Aleutian Islands. After leaving the
service, he worked as a ranch hand, wrangler and blacksmith. Briefly, he
was a bodyguard for Howard Hughes.

He began shoeing horses for television and film westerns, and gradually
took nonspeaking roles on horseback. He appeared as a stuntman in
“Bandolero\!,” in an uncredited role in “True Grit” and as a
blacksmith in the television series “Kung Fu.”

After “The China Syndrome,” he worked steadily. He played Harry, the
former manager of the country singer played by Robert Duvall, in
[“Tender
Mercies,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d40BjDgpdwU "Brimley in \"Tender Mercies\"")
and the eccentric tycoon Bradley Tozer in the Tom Selleck adventure film
“High Road to China,” before returning to the role of Ben Luckett in
“Cocoon: The Return.”

From 1986 to 1988 he had a starring role as Gus Witherspoon, the
opinionated but lovable grandfather in the NBC series “Our House,” yet
again confounding the usual Hollywood aging process by portraying, in
his early 50s, a character who was 65.

“I’m never the leading man,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 1993. “I
never get the girl. And I never get to take my shirt off. I started by
playing fathers to guys who were 25 years older than I was.”

In part because of his television commercials, Mr. Brimley made the
transition from actor to comic source material. John Goodman did a
parody of his diabetes commercial on [“Saturday Night
Live,”](https://video.yahoo.com/liberty-medical-000000755.html "John Goodman \"SNL\" parody")
and in 1997 he appeared in a cameo role on “Seinfeld” as the
short-tempered postmaster general, Henry Atkins.

He had a pleasant singing voice and recorded several albums of jazz
standards, including “This Time the Dream’s on Me” and “Wilford Brimley
With the Jeff Hamilton Trio.” He could more than hold his own as a
[guitarist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAft2naOgGc "Brimley on guitar")
too.

Mr. Wilford’s first wife, the former Lynne Bagley, died in 2000. He is
survived by his wife, Beverly, and three sons from his first marriage,
James, John and William; complete information on other survivors was not
available on Saturday night.

As Mr. Howard noted, Mr. Brimley came by his
[cussedness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLqX7Vi9yT8&list=PLy1Yuw2wBXtCMd3A4mbt2x4Z8ty3S_YFF "Brimley appearance on Craig Ferguson talk show")naturally.
In “Miracles and Mercies,” a documentary about the making of “Tender
Mercies,” Mr. Duvall recalled a set-to between Mr. Brimley and the
director Bruce Beresford, who had made a suggestion about how Mr.
Brimley might play the role of Harry.

“Now look, let me tell you something, I’m Harry,” he recalled Mr.
Brimley telling Mr. Beresford. “Harry’s not over there, Harry’s not over
here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I’m Harry, and whatever I
do is fine ‘cause I’m Harry.”
