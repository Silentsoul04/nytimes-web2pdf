Many people worry about bats as a source of viruses, including the one
that has caused a worldwide pandemic. But another question is surfacing:
Could humans pass the novel coronavirus to wildlife, specifically North
American bats?

It may seem like the last pandemic worry right now, far down the line
after concerns about getting sick and staying employed. But as the
spread of the novel coronavirus has made clear, the more careful we are
about viruses passing among species, the better off we are.

The scientific consensus is that the virus originated in bats in China
or neighboring countries. A recent paper tracing the genetic lineage of
the novel virus[found evidence that it probably evolved in bats into its
current form.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4)The
researchers also concluded that either this coronavirus or others that
could make the jump to humans are likely present in bat populations now
— we just haven’t found them yet.

So why worry about infecting new bats with the current virus? The
federal government considers it a legitimate concern both for bat
populations, which have been devastated by a fungal disease called
white-nose syndrome, and for humans, given potential problems down the
road.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Fish and Wildlife Service, two
agencies involved in research on bats, took the issue seriously enough
to convene a panel of 12 experts to analyze the likelihood of
human-to-bat transmission of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in North
America.

Another team of scientists, mostly from the two agencies, assessed the
expert opinions and issued a report [in June. They
concluded](https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20201060) that there is some risk,
although how much is hard to pin down. Taking precautions, like wearing
masks, gloves and protective clothing, could significantly cut it down.

Kevin Olival, a vice president for research at EcoHealth Alliance, an
independent group and an author of the report, said that as the virus
began to spread around the globe, “there was a real concern that not
only North American but wildlife populations all over the world could be
exposed.”

While the group studied interactions between North American bats and
scientific researchers, Dr. Olival said wildlife-control workers and
people who rehabilitate injured bats, for example, may come into contact
with bats even more than researchers do.

Evaluating risk meant trying to cope with unknowns piled on unknowns:
the risk of an infected research scientist or wildlife worker
encountering bats; the risk of the bats becoming infected in that
situation; the risk of an infected bat passing the virus onto other bats
so that the virus becomes established in the population.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The authors of the paper concluded there was a risk of humans infecting
bats with the novel coronavirus. How much risk? You might say little, or
small, or unknown, but this report is from two federal agencies, so it
describes the risk as “non-negligible.”

Although the issue of how bat researchers should conduct their work may
seem narrow, the potential consequences are broad. The report notes that
if SARS-CoV-2 became established in North American bats, it would allow
the virus to keep propagating in animals even if it didn’t cause
disease. And the virus could potentially spill back over to humans after
this pandemic is contained.

Another concern involves how readily the coronavirus might spread from
bats to other kinds of wildlife or domestic animals, including pets.
Scientists have already shown that domestic cats and big cats can become
infected, and domestic cats can infect each other. Ferrets are easily
infected, as are minks. On the suspicion that they may be passing the
disease to people, [Spain and the Netherlands have slaughtered thousands
of minks at fur
farms.](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/16/world/europe/16reuters-health-coronavirus-spain-minks.html)

A small number of infected pets has gotten a good deal of publicity. But
public health authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have said that, although information is limited, [the risk of
pets spreading the virus to
people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/pets.html)
is low. They do recommend that any person who has Covid-19 take the same
precautions with their pets that they would with human family members.
[National Geographic reported Thursday that the first U. S. dog known to
have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, had
died](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/07/first-dog-to-test-positive-for-covid-in-us-dies/).
The dog, Buddy, apparently had
lymphoma.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

As to the susceptibility of North American bats, Dr. Olival was not
aware of any published work on whether they can be infected with the
virus. Researchers in Hong Kong have reported that [in a lab the
coronavirus infected the intestinal cells of Chinese rufous horseshoe
bats.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0912-6) A report this
month [in The Lancet found that fruit bats could become infected with
the
virus](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247\(20\)30089-6/fulltext).

Beyond bats, Dr. Olival said that scientists should be concerned about
how they conduct research on wildlife in general and consider what
precautions to take to avoid potentially infecting one species or
another. One step, he said, would be evaluating research goals to weigh
what level of contact would be necessary.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In some cases, he said, observation and data recording could be done
without handling animals. If not, gloves and other precautions make
sense, although some “old-school” researchers have balked at the
suggestions, he said.

He said his group continues to recommend, “the highest level of personal
protective equipment when you work with wildlife, because it’s not just
a risk that you will pick up something from the wildlife, but that you
don’t give something back to them.”

He acknowledged that research precautions with wildlife will have a very
small effect, given the greater number of people who hunt wildlife or
come into contact in other ways. Education efforts are underway to try
to change some of those practices; in addition that, he said,
researchers “should set some kind of standard.”
