What exactly is going on with TikTok?

The [wildly popular
app](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/technology/tiktok-is-the-future.html)
is known for hosting short videos where teenagers, celebrities and
creators often dance or lip-sync to viral audio clips. It all seems
innocuous, fun and sometimes even silly.

But in recent days, President Trump has [talked of banning
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html)
from the United States, spooking the millions of people who make or
watch TikTok videos for entertainment. Discussions of a ban have been
coupled with reports that Microsoft or other companies may potentially
buy the U.S. operations of the app.

So what gives? Here’s a primer on how the app became embroiled with the
White House and on the deal talks.

**What is the issue with TikTok?**

It all starts with two factors. One is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese
internet company,
[ByteDance](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html).
And the second is that China is increasingly in the sights of the Trump
administration.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officials in Washington have become increasingly concerned that the
Chinese government could get access to information about Americans who
use TikTok because of the app’s Chinese ownership. TikTok has
[repeatedly
denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/technology/tiktok-alex-zhu-interview.html)
that it is influenced by Beijing.

In any case, the tensions have now boiled over. On Friday night,
President Trump said he planned to ban the app, possibly through an
executive order. Now, TikTok’s owner is said to be trying to address the
administration’s concerns by pledging to sell the app’s U.S. operations.

**Why is Mr. Trump concerned about TikTok?**

Mr. Trump and other administration officials say that Chinese-owned
companies pose a threat to national security because the Chinese
government has the ability to access those companies’ systems under
local laws.

The White House has previously raised similar concerns about Huawei and
ZTE, two Chinese companies that make equipment for mobile phone
networks. The newest front in this fight is smartphone apps like TikTok.

**What could Mr. Trump do about it?**

Mr. Trump has not been clear about how, exactly, he might ban TikTok and
what a “ban” really means. On Friday, he said aboard Air Force One that
he “can do it with an executive order.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump administration has other options to restrict TikTok’s reach.
It could try using a law called the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act to block some foreign products from American app stores. Or
it could put TikTok’s owner on a list that prohibits American firms from
selling goods to it without a license.

Because TikTok emerged out of ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition of a
lip-syncing app called Musical.ly, the administration could also
effectively order the Chinese firm to spin off TikTok. ByteDance could
also agree to sell TikTok voluntarily to avoid being ordered to do so.

This has happened before. Last year, a Chinese company that had bought
the gay dating app Grindr agreed to sell it under pressure from the
Trump administration.

**What do we know about TikTok’s Chinese owner?**

TikTok’s parent, ByteDance, is a large and privately held internet
company with headquarters in Beijing. It makes many popular apps that
are well known in China, including the short-video app Douyin. ByteDance
has many non-Chinese investors, including KKR, SoftBank and General
Atlantic.

**What about the deal talks?**

ByteDance [has reportedly offered to sell the American
operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/technology/tiktok-sale-trump-ban.html)
of TikTok to stop the Trump administration from banning the app
outright. Microsoft is one of the companies it has talked to about
buying the app, though a deal has not been reached.

ByteDance also previously discussed [selling a majority
stake](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/dealbook/tiktok-bytedance-investors-trump.html?searchResultPosition=2)
of TikTok to American investors, but the Trump administration appears to
have rejected that course of action, a person with knowledge of the
situation has said.

TikTok has taken steps to paint itself as an American brand. It [hired
Kevin
Mayer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/business/media/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer.html),
who used to work at Disney, to be its chief executive in May. It has
highlighted its prominent American investors. And it says it has hired
almost 1,000 employees in the United States, with plans to hire 10,000
more.

In a statement, a TikTok spokeswoman noted that it stores its data in
the United States and has “strict controls on employee access” to the
information.
