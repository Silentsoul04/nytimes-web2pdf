## Celebrating Eid al-Adha

Most countries observed Eid al-Adha on Friday, and so a belated Eid
Mubarak to all who celebrated one of the holiest days in Islam. It is
meant to remind Muslims of their faithfulness to Allah and each other,
through Zakat, one of the five pillars of the religion that focuses on
charity.

The holiday commemorates the story of the Prophet Ibrahim’s devotion to
Allah and his willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail. Allah ultimately
spared Ismail, and instead sacrificed a ram. You might know the story as
Abraham and Isaac, per the Judeo-Christian tradition. This is why Eid
al-Adha is known as the festival of sacrifice and why families slaughter
an animal — often a goat, sheep or a cow — to give to a family in need.

Eid al-Adha also comes right after Hajj, a sacred pilgrimage to Mecca
that is a mandate for Muslims who are able-bodied and can afford the
five-day trip. Usually 2.5 million Muslims make the journey. But this
year, because of the global pandemic, Saudi Arabia [said it would allow
just 1,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/world/middleeast/pilgrims-hajj-mecca-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
people, and all from within the
kingdom.

I’m celebrating — socially distanced — with my parents and one of my
sisters, who lives in the New York City borough of Queens, not far from
our parents and from where I grew up. My dad went to a socially
distanced prayer service in the morning and my mom and I prayed at home.
My mom usually makes a feast — pulao, biryani, kebabs and much more —
but made much less food this year.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Our pared down celebration got me thinking: How else are American
Muslims observing Eid al-Adha this year? I talked to a few people across
the country about how they planned to celebrate. Here’s what they say
had to say, edited lightly for length and clarity:

**Ahmed Ali Akbar**, a journalist and host of the podcast “See
Something, Say Something,” has been in quarantine in Michigan with his
wife and his father since March.

> We’re going to pray in our house (the local mosque is open but we are
> choosing not to go), my wife, my dad and I on Zoom. We’ll probably
> take a lot of pictures. Dressing up and looking nice is definitely a
> huge part of Eid; it’s a renewal kind of thing.
> 
> We’re going to go to the drive-through — our mosque is doing barbecue
> — and pick up some food. We’re going to do a socially distanced
> picnic and do a socially distanced photo shoot. The other thing I’m
> going to cook is achar gosht (pickled meat stew) because during Eid
> al-Adha meat is a very central part, in a way.

**Kima Jones**, the founder of a book publicity agency committed to
literature by Black writers and writers of color, lives in Los Angeles
and will be celebrating with her two brothers who have been in
quarantine with her.

> The Eids are two of my favorite holidays. My father was Muslim, and
> growing up, my mother was Southern Baptist; she’s since converted.
> It’s really just all about the food for me. We lived in New York and
> my father would drive to New Jersey and pick up Halal sausage, bean
> pies, in bulk, because there were eight of us children. My father, my
> brothers, my older male cousins, they always slaughtered lamb, sheep,
> and once or twice, cows.
> 
> My father owned a Halal farm during his lifetime. I grew up with him
> going out and sacrificing and cleaning the designated animal. We paid
> Zakat the way that we needed to, but really it was just three or four
> days of extremely good eating. I won’t be sacrificing an animal this
> year because of Covid-19. Whenever I can’t get meat, either I can’t do
> it myself or if a family member can’t, I try to order from Honest
> Chops, a Halal meat market in Manhattan. You can actually buy an
> animal and donate it to a family and they will do the ritual for you
> and get the meat cleaned, packaged and shipped out.
> 
> This year in the pandemic, I’m going to do our Eid prayers here at the
> house. We’re going to cook five or six courses, which I know sounds
> like a lot, but I come from a big family and so I’m used to very big
> portions. We’re going to have lamb, red snapper, something with
> shrimp, a vegetable, grill some corn, make a fruit
salad.
