# Army Officer Who Clashed With Trump Vows to Speak Out on Security Issues

</div>

Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman’s retirement from the Army after more than
21 years of service took effect on Saturday, the same day his sharply
critical op-ed of the president was published.

An Army officer who was a key witness during the impeachment inquiry
into President Trump last year and later retired after what he called a
campaign of bullying and intimidation by the president and his allies,
sharply criticized the administration on Saturday and said he would use
his new civilian status to champion national security issues ahead of
the elections in November.

Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran who served
on the staff of the White House’s National Security Council, accused the
administration in an
[op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/01/alexander-vindman-retiring-oped/?hpid=hp_save-opinions-float-right-4-0_opinion-card-a-right%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)
in The Washington Post of using Soviet-style tactics to punish
dissenters. He added: “At no point in my career or life have I felt our
nation’s values under greater threat and in more peril than at this
moment.”

In his role as a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council staff,
Colonel Vindman was on [the July 25, 2019, phone call Mr. Trump had with
Ukraine’s
president](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html)
that became a central element of the impeachment inquiry. Colonel
Vindman testified in the House impeachment hearings that it was
[“improper for the
president”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html)
to coerce a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.

“Our citizens are being subjected to the same kinds of attacks tyrants
launch against their critics and political opponents,” Colonel Vindman,
whose retirement from the Army after more than 21 years of service took
effect Saturday, said in his op-ed. “Those who choose loyalty to
American values and allegiance to the Constitution over devotion to a
mendacious president and his enablers are punished.”

Colonel Vindman, who plans to pursue a Ph.D. in international relations
at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies,
said he intended to speak out on a range of
issues.

“I will demand accountability of our leadership and call for leaders of
moral courage and public servants of integrity,” he said. “I will speak
about the attacks on our national security. I will advocate for policies
and strategies that will keep our nation safe and strong against
internal and external threats.”

People familiar with Colonel Vindman’s plans said he was likely to focus
on the United States’s so-called great-power competition with Russia and
China, but was still deciding on how and in what form to weigh in.

A spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to comment on
Colonel Vindman’s remarks.

Colonel Vindman was among scores of officers who had been picked to be
promoted to full colonel this year. Typically, such promotions are
backed by Army and Pentagon officials before moving to the White House
for final approval, and then to the Senate for a confirmation vote.

But the White House made clear to officials in the Pentagon’s office of
personnel and readiness, which handles such matters, that Mr. Trump did
not want to see Colonel Vindman promoted, officials said. Defense
Secretary Mark T. Esper pushed back against the White House opposition,
and forwarded the promotion list, which included Colonel Vindman, to the
White House.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Colonel Vindman told friends and family that he felt increasingly
pessimistic that he had a meaningful future in the Army, and [opted to
retire](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/vindman-trump-ukraine-impeachment.html).

Hours before Colonel Vindman was [marched out of the White House in
February](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-gordon-sondland-fired.html)
by security guards, Mr. Trump foreshadowed his fate. “Well, I’m not
happy with him,” the president told reporters when asked whether Colonel
Vindman would be pushed out.

“The circumstances of my departure might have been more public, yet they
are little different from those of dozens of other lifelong public
servants who have left this administration with their integrity intact
but their careers irreparably harmed,” Colonel Vindman wrote on
Saturday.

Colonel Vindman said that despite his personal turmoil, he remained
hopeful about the future of his family and the country. He said he has
received messages of support from “tens of thousands of Americans.”

“Impeachment exposed Trump’s corruption, but the confluence of a
pandemic, a financial crisis and the stoking of societal divisions has
roused the soul of the American people,” he said. “A groundswell is
building that will issue a mandate to reject hate and bigotry and a
return to the ideals that set the United States apart from the rest of
the world. I look forward to contributing to that
effort.”
