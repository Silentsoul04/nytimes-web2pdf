# Indian Billionaires Bet Big on Head Start in Coronavirus Vaccine Race

The world’s largest vaccine producer, the Serum Institute, announced a
plan to make hundreds of millions of doses of an unproven inoculation.
It’s a gamble with a huge upside. And huge risks.

PUNE, India — In early May, an extremely well-sealed steel box arrived
at the cold room of the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest
vaccine maker.

Inside, packed in dry ice, sat a tiny 1-milliliter vial from Oxford,
England, containing the cellular material for one of the [world’s most
promising coronavirus
vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html).

Scientists in white lab coats brought the vial to Building 14, carefully
poured the contents into a flask, added a medium of vitamins and sugar
and began growing billions of cells. Thus began one of the biggest
gambles yet in the quest to find the vaccine that will bring the world’s
Covid-19 nightmare to an end.

[The Serum Institute](https://www.seruminstitute.com/index.php), which
is exclusively controlled by a small and fabulously rich Indian family
and started out years ago as a horse farm, is doing what a few other
companies in the race for a vaccine are doing: mass-producing hundreds
of millions of doses of a vaccine candidate that is still in trials and
might not even work.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But if it does, Adar Poonawalla, Serum’s chief executive and the only
child of the company’s founder, will become one of the most tugged-at
men in the world. He will have on hand what everyone wants, possibly in
greater quantities before anyone else.

His company, which has teamed up with the Oxford scientists developing
the vaccine, [was one of the first to boldly
announce](https://www.news18.com/news/business/indias-serum-institute-to-make-millions-of-potential-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-2597041.html),
in April, that it was going to mass-produce a vaccine before clinical
trials even ended. Now, Mr. Poonawalla’s fastest vaccine assembly lines
are being readied to crank out 500 doses each minute, and his phone
rings endlessly.

National health ministers, prime ministers and other heads of state (he
wouldn’t say who) and friends he hasn’t heard from in years have been
calling him, he said, begging for the first batches.

“I’ve had to explain to them that, ‘Look I can’t just give it to you
like this,’” he said.

With the coronavirus pandemic turning the world upside down and all
hopes pinned on a vaccine, the Serum Institute finds itself in the
middle of an extremely competitive and murky endeavor. To get the
vaccine out as soon as possible, vaccine developers say they need
Serum’s mammoth assembly lines — each year, it churns out 1.5 billion
doses of other vaccines, mostly for poor countries, more than any other
company.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Half of the world’s children have been vaccinated with Serum’s products.
Scale is its specialty. Just the other day, Mr. Poonawalla received a
shipment of 600 million glass vials.

But right now it’s not entirely clear how much of the coronavirus
vaccine that Serum will mass-produce will be kept by India or who will
fund its production, leaving the Poonawallas to navigate a torrent of
cross-pressures, political, financial, external and domestic.

[India has been walloped by the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/world/asia/coronavirus-india-million-cases.html),
and with 1.3 billion people, it needs vaccine doses as much as anywhere.
It’s also led by a highly nationalistic prime minister, Narendra Modi,
whose government has already [blocked exports of
drugs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/business/coronavirus-india-drugs.html)
that were believed to help treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus.

Adar Poonawalla, 39, says that he will split the hundreds of millions of
vaccine doses he produces 50-50 between India and the rest of the world,
with a focus on poorer countries, and that Mr. Modi’s government has not
objected to
this.

The [Oxford-designed
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html)
is just one of several promising contenders that will soon be
mass-produced, in different factories around the world, before they are
proven to work. Vaccines take time not just to perfect but to
manufacture. Live cultures need weeks to grow inside bioreactors, for
instance, and each vial needs to be carefully cleaned, filled,
stoppered, sealed and packaged.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The idea is to conduct these two processes simultaneously and start
production now, while the vaccines are still in trials, so that as soon
as the trials are finished — at best within the next six months, though
no one really knows — vaccine doses will be on hand, ready for a world
desperate to protect itself.

American and European governments have committed billions of dollars to
this effort, cutting deals with pharmaceutical giants such as Johnson &
Johnson, Pfizer, Sanofi and AstraZeneca to speed up the development and
production of select vaccine candidates in exchange for hundreds of
millions of
doses.

AstraZeneca is the lead partner with the Oxford scientists, and it has
signed government contracts worth more than $1 billion to manufacture
the vaccine for Europe, the United States and other markets. But it has
allowed the Serum Institute to produce it as well. The difference, Mr.
Poonawalla said, is that his company is shouldering the cost of
production on its own.

But Serum is distinct from all other major vaccine producers in an
important way. Like many highly successful Indian businesses, it is
family-run. It can make decisions quickly and take big risks, like the
one it’s about to, which could cost the family hundreds of millions of
dollars.

Mr. Poonawalla said he was “70 to 80 percent” sure the Oxford vaccine
would work.

But, he added, “I hope we don’t go in too deep.”

More than 50 years ago, the Serum Institute began as a shed on the
family’s thoroughbred horse farm. The elder Poonawalla realized that
instead of donating horses to a vaccine laboratory that needed horse
serum — one way of producing vaccines is to inject horses with small
amounts of toxins and then extract their antibody-rich blood serum — he
could process the serum and make the vaccines himself.

He started with tetanus in 1967. Then snake bite antidotes. Then shots
for tuberculosis, hepatitis, polio and the flu. From his stud farm in
the fertile and pleasantly humid town of Pune, Mr. Poonawalla built a
vaccine empire, and a staggering fortune.

Capitalizing on India’s combination of cheap labor and advanced
technology, the Serum Institute won contracts from Unicef, the Pan
American Health Organization and scores of countries, many of them poor,
to supply low-cost vaccines. The Poonawallas have now entered the
[pantheon of India’s richest
families](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naazneenkarmali/2020/04/07/indias-10-richest-billionaires-in-2020/#316831d47c23),
worth more than $5 billion.

Horses are still everywhere. Live ones trot around emerald paddocks,
topiary ones guard the front gates, and fancy glass ornaments frozen in
mid-strut stand on the tabletop of Serum’s baronial boardroom
overlooking its industrial park, where 5,000 people work.

Inside the facility producing the coronavirus vaccine candidate,
white-hooded scientists monitor the vital signs of the bioreactors, huge
stainless steel vats where the vaccine’s cellular material is
reproduced. Visitors are not allowed inside but can peer through
double-paned
glass.

“These cells are very delicate,” said Santosh Narwade, a Serum
scientist. “We have to take care with oxygen levels and mixing speed or
the cells get ruptured.”

His voice was jumpy with excitement.

“We all feel like we’re giving the solution to our nation and our
world,” he said.

Initial trial results of the Oxford-designed vaccine showed that it
activated antibody levels similar to those seen in recovering Covid-19
patients, which was considered very good news.

Serum has already produced millions of doses of this vaccine for
research and development, including large batches for the ongoing
trials. By the time the trials finish, expected around November, Serum
plans to have stockpiled 300 million doses for commercial
use.

        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

But even if this vaccine fails to win the race, the Serum Institute will
still be instrumental. It has teamed up with other vaccine designers, at
earlier stages of development, to manufacture four other vaccines,
though those are not being mass produced yet.

And if all of those fail, Mr. Poonawalla says he can quickly adapt his
assembly lines to manufacture whatever vaccine candidate does work,
wherever it comes from.

“Very few people can produce it at this cost, this scale and this
speed,” he said.

Under the AstraZeneca deal, Serum can make 1 billion doses of the Oxford
vaccine for India and lower- and middle-income countries during the
pandemic and charge an amount that is no more than its production costs.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the pandemic passes, Mr. Poonawalla expects that he will be able
to sell the vaccine at a profit — if it works — but his biggest concern
is the near term and covering his cash flow. He estimates that he is
spending around $450 million to mass-produce the Oxford
vaccine.

Many of his expenses might never be recouped, like the costs for the
vials holding the vaccine and the chemicals used in the process. For the
first time, the Poonawallas say they are considering turning to
sovereign wealth or private equity funds for help.

Contrast that with the deals made under [President Trump’s Warp Speed
project](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-moderna.html),
and the similar ones in Europe. In the scramble to secure hundreds of
millions of doses for their people, richer countries have already paid
or committed to pay drug companies handsomely to offset the risks of
mass-producing a vaccine candidate that might not work and end up being
thrown out.

What this spells is “vaccine nationalism,” said [Dr. Olivier
Wouters](http://www.lse.ac.uk/health-policy/people/dr-olivier-wouters),
a health policy professor at the London School of Economics.

“Rich countries are getting to the front of the queue and poorer
countries are at risk of getting left behind.”

Analysts said it was likely that Serum would eventually get some
financial help from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which supports
global immunization programs, or maybe the Indian government. Both
declined to comment.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But any deal will probably be far smaller than what the big
pharmaceutical companies have landed. Another difference is that those
companies are vaccine developers and producers. Serum’s role, at least
for the Oxford vaccine, is purely
production.

Either way, Mr. Poonawalla said he felt an obligation to take this risk.

“We just felt that this was our sort of moment,” he said.

Since Adar Poonawalla took over as Serum’s chief executive from his
father in 2011, the company has expanded into new markets, pushing
revenues to more than $800 million.

A few years ago, [the Poonawallas decided to buy the former American
consulate building in
Mumbai](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/14/cyrus-poonawalla-buys-mumbais-lincoln-house-setting-india-record.html),
which used to be a maharajah palace, for $113 million — for a weekend
retreat. They have [more Rolls-Royces and
Ferraris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da0-uMocTMc) than you can
shake a stick at, and a Batmobile.

Adar Poonawalla acknowledged that his family was better known for “being
seen in some fancy car or a jet or whatever,’’ than making lifesaving
vaccines.

“A lot of people didn’t even know in India what the hell I did,” he
said. “They thought, ‘Oh, you do something with horses or something, you
must be making money.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Poonawalla senses this is about to change.

He is confident that the Oxford vaccine his gleaming stainless-steel
machines are churning out has the best shot of working. If it does, he
plans to roll up his sleeve and brace for an injection.

“It would be ridiculous,” he said, “if I spent all this money, committed
to everything, and I didn’t take it
myself.”
