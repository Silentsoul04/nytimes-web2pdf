Nearly half of Ron Rash's mesmerizing new story collection is devoted to
the eponymous ``In the Valley,'' a sequel to his 2008 novel ``Serena.''
If you've read that book, you surely remain haunted by its mythic
powers. Nominally the Depression-era story of a North Carolina logging
heir who returns home from Boston with a daunting new bride, it invested
the power-mad Serena Pemberton with otherworldly malign qualities and
gave her a big swath of North Carolina's Appalachian logging country to
despoil.

Serena herself, ruling the region on her white Arabian stallion with a
trained eagle and lasso for emphasis, cut a bloodcurdling figure. A
tall, blond goddess with the heart of Lady Macbeth, she seemed to
terrorize every living thing in her path. She hoped to ravage the
landscape both economically and physically, with a few human grudge
matches for good measure. Her ambition was tamped down in ``Serena''
only by the fact that through most of the book she wasn't technically
the boss but his wife, no matter how intimidating.

Serena steps off a seaplane into ``In the Valley,'' returning to her
North Carolina logging tract followed by a press contingent. The year is
1931. Any answers about her husband's death or that of the local
advocate for a national park? Does she plan to pay fair wages? The only
question she deigns to answer is from a young woman: When will she ever
be satisfied? ``When the world and my will are one,'' Serena answers,
reminding the reader that she is a pure Aryan dream.

``In the Valley'' is a full-throated cry for help against her brand of
ruthlessness. As the locals watch Serena's eagle kill rattlesnakes for
threat and sport, they get an inkling of what she has in mind for
everything in sight. All the snakes go wild. The increasing number of
tree stumps make ``the land look poxed, as if infected by some dread
disease.'' Rash includes passages solely devoted to related species of
wildlife fleeing this doomed place. They are among the least eerie parts
of the novella, since the natural world's survival skills are relatively
drama-free. Humans fare worse.

``In the Valley'' takes Serena to such a fever pitch of destruction that
in a lesser writer's hands it might seem overheated. But Rash maintains
the deep keel that has always distinguished him and has perhaps led to
him being characterized as ``Southern,'' a designation he apparently
finds dismissive. He shouldn't; he's one of the best living American
writers, and his laconic understatement is much more powerful than
excess. There's nothing rash about Rash. The way that influenza deaths
figure in ``In the Valley'' is as terrifying as anything you may find on
the subject, even if its crescendo is: ``By the time he got the doctor,
it was too late. His family was nothing more than three filled
coffins.''

The novella's minor characters, human and otherwise, are all drawn with
exceptional care. That's also true in the nine other stories in this
slim volume, though some are very short. ``Ransom'' amounts to an
extended vignette, but it captures the chemistry between a well-off
college student and the man who abducts her, hoping to make only one
kind of killing. The unexpected happens, as it always does with this
author. And these two turn out to be just simpatico enough to leave the
captive with a memory guaranteed to endure.

``Ransom'' is a new story. Others in the collection have appeared in
places as varied as ``Best American Short Stories 2018'' and the
literary review Bitter Southerner (which is ironically named and well
worth looking into). The opening piece, a beauty, even found its way
into ``Best American Mystery Stories 2019'' for its way of pitting
exhausted Civil War troops against a woman defending her homestead. It's
called ``Neighbors.'' And it revolves, as so much of Rash's work does,
around secrets held deep within Southern hearts.

The most haunting and darkly funny of these is ``The Baptism,'' a story
that begins and ends with shotguns. The reason for the firepower: Jason
Gunter, well-known ne'er-do-well and terrible husband, who is working up
to his second marriage. His first wife either hanged herself or
disappeared, depending on whom you ask in the rural spot where the story
unfolds. One person who wouldn't like to be asked: Reverend Yates, who
knows that Jason intends his next wife to be a very young girl.

What's more, Jason wants a baptism for this fresh start. In the dead of
winter. Given Jason's track record for marriage there are no enthusiasts
for this, but Jason will not be denied. Let's just say that he gets the
exact baptism he deserves and that Reverend Yates's secret is one he can
happily live with forever.
