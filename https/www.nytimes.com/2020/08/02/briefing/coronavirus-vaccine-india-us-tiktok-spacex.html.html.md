## The Indian billionaires who may help vanquish Covid

The world’s largest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute, which is
controlled by a small and very rich Indian family, has teamed up with
scientists from the University of Oxford, who are developing a promising
coronavirus vaccine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The company plans to[mass-produce hundreds of millions of doses of the
vaccine,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html)
which is still in clinical trials and might not even work. But if it
does, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of Serum, will have on hand
what everyone wants — and possibly in huge quantities — before anyone
else.

Mr. Poonawalla says that he will split the vaccine doses he produces
50-50 between India and the rest of the world, with a focus on poorer
countries. The Serum Institute is steered by only two men: Mr.
Poonawalla and his father, Cyrus, a horse breeder who became a
billionaire.

**Leapfrogging:** Vaccines take time not just to perfect but to
manufacture. More than one project is conducting these two processes
simultaneously and starting production now, while the vaccines are still
in trials. That way, if and when a vaccine is approved — at best within
the next six months, though no one really knows — doses will be on hand.

**The global race:** U.S. and European governments have sealed billions
of dollars in deals with pharmaceutical giants like Johnson & Johnson,
Pfizer, Sanofi and AstraZeneca to speed up the development and
production of select vaccine candidates in exchange for hundreds of
millions of doses.

and
[maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
tracking the pandemic.

**In other developments:**

  - Australian officials announced [stricter restrictions in

    in an effort to stem an outbreak that is raging despite a lockdown
    that began four weeks ago. On Sunday, there were 671 new cases
    reported in the state of Victoria, suggesting that the virus is more
    widespread than previously thought.

  - Millions of dollars of American taxpayer money [have flowed to
    China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/virus-china-ppp-small-business-loans.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

    struggling small businesses in the U.S.

  - The U.S. recorded [more than 1.9 million new infections in
    July,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html)
    more than double the number recorded in any other month, according
    to a Times database.

  - India’s biggest film star, [Amitabh

    was discharged from the hospital on Sunday after recovering from
    Covid-19, while the country’s home minister, Amit Shah, tested
    positive for the
virus.

But in recent days, [President Trump has talked of banning TikTok from

White House officials have said the app may pose a national security
threat because of its Chinese ownership.

ByteDance, the Chinese internet giant that owns TikTok, [has offered to
sell all of the app’s U.S.
operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/technology/tiktok-sale-trump-ban.html)
as a way to save the business from being banned by the Trump
administration.

**What’s next:** It’s not clear whether the Trump administration would
accept the divestment as a response to its concerns. Microsoft and other
companies have been in talks to buy TikTok, but no deal has been
reached.

## Brazil’s leader bows to pressure to protect the Amazon

European governments and foreign investors [have been cranking up
pressure on the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, to stop
deforestation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/americas/Brazil-amazon-deforestation-bolsonaro.html?referringSource=articleShare)
in the Amazon.

And it seems to be working. The man who insisted “The Amazon is ours” a
year ago has banned intentional forest fires used for clearing — though
environmentalists, experts and foreign officials who have pressed Brazil
on conservation matters worry that the actions amount to little more
than damage control at a time when the economy is in deep trouble.

**Points of leverage:** Brazil’s poor environmental reputation has put
two important foreign policy goals in jeopardy. One is a trade deal with
the E.U., and the other is joining the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Both require Brazil to meet labor and
environmental
standards.

Germany has begun dealing with far-right networks that officials say are
far more extensive than they had understood.

Our correspondent takes a look at the Northern Cross group, which had
planned for “Day X,” a mythical moment when committed far-right
extremists would [round up and kill political enemies and those
defending migrants and
refugees.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/europe/germany-nazi-infiltration.html)

uncovered more than three years ago but only recently brought to trial.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

### And now for the Back Story on …

## Mao’s China, covered by my father, still echoes

*Like father, like daughter: Alexandra Stevenson, a Times correspondent
who covers China’s economy from Hong Kong, took a look back at the
reporting her father, William Stevenson, did for The Toronto Star and
The Star Weekly in the 1950s as one of the first foreign journalists to
work in China after the Communist takeover.*

*Here’s an excerpt from* [*an article she
wrote*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/30/world/asia/china-1950s-echoed-today.html)
*about how much of what he described is still recognizable.*

My father left behind written notes and newspaper clippings, stacks of
passports with visas, photos and transcripts from his first and
subsequent trips to China. They have allowed me to imagine conversations
that we might have had in the six years since he died. Conversations
about how the country he saw back then — brimming with hope and
enthusiasm yet also tightly controlled — is in some ways the same
today.

His first trip to China spanned two months and thousands of miles. He
met Mao Zedong (whom he tapped on the shoulder from behind his camera,
mistaking the chairman for a “humble courtier” blocking his shot) and
Zhou Enlai, the premier and foreign minister at the time. But he also
talked with factory workers, actors, newspaper editors and shop owners.

He described being filled with hope for the human spirit he witnessed.
But he also felt despair because a government-provided handler was never
too far away, ready to silence anyone who veered too far from the
Communist Party line.

China defied any broad-brush statement. “And yet,” he wrote in one
notebook, “under the current leadership, the way in which the government
silences alternative points of view makes it hard not to.”

A version of this exists today. I have a long list of names of people
who wouldn’t talk to me because I work for The New York Times, portrayed
in Chinese state media as the source of “smears and lies.” Sources I’ve
interviewed privately are later threatened by the local police, while
stridently nationalist rhetoric dominates the state media.

Several months after I returned to Hong Kong, the Chinese government in
March expelled my American colleagues as part of a diplomatic dispute
with the United States. In the past month, Beijing has tightened its
grip over Hong Kong with a new national security law, threatening free
speech and other civil liberties in the city.
