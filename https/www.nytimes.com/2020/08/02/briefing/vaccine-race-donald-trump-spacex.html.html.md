## Russia plans mass vaccination after shortened trials

Russia is planning [a nationwide vaccination campaign in
October](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/world/europe/russia-trials-vaccine-October.html)
with a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to complete clinical trials. The
announcement has raised international concerns that the country would
inoculate the public without fully testing its product.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officials said amid accelerated testing that approval would be expected
this month — far earlier than the end-of-the-year date suggested by
Western regulators. Winning the global race would be a symbol of
national pride.

But critics say Russia has cut corners in research on other products,
and the U.S., Canadian and British governments have accused Russian
hackers of trying to steal vaccine research.

Separately, the world’s largest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute is
betting on a vaccine that is in trials with Oxford University
scientists. The company plans to[mass produce hundreds of millions of
doses of the
vaccine,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html)
which might not even work. But if it does, Adar Poonawalla, the chief
executive of Serum, will have what everyone wants — possibly in enormous
quantities — before anyone else.

**An American vaccine:** Earlier in the year, officials set an ambitious
October deadline for a publicly available vaccine. Now, some involved in
the project say they [fear political intervention to produce one ahead
of November’s
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html).

**Related:** In Moscow, young Russians are[partying
again](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/europe/russia-moscow-coronavirus.html),
seeking a return to normal life and willing to risk a coronavirus surge.
“We are people, not robots, and want to have a life,” a bar patron (and
doctor) said.

## Britain’s new dilemma: What if Trump loses?

Few countries have worked harder than Britain to please President Trump.
But with Mr. Trump trailing in the polls to former Vice President Joseph
Biden Jr., [British officials are waking up to the unsettling
prospect](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/world/europe/britain-biden-presidency-johnson.html)
that Mr. Trump may be out of power next year.

In Paris and Berlin, a Trump defeat would be welcomed given he has split
alliances, threatened a trade war and tried to dismantle the European
project. But in Mr. Biden, Britain would face a president who opposed
Brexit, would look out for Ireland and who may have little interest in a
trade deal.

**What it means:** Experts say the risk is a gradual slide into
irrelevance. Mr. Biden’s emphasis, they said, would be on mending fences
with Berlin and Paris, not celebrating a “special relationship” with
London that got plenty of attention from his predecessor.

**What’s next:** Pro-government papers have begun to make the case that
a President Biden would be better for Britain, and Boris Johnson, the
prime minister, has already tried to keep Mr. Trump at an arm’s length
even as he avoids offending
him.

## Brazil’s leader bows to pressure to protect the Amazon

European governments and foreign investors [have been pressuring the
Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, to stop
deforestation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/americas/Brazil-amazon-deforestation-bolsonaro.html?referringSource=articleShare)
in the Amazon.

And it seems to be working. The man who a year ago insisted “the Amazon
is ours” has set up a military operation to defend it and banned
intentional forest fires used for clearing — though environmentalists
and foreign officials who have pressed Brazil on conservation matters
worry that the actions are little more than damage control given the
economy is in deep trouble.

**Points of leverage:** Brazil’s poor environmental reputation has put
two important foreign policy goals in jeopardy. One is a trade deal with
the E.U., and the other is joining the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Both require Brazil to meet labor and
environmental standards.

**Example:** This week, Nordea Asset Management, a major European
investment firm, announced it had dropped from its funds the Brazilian
meat processing giant JBS SA over the company’s role in deforestation
and other
concerns.

extremists would [round up and kill political enemies and those

The group, which included former police officers and soldiers, was
uncovered more than three years ago but only recently brought to trial.

**Italy:** Less than two years after the collapse of a bridge in Genoa

[is troubling to

**U.K. politician:** A Conservative lawmaker in Britain was [arrested
this
weekend](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/world/europe/uk-conservative-lawmaker-arrest.html)
after a former employee accused him of raping her, according to British
news reports. The lawmaker, who has not been publicly identified, was
released on bail.

**New Middle East nuclear power:** On Saturday, the United Arab Emirates
became [the first Arab country to open a nuclear power
plant](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/middleeast/uae-nuclear-Barakah.html),
raising concerns about introducing more nuclear programs to the Middle
East. Israel and Iran also have some nuclear
capacities.

The Star Weekly in the 1950s as one of the first foreign journalists to
work in China after the Communist takeover.*

My father left behind written notes and newspaper clippings, stacks of
passports with visas, photos and transcripts from his first and
subsequent trips to China. They have allowed me to imagine conversations
that we might have had in the six years since he died. Conversations
about how the country he saw back then — brimming with hope and
enthusiasm yet also tightly controlled — is in some ways the same
today.

His first trip to China spanned two months and thousands of miles. He
met Mao Zedong (whom he tapped on the shoulder from behind his camera,
mistaking the chairman for a “humble courtier” blocking his shot) and
Zhou Enlai, the premier and foreign minister at the time. But he also
talked with factory workers, actors, newspaper editors and shop owners.

He described being filled with hope for the human spirit he witnessed.
But he also felt despair because a government-provided handler was never
too far away, ready to silence anyone who veered too far from the
Communist Party line.

China defied any broad-brush statement. “And yet,” he wrote in one
notebook, “under the current leadership, the way in which the government
silences alternative points of view makes it hard not to.”

A version of this exists today. I have a long list of names of people
who wouldn’t talk to me because I work for The New York Times, portrayed
in Chinese state media as the source of “smears and lies.” Sources I’ve
interviewed privately are later threatened by the local police, while
stridently nationalist rhetoric dominates the state media.

Several months after I returned to Hong Kong, the Chinese government in
March expelled my American colleagues as part of a diplomatic dispute
with the United States. In the past month, Beijing has tightened its
grip over Hong Kong with a new national security law, threatening free
speech and other civil liberties in the city.
