Wendy Nguyen, a fashionable Instagram personality with 1.1 million
followers, is regularly tapped by retailers like Macy’s and Banana
Republic to promote their wares on social media. They typically want her
to take a stylish photo in their apparel and enthuse about their brand
and any upcoming sale or product line.

But Ms. Nguyen recently fielded what she considered an unusual and “very
careful” inquiry from Nordstrom. It wanted to gauge her interest in a
campaign that would require visiting the company’s seven-story flagship
store in New York to highlight Nordstrom’s new safety measures and
“encourage people to experience what they built,” she said.

The subsequent Instagram posts from Ms. Nguyen and a handful of other
influencers were shared in the last two weeks and offer a glimpse into
pandemic-era retailing and the ways stores are trying to bring shoppers
back in person. The women, clad in trendy clothing and masks, were
photographed in unusual and notably spacious parts of the store like the
Nordstrom x Nike [sneaker
boutique](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDE6NX9gUBE/), the so-called
personalization studio and a section dubbed the “Beauty Haven.” (There
was one on an escalator.) The posts all praised Nordstrom’s safety
measures, like mandatory masks, abundant hand sanitizer and adherence to
social distancing.

Multiple posts mentioned being able to shop “with peace of mind.” One
poster urged [her followers](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDPbbe1pbkz/)
to “come explore an escape from the city,” while Ms. Nguyen, who is
known on Instagram as @wendyslookbook, [wrote
that](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDC-ZQeANKG/)she hadn’t been out in
months and that the visit “was so refreshing.”

“In times of uncertainty, people are going to find the people that they
trust the most to provide validation for the things that they’ve loved
doing in the past,” said Krishna Subramanian, a founder of the
influencer marketing firm Captiv8. He oversaw the Nordstrom campaign and
said that other companies are also planning influencer campaigns focused
on store safety.

Even before the coronavirus pandemic, retailers were struggling to get
more people into stores. Now foot traffic to malls, including outdoor
shopping centers, is down about 30 percent from last year, according to
aggregated data from the location analysis company Cuebiq, which tracks
about 15 million cellphone users nationwide daily. It was down as much
as 57 percent earlier this year, as widespread shutdowns essentially
ended in-person shopping in many areas of the
country.

By hiring influencers to highlight safety measures, retailers,
especially those that sell apparel and other discretionary goods, are
trying to restore a sense of normalcy to activities like in-store
shopping that were utterly banal six months ago but now may seem
dangerous to many customers.

Influencers are offering a reintroduction of sorts with their posts, Mr.
Subramanian said.

“Remember that experience you used to have on a weekly basis? Here’s how
you do that again,” he said in describing the message of the posts.
“We're not all the way back to normal, but here’s a step to that.”

The Nordstrom promotions appeared to be unique to the New York flagship
store, a colossus that opened its doors less than a year ago. The
pandemic forced it to close in March, but it opened again on June 24.
Mr. Subramanian said he anticipated that influencer marketing around
safety would remain local or regional because of the unpredictable
nature of the virus and the differing infection rates across the
country.

Scott Meden, Nordstrom’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement
that working with influencers was an important part of the retailer’s
marketing program and that many of its customers look to them for
fashion and lifestyle tips.

“The health and safety of our customers and employees is our most
important priority, and more than anything, we want customers to feel
safe and comfortable shopping with us,” he said. “For this campaign,
partnering with influencers is a way to share their perspective on steps
we’ve taken in the way we serve customers to help keep everyone
healthy.”

Ms. Nguyen, who also owns a CBD shop in New York’s West Village, said
her followers appreciated her posts. Many said they hadn’t realized the
store was open again and they were glad to see it was still operating,
given the number of stores around the country that have been forced to
close permanently.

As a retail store owner herself, Ms. Nguyen said working with Nordstrom
had left her cautiously optimistic.

“The store openings can work if we are all active participants in how to
protect others and ourselves,” she said.
