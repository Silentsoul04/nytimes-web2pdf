Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus coordinator,
said on Sunday that the nation was in a “new phase” of the coronavirus
epidemic that was much more sprawling across the country than last
spring’s outbreaks in major cities like New York and Seattle.

She recommended that people living in communities where cases are
surging should consider wearing a mask at home, if they live with
someone who is especially vulnerable because of age or underlying
medical conditions.

“What we are seeing today is different from March and April — it is
extraordinarily widespread,” she said on [CNN’s “State of the
Union”](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/politics/birx-coronavirus-new-phase-cnntv/index.html)
news program. “It’s into the rural as equal urban areas. So everybody
who lives in a rural area, you are not immune.”

Dr. Birx emphasized the significance of asymptomatic transmission, and
said that the White House coronavirus task force was working to make
sure Americans in affected communities understood this risk. “If you
have an outbreak in your rural area or in your city, you need to really
consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you’re positive if you
have individuals in your home with comorbidities,” like respiratory
problems or diabetes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Birx said that, in her recent travels, she had seen “all of America
moving,” making it doubly important for people to understand the
attendant risks, given that cases have surged in many popular holiday
destinations. “If you’ve chosen to go on vacation into a hot spot, you
really need to come back and assume you’re infected,” she
said.

Infected people without symptoms can unwittingly seed numerous chains of
infection. “By the time you wait for someone to come forward to the
emergency room, you have widespread community spread,” Dr. Birx said.

In some communities seeing recent outbreaks, household transmission has
been a huge factor, public health experts say.

Both she and Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized the importance of
prevention methods, like wide-scale mask-wearing, hand-washing, and
avoiding crowded indoor spaces like bars or restaurants and mass social
gatherings.

On NBC’s [“Meet the Press,” Admiral Giroir
said](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-giroir-i-can-t-recommend-hydroxychloroquine-89440837642)
on Sunday that some of the efforts seemed to be helping in recent weeks
to reduce the number of cases in Arizona, as well as in communities in
Texas and Florida — all states that have been hard-hit this summer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He repeatedly pointed to mask-wearing as perhaps the single-most
effective preventive measure in communities experiencing outbreaks.
“Wearing a mask is incredibly important but we have to have like 85 or
90 percent of individuals wearing a mask and avoiding crowds,” he said.
“That is essentially — gives you the same outcome as a complete
shutdown.”

Asked if he was recommending a national mask mandate, Admiral Giroir
said, “The public health message is we’ve got to have mask-wearing.” He
added: “If we don’t do that, and if we don’t limit the indoor crowded
spaces, the virus will continue to run.”

Another guest on CNN on Sunday, Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard
Global Health Institute, said that, in many areas where cases are
surging, the availability of tests was badly lagging. “In 18, 20 states,
the number of tests being done is actually falling and falling because
our testing system is under such strain that we just can’t even deliver
the test today that we were doing two weeks ago,” he said. “That’s very
concerning because when cases are rising, and your number of tests are
falling, that’s a recipe for disaster.”

Admiral Giroir defended the nation’s testing program, noting it has
exponentially been increased in recent months although there are still
delays in getting results. He said that both testing and [contact
tracing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html)
efforts were crucial responses, but not particularly helpful in large,
communitywide
outbreaks.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“When you have a widespread, multifocal outbreak where many people are
asymptomatic, testing and tracing are of limited utility versus public
health policy measures like mask-wearing, like closing indoor crowded
spaces,” Admiral Giroir said. “So, yes, contact tracing is important,
but it’s much less important right now than the public policy mitigation
measures.”

The admiral, a pediatrician, cautioned that there was still plenty of
disinformation circulating on social media. Decisions by most doctors
who prescribe drugs were “evidence-based and not influenced by
whatever’s on Twitter or anything else,” he said. Asked about
hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that President Trump continues
to promote, Dr. Giroir was firm: “At this point in time, there’s been
five randomized control, placebo-controlled trials that do not show any
benefit to hydroxychloroquine. So at this point in time, we don’t
recommend that as a treatment.”

He added that it was time to “move on” from hydroxychloroquine, and
stressed that [there are treatments showing more
promise](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html).
The antiviral drug remdesivir, for example, has been shown to shorten
recovery times in severely ill patients, and the steroid dexamethasone
lowers the death risk among patients on ventilators. Administration
officials have also been promoting the use of convalescent plasma as a
potential treatment, although it is still unclear whether it will work
against the virus, as well as giving billions of federal dollars to
several drug companies that are pursuing vaccines on an accelerated
timetable.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, despite encouraging signs in some states fighting to contain the
recent outbreaks, Admiral Giroir said, the true cost of those infections
will only be clear in the weeks to come. “We are very concerned and this
is a very serious point,” he said, “and deaths will continue to increase
for the next few weeks” because deaths tend to lag behind case counts.
