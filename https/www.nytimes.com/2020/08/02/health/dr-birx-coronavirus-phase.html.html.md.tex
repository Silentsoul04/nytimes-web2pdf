She and other top health officials in the Trump administration warn
states of a deepening spread of the coronavirus, in both rural and urban
areas.

Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration's coronavirus coordinator,
said on Sunday that the nation was in a ``new phase'' of the coronavirus
epidemic that was much more sprawling across the country than last
spring's outbreaks in major cities like New York and Seattle.

She recommended that people living in communities where cases are
surging should consider wearing a mask at home, if they live with
someone who is especially vulnerable because of age or underlying
medical conditions.

``What we are seeing today is different from March and April --- it is
extraordinarily widespread,'' she said on
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/politics/birx-coronavirus-new-phase-cnntv/index.html}{CNN's
``State of the Union''} news program. ``It's into the rural as equal
urban areas. So everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not
immune.''

Dr. Birx emphasized the significance of asymptomatic transmission, and
said that the White House coronavirus task force was working to make
sure Americans in affected communities understood this risk. ``If you
have an outbreak in your rural area or in your city, you need to really
consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you're positive if you
have individuals in your home with comorbidities,'' like respiratory
problems or diabetes.

Dr. Birx said that, in her recent travels, she had seen ``all of America
moving,'' making it doubly important for people to understand the
attendant risks, given that cases have surged in many popular holiday
destinations. ``If you've chosen to go on vacation into a hot spot, you
really need to come back and assume you're infected,'' she said.

Infected people without symptoms can unwittingly seed numerous chains of
infection. ``By the time you wait for someone to come forward to the
emergency room, you have widespread community spread,'' Dr. Birx said.

In some communities seeing recent outbreaks, household transmission has
been a huge factor, public health experts say.

Both she and Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized the importance of
prevention methods, like wide-scale mask-wearing, hand-washing, and
avoiding crowded indoor spaces like bars or restaurants and mass social
gatherings.

On NBC's
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-giroir-i-can-t-recommend-hydroxychloroquine-89440837642}{``Meet
the Press,'' Admiral Giroir said} on Sunday that some of the efforts
seemed to be helping in recent weeks to reduce the number of cases in
Arizona, as well as in communities in Texas and Florida --- all states
that have been hard-hit this summer.

He repeatedly pointed to mask-wearing as perhaps the single-most
effective preventive measure in communities experiencing outbreaks.
``Wearing a mask is incredibly important but we have to have like 85 or
90 percent of individuals wearing a mask and avoiding crowds,'' he said.
``That is essentially --- gives you the same outcome as a complete
shutdown.''

Asked if he was recommending a national mask mandate, Admiral Giroir
said, ``The public health message is we've got to have mask-wearing.''
He added: ``If we don't do that, and if we don't limit the indoor
crowded spaces, the virus will continue to run.''

Another guest on CNN on Sunday, Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard
Global Health Institute, said that, in many areas where cases are
surging, the availability of tests was badly lagging. ``In 18, 20
states, the number of tests being done is actually falling and falling
because our testing system is under such strain that we just can't even
deliver the test today that we were doing two weeks ago,'' he said.
``That's very concerning because when cases are rising, and your number
of tests are falling, that's a recipe for disaster.''

Admiral Giroir defended the nation's testing program, noting it has
exponentially been increased in recent months although there are still
delays in getting results. He said that both testing and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html}{contact
tracing} efforts were crucial responses, but not particularly helpful in
large, communitywide outbreaks.

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

``When you have a widespread, multifocal outbreak where many people are
asymptomatic, testing and tracing are of limited utility versus public
health policy measures like mask-wearing, like closing indoor crowded
spaces,'' Admiral Giroir said. ``So, yes, contact tracing is important,
but it's much less important right now than the public policy mitigation
measures.''

The admiral, a pediatrician, cautioned that there was still plenty of
disinformation circulating on social media. Decisions by most doctors
who prescribe drugs were ``evidence-based and not influenced by
whatever's on Twitter or anything else,'' he said. Asked about
hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that President Trump continues
to promote, Dr. Giroir was firm: ``At this point in time, there's been
five randomized control, placebo-controlled trials that do not show any
benefit to hydroxychloroquine. So at this point in time, we don't
recommend that as a treatment.''

He added that it was time to ``move on'' from hydroxychloroquine, and
stressed that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html}{there
are treatments showing more promise}. The antiviral drug remdesivir, for
example, has been shown to shorten recovery times in severely ill
patients, and the steroid dexamethasone lowers the death risk among
patients on ventilators. Administration officials have also been
promoting the use of convalescent plasma as a potential treatment,
although it is still unclear whether it will work against the virus, as
well as giving billions of federal dollars to several drug companies
that are pursuing vaccines on an accelerated timetable.

Still, despite encouraging signs in some states fighting to contain the
recent outbreaks, Admiral Giroir said, the true cost of those infections
will only be clear in the weeks to come. ``We are very concerned and
this is a very serious point,'' he said, ``and deaths will continue to
increase for the next few weeks'' because deaths tend to lag behind case
counts.
