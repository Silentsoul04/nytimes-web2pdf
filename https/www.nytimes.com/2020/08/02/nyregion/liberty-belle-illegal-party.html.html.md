The Liberty Belle, a riverboat with four bars, three outdoor decks and
space for 600 guests, has been touted by its operators as a “favorite
venue” of New Yorkers who hold parties, fund-raisers and other trendy
events on the water.

But now it has become yet another symbol of reckless socializing during
the pandemic: The boat was used on Saturday to host a party with more
than 170 guests, violating state and local social-distancing rules,
according to the New York Sheriff’s Office.

Even though the outbreak is mostly under control in New York, city and
state officials are expressing growing alarm about the dangers posed by
social gatherings where people violate the public health rules imposed
to slow the transmission of the coronavirus.

Events with high drink or ticket prices — like a recent [charity concert
in the
Hamptons](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/nyregion/hamptons-chainsmokers-concert-social-distancing.html)
featuring D.J. performances from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs
and the Chainsmokers — have drawn harsh criticism as examples of
careless behavior from the wealthy, who have largely escaped the worst
of the outbreak as the virus has [ravaged poorer
communities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/nyregion/bronx-coronavirus-outbreak.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was unclear what kind of party was held on the Liberty Belle and how
much organizers might have charged for admission. The authorities
received a complaint about a party boat departing Pier 36 on Manhattan’s
Lower East Side around 8:30 p.m., and deputies intercepted and boarded
the boat when it returned around 11:30 p.m.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two owners of the boat, Ronny Vargas and Alex Suazo, were arrested on
Saturday night and accused of violating several provisions of state law,
including operating an unlicensed bar and bottle club, the Sheriff’s
Office
said.

The boat’s captain, who was not named, was issued a summons for not
properly displaying its identification number, the Sheriff’s Office
said.

“I want the business in New York to do well,” said Gale A. Brewer, the
Manhattan borough president, whose office received the complaint about
the illegal party that led to the arrests. “But you have to follow the
rules in terms of safety and health.”

Mr. Vargas and Mr. Suazo could not immediately be reached for comment.
The company that operates the Liberty Belle, Empire Cruises, did not
respond to a request for comment.

In an [undated statement on its
website](https://empirecruises.com/covid19/), Empire Cruises said that
it had been “forced to cease our operations until further notice”
because of the pandemic. The company said it was following all public
health measures.

It was not clear if Empire Cruises was officially operating again.

Trever Holland, the president of the resident association at Two Bridges
Tower, an apartment building near the pier, said that on Saturday
evening [he noticed the Liberty
Belle](https://twitter.com/twobridgestower/status/1289717659030786048)
from the window of his 19th-floor apartment. It appeared that people
were gathering without masks, he said, and that they were not social
distancing.

Mr. Holland said that before the pandemic, residents of the neighborhood
often saw large boat parties on the East River. As the weather had
gotten warmer, he had noticed smaller tour boats in the water, but the
crowds on the Liberty Belle “just caught us by surprise,” he
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“It’s obviously a threat to the neighborhood and against everything
we’re trying to do as a city,” he added.

Mr. Holland took a picture of the riverboat and posted it on Twitter,
alerting Ms. Brewer. She responded, saying that she had contacted state
and local authorities.

State officials in recent weeks have increasingly cracked down on bars
and other businesses that violate social-distancing and other safety
measures. Dozens of businesses have had their liquor licenses suspended.
