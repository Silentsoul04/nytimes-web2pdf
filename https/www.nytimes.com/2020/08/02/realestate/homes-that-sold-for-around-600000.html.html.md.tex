\emph{Each week, our survey of recent residential sales in New York City
and the surrounding region focuses on homes that sold around a certain
price point, allowing you to compare single-family homes, condos and
co-ops in different locales.}

\emph{The ``list price'' is the asking price when the property came on
the market with the most recent broker. The time on the market is
measured from the most recent listing to the closing date of the sale.}
