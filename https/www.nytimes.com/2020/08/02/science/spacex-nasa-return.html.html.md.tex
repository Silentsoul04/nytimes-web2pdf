Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley left the space station on Saturday night,
preparing for a Gulf of Mexico splashdown on Sunday.

The first astronaut trip to orbit by a private company is coming to an
end. The passengers are two NASA astronauts ---
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/science/bob-behnken-doug-hurley.html}{Robert
L. Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley} --- but it could be a first step to
more people going to space for a variety of new activities like
sightseeing, corporate research and satellite repair.

This flight of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/26/science/spacex-nasa.html}{the
Crew Dragon capsule is being operated by SpaceX}, the rocket company
started by Elon Musk, as part of NASA's efforts to turn over to private
enterprise some things it used to do.

NASA has hired two companies --- SpaceX and Boeing --- to provide
transportation of astronauts to and from the International Space
Station, and SpaceX was the first to be ready to take astronauts to
orbit,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/science/spacex-nasa-astronauts.html}{launching
Mr. Behnken and Mr. Hurley in May}.

After 63 days on the space station, Mr. Behnken and Mr. Hurley reboarded
the Crew Dragon and undocked from the space station on Saturday evening.

The capsule and its passengers will land in the Gulf of Mexico off
Pensacola, Fla., on Sunday. Splashdown is scheduled for 2:48 p.m.
Eastern time.

Sleeping mostly.

Following a series of thruster firings to put the spacecraft on track
with the landing site, the astronauts'

included}a full night of rest.

Any return journey that exceeds six hours has to be long enough for the
crew to get some sleep between undocking and splashdown, Daniel Huot, a
NASA spokesman, said in an email.

Otherwise, because of the extended process that leads up to undocking,
the crew would end up working more than 20 hours straight, ``which is
not safe for dynamic operations like water splashdown and recovery,''
Mr. Huot said.
