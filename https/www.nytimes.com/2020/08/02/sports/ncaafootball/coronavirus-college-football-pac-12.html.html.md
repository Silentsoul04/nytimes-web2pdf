# A Group of Pac-12 Football Players Threaten to Opt Out of the Season

</div>

The athletes from 10 schools said they were dissatisfied with how their
universities were handling the coronavirus, an approach they say
prioritizes money over safety.

Thirteen Pac-12 Conference football players threatened Sunday to opt out
of the coming season, saying they would not play until systemic
inequities that have been highlighted by [college athletics’
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/sports/ncaafootball/ncaa-guidelines-fall-sports.html)
to [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) were
addressed.

The players, who are from 10 schools and include All-American and honor
roll candidates, said that playing a contact sport like football during
the outbreak would be reckless because of what they described as
inadequate transparency about the health risks, a lack of uniform safety
measures and an absence of ample enforcement.

Those shortcomings, they added, are emblematic of a system in which
players have little standing to address social, economic or racial
inequalities — and, they said, far more of the millions of dollars they
help generate should go toward addressing them.

“The people who are deciding whether we are going to play football are
going to prioritize money over health and safety 10 times out of 10,”
Jaydon Grant, a senior defensive back at Oregon State who graduated with
a degree in digital communication arts said in an interview.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The announcement comes as [the college football season is increasingly
in
doubt](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-season-canceled.html)
as the coronavirus bounces around the country — including [infiltrating
Major League
Baseball](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/sports/baseball/coronavirus-cardinals.html)—
no more under control than it was [in March, when college
sports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-basketball-tournament-coronavirus.html)
and [professional leagues in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/sports/coronavirus-sports-canceled.html)
began shutting down.

This has led many universities to [keep students off
campus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/upshot/virus-colleges-harvard-reopening.html)
and some conferences, like the Ivy League, to postpone fall sports until
at least January. But the schools at the lucrative top of the football
food chain, which heavily leans on television revenue, are forging
ahead. Four major conferences — the Southeastern, Big Ten, Pac-12 and
Atlantic Coast — have pared their schedules mainly to conference games.

Still, there is pushback gathering over whether universities should be
conscripting unpaid college athletes to keep hundreds of millions of
dollars flowing into athletic departments’ coffers by largely assuming
whatever risks come with Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus. Particularly when there are no N.C.A.A.-wide standards on
the frequency of testing or other protocols, which some schools could
resist because they would be costly. ([The N.C.A.A. has made
recommendations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/sports/ncaafootball/ncaa-guidelines-fall-sports.html)
but decisions have been left up to the universities themselves.)

The N.C.A.A. Board of Governors, which largely comprises university
presidents, will consider fall sports when it meets Tuesday.

While some athletes have expressed trepidation about playing football
during the pandemic — including SEC players during a recent call with
league officials, [according to The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/01/sec-football-players-safety-meeting/)
— and a handful have opted out, the Pac-12 players represent the first
collective effort to question why players are assuming so much risk.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Pac-12 players, who include Oregon safety Jevon Holland, considered
a possible first-round N.F.L. draft pick, and Washington linebacker Joe
Tryon, a preseason All-American, are taking advantage of the
conference’s recent announcement that it will allow all students to
retain their athletic scholarships if they opt out. The players said the
conditions for their return not only included increased health and
safety protections, but measures that would redistribute some of the
millions of dollars that college football generates.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The players asked that Commissioner Larry Scott, who is paid $5.3
million per year, and other coaches and administrators drastically
reduce their pay and end lavish facility spending. They also demanded
increased medical insurance coverage, six-year scholarships, the freedom
to hire marketing agents, and that 50 percent of each sport’s conference
revenue be distributed evenly among athletes in their sport, akin to how
professional sports leagues share revenue with players.

Scott declined an interview request. A conference spokesman referred to
a statement that said the group had not contacted the Pac-12 or its
schools.

### The Games Resume

#### Sports and the Virus

Updated July 31, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - The [N.B.A.
        returned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/basketball/clippers-lakers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup),
        and the Lakers held on to beat the Clippers in a thriller. Zion
        Williamson played in the first game of the night for the
        Pelicans.
      - Players, coaches and analysts are watching this season’s
        baseball games [to see what
        effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/sports/baseball/baseball-empty-stadiums-effects.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)
        the absence of fans has.
      - With no summer tournaments to play in, top high school
        basketball stars are [committing to colleges
        earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/ncaabasketball/college-basketball-recruiting.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup).
        Villanova is one of the beneficiaries.

At least one head coach was not happy with the players’ stance.
Washington State Coach Nick Rolovich told players who had health
concerns he was fine if they opted out, but he did not want them around
the team if they expressed support for \#WeStandUnited, according to
John Woods Jr., the father of the sophomore receiver Kassidy Woods.

In an interview Sunday night, John Woods Jr. said Rolovich told his son,
who opted out for health reasons, to clean out his locker on Monday
after he also said he supported the \#WeStandUnited players. The lone
Washington State player to sign the statement, Dallas Hobbs, a junior
defensive lineman, was told the same, the receiver’s father said.

Washington State did not immediately respond to a request to comment.

“These are discussions and topics that are talked about in locker rooms
around the country weekly,” said Valentino Daltoso, a senior three-year
starter on the offensive line at California, where he recently graduated
in legal studies. “This isn’t some new idea out of left field.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Daltoso, one of three Cal players among the 13, said the idea took a
foothold about a month ago during a Zoom call his teammates had in the
wake of protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
As the discussions developed, they reached out to players around the
Pac-12 and to others, like Ramogi Huma, the director of the National
College Players Association, which advocates for players’ rights.

The players say there are hundreds of others in the Pac-12 who share
their concerns, and indeed dozens, including [Penei
Sewell](https://twitter.com/peneisewell58/status/1289974930155569153),
an Oregon offensive tackle who is considered a likely top draft pick
next year, retweeted a Twitter post on Sunday with the hashtag
\#WeAreUnited.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Daltoso expects there are also hundreds of players in other conferences
who feel similarly, noting the questions the SEC players raised in their
conference call with Commissioner Greg Sankey and the conference’s
medical advisers.

When MoMo Sanogo, a linebacker at Mississippi, wondered why colleges
were bringing students back to campus, according to The Post, an
official replied, “It’s one of those things where if students don’t come
back to campus, then the chances of having a football season are almost
zero.” Another player wondered about the long-term effects of
contracting the virus.

“Those guys in the SEC are not alone in how they feel,” Daltoso said.
“Good for them for advocating for themselves. Our power as players
comes from being knowledgeable of each other’s
struggles.”

Grant, the Oregon State player and a son of former N.B.A. player Brian
Grant, said that his school has taken extensive measures to keep players
safe during workouts, but he doesn’t see a way to play games, where
social distancing would be impossible. A restricted environment at a
limited number of sites, an approach that [seems to have worked in the
nascent returns of pro basketball and
soccer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/basketball/sports-bubble-nba-mlb.html),
would be impractical for teams of 120 players — and antithetical to
college sports.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the sidelining of Boston Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez with
heart inflammation related to the coronavirus has also been chilling.

“Do you want to wait until something happens to us or do you want ensure
that there’s a system in place that will help keep us safe?” Grant said.
“The system has failed to provide our insurance. That’s why we’re
united.”
