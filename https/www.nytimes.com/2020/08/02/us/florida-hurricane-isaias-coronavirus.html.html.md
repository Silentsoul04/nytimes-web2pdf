MIAMI — The crowded grocery stores, empty shelves and barren streets of
South Florida in the dawning days of the coronavirus pandemic felt
unsettlingly familiar: They resembled the rush of preparations and then
the tense silence that precede a hurricane.

Maybe the tough residents of a state used to dealing with unpredictable
forces of nature would have an edge in handling the deadly coronavirus.
In theory, the people of Florida know a thing or two about how to follow
orders during an emergency and stay at home.

Oh, were we naïve.

The virus has entrenched itself in communities from Pensacola to [Key
West](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-masks-enforcement-key-west.html?referringSource=articleShare),
killing more than 7,000 Floridians. For four consecutive days last week,
the daily number of fatalities broke state records. Florida’s 257 deaths
on Friday accounted for nearly one-fifth of all of the deaths attributed
to Covid-19 that day in the United States.

With the scourge of virus death came Tropical Storm Isaias to stalk the
Atlantic Coast. The calendar had barely turned to August — too early, in
a normal year, to worry much about storms. But this annus horribilis
would not have it any other way.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A public health crisis. An economic calamity, with more than a million
[Floridians out of
work](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/florida-coronavirus-unemployment.html)
and an unemployment payment system that was one of the slowest in the
country. And now an early debut of hurricane season to remind the state
that the inevitable convergence of the pandemic and the weather is
likely to play out again, and perhaps much more seriously than this
relatively mild storm, before this nightmare season ends.

“It’s just kind of been the way 2020’s gone so far,” said Howard Tipton,
the administrator for St. Lucie County, on Florida’s Treasure Coast.
“But we roll with it, right? We don’t get to determine the cards that
we’re dealt.”

Tropical Storm Isaias threatens the entire East Coast all the way up to
Maine, but it is the South that has seen a recent dramatic increase in
new coronavirus cases. Health officials in Georgia, South Carolina and
North Carolina have warned that hospitals could be strained beyond
capacity with the flood of new patients.

Meantime, emergency management officials [have drawn up special
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/hurricane-pandemic-coronavirus-florida.html)
to deal with people fleeing or displaced by storms. To avoid virus
exposure in shelters, the first choice is for coastal residents in homes
vulnerable to flooding to stay with relatives or friends farther inland,
being careful to wear masks and remain socially distant.

“Because of Covid, we feel that you are safer at home,” said Bill
Johnson, the emergency management director for Palm Beach County.
“Shelters should be considered your last resort.”

Summer in Florida, with its routine thunderstorms, sweaty nights and
unforgiving mosquitoes, is not for the faint of heart. (At least 11
suspected cases of coronavirus in the Florida Keys last month turned out
to be mosquito-borne dengue fever.) Sometimes it feels as though the
season’s only rewards are royal poinciana blooms, ripened mangoes and
fewer
tourists.

This summer has been made harder by the virus, which brought a sense of
despair and helplessness that seemed especially acute in the days
leading up to Tropical Storm Isaias. The storm goes away. The virus has
not.

“It’s really stretching our limits,” said Kevin Cho, 31, a Florida
National Guard captain and a nurse practitioner who treats Covid-19
patients in the intensive care units of several Miami public hospitals.
Among them have been a doctor, who died, and a fellow nurse, who lived.

Many poor people contracting the disease “are losing their jobs, and now
they’re faced with a hurricane,” he added. “How could they prepare for a
hurricane when they have been exhausted of every resource they have?
This hurricane is only going to make things worse.”

In Miami-Dade County, where the coronavirus has hit worse than anywhere
else in Florida, the emergency operations center has been outfitted with
plexiglass desk dividers and fans equipped with ultraviolet lights to
try to kill the virus. Many employees who would normally be in the
building worked from home, at least as long as their internet did not go
out.

“It’s not as good as being here,” said Frank K. Rollason, the county’s
emergency management director. “But right now, it’s better than being
here.”

Some South Floridians hurried to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware
stores to stock up on canned food, water bottles and plywood. But
others, unfazed by the relatively weak and disorganized storm, did not
bother. My building in a Miami suburb, which was not in the storm’s
direct path, did not even bring in the patio furniture, and my potted
plants remained on the balcony. One neighbor on my street put up window
shutters.

“We usually would be assuming, ‘This is terrible,’ I think, except we’re
already so busy assuming that Covid is terrible that we don’t have any
room,” said the humor writer Dave Barry, a fellow veteran of the Miami
press corps whom I have known since we both worked at The Miami Herald.
“We go through this every year, where we always overreact to it, and
maybe this time we underreact to it. Or maybe this is just 2020 lulling
us into: ‘OK, you guys think you had a hurricane. Now you can relax\!’
Then the big hurricane comes.”

Local officials worried that the usual spike in alcohol sales before the
storm would entice people to invite friends and relatives over.

Verdenia C. Baker, the Palm Beach County administrator, warned: “I know
we’ve been cooped up. Now we have a storm. And some of us normally would
have hurricane parties. This is not the time.”

Florida’s relentless coronavirus surge has been driven by a [rapid
economic
reopening](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-florida-texas-bars-closing.html)
that exposed people to infection in bars and [house
parties](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-florida-miami.html).
Contact tracers in Miami-Dade County have found that about 30 percent of
people who tested positive for the virus were exposed by someone else in
their household, the biggest source of infection after “don’t know.”

The huge growth in case numbers, which is finally starting to dip, came
even though South Florida had locked down earlier and longer than the
rest of the state. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has not issued a
statewide mask order, but Miami-Dade County imposed its first facial
covering requirement back in April.

Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, chairwoman of the epidemiology department at Florida
International University, attributed the contagion in part to Miami’s
larger-than-average household sizes and higher poverty rates, as well as
to uneven mask use. The prevalence of the virus is declining so slowly
that it might take until December to get down to a 5 percent positivity
rate, she
estimated.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“It’s really important that we don’t open the tap in any way,” she said
of the possibility of further reopening. “I hope we're not going to be
having exposures related to that — or to any of the future hurricanes we
might face over the next couple of months.”

initially appeared that the state had weathered the first two months of
the outbreak with success. Instead, after most counties returned to
business and holidays prompted people to hold gatherings, the infections
got out of control.

Gus Perez, 32, whom I met at a party last year, thinks he contracted the
virus three weeks ago, over a weekend on which he hung out with a few
friends and went to an outdoor event late one night at a brewery.

He wore a mask and was careful — his friend who had leukemia and his
friend’s mother had both succumbed earlier to the virus.

“I thought I was very on top of it, and it still got me,” he said.

The hospitals have not collapsed, but only because they have added
scores of beds, straining doctors and nurses.

The Rev. Maria Anderson, 64, an interfaith Miami hospital chaplain, has
been tending to exhausted medical workers treating Covid-19 patients and
to family members allowed to visit their loved ones shortly before or
after they die.

“I’ve actually lost track of time,” she said. “We’re in a timeline
limbo. The end doesn’t seem to be in sight, and we have no hope that it
will end.”

Ms. Anderson said that coming home to watch news coverage of political
fighting over masks and the virus has been frustrating, underscoring the
distance between the elected officials making decisions and the
professionals toiling in hospitals every day.

“It’s such a huge moral disconnect that state and federal leaders have,
and that’s what makes me angry,” she said. “I look up and say, ‘Sorry,
God’ — but the anger is there.”

And now storm season may imperil the tenuous new normal that businesses
have tried to forge as they confront the virus.

When Hurricane Irma lashed Florida in 2017, Mike Beltran kept Ariete,
his restaurant in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood, open until the
last minute, cooking rice and black beans for customers. He then worked
out of a borrowed food truck while the electricity was out.

This year, Mr. Beltran, 34, was so consumed by staying afloat amid the
virus, which has forced him to close one of his three restaurants and
lay off some of his staff, that he did not know about Tropical Storm
Isaias until late on Thursday.

“It’s like, ‘Oh, something *else*,’” he said. “I’m just waiting for the
year to be over.”

has lived in Miami for the past 17 years; before joining the Times, was
The Miami Herald’s political writer.
