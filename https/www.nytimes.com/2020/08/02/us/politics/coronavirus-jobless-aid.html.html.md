# Relief Package Deal Remains Elusive as Impasse Over Jobless Benefits Persists

Negotiators acknowledged some progress over the weekend, but said they

WASHINGTON — Top Trump administration officials and lawmakers cautioned
on Sunday that a deal over a [new relief
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html)
to help people and businesses weather the [coronavirus
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) remained elusive
even as the debate over the details of the aid was set to take center
stage in the coming week.

A meeting on Saturday in the Capitol Hill suite of Speaker Nancy Pelosi
had been the most productive discussion in recent days, officials said,
but they remain divided on a number of issues, including how to revive
lapsed unemployment benefits for tens of millions of Americans and how
broad any deal should be.

“We still have a long ways to go,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief
of staff, who is negotiating on behalf of the administration, said on
CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I’m not optimistic that there will be a
solution in the very near term.”

He continued to push for Democrats to agree to a stand-alone measure
that would restore the weekly federal jobless benefits, which expired on
Friday, as a way to continue providing relief.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Ms. Pelosi, who is expected to again meet with administration
officials on Monday, reiterated that she would reject a so-called skinny
bill in favor of a sweeping package that includes a national health
strategy to counter the spread of the virus and extend the full
$600-a-week unemployment
benefit.

She charged that Mr. Meadows and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary,
remained reluctant to commit to a strategic health plan or to address
the needs of American families.

“We have to defeat the virus, and that’s one of the contentious issues
that we have to deal with yet,” Ms. Pelosi said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“We will be close to an agreement when we have an agreement,” she added.

Lawmakers have already approved spending nearly $3 trillion to address
the public health crisis and economic collapse caused by the pandemic,
but the two parties remain bitterly divided over the scope and cost of
another relief package. Democrats, who remain publicly united behind the
$3 trillion stimulus measure the House approved in May, contend that
another significant infusion of cash is necessary.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But at least 20 Senate Republicans are unlikely to support any
additional spending, party leaders have acknowledged, in part because of
concerns over the level of spending and its effect on the national debt.
Under a $1 trillion plan Republicans unveiled on Monday — a narrower
proposal than the Democrats’ plan — a number of provisions, including
the $600 weekly federal unemployment benefit, would be severely
curtailed.

“We have to balance — there’s obviously a need to support workers, to
support the economy, people who through no fault of their own are shut
down because of this terrible disease,” Mr. Mnuchin said on ABC’s “This
Week,” responding to criticism that Republicans took too long to
introduce a proposal. “On the other hand, we have to be careful about
not piling on enormous amounts of debt for future
generations.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“The president is determined to spend what we need to spend,” he added,
though he criticized Democrats for pushing for close to $1 trillion in
new aid to state and local governments. “We’re moving very quickly now.”

Ms. Pelosi reiterated on Sunday that her caucus would not accept such a
measure, though she indicated Democrats would be open to an approach
that tied the unemployment benefit to the unemployment rate, lowering
the size of the benefit as the number of people returning to the work
force begins to grow.

The Senate is scheduled to leave for a monthlong recess by the end of
the week, but it is unclear whether lawmakers will be able to reach a
deal by then.

“We’re going to work every day until we reach a reasonable agreement
that’s good for the American public,” Mr. Mnuchin said.
