# Taylor Swift’s ‘Folklore’ Is No. 1 With a Blockbuster Debut Week

A new Taylor Swift album usually arrives with a [monthslong marketing
rollout](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/business/media/taylor-swift-maximizes-use-of-social-media-in-release-of-new-album.html):
radio singles, [corporate
tie-ins](https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/swifts-red-tops-a-million-sales-in-week-1/),
a string of media appearances — all carefully choreographed to send her
to No. 1.

For her latest release, “Folklore,” Swift threw out almost her entire
playbook, yet still rocketed to the top with sales that most artists can
only dream of.

“Folklore,” which came out on July 24 with [less than 24 hours’
notice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/arts/music/taylor-swift-kanye-west.html),
opened at No. 1 on Billboard’s latest album chart with a whopping
846,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen Music. That’s
the
[third-highest](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9428290/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard-200-number-1)
weekly total for any album in four years, beaten only by Swift’s last
two albums: “Reputation” (1.2 million in 2017) and “Lover” (867,000 a
year ago).

By comparison, Drake’s “Scorpion,” a monster streaming hit, opened with
the equivalent of [732,000
sales](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8464342/drake-scorpion-debut-no1-billboard-200-chart-sets-streaming-record)
in 2018, while Kendrick Lamar’s “DAMN.” notched
[603,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-damn-billboard-debut.html)
the year before that.

Selling more than one million copies in a single week — [once a Swift
specialty](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/arts/music/taylor-swift-lover-sales.html)
— may no longer be possible in the streaming era, but through canny
marketing Swift has kept her numbers as high as almost anyone can. (One
exception: Adele, who had [stratospheric
numbers](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/business/media/adele-shatters-music-industry-truisms-by-going-against-the-grain.html)
the last time around, and has a new album in the works.)

“Folklore” may also be one of the last blockbuster releases to take full
advantage of one of Nielsen and Billboard’s [most contested
rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/billboard-charts-bundles.html),
over the so-called bundling of albums — selling a copy of an album along
with another item, like merchandise or a concert ticket. Billboard is
set to [stop
counting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/arts/music/billboard-ticket-merchandise-bundles.html)
most of these deals in October.

When her album was announced, Swift’s website was fully primed to
deliver her album in an array of deals for items like a [$49
cardigan](https://twitter.com/bybrianbyrne/status/1289312401360187392)
and a $15 phone stand. In addition, Swift sold [17 physical
versions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/arts/music/juice-wrld-taylor-swift-billboard.html)
of “Folklore” — eight CDs, eight LPs and a cassette tape — that surely
lured large numbers of collectors and fans. Swift’s 846,000 sales total
is a composite number that includes 615,000 copies sold as a full album.

Yet Swift’s surprise release strategy brought its own momentum, and in
the days after its release it was a legitimate sensation online — as
well as a [critics’
favorite](https://www.metacritic.com/music/folklore/taylor-swift), [for
the most
part](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html)
— that drew 290 million streams. The “Folklore” single “Cardigan” also
debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100.

Swift did manage to avoid one piece of potential competition in her
opening week. Kanye West, her eternal celebrity nemesis, had announced a
new album, “[Donda: With
Child](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/arts/music/taylor-swift-kanye-west.html),”
for the same day, but so far it has not materialized.

Also this week, Logic’s “No Pressure” opened at No. 2 with the
equivalent of 221,000 sales. Juice WRLD’s “Legends Never Die” falls to
No. 3 after [two weeks at the
top](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/arts/music/juice-wrld-taylor-swift-billboard.html),
and another posthumous rap album, Pop Smoke’s “Shoot for the Stars Aim
for the Moon,” is No. 4. The “Hamilton” Broadway cast album is No. 5.
