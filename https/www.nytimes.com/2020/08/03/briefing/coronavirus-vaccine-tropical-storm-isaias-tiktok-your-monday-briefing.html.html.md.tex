\subsection{Good morning. Microsoft talked to President Trump about
buying TikTok. Several countries are rushing their coronavirus vaccine
efforts. Let's start with a look at the growing adoption of police
reforms.}\label{good-morning-microsoft-talked-to-president-trump-about-buying-tiktok-several-countries-are-rushing-their-coronavirus-vaccine-efforts-lets-start-with-a-look-at-the-growing-adoption-of-police-reforms}}

In Washington, the efforts to reform policing have stalled. Congress
can't agree on a bill and has largely stopped debating the issue.

But changes are happening in cities across the country.

In the more than two months since the killing of George Floyd, 31 of
America's 100 largest cities have enacted policies restricting officers'
use of chokeholds, according to an analysis by Campaign Zero, a group
that advocates against police violence. In all, 62 of the 100 largest
cities now have such policies in place, including New York and
Minneapolis, where Floyd died after an officer knelt on his neck for
nearly nine minutes.

Atlanta, San Diego and 67 other cities now require officers to intervene
when a fellow officer uses excessive force, up from 51 before Floyd's
death. And five cities --- including Denver and St. Louis --- have
adopted \href{https://8cantwait.org/}{the suite of eight reforms that
Campaign Zero advocates}, up from two cities earlier this year.

have suggested that those eight policies are likely to be effective in
reducing police violence --- without increasing crime.

But police unions have generally opposed limiting the use of force,
saying it inhibits officers' ability to fight crime. And some
progressive critics of Campaign Zero argue that these reforms have been
tried before and put too much faith in officers to abide by new rules. A
better approach, they say, is
\href{https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep4xy7/what-does-defund-and-abolish-the-police-mean}{shrinking
police budgets}.

``If you don't have the standards, you can't enforce them,'' said Samuel
Sinyangwe, a data scientist and co-founder of Campaign Zero. ``One of
the key challenges moving forward will be, now that these standards have
been raised, how are we making sure officers who violate them are held
accountable?''

President Trump has also opposed most restrictions on policing.
\href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/10/biden-root-out-systemic-racism-not-just-divisive-trump-talk-column/5327631002/}{Joe
Biden} and many congressional Democrats favor a bill that would
condition federal funding on localities' banning chokeholds and
strangleholds.

The White House's ambitious initiative to speed production of a
coronavirus vaccine, Operation Warp Speed, has provided billions of
dollars in funding and cut through red tape. But it's also
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html}{endangering
the system set up to ensure safe drugs}, experts say. Some worry that
the administration will push regulators to give emergency approval to a
vaccine before the November election.

The U.S. isn't the only country trying to hurry the process.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/world/europe/russia-trials-vaccine-October.html}{Russia}
plans to begin a nationwide vaccination campaign in October, despite not
yet completing clinical trials. And
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html}{in

of doses of a vaccine candidate that is still in clinical trials.

Storm Isaias} brushed Florida's eastern edge yesterday, dousing the
state with heavy rainfall but failing to deliver the devastating punch

coast and possible tornadoes by tonight.

Much of the East Coast will get a soaking this week, forecasters say, as
the storm moves north. New York and New England are expected to be hit
Tuesday and Wednesday.

Microsoft is pressing forward on a possible deal to

the social media app TikTok}, the company said last night. The effort
took on a new urgency over the weekend after Trump threatened to ban the
app, which is owned by a Chinese company.

The president's plans appeared to change after he spoke with Satya
Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft.

\textbf{On the app:} The threat of a ban unleashed chaos this weekend,
as influencers issued teary --- and perhaps premature --- goodbyes to
their fans,

In her latest book, ``Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,'' the

race in America functions as an immutable caste system, a ``ranking of
human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the
presumed inferiority of other groups.''

Some anglerfish are terribly clingy boyfriends, physically fusing onto
females up to 60 times their size. The mating ritual, called sexual
parasitism, has long mystified scientists. Two genetically distinct
animals sharing flesh would normally set off a major immune response,
for the same reason transplanted organs in humans are often rejected by
a recipient's body.

But a new study says the fish have evolved to largely ditch a key part
of their immune systems, a change that hasn't yet been documented in any
other species.
