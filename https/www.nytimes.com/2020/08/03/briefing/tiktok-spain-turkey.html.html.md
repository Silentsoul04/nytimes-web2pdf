## Microsoft gets green light to buy part of TikTok

President [Trump gave the go-ahead on Monday for
Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
to pursue a potential acquisition of the Chinese-owned video app’s
operations in the U.S. TikTok will shut down on Sept. 15 unless
Microsoft or another company buys it, he said on Monday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a retreat from the president’s earlier threats to ban TikTok, an
app that has come under scrutiny after lawmakers argued it could pose a
national security threat.

**What’s next:** In a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft said it would
finish discussions with TikTok’s parent company, the Chinese social
media giant ByteDance, by Sept. 15. The talks could result in the
purchase of the service in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand,
though discussions were still “preliminary.”

**Tech on notice:** Executives at TikTok have insisted that it does not
take direction from ByteDance. From the start, TikTok was made
unavailable in China so that users wouldn’t be subject to the Communist
Party’s censorship requirements, and their data was stored in Virginia
and Singapore.

But suspicion never dissipated that TikTok might give into pressure from
Beijing. TikTok’s sudden change of fortunes [might cause other Chinese
tech companies to re-evaluate their own international
ambitions.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html)

**Related:** A tide of [Chinese scholars have turned against
Western-inspired
ideas](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/world/asia/china-hong-kong-national-security-law.html)
that once flowed in China’s universities, instead promoting the proudly
authoritarian worldview ascendant under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party
leader.

## Turkey’s aggression worries some in NATO

Turkey — increasingly assertive, ambitious and authoritarian — has
become [“the elephant in the room” for
NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/turkey-nato.html),
European diplomats say.

Despite being a NATO member, the country has bought a Russian air
defense system, and its energy ambitions and a recent push into Libya
nearly led to armed conflicts with France and Greece.

But alliance officials suggest it could be too big, powerful and
strategically important to allow an open confrontation, our diplomatic
correspondent writes.

Turkey has dismissed criticism of its behavior as unjustified. But some
NATO ambassadors believe the country is challenging the organization’s
democratic values and its collective defense.

**Details:** Turkey is at odds with its Western allies over Libya,
Syria, Iraq and Russia, as well as the energy resources of the eastern
Mediterranean. The strongman rule of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, has also unsettled other NATO members. Without consistent U.S.
leadership, analysts say that Turkey is getting a kind of free
pass.

## Spain’s former king quits the country

The former king of Spain, Juan Carlos, said on Monday that [he was
abandoning his country amid multiple financial
inquiries](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/juan-carlos-leaves-spain.html),
including a money laundering and tax evasion investigation.

In a letter addressed to King Felipe VI, his son and Spain’s current
monarch, Juan Carlos said his decision to leave was taken “with the same
eagerness to serve Spain that inspired my reign.”

Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 amid health problems and scandals that
were undermining the reputation of Spain’s monarchy. His legal problems
have continued, and his departure may fuel Spain’s political and social
debate over the monarchy’s future.

**Response:** Spain’s left-wing deputy prime minister, Pablo Iglesias,
said Juan Carlos’s decision to leave was a “flight abroad,” which he
called “unworthy of a former head of state.” The government said on
Monday that it respected his decision. But the monarchy is a point of
divergence between the two parties that formed Spain’s first coalition
government in January.

Spear gear has been selling out at dive shops up and down the east coast
of Australia since March, when the country began locking down because of
the coronavirus outbreak.

To understand why, our Sydney bureau chief slipped on some fins and took
to the water. He found that “spearfishing has become an increasingly
popular escape for people seeking calm, control and sustenance far from
the anxieties of land.” The “spearos,” as they are called, “all [find
something for their stomachs and
souls](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/australia/spearfishing-sydney-coronavirus.html)
in an act that is ancient and elemental.”

### Here’s what else is happening

**Poland:** The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the results of [President
Andrzej Duda’s narrow
victory](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/poland-court-presidential-election.html)
in elections last month, clearing the path for the country’s
conservative Law and Justice party to continue in power.

**Pakistan media:** The recent abduction of a prominent journalist,
Matiullah Jan, by state security officers has [renewed concerns about
press
freedom](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/asia/pakistan-media-abductions.html).
Two years into Prime Minister Imran Khan’s term, journalists and
activists say censorship is on the rise.

**In memoriam:** [John
Hume](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/obituaries/john-hume-dies.html),
a moderate Roman Catholic politician who was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize for his dogged and ultimately successful campaign to end decades
of bloodshed in his native Northern Ireland, died on Monday. He was
83.

### And now for the Back Story on …

## The next best thing to traveling

*When travel restrictions began to lock people in place all around the
world, our editors on the Travel desk began a new visual series called*
[*The World Through a
Lens*](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-world-through-a-lens)*. The
idea was to showcase beautiful and intriguing places, and to introduce
readers to aspects of global culture. Here’s an excerpt from* [*what the
editors told Times Insider about the
project*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/insider/letting-their-cameras-transport-you.html)*.*

Our goal with this series is slightly different from that of our typical
Travel fare. Instead of inspiring travel among our readers or describing
the travels of our contributors, we’re aiming to *approximate* elements
of travel itself — to provide a kind of virtual travel substitute that
soothes, transports and
distracts.

But escapism isn’t the only objective. At its best, travel can transform
us: It can awaken us to the restorative power of nature; it can broaden
our ability to understand and appreciate dissimilar cultures; it can
help us become more empathetic to people whose lives fall outside the
scope of our day-to-day routines. These, too, are things we hope the
series can provide, especially at a time when such transformations
aren’t available to many of us via direct experience.

To achieve all of that, we’ve tried to create immersive visual
experiences; every story in the series is driven by images. (Instead of
assigning photographers to shoot new work, we are relying on
photojournalists with previously shot, and unpublished, portfolios.)

We’ve also tried to create a more intuitive and symbiotic relationship
between images and text. (In most cases, the journalist who took the
pictures is also the one who wrote the copy.) And as a general rule,
we’ve avoided “service” information: no hotel plugs or restaurant
reviews, no recommended itineraries. The focus is on the people and the
places themselves, as seen and captured by some of the best
photojournalists in the world.
