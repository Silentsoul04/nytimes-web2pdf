The president of the \textbf{Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis}
suggested that it would be better for the economy if authorities across
the United States reinstated lockdowns to bring the spread of the
coronavirus under control.

``We're going to have flare-ups, lockdowns, and a very halting recovery
with many more job losses and many more bankruptcies,'' Neel Kashkari
said, speaking on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday.

``If we were to lock down hard for a month or six weeks, we could get
the case count down, so that our testing and our contact tracing was
actually enough to control it,'' Mr Kashkari said. ``If we don't do
that, and we have this raging virus spreading throughout the country
with flare-ups and local lockdowns for the next year or two, which is
entirely possible, we're going to see many, many more business
bankruptcies.''

``That's going to be a much slower recovery for all of us,'' he said.

He also said that given the low cost the United States government is
paying to issue debt, the government has room to spend to support the
economy.

``Congress should use this opportunity to support the American people,
and the American economy,'' he said. ``If we get the economy growing, we
will be able to pay off the debt.''
