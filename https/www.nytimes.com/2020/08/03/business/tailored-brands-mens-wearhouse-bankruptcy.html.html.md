# Men’s Wearhouse Owner Files for Bankruptcy

</div>

Tailored Brands, known for its clothing chains Men’s Wearhouse and JoS.
A. Bank, struggled as the pandemic shut stores and consumer demand for
office attire dropped.

The owner of Men’s Wearhouse and JoS. A. Bank, which once dominated the
market for affordable men’s suits, filed for bankruptcy protection late
Sunday, as demand plummeted for its corporate clothing with the
coronavirus pandemic keeping America’s office workers at home.

The company, Tailored Brands, had about 1,400 stores and 18,000
employees. It had already
[announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200721005319/en/Tailored-Brands-Announces-Plans-Reduce-Headcount-Close)
plans in July to eliminate 20 percent of its corporate jobs and close up
to 500 stores, and on Sunday said it planned to use the restructuring
process to slash its debt by at least $630 million.

“Our enduring commitment to help customers look and feel their best will
allow us to overcome the challenges of Covid-19,” Dinesh Lathi, chief
executive of Tailored Brands, said in a
[statement](https://www.tailoredstronger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TLRD-Infographic_08022020.pdf)
accompanying the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of Texas.

The apparel industry has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic,
prompting bankruptcy filings from retailers like the [Neiman Marcus
Group](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/business/neiman-marcus-bankruptcy.html),
[J.
Crew](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/business/j-crew-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html)and
[J.C.
Penney](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/jc-penney-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html).
[Lord &
Taylor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/business/Lord-and-Taylor-Bankruptcy.html),
once a major presence in America’s department stores, and its owner, Le
Tote, filed for bankruptcy several hours before Tailored Brands on
Sunday. The owner of Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant, [Ascena
Retail](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/ascena-bankruptcy-ann-taylor-lane-bryant.html),
which just a few years ago was one of the country’s largest retailers
for affordable professional clothing for women, sought Chapter 11
protection on July 23.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many clothing stores shut their doors during the lockdowns, leading to
unpaid rents and staff furloughs. Brick-and-mortar retailers had already
been struggling to adapt to the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer
behavior.

With millions of Americans unemployed or working from home, and a pause
on proms and weddings, demand has plummeted for Tailored Brands’ core
product: men’s suits. The company
[reported](https://ir.tailoredbrands.com/press-releases/detail/1893/tailored-brands-inc-provides-business-update-reports)
that in the three months that ended on May 2, net sales fell 60.4
percent from a year earlier.

[Brooks
Brothers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/business/brooks-brothers-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html),
a more upscale seller of suits and preppy clothes that has been in
business since 1818, also saw demand for its wares crater during the
pandemic. It filed for bankruptcy in early July.

Men’s Wearhouse was founded in 1973 by George Zimmer, who became known
for his catchy slogan in TV and radio commercials: “You’re going to like
the way you look. I guarantee it.” The business, catering to the common
man who wanted to look sharp for work without breaking the bank, took
off. Men’s Wearhouse had about 100 stores when it went public in 1992.

“They came out with an inexpensive option that allowed a guy to go in
and buy everything from one place, all at a certain quality and all at a
certain price point,” said Mark-Evan Blackman, assistant professor and
men's wear specialist at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “For many
years, they were considered by certain customers to be the only game in
town.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the company’s troubles predate the pandemic. In 2013, the company
abruptly [fired Mr.
Zimmer](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/dumping-the-face-and-founder-of-mens-wearhouse.html),
the executive chairman, saying he had been unwilling to cede control to
the board and had pushed to sell the company to private investors
against shareholders’ interests. In response, Mr. Zimmer [released a
letter](https://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/06/26/an-open-letter-from-the-ousted-mens-wearhouse-boss/)expressing
his concerns that the company was heading in the wrong direction.

Mr. Zimmer, 71, said it was painful to see the company seek bankruptcy
protection after he had invested so much of his life building it. He
attributes the company’s downfall to decisions made after his
contentious exit.

“It’s a crying shame,” Mr. Zimmer said in an interview. “I spent 40
years creating a really neat company, and it only took seven years to
destroy it.”

In 2014, Men’s Wearhouse acquired the men's wear company JoS. A. Bank,
forming the parent organization Tailored Brands. The merger was meant to
unite the two retail companies and capture a bigger share of the market
of budget-conscious suit buyers and renters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Instead of increasing sales, the merger mired Tailored Brands in debt.
On May 2, the company had long-term debt of $1.4 billion and $244.2
million of cash and cash equivalents.

“When you merge two poorly performing companies together and layer on a
lot of debt, it’s usually not a recipe for success, and it hasn’t been,”
said Ivan Feinseth, director of research for Tigress Financial Partners.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The merger was ill conceived, Mr. Feinseth said, because the two
companies had fundamentally different business models and it was
difficult and expensive to consolidate their inventory and
brick-and-mortar locations into one seamless enterprise.

At the same time, Tailored Brands faced other pressures. It struggled to
compete with the rise of fast fashion and the dominance of online
retailers, while saddled with the extensive real estate and operating
costs of maintaining stores.

It was also hurt by the [relaxation of office dress
codes](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/fashion/office-fashion-uniforms.html),
inspired by tech start-up culture. The casual workwear trend had such
sweeping influence that Goldman Sachs, a leader in an industry known for
its formality, gave its employees the [green
light](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-dress-code.html)
in 2019 to wear casual clothes.

“Fifteen years ago, every guy had a suit in his closet, whether he was a
plumber or a middle management administrator,” said Mr. Blackman of the
Fashion Institute of Technology. “That’s no longer the case. Tailored
garments have been hurting for a very long time.”

Tailored Brands, like most of the retailers that have filed for
bankruptcy during the pandemic, plans to stay in business and use the
Chapter 11 filing to cut down on debt and close stores. To sustain its
business, Tailored Brands will have to reinvent its business model and
significantly improve its online presence, said Anthony Campagna, global
director of fundamental research at ISS EVA, an analytics firm.

“There is a place in the market you can sell lower-tier men’s clothing,”
he said. “It’s just a matter of positioning it correctly.”
