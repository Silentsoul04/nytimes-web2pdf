Dirt Candy, the chef Amanda Cohen's vegetarian restaurant on the Lower
East Side, has emerged four months after closing. Her new menu includes
a vegetarian version of a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/8587-muffuletta}{muffuletta}
sandwich. Smoked celeriac never made it into the classic from
\href{https://centralgrocery.com/}{Central Grocery} in New Orleans. But
here, it's among the paper-thin layers of vegetables like eggplant,
zucchini and carrot interspersed with pickled stuff, vegan provolone and
yuba (tofu skin), and olive tapenade in a successful creation. It's sold
for takeout and delivery, and there are socially distant seats on the
sidewalk for instant gratification.

Muffuletta, \$13, Dirt Candy, 86 Allen Street (Broome Street),
