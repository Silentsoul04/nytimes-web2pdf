This has been the summer of new ice creams. I suppose that when you're
sheltering in place, there's nothing more tempting than a pint and a
spoon. A line of inviting Mexican-inspired flavors called Helados La
Neta has been introduced by High Road Craft, a bakery and ice cream
company in Marietta, Ga. (The company also makes Ciao Bella.) Among the
offerings are a distinctive vanilla; cinnamon-scented horchata; deep
chocolate; nubbly coconut; delicate strawberries and cream; rum raisin;
and avocado and lime. The ice creams are sold at Walmart, ShopRite and
Kroger stores, among others.
