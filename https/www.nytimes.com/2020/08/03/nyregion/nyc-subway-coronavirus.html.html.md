Not many people are riding the subway these days — being cooped up with
strangers in a subway car must surely be among the riskiest activities
possible during the coronavirus pandemic.

But that may not be entirely true. Even as riders have returned in
greater numbers to public transit in Europe and Asia, there has been a
lack of corresponding superspreader events, [my colleague Christina
Goldbaum
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/nyregion/nyc-subway-coronavirus-safety.html).
A superspreader is an infected person who transmits the virus to many
others.

So while experts say riding the subway is probably riskier than walking
outdoors, it is also probably safer than dining indoors.

Here are some takeaways from her article:

**In countries where the outbreak has waned, there have been no notable
superspreader events linked to mass transit.**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Beijing, subway ridership has risen to about 60 percent of
pre-pandemic levels; in Berlin, ridership on buses and subways is 60 to
70 percent of normal rates; and in Paris, ridership on the Métro has
returned to 45 percent of usual
levels.

Superspreader events, however, have not emerged.

**Still, public health experts warn that the evidence so far should be
met with caution.**

Even in cities where ridership is up, it has not reached pre-pandemic
levels. A full return, with jam-packed subway cars, still poses a
danger.

There are also other factors that may affect whether outbreaks occur.
They include the quality of ventilation systems used to filter air, and
the level to which a city has reduced its overall infection rate.

As a result, tracking clusters of coronavirus cases to public transit is
difficult: The chances that infected people would remember the precise
train car they rode in is unlikely, and reaching those who were in that
same car is nearly impossible.

Even looking back at the worst months in New York City, officials are
not clear on the degree to which mass transit contributed to a surge
that killed more than 20,000 people.

**New York officials are now focused on how to draw riders back while
avoiding crowding at rush hour.**

Subway ridership in the city is still at about 20 percent of
pre-pandemic levels. For the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the
agency that runs the city’s subway and buses and that relies on fare
revenue for 40 percent of its operating budget, that’s a problem.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But there are things that can lessen the risk of riding the subway.

In the months since the height of the outbreak in New York, the
authority has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the daily
disinfection of train cars, distributed over a million masks to riders
and started public service campaigns encouraging riders to maintain
social distance.

New York transit officials say that a recent observational study of more
than 220,000 riders found that over 90 percent were wearing masks.

In New York’s subway trains, transit officials say, the air that
circulates through a car is replaced with fresh, filtered air at least
18 times an hour, much higher than the recommended air-exchange rates in
restaurants or in offices.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

## And finally: Ask your questions about the pandemic

The United States recorded more than 1.9 million new coronavirus
infections last month, more than double any previous monthly total. In
New York, the city is opening up but taking protective measures.

To help us all understand the recent events and what the future might
hold, we recently asked you to send in your questions about the effects
of the virus on daily life. Readers of The Times’s California Today
newsletter, for example, asked [how massage therapists were
adapting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/essential-workers-massage-therapists.html)
to the pandemic and what people should know before [visiting state and
national
parks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/california-parks-coronavirus.html).

We’re curious about everything — what do you want to know about the
economy, health care, the environment, the arts, dating, traveling and
more? How are you experiencing life during the pandemic, and how can we
help you make sense of those changes?

Dear Diary:

As I left the No. 6 train station at Bleecker Street, I noticed two
young men on the corner. One was holding a map, and they both had
puzzled looks on their faces as they scanned the nearby street signs.

I asked whether they needed help.

The one with the map said he knew where they were but couldn’t find the
spot on the map.

I pointed out Houston Street a block away, and then showed them where it
was on the map. They thanked me.

As I started to walk away, the second man reached out his hand — not to
shake mine, but to give me a $1 bill.

It was the only time I’d been offered a tip for giving directions.
