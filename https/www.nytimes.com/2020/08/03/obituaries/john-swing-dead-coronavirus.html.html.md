*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

When Food & Wine magazine declared in a headline last year that
“[Historic Filipinotown Is L.A.’s Next Great Dining
Neighborhood](https://www.foodandwine.com/travel/restaurants/historic-filipinotown-restaurants-los-angeles),”
an unseen player in this rise was neither a chef nor a restaurateur.

John Eric Swing spent the last five years helping restaurants and other
small businesses in the community through a nonprofit called [Search to
Involve Pilipino Americans](https://sipacares.org/), or SIPA. In April
he became the organization’s executive director.

“John basically got me started,” said Justin Foronda, a registered nurse
who in 2017 decided that he wanted to start a restaurant. “I didn’t know
anything about finance or running a business. But I’m passionate about
my neighborhood, and passionate about food. He was a master connector.
Any question you asked, the answer was always ‘Yes.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After Mr. Foronda opened [HiFi Kitchen](https://www.hifi-kitchen.com/)
in February, he had at least one stream of steady customers: Mr. Swing’s
weekly entrepreneurship class.

Mr. Swing got to enjoy the restaurant, and to see a protégé turn a dream
into a working business, before the pandemic surged in Los Angeles. He
contracted the novel coronavirus and died on June 28 in a hospital in
Fountain Valley, Calif. The immediate cause was pneumonia and an
ischemic stroke, according to a
[statement](https://www.gofundme.com/f/john-eric039s-fight-with-covid)
by his family. He was 48.

An online memorial for him drew speakers like the city’s mayor, Eric
Garcetti, and the filmmaker Ava DuVernay.

“We’ve lost a community builder at a time when we need community
builders,” said [Mitch O’Farrell](https://cd13.lacity.org/), a City
Council member. The Council adjourned for a day in honor of Mr. Swing.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He was such a bright presence, full of optimism; I wouldn’t even know
what his face would look like not smiling,” Mr. O’Farrell said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Swing was born in Los Angeles on May 2, 1972, the oldest of three
children of Filipino immigrants, Ellis D. and Aurora S. Swing. His
father is a political consultant and businessman; his mother is a
retired clinical laboratory scientist.

Mr. Swing earned a bachelor’s degree in ethnic studies from the
University of California, Riverside, in 1995 and spent six years in the
Marine Corps Reserves as a personnel and administrative clerk, the
family said.

After a stint as a probation corrections officer in Riverside County, he
worked as an education and health consultant for programs in Costa Rica,
Vietnam and the Philippines. Returning to Los Angeles, he worked at
several Filipino-American cultural and business organizations before
joining SIPA.

Along with his parents, he is survived by his wife, Ellen
Rodriguez-Swing; his children, Zachary, Joshua, Chloe and Mackenzie; his
stepchildren, Sasha and Nicco; a sister, Karen Bromley; and a brother,
PJ Swing.

He died with plans unrealized, including a workshop to address
anti-Black stereotypes among Filipinos. He also took part in community
efforts, like a nearly $500,000 city ****
[project](https://www.theeastsiderla.com/neighborhoods/historic_filipinotown/plans-unveiled-for-452-000-gateway-to-historic-filipinotown/article_096736f6-ad28-11ea-8a45-d34c6d8d6822.html#:~:text=%22Historic%20Filipinotown%20will%20have%20a,%2C%22%20O'Farrell%20said.&text=Designed%20by%20Filipino%20artist%20Eliseo,Gabay%3A%20Our%20Guiding%20Star.%E2%80%9D)
to build a gateway arch and columns marking the entrance to Historic
Filipinotown, which crosses the neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver
Lake.

Next up was a plan to redevelop SIPA’s headquarters to include 64 units
of affordable housing. Its small business center will bear Mr. Swing’s
name.

“He always said he believed he worked in the culture of changing lives,”
said [Jessica del Mundo](https://sipacares.org/about/board/), executive
secretary of the board at SIPA. “That to him was what the nonprofit
world meant. It wasn’t just about uplifting
Filipinos.”
