\textbf{To the Editor:}

Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/opinion/russia-china-nuclear-weapons.html}{China's
Troubling Nuclear Buildup}'' (Op-Ed, July 31):

I agree with James Anderson, acting under secretary of defense for
policy, on the importance of arms control agreements and including other
nuclear powers in arms talks. Reducing the number of nuclear weapons in
the world is a worthwhile goal that enhances international security.

However, the United States and Russia account for 90 percent of the
world's nuclear weapons. Ending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
and the limits it imposes on the world's two largest nuclear arsenals is
no way to advance nonproliferation. Likewise, the treaty's limitations
on nuclear weapons and its irreplaceable monitoring and verification
regime are vital to arms control.

The United States should demonstrate global leadership by renewing New
Start, which President Vladimir
\href{https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2019-12-19/us-russian-nuclear-arms-control}{Putin
has already agreed} to do. At the same time, we can begin holding
multilateral arms control discussions with other nuclear powers. I
support including China and other nuclear powers in future talks and
agreements, but that should happen apart from an immediate extension of
New Start.

Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/opinion/coronavirus-testing-cuomo.html}{How
to End the Wait for Test Results},'' by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York
(Op-Ed, Aug. 1):

I am surprised that the governor is advising other states about fast and
efficient testing.

My daughter and I were tested on July 2, and we did not get our results
back until July 13, making them virtually useless. We are not alone;
many of her friends were tested around the same time and they had an
eight-day wait for results.

I would like to know what facility is giving a two- to three-day
turnaround, because I don't know anyone who has had such a good
experience.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

If airlines can safely fly a half-filled plane across the country for
five hours, why can't we safely half fill a classroom for five hours a
day? The solution is simple: Passenger planes rely on HEPA air filters
to remove coronavirus pathogens. Classrooms could easily do the same
thing with portable air purifiers that not only use HEPA filters to
clean the air but also use UV lamps and plasma ionization that are
proved to kill coronaviruses.

For less than \$1,000 to \$3,000 per classroom our kids could be going
back to school in safe classrooms. If our Washington friends can fund
tens of billions of dollars to airlines, surely we could fund \$10
billion to schools for air purification. This would benefit kids, their
parents and the economy.
