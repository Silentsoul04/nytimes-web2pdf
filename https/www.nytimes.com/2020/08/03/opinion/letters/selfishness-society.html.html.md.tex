Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/opinion/us-republicans-coronavirus.html}{The
Cult of Selfishness Is Killing America},'' by Paul Krugman (column, July
28):

While I agree with the headline, I think the article missed the mark.
This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is failure of the
broader society. Masks have become political theater, no different from
the knocking over of statues or the destruction of private property.
Neither the left nor the right is justified in its respective behaviors.

We as Americans have a fundamental right to disagree. We do not have the
right to trample on others' property, health, thought process or social
well-being. It is a failure of the society at large to peacefully and
respectfully disagree. This is not a partisan issue. All of us own this,
and it needs to be fixed.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

Paul Krugman has been warning us for years about right-wing hypocrisy
and the essentially anti-democratic ways of modern-day Republicans, and
his take on a ``cult of selfishness'' is once again correct and urgent.

Today's G.O.P. values applied to the virus response can actually be
measured in tens of thousands of needless American deaths and, as Mr.
Krugman has so often stated, the steady destruction of an America built
for the common good. Sadly, the voting criterion for the average
Republican and for the professional Republican in Congress is now too
often: ``What's in it for \emph{me}?''

This triggers the other telltale measure of destructive selfishness ---
unshakable support for a lawless and destructive president.

How can the American experiment survive if one of our two major parties
is complicit in Trumpist corruption and negligence and if once again too
many voters opt for some self-obsessed or self-deluded agenda, rather
than a better nation for all?

\textbf{To the Editor:}

I agree with Paul Krugman about ``the cult of selfishness,'' but it is
not confined to ``the modern U.S. right.'' It has become a quality of
Americans regardless of political beliefs. I doubt the people who
gathered for a posh party concert in the Hamptons recently were thinking
about politics when violating social distancing. Do you think people are
thinking about racism when deciding not to give poor children greater
equality?

Selfishness is everywhere. The elite progressives and right-wing
conservatives and everyone else in the mix are selfish, and it is
damaging to people and our democracy. Let's all take time to think about
how to change our own selfish behavior before attacking others.
