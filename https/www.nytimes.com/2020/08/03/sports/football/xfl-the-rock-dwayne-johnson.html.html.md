In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the XFL football league
shut up shop, just five weeks into its ballyhooed restart. [Then it
filed for
bankruptcy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/sports/football/xfl-bankruptcy-vince-mcmahon.html).
It seemed like an abrupt, but final, end for the revived league, which
first rose to notoriety for a single season 19 years ago.

But now the league has found some buyers for its assets. And one of them
is the Rock.

Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as the Rock; Dany
Garcia, his business partner and ex-wife; and the investment firm
RedBird Capital Partners bought what remained of the XFL for $15
million, pending bankruptcy court approval, it was announced on Monday.

Johnson said in a statement that he looked forward to “creating
something special for the players, fans and everyone involved for the
love of football.”

A news release did not specifically report when or if the XFL would be
revived. It said the new owners planned “to option live entertainment
intellectual property for further expansion across sports, live events
and original entertainment programming.”

“This is a Hollywood ending to our sale process, and it is an exciting
new chapter for the league,” Jeffrey Pollack, the XFL’s president, said.

The league’s chief executive and commissioner, Oliver Luck, [filed a
wrongful termination
lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/sports/football/xfl-oliver-luck-vince-mcmahon-sued.html)
against the league’s former owner, Vince McMahon, in April. Luck, the
father of the former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, said he
was fired without cause days after the league declared bankruptcy.

The colorful original XFL, begun by the World Wrestling Federation,
lasted just one season, in 2001, but is remembered for its nicknames,
flamboyant announcers, innovative rules and sometimes prurient halftime
entertainment.

The new league kept the name, but [promised a back-to-basics
approach](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/sports/football/xfl-preview.html)
for the 2020 season with no gimmicks. It did continue to innovate with
the rules, offering teams a chance to go for 1, 2 or 3 points after a
touchdown.

The league drew an average of about three million viewers in its first
week, but the audience was halved by the time it shut down in March. The
championship was never awarded, although the Houston Roughnecks were the
only undefeated team.

Although the coronavirus was the immediate cause of the league’s
shutdown, it had always faced an uphill climb to counter the resources
and audience of the N.F.L. The United Football League, the Fall
Experimental Football League and the Alliance of American Football all
closed down after short runs in recent years.

Pollack spoke of a “100-year brand” before the season in February, which
very quickly looked like a poor prediction. The chance of restarting
minor league football in the current world environment seems close to
zero.

In time, perhaps the Rock can reinvigorate the XFL, though how, where
and when remain to be seen.
