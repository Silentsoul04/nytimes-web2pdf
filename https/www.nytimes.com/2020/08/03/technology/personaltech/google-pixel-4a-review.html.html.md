People generally adore Google for bringing useful technology to the
masses at an aggressively low price, if not free.

For those who like that, I have happy news: Google is getting really,
really good at the price cutting, while still bringing quality, with its
smartphones.

The evidence? The Pixel 4A smartphone, which the company introduced on
Monday.

With this latest device, Google took the best stuff from its[$800
high-end
Pixel 4](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/technology/personaltech/pixel-4-review.html)
— specifically, an excellent camera system and a large, bright screen —
and squeezed it into the body of a $350 device. That’s $50 less than
[last year’s
Pixel 3A](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/technology/personaltech/pixel-3a.html),
which was Google’s first budget phone.

The Pixel 4A is cheaper than high-end devices largely because it lacks
the frills in fancy phones, like wireless charging and a face scanner.
But for what you pay, it’s a great value. Its camera quality and bright
screen are on a par with many of the best smartphones out there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like the [$399 iPhone
SE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/technology/personaltech/apple-iphone-se-review.html),
which Apple released in April, the Pixel 4A is a sign that you no longer
need to pay through the nose for a great smartphone with a nice camera.

Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for Creative
Strategies, a consulting firm, said Google’s prowess in software was
helping bring down the price of premium smartphone technology.

“It’s been a long time coming for this market, which has always been
focused on the high end because of the dominance of Samsung and the
iPhone,” she said.

I tested the Pixel 4A for two weeks, including comparing it against the
budget iPhone. Here’s what I found.

## Focusing on What We Care About

Google, which prides itself on being driven by data, surveyed its
customers to find out [what they wanted in a
smartphone](https://www.statista.com/chart/5995/the-most-wanted-smartphone-features/).
A large screen, long battery life, lots of storage and great camera
quality were among the features that people cared most about.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For the most part, that’s what you get with the Pixel 4A. Let’s run
through its features:

  - The screen measures 5.81 diagonal inches and relies on OLED (organic
    light-emitting diode) technology, a newer type of display that can
    be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and
    contrast than its predecessor, LCD, or liquid crystal display. For a
    device in this price range, this is a very roomy, attractive
    display, with nice colors and deep shadow detail.
    
    Its colors aren’t as accurate as the screen on Apple’s $999 iPhone
    11 Pro, which is nearly identical in size, but at this price, I
    can’t complain.

  - The 4A has a reasonably long battery life, though your mileage may
    depend on what you do. On a typical workday juggling emails, calls
    and texts, I had more than 30 percent battery life left in the
    evening. But on weekends, when I had downtime, playing games and
    watching videos with the 4A drained the battery in a few hours. This
    is typical of smartphones.

  - The 4A comes in only one model with a generous amount of storage:
    128 gigabytes, which is enough for most casual users to store
    thousands of photos and lots of apps and games. This was a wise
    decision by Google. Whenever I talk to people about their tech
    problems, running out of storage on their phone is a frequent
    complaint.

  - Pixel phones are famous for their camera system, which has software
    features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning.
    The Pixel 4A has Google’s most important camera features, including
    Portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect, which puts a
    picture’s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the
    background. It also offers Night Sight, which makes photos taken in
    low light look as if they had been shot in normal conditions,
    without a flash.

The 4A lacks some features that were in the Pixel 4 — such as wireless
charging and a face scanner for unlocking the phone. That’s not a
dealbreaker for a device this cheap.

But Google left out one big feature that does matter: water resistance.
That would save a phone that was accidentally dunked in a toilet or left
out in a storm. So it was disappointing not to have it because
durability was another feature that people wanted most in their
smartphones.

The company left out water resistance because it put priority on other
features while reducing the price from last year’s Pixel 3A, a Google
spokesman said.

## Pixel Versus iPhone

The 4A’s strengths and weaknesses are best illustrated in a side-by-side
comparison with Apple’s iPhone SE. Here’s a rundown of where each one
came out on
top.

### **Camera**

**Winner: Pixel 4A.** Though both phone cameras produced very clear,
satisfying photos in bright light, the Pixel’s camera was slightly
better than the iPhone’s camera. That was partly because of the Pixel’s
ability to take photos in low light, a feature that is useful in some
situations, like a family photo inside a dimly lit
restaurant.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

### Screen

**Winner: Pixel 4A.** The Google phone’s screen is notably larger than
the iPhone’s, which measures 4.7 diagonal inches and uses older,
dimmer-looking LCD screen technology.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### Power

**Winner: Pixel 4A.** On average, after a day of heavy use, the Pixel 4A
had plenty of battery left by the evening. The iPhone SE’s battery was
usually almost empty by supper time. (Unlike the Pixel 4A, the iPhone SE
does have wireless charging, which [is not a must-have
feature.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/technology/personaltech/wireless-charging-pros-cons.html))

### Durability

**Winner: iPhone SE.** The Apple phone is water and dust resistant.
That’s a major benefit for budget-conscious consumers who want their
phone to last many years.

### Performance

**Winner: iPhone SE.** Gaming and web browsing are noticeably smoother
on the budget iPhone. The Apple handset uses the same mobile computing
processor as the one found in Apple’s high-end phones, which is the
fastest on the market. People who plan to use their phone heavily for
work tasks may prefer the iPhone.

### Storage

**Winner: Pixel 4A.** The iPhone SE starts at $399 with 64 gigabytes, a
modest amount of storage that can be quickly gobbled up if you take lots
of photos. To get an iPhone SE that matches the 128 gigabytes in the
Pixel 4A, you would have to shell out $449.

## The Bottom Line

Both the budget Pixel and Apple phones are excellent values. Some may
prefer the Pixel 4A for its richer set of features, while others may
choose the iPhone for its greater longevity.

What’s clear is that the tech giants are now aggressively competing to
offer bang-for-the-buck phones. For several years, especially after the
introduction of the [$999 iPhone X
in 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/technology/personaltech/apple-iphone-x-review.html),
it felt as if phone prices were only going up. It’s a relief that the
Pixel 4A is not only better than its predecessor but also cheaper.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So why would you spend $800 for the Pixel 4 if the Pixel 4A, for less
than half the price, is also very good minus some superfluous features?

The clear answer: Only gadget enthusiasts should have to pay a premium
for cutting-edge tech.

The rest of us now have the option to save.
