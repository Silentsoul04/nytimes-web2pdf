# Trump Reverses Course on TikTok, Opening Door to Microsoft Bid

</div>

The president said he did not object to a potential acquisition of the
Chinese-owned app, retreating from comments about banning the service.

WASHINGTON — President Trump gave the go-ahead for [Microsoft to pursue
an
acquisition](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html)
of TikTok, in his first public comments about the popular Chinese-owned
video app after he had threatened to ban it from the United States
entirely.

At the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said that TikTok would shut down
on Sept. 15 unless
[Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/navy-seal-museum-kaepernick.html)
or another company purchased it, and that he had suggested in a call
this weekend that the chief executive of Microsoft “go ahead” with the
acquisition.

“It can’t be controlled for security reasons by China,” Mr. Trump said
of TikTok, adding that he did not mind if Microsoft or another very
secure, “very American” company bought it instead.

Mr. Trump said such a purchase would funnel a large amount of money to
China, and argued that the United States should receive money in return
for letting the deal happen, without explaining how that would work.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“A very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into
the Treasury of the United States, because we’re making it possible for
this deal to happen,” Mr. Trump said.

His comments indicated at least a temporary reprieve for TikTok, which
has come under scrutiny in Washington for its Chinese ownership. Trump
administration officials and lawmakers of both parties have argued that
the app, which is known for dance videos and other fun viral clips,
could pose a national security threat by potentially giving the Chinese
government access to vast quantities of American user data.

Executives at TikTok have insisted that it does not take direction from
[ByteDance, its parent company in
Beijing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html).

Microsoft declined to comment on Monday. TikTok said in a statement that
it was “committed to continuing to bring joy to families and meaningful
careers to those who create on our platform as we build TikTok for the
long term.”

A special government panel that examines national security threats, the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, has extended its
deadline by 45 days to allow [Microsoft to explore the
purchase](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft-tweens.html),
a person familiar with the matter said. The 45-day extension was
[reported earlier by
Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-trump-exclusive/exclusive-trump-gives-microsoft-45-days-to-clinch-tiktok-deal-idUSKBN24Y0UD).

After months of deliberations, that panel had recommended that TikTok
sell its assets to an American company to curtail China’s potential
influence in the United States, and [Microsoft had stepped
forward](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html)
as a potential buyer.

But several China hawks in the Trump administration, including the White
House trade adviser Peter Navarro, argued against the sale, seeing the
moment as an opportunity to take more sweeping action to ban TikTok and
other Chinese-run internet services like Tencent’s
[WeChat](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/trump-china-wechat-tiktok.html).

On Monday, Mr. Navarro doubled down on that approach, suggesting that
Microsoft should be required to divest any business it had in China if
it bought TikTok. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Navarro accused
Microsoft of enabling Chinese censorship and surveillance through
products like Skype and its search engine, Bing.

“This is not a white-hat company,” he said.

Mr. Trump appeared to take Mr. Navarro’s side on Friday, saying that he
did not favor a sale of TikTok and that he instead planned to ban the
app entirely. But after [a series of
calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html),
including from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and
Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, Mr. Trump appeared to
change his mind.

Several of Mr. Trump’s aides had warned that a ban could prompt an
intense legal battle, as well as hurt the president’s popularity with
younger Americans. TikTok has said 100 million Americans use it.

TikTok acquired something of an anti-Trump reputation in June, after
some of its users boasted that they had registered for thousands of
tickets to Mr. Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., to [embarrass the
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html),
but pro-Trump content on the app is widespread. Some of its most popular
users are conservatives, and the hashtag \#conservative has 1.9 billion
views.

In [a blog post on
Sunday](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/),
Microsoft said it would “move quickly to pursue discussions with
TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, in a matter of weeks” and conclude
the talks no later than Sept. 15.

Microsoft said the talks could result in its purchase of TikTok’s
service in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, though
it cautioned that the discussions were still “preliminary.” The company
also said any deal would include transferring any and all user
information to servers in the United States. Microsoft may also bring on
other outside minority investors if a deal moves forward.

Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.
