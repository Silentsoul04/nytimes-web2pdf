\section{The Last California County Without a Coronavirus
Case}\label{the-last-california-county-without-a-coronavirus-case}}

Monday: The virus found its way into tiny, remote Modoc County. Also:
The Apple Fire prompted evacuations, and a successful astronaut return.

\textbf{My colleague}
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller}{Thomas Fuller}}
\textbf{traveled to Alturas to report on a county that had been
mercifully isolated from the coronavirus --- until last week.}

Here's his dispatch:

Evergreen forests surrounded by lumpy mountains and vast valleys filled
with thousands of cattle. Residents of Modoc County, population 8,800,
like to point out that social distancing was a way of life well before
the coronavirus arrived in California. Alturas, the Modoc County seat,
has a single red flashing traffic signal at the intersection of what
maps show as major highways but are really just winding two-lane country
roads.

For five months, officials in Modoc had hoped that the county's
isolation in the northeastern corner of the state would spare it from
the virus. And until last week, when a couple in Alturas tested
positive, Modoc had been the last county in California without any
confirmed cases.

Now the message seems clear: If the virus made it to Modoc County, where
the closest big town is a two-hour drive, it's everywhere in California.

Modoc may be isolated, but it is not an island. The Modoc County Health
Services Department did not identify the two people who contracted the
virus, but Jodie Larranaga, an owner of the Brass Rail, a bar and Basque
restaurant, said a waitress who worked at the bar was one of the people
who tested positive. The waitress and her husband had recently returned
from a family vacation to Fresno, Ms. Larranaga said.

When it announced the infections on Tuesday, the Health Department asked
any residents who visited a bar in the past two weeks to call a hotline.
But Ms. Larranaga said that was not casting the net wide enough.

``This couple has been all over the place,'' she said. ``They were all
around town.''

Alturas had gone ahead with a July 4 parade and had hosted motocross
races. Most residents still go maskless at supermarkets in Alturas,
despite a statewide order to wear them in public places. Tex Dowdy, the
Modoc County sheriff, refuses to implement the mask order.

Juan Ledezma, the owner of a thrift store in Alturas, said most of the
two dozen daily customers came in without a face covering.

``I would say 20 percent wear masks,'' he said. ``I don't ask them to do
it because they might get offended.''

Rick Holloway, the publisher and editor of The Modoc County Record, the
county's weekly newspaper, says mask wearing often breaks along partisan
lines.

``To most of the people here, it's more of a political statement than a
health statement,'' he said.

``I would like to think that we're going to do a better job of trying to
prevent more people from getting Covid,'' he said, ``but I wouldn't bet
on it.''
