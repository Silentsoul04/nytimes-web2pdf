\subsection{Back-to-school outbreaks}\label{back-to-school-outbreaks}}

The school year is underway in some parts of the United States --- and
we're already seeing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage\#link-4c85ed64}{how
fraught reopening classrooms can be}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  On Saturday, the superintendent of the Elwood Community School
  Corporation in Central Indiana sent a note thanking students and
  parents for ``a great first two days of school!'' But several staff
  members then tested positive, and the high school was forced to close
  its doors.
\item
  Just hours into the first day of classes at Greenfield Central Junior
  High School, also in Indiana, the county health department notified
  the school that a student had tested positive. The student was
  isolated, and others who had been in proximity were forced to
  quarantine for two weeks.
\item
  At a high school in Corinth, Miss., someone also tested positive
  during the first week back, and exposed students there were asked to
  stay home for 14 days.
\end{itemize}

These scattered outbreaks are exactly what you would expect given
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html}{the
high levels of viral transmission in many U.S. states}, as we reported
on Friday. And there are surely many schools that opened without a
hitch, at least so far. But over the next few weeks, we will undoubtedly
see many more outbreaks --- and that could push districts teetering on
the question of whether to allow in-person teaching right off the edge.

\textbf{In other school coronavirus developments:} Gov. Larry Hogan of
Maryland
\href{https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1290330304830246912}{issued
an emergency order} counteracting Montgomery County's health department,
which on Friday said that all private schools needed to

the year teaching remotely}. Montgomery County is home to some of the
nation's most prestigious private schools, including St. Andrew's
Episcopal School, attended by Barron Trump, the president's youngest
child.

Debbie Krebs went to the hospital in March with lung pain and a cough,
and a doctor swabbed her nose for the coronavirus. A week later, the
laboratory called with her results: negative. But when the hospital bill
arrived, the coronavirus test was missing. Without it, Ms. Krebs didn't
qualify for protections Congress had put in place that barred insurers
from charging patients for visits meant to diagnose the coronavirus. She
was told she owed \$1,980.

Across the United States, Americans like Ms. Krebs are receiving
surprise bills for coronavirus care. Tests for the virus can cost \$199
to \$6,408 at the same location. A coming wave of treatment bills could
be hundreds of times higher.

This patchwork of medical billing is one reason our colleague Sarah
Kliff, an investigative reporter who covers health care, is starting
something new today: She's asking readers to send in copies of medical
bills for coronavirus testing and treatment. She told us that the prices
hospitals and insurers negotiate are kept secret from the public, and
patients often don't know the price until they get a bill.

``It's a very inefficient method to ask people to send in their bills,
but it's the best strategy we've got,'' Sarah told us. ``My hope is to
really shine a light on how this is affecting patients. And then, people
can make decisions about where to be treated, and legislators can decide
if something should be done to change this.''

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
