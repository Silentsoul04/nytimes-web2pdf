# Kansas Senate Primary Has Arrived, and the Anxiety Over Kobach Is High

</div>

Republicans worry that if Kris Kobach, a polarizing figure in the state,
wins the nomination, it would pave the way for Democrats to capture the
seat and perhaps gain control of the Senate.

Republican anxieties about control of the Senate are reaching new
heights this week as the Kansas Senate primary hurdles to a close, amid
[fears in
Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach-trump.html)
that the firebrand candidate and staunch Trump supporter Kris Kobach
could win the nomination but lose a longtime red seat in November.

As the national political environment has worsened for the G.O.P.,
putting a number of traditionally safe conservative seats into play,
many Republicans have grown especially focused on Kansas — and concerned
that if Mr. Kobach, a polarizing figure in the state, wins on Tuesday,
Democrats could take the seat and perhaps gain control of the Senate.

“A Kobach candidacy could put Schumer one step closer to becoming the
leader,” said Scott W. Reed, the senior political strategist at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, referring to the Senate minority leader, Chuck
Schumer. Mr. Reed’s group is supporting Representative Roger Marshall in
the primary contest.

The primary is one of several high-profile contests that will unfold
across the country on Tuesday, including the race for the seat of
[Representative Rashida
Tlaib](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/rashida-tlaib-brenda-jones-primary.html),
the prominent progressive Michigan congresswoman, and [a sheriff’s
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/arizona-election-joe-arpaio.html)
in Maricopa County, Ariz., where the immigration hard-liner Joe Arpaio
is running for his former position.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who has run for office
[multiple
times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html),
has long been a controversial figure because of his severe views on
issues including immigration and voting rights. He has cultivated a
devoted conservative following but also discomfited many more moderate
Republicans in the process.

His [2018 run for
governor](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/laura-kelly-wins-kansas-governors-race.html)
— he eked out a primary win with [President Trump’s
endorsement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/kris-kobach-trump-kansas.html),
only to lose to Democrat Laura Kelly in the general election — further
convinced some party leaders that he would uniquely endanger the Senate
seat this year, a fear backed by Senate Republican polling. It’s a
conviction [he
dismisses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach-trump.html)
as “establishment” angst.

Mr. Kobach is running in a crowded Republican field against candidates
including Mr. Marshall and [Bob
Hamilton](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article244374532.html),
a businessman who started a successful plumbing company and has lent his
campaign several million dollars (tagline: “Send in a plumber to drain
the swamp.”). All three have spent time campaigning in person across the
state in recent days. Mr. Marshall embarked on what he called a
“campaign countdown tour,” and Mr. Kobach has been hosting events
centered around discussing the Constitution.

Strategists studying the race described a close and fluid contest, and
they headed into Primary Day with uncertainty about the outcome. Some
were also [bracing for a slow tabulation of the
results](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article244625722.html)
to account for large numbers of mail-in ballots.

It has been 88 years since Kansas [sent a
Democrat](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach.html)
to the U.S. Senate, and the state remains fundamentally conservative
terrain. But top Republicans acknowledge that at a challenging moment
for their party — as Mr. Trump faces strong disapproval for his handling
of the coronavirus crisis — Kansas is not a sure bet in a general
election Senate race, especially if a well-known and polarizing
candidate is on the ticket.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, Mr. Trump remains overwhelmingly popular with the Republican base
— he won the state by more than 20 percentage points in 2016 — and party
leaders have implored him to endorse Mr. Marshall, whom they consider
the strongest potential candidate in a general election. But he has so
far stayed on the sidelines, stoking [tensions between Capitol Hill and
the White
House.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach-trump.html)

The primary battle has been extraordinarily negative, defined by a
seemingly constant stream of attack ads leveled on television and in
mailers sent to
voters.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Marshall, who represents the “Big First” District in western Kansas
— a sprawling seat that often propels statewide Republican victors —
has made clear through his own advertising that the size of the field is
of great concern. He has singled out in particular Mr. Hamilton and Dave
Lindstrom, a businessman and former Kansas City Chiefs player, trying to
convince Kansans that supporting those candidates would divide the vote
and aid Mr. Kobach.

“Bob Hamilton + Dave Lindstrom = Kris Kobach,” read one mailer from Mr.
Marshall’s campaign, the letters sketched on an image of a chalkboard.
“Math can be complicated — elections shouldn’t be. A vote for Hamilton
or Lindstrom is a vote for Kris Kobach.”

The winner of the primary is expected to face State Senator Barbara
Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist who [until recently was a
Republican](https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article222990385.html),
and did not have a significant primary battle of her own.

“Most of the ads that have been run on the Republican side are negative
and getting more negative by the moment, so there’s a lot of collateral
damage that will be left on the playing field,” said former Gov.
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat. “It’s always nice in a situation like
this to have the opportunity — which Barbara, I think, is taking great
advantage of — to introduce herself in a very positive way. To use this
time, without a primary opponent, to make sure she’s known, gets to
define herself, before Republicans come after her.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Certainly, Ms. Sebelius acknowledged, running statewide in Kansas is a
challenge for any Democrat.

For many religious conservatives, voting for a Democrat is a nonstarter
because of their opposition to abortion rights and desire to see
conservative Supreme Court justices appointed. And plenty of more
centrist, business-oriented voters who recoil from Mr. Trump’s
incendiary style are nevertheless reluctant to see a Democratic majority
in the Senate.

But the [moderate suburbs in the Kansas City
area](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach.html),
where Ms. Bollier lives, have moved away from the Republican Party in
the Trump era. And some Republicans are concerned that she has benefited
from the internecine warfare on their side of the aisle, making her more
resilient against the ultimate nominee.

“We had a crowded primary,” acknowledged Chairman Mike Kuckelman of the
Kansas Republican Party, who is still optimistic about keeping the seat
in November. “It cost a lot of money that could have been used in the
general. It’s taken up a lot of time. But that’s the way it goes. I wish
it’d been otherwise. I think we’re ready to get it all behind us.”
