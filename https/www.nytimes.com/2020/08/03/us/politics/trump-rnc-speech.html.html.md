# Gettysburg? The Liberty Bell? Trump Weighs R.N.C. Speech Options

The president and his aides are holding out hope for ambitious

or a speech by Melania Trump from Seneca Falls, N.Y.

WASHINGTON — A presidential address in front of the Gettysburg
battlefield, or at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. A speech from the
first lady, Melania Trump, at Seneca Falls, N.Y., the cradle of the
national movement for women’s rights. Perhaps a stage for the warm-up
acts built at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.

These are some of the scenarios that have been under discussion among
[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
and his top aides as they hold out hope for an ambitious, Trumpian
display over four nights of Republican National Convention programming.

Despite the surging coronavirus pandemic, which forced Mr. Trump to
[cancel the convention in Jacksonville,
Fla.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html),
after moving it from its original location in Charlotte, N.C., he and
his advisers are counting on some form of the spectacle to serve as a
boost to the flagging incumbent as he heads into the final stretch of
the campaign.

Mr. Trump has said he plans to travel to Charlotte to thank delegates
who are still planning to gather there for meetings and the official
roll call, despite the state’s social distancing requirements.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But his advisers have been thinking bigger, according to six people
involved in the efforts, looking for ways to re-create what they view as
the president’s most successful speech since the virus halted regular
events: his address in front of Mount Rushmore over the July 4 weekend,
when Mr. Trump described his effort to win a second term as a battle
against a [“new far-left fascism” seeking to wipe out the nation’s
values and
history](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mount-rushmore.html).

The Democrats have [condensed their planned convention in Milwaukee to
almost
nothing,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee.html)
shrinking a gathering of 50,000 people to something that may have as few
as 300 attendees. And Mr. Trump has now twice been forced to upend his
plans to deliver a rousing renomination speech in front of a packed
crowd of fans, conceding that “to have a big convention is not the right
time.”

But Mr. Trump’s advisers are still pushing for some version of the show
to go on, and searching for historical locations that they want to
reinforce the messages of the various convention speakers.

The idea of having Ms. Trump speak from Seneca Falls, the site of the
[1848 Seneca
Falls](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-rights/seneca-falls-convention)
women’s rights convention — a move that advisers thought could offer the
president a boost as he tried to win back women in the suburbs — was
briefly considered. But it was deemed to be too difficult to pull off in
a short time frame. A spokeswoman for Ms. Trump did not respond to a
request for comment about her convention plans.

In meetings at the White House, Trump advisers have also discussed the
possibility of returning to Mount Rushmore for an encore performance.
And they have proposed to Mr. Trump other national monuments closer to
the White House that could serve as outdoor vistas for his renomination
speech on Aug. 27.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One such venue that drew Mr. Trump’s attention was Gettysburg, a
wide-open national park with a built-in theme about a country divided
against itself. The aides thought the setting would flatter Mr. Trump by
allowing him to draw a comparison he loves: one between himself and
Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Trump [delivered a speech at
Gettysburg](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html)
during his campaign four years ago, calling it an “amazing place” and
suggesting that the country was as divided as it had been during the
Civil War. He also said that the election was rigged against him and
that he planned to sue the women who had accused him of aggressive
sexual advances (he never did).

A White House official said the president was leaning toward a series of
speeches that could be held outdoors in different places, and a stage
that would serve as the main hub of activity all week in Washington. It
is also not yet clear if any of the ambitious plans will come to
fruition for a convention set to start on Aug. 24.

Some aides have been pushing for Mr. Trump’s own Washington hotel, just
down the street from the White House, to serve as the convention week
hub. But other Washington locations are currently being more seriously
considered.

“Conventions have gone the way of the dinosaur,” said Brian Ballard, the
top Republican lobbyist in Florida and a major party donor, who was one
of the key fund-raisers for the convention when it was set for
Jacksonville. “But the acceptance speech matters more than anything
else. I hope they find an iconic location. It will be unique, and make
history.”

Mr. Trump has also indicated both privately and publicly that he likes
the idea of giving his renomination speech from the confines of the
White House — a move that would technically be legal but blurs the line
between political candidate and public servant. Other presidents have
come close to the line — President Barack Obama filmed two political
advertisements in 2012 from the chief of staff’s office in the West Wing
— and Trump advisers said they were on solid legal footing if Mr. Trump
spoke from the residence rather than the West Wing.

So far, however, little except an overarching theme about the “forgotten
men and women of America” has been finalized, and Mr. Trump has been
characteristically indecisive about signing off on any plans. Tim
Murtaugh, the campaign’s communications director, said the convention
would still be “a celebration of the accomplishments of President Trump
on behalf of all Americans.”

Aides said they were planning programming that would reflect the kinds
of stories highlighted every year during the State of the Union address,
featuring speakers who are regular Americans with stories to tell about
how their lives were affected by opportunity zones, school choice
scholarships, or other initiatives promoted by the administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Campaign advisers claimed that they were in no rush to announce more,
and that the campaign could benefit from an element of surprise in
whatever location and program the president ultimately settled on.

The group involved in the convention planning from within the White
House includes veterans of Mr. Trump’s 2016 election effort. Among them
are Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who is overseeing his
entire re-election effort; Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor
and 2016 campaign manager; Hope Hicks, a senior adviser; and Stephen
Miller, the chief speechwriter. Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the
Republican National Committee, has also been deeply involved, along with
Justin Clark, the deputy campaign manager; Jason Miller, the campaign
strategist; and one of Mr. Trump’s go-to pinch-hitters, Tony Sayegh, a
former top official in the Treasury Department who also helped the White
House communications department navigate Mr. Trump’s
impeachment.
