WASHINGTON — At [a virtual congressional hearing in
May](https://www.c-span.org/video/?472163-1/fed-reserve-chair-treasury-secretary-testimony-coronavirus-relief-bill),
Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, asked Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin for help. A struggling trucking company in his state was
on the brink of collapse and needed government support.

Eager to assist, Mr. Mnuchin assured the senator that “we will look at
that specific company and see what we can do and get back to you.”

That company, YRC Worldwide, had lost more than $100 million in 2019 and
was being sued by the Justice Department over claims it defrauded the
federal government for a seven-year period. But six weeks after the
hearing, YRC received a bailout from the Treasury Department — [a $700
million loan in exchange for a 30 percent stake in the
business](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/YRC-Transaction-Summary.pdf).
The company’s stock price soared 74 percent, though it has come down
since.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rescue, which was approved on the grounds that YRC was critical to
national security, made the company one of the largest recipients of
taxpayer money meant to support businesses and workers struggling amid
the coronavirus.

It has also raised questions about whether YRC benefited from a web of
connections between the company and the White House that allowed it to
bypass the Trump administration’s own rules for which companies should
be eligible for federal help.

YRC has financial backing from Apollo Global Management, a private
equity firm with close ties to Trump administration officials. In 2019,
a group of funds managed by affiliates of Apollo [lent YRC $600
million](http://investors.yrcw.com/news-releases/news-release-details/yrc-worldwide-announces-new-term-loan-agreement).
In April, President Trump tapped YRC’s chief executive, Darren Hawkins,
to serve on a coronavirus economic task force and in January, he
nominated the company’s former chief executive, William Zollars, to the
United States Postal Service’s board of governors.

The loan has come under scrutiny from the Congressional Oversight
Commission, a bipartisan panel created by Congress to police stimulus
funds. Last month, the commission opened an inquiry into whether the
company, which ships meal kits, protective equipment and other supplies
to military bases, was really worthy of a rescue.

YRC’s loan came from a discrete $17 billion pot of money set up by
Congress and controlled by Mr. Mnuchin to help companies that were
designated as critical to national security. It was the first company to
receive a loan from that fund.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The company has said the loan will be used to pay pension and health
care costs and to invest in trailers and
trucks.

For months, the money went untouched, in part because the loans come
with strict terms and requirements and corporations must be willing to
hand over equity stakes in their companies to the federal government. To
be eligible, most companies are supposed to have government contracts
that involve emergency preparedness functions or top-secret facilities.
The Treasury Department submits all applications that do not meet those
criteria to the Defense Department for review.

That is what the Treasury Department did with YRC’s application, saying
in a news release that the approval for the loan “was based on a
certification by the secretary of defense that YRC is critical to
maintaining national security.”

A [July
report](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/files/documents/Oversight%20Commission%20-%203rd%20Report%20\(FINAL\)_7.20.20.pdf)
from the Congressional Oversight Commission raised questions about the
decision to grant the loan, asking why delivering food to bases was
vital for national security and why the Treasury Department appeared to
seek special signoff from the Defense Department to ensure that YRC was
considered eligible. The panel, which was created as part of the
legislation that was signed in March to oversee distribution of $2.2
trillion in federal virus relief, said it found the agreement
questionable and predicted that the government could end up losing money
on the deal given the company’s precarious financial position.

Some members of the commission also want to look into whether YRC’s
relationship with Apollo influenced the approval of the loan, according
to a person familiar with the matter. No decision has been made about
moving the inquiry in that direction. The commission, which will hold
its first hearing on Friday morning, has the power to request documents,
call witnesses and coordinate with other congressional committees on
oversight matters.

The loan has raised questions of favoritism in part because it appears
to flout the Trump administration’s own public assertions that it would
not use taxpayer money to prop up individual companies or bail out
businesses that were in financial trouble before the pandemic struck.
The YRC loan appears to be an exception.

“YRC was already in a precarious position given that they weren’t a very
profitable company, they were already losing volume and market share,
and they’ve been trying to turn this around forever,” said David Ross,
an analyst at the investment firm Stifel. “In normal times when you have
a recession, companies that aren’t the best companies go
away.”

The relationship between Apollo and the White House runs deep. In 2017,
Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo, [advised the Trump administration on
infrastructure
policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/jared-kushner-apollo-citigroup-loans.html)
and discussed a possible White House job with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s
son-in-law and senior adviser. That same year, Apollo lent $184 million
to Mr. Kushner’s family real estate firm, Kushner Companies, to
refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.

Since the pandemic, Apollo has been lobbying the Trump administration to
[allow broader access to an emergency Federal Reserve lending
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/business/economy/apollo-federal-reserve-lending-talf.html).

The government lifeline to YRC was a boon to Apollo, which might have
been faced with liquidating its decaying trucking assets if the company
was forced to close.

Apollo, which is YRC’s biggest creditor, said it was not involved in
YRC’s decision to seek the Treasury Department loan and noted that it
is one of several lenders invested in the company. However, a
spokeswoman acknowledged that it was advised of the government loan and
made changes to its own loan terms with YRC to accommodate
it.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

Mike Kelley, a YRC spokesman, declined to comment.

The Treasury Department declined to explain why it determined that YRC
was worthy of a loan. In announcing the decision on July 1, Mr. Mnuchin
said, “This loan will enable a critical vendor to the Department of
Defense to maintain significant employment while providing appropriate
compensation to taxpayers” and estimated that 30,000 trucking jobs would
be saved. A Defense Department spokesman referred questions to the
Treasury Department when asked why YRC was critical to the country’s
security.

YRC’s relationship with the government has not always been cozy. In
2018, the [Justice Department sued
YRC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-sues-freight-companies-systematic-overcharging-shipments),
accusing it of overcharging and defrauding the Defense Department out of
millions of dollars over a seven-year period. Prosecutors said YRC
inflated the weights of thousands of shipments, billing the government
based on those false numbers in what was described as “an affront to
American taxpayers.”

YRC attributes the complaint to an old contractual dispute and says it
has a motion for dismissal pending.

YRC’s fortunes have been fading for years, beginning in 2009 when two of
its shipping competitors, FedEx and Conway, engaged in a price war in
hopes of driving it out of the market. Last year it posted a net loss of
$104 million. As of the end of March it [had $880
million](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/11/2031400/0/en/YRC-Worldwide-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results.html#:~:text=OVERLAND%20PARK%2C%20Kan.%2C%20May,net%20gain%20on%20property%20sales.)
in outstanding debt.

Analysts attributed its financial malaise to a long period of
mismanagement and neglect of its fleet of trucks.

Amit Mehrotra, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said that YRC’s fleet was twice
as old as the industry average and that many of its competitors had been
thriving despite the economic upheaval, suggesting that the pandemic
merely accelerated the company’s demise. Although it would be
inconvenient for the Defense Department to terminate its contract if YRC
went out of business, he said, there are plenty of capable alternatives
in the shipping market.

“Their crisis is not a product of Covid,” Mr. Mehrotra said. “Their
crisis is borne of years and of under investment in their assets.”

As the pandemic shuttered large swaths of the U.S. economy this spring,
freight volumes at YRC fell sharply. The company began shedding workers,
delayed payments to health funds for its union workers and, in late
April, applied to the federal government for financial assistance.
Moody’s Investors Service cut the company’s ratings and Mr. Ross, of
Stifel, halted estimates of its earnings, noting the high degree of
uncertainty facing the company.

“Will YRC live to fight another day?” Mr. Ross wrote in a note to
clients in May.

To government watchdog groups that have been tracking the Trump
administration’s economic relief effort, the real question is whether a
company such as YRC should live on. That is especially pertinent when
difficult choices are being made about extending unemployment insurance
and funding schools with personal protective equipment.

“It sends a chilling message to the American people that the Trump
administration has no problem throwing nearly a billion dollars to
wealthy, well-connected companies like YRC, while they refuse to provide
adequate assistance for the unemployed or protect workers as the
pandemic worsens,” said Kyle Herrig, the president of Accountable.US.
