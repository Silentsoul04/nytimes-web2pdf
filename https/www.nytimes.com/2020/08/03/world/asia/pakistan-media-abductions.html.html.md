# Abductions, Censorship and Layoffs: Pakistani Critics Are Under Siege

</div>

Recent abductions of a journalist and an activist have underscored
Pakistan’s worsening rights conditions as the country’s security forces
pressure the news media and human rights groups.

When Prime Minister Imran Khan boasted last year that Pakistan had one
of the “freest presses in the world,” [journalists were quick to
object](https://rsf.org/en/news/after-year-press-freedom-violations-rsf-writes-pakistans-premier),
saying that intimidation of reporters across the country was
intensifying. It has only gotten worse since.

Two years into Mr. Khan’s term, censorship is on the rise, journalists
and activists say, leaving the country’s heavy-handed military and
security forces unchecked as they intimidate the news media to a degree
unseen since the [country’s era of army
juntas](https://tribune.com.pk/story/459782/when-musharraf-silenced-the-media).

The security forces frequently pressure editors to fire or muzzle
reporters, journalists say, while the government starves critical news
outlets of advertising funds and refuses to [settle previous bills worth
millions of
dollars](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/659532-extraordinary-delay-in-payment-of-media-dues-apns-extremely-concerned-over-govt-inaction).

The [abduction of a prominent
reporter](https://www.dawn.com/news/1570325)by state security officers
in late July, coupled with the [disappearance of a rights
activist](https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/take-action/where-is-idris-khattak/)in
November, has heightened those concerns. In June, Pakistan’s Military
Intelligence<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>agency admitted
that it had detained the activist and that he is awaiting trial in a
secret court on undisclosed charges.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Disappearances are a tool of terror, used not just to silence the
victim but to fill the wider community with fear,” said Omar Waraich,
the head of South Asia for Amnesty International.

“In Pakistan, the military’s intelligence apparatus has used
disappearances with impunity,” Mr. Waraich said, adding: “Civilian
politicians look on helplessly, affecting concern and promising to
investigate. Unable to uphold the rule of law as Imran Khan vowed to do,
their authority erodes.”

On July 21, the reporter, Mattiullah Jan, had just dropped off his wife
at her job in an upscale neighborhood in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad
when several men, some in plain clothes, others in counterterrorism
police uniforms, dragged him from his car, bundled him into one of their
vehicles and sped away.

Mr. Jan, 51, is a vocal critic of Mr. Khan’s governing party, the
judiciary and the military, which critics accuse of working together to
preserve their power and stamp out dissent.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Footage from a security camera clearly shows the police’s involvement in
the abduction, working alongside men in civilian clothes that many
believe are Pakistani intelligence officers. The footage culminated in a
pressure campaign on social media and Mr. Jan was released 12 hours
later. He released a vague statement saying he had been abducted by
forces that are “against democracy.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Multiple requests to the Pakistani government and military to comment
for this article went unanswered. Pakistan’s security forces have not
publicly commented on Mr. Jan’s abduction.

Under Pakistani law, state-directed abductions like Mr. Jan’s are
lawful. The [detentions often go
unexplained](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/world/asia/14pakistan.html),
leaving the families of the victims wondering for months or even years
whether their loved one was killed in something as commonplace as a
hit-and-run accident or secretly detained by the security forces.

While Pakistan has long had a poor track record on press freedom, it has
gotten notably worse under Mr. Khan’s administration, which has been
widely seen as a high-water mark for military influence in the past
decade. Pakistan slipped six spots since 2017 — the year before Mr. Khan
took office **—** to 145th place out of 180 countries in the [2020 world
press freedom index](https://rsf.org/en/pakistan) compiled by Reporters
Without Borders.

In the last five years, 11 journalists have been [killed in
Pakistan](https://cpj.org/asia/pakistan/), seven of them since Mr. Khan
was sworn in as prime minister two years ago. Anchors have frequently
seen their newscasts cut off in the middle of broadcasting — a level of
censorship not seen since the era of military dictatorships in Pakistan.

Instead of establishing an outright dictatorship, human rights groups
say, Pakistan’s generals are effectively imposing their will through
their allies in a government that they helped usher into office.

During the 2018 elections,[the military was accused of
meddling](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/world/asia/pakistan-election-military.html)
to ensure victory for Mr. Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ******
party and to virtually dismantle the party of former Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, who had tried to curb the military’s powers. The military
has denied those
accusations.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As those elections drew near, the military accused reporters of being
anti-state, an allegation that was swiftly condemned by the [Committee
to Protect
Journalists.](https://cpj.org/2018/06/pakistan-army-spokesperson-accuses-journalists-of/)
After a series of articles detailing the military’s political and
electoral interference, the security forces disrupted the [distribution
of Dawn
newspaper](https://cpj.org/2018/05/pakistani-authorities-disrupt-distribution-of-dawn/)
across the country.

Over the past year, the country’s remaining critical news outlets have
been gutted by the combination of a devastated national economy and the
sudden elimination of government advertising dollars. Media
organizations have laid off dozens of journalists, and the combination
of heavy pressure and job insecurity has led many reporters to avoid
critical or controversial subjects.

Like many Pakistani reporters, Mr. Jan claims that he lost his job as a
popular talk show host just months after the election because of his
hard-hitting reporting. He now runs his own YouTube channel.

“This is the first time in the 31 years of my career where I’ve seen a
structural takeover of the media industry,” said Talat Hussain, a former
Geo TV news anchor who has been critical of the military and government.

Mr. Hussain said his company fired him under pressure from the military
shortly after Mr. Khan’s election. He has remained unemployed, with
newspapers and TV shows refusing to host his work.

“We have dealt with fairly tyrannical regimes that were elected and
dealt in repression, but it was episodic,” Mr. Hussain said. “This time
it is structural and complete and it’s hard to breathe.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Eventually, the authorities came after Mr. Hussain’s former boss. In
March, Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman, the owner of the Jang Group, which owns Geo
TV and The News newspaper, [was detained over accusations of
corruption](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/asia/pakistan-journalist-jang.html),
which Mr. Rehman has denied. Mr. Rehman has been held for over 100 days
without charges, and several bail hearings have been
postponed.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the rights activist Idris Khattak, 56, disappeared late last year,
there was no video footage to give his family the clarity that Mr. Jan’s
family had.

In November, Mr. Khattak’s 21-year-old daughter, Talia Khattak, left
Islamabad to go on a trip organized by her university. Her father told
her he would call her to check in multiple times a day.

During their last call, Ms. Khattak said her father sounded nervous and
there was a commotion in the background. He promised to call back in
“two or three days” before hastily hanging up the phone, an unusual
gap of time for him.

“Those two or three days have turned into eight months,” Ms. Khattak
said in an interview.

As the coronavirus rippled through Pakistan in the months after his
disappearance, the family’s panic deepened — Mr. Khattak’s health
issues, including diabetes, have proved dangerous in those stricken by
the virus.

Mr. Khattak’s disappearance was unusual. He retired about five years ago
from his advocacy work with groups including Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International. Mr. Khattak’s work focused on state-sponsored
abductions. But he had since lived a quiet and seemingly uncontroversial
life, his daughter said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Finally, in June, a rare admission came from the Military Intelligence
agency: Mr. Khattak was in its custody and would be tried in a secret
military tribunal.

“When you take someone, when you abduct them, those people have families
behind them. You’re ending all their lives,” Ms. Khattak said. “That
they can just do this, with no repercussions, is unconscionable.”

The authorities have not allowed Mr. Khattak’s family members to speak
with him. In the eight months he has been gone, they have received no
word about his health or that he is getting his medication.

The abduction of her father has thrown Ms. Khattak into a murky
political game as she tries to challenge the most secretive and
repressive parts of the Pakistani state.

“Whenever there is a journalist or activist in Pakistan speaking up on
sensitive issues, they disappear like this,” she said. “Papa didn’t do
anything illegal — all Papa did was speak
up.”
