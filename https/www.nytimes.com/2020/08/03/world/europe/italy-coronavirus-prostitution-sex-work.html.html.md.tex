the

Prostitution is not illegal in Italy, nor is it regulated as an official
occupation. But the coronavirus has forced many sex workers to accept
certain risks in order to avoid poverty.

MILAN --- When the mayor of Modica, a Sicilian town known for its
chocolates and churches, learned that a sex worker in the area had
tested positive for the coronavirus, he immediately started to worry
about an outbreak.

He made a frantic public appeal for clients to get tested, assuring them
that their wives wouldn't find out. But contact tracing proved difficult
as the mayor, Ignazio Abbate, began receiving anonymous phone calls from
men ``asking for a friend'' what the sex worker looked like.

The secrecy and stigma around unregulated sex work put ``everyone in
danger,'' Mr. Abbate said.

Modica has so far not experienced a new outbreak, but as the sex worker
recovered in a hospital in Perugia last month, news of her situation and
occupation spread throughout the country, highlighting the ways in which
the pandemic has affected some of the most vulnerable and marginalized
communities in Italy, and the dangers of keeping sex work in the
shadows.

``Of course I am scared,'' said Fernanda Ponciano, a 31-year-old sex
worker from Torre del Lago, in Tuscany. Ms. Ponciano started taking
clients again after a three-month hiatus during the lockdown. She works
as a maid in the morning and as a sex worker in the afternoon, she said.
She also supports her mother, her sister and a niece in Brazil.

``The fear of ending up homeless is bigger than that of Covid,'' said
Ms. Ponciano.

In Italy, prostitution is not illegal, nor is it regulated as an
official occupation, making the country's 70,000 sex workers largely
ineligible to receive economic relief. Many have been forced to take
their chances by returning to work in order to avoid poverty.

Mery Sommella, a 54-year-old sex worker in Bologna, stopped taking
clients in mid-March. By the beginning of April, she was unable to pay
for groceries and started relying on bags of food from a local charity.
She said she is too scared to return to work.

``For 40 years on the street I have been so careful to protect myself
from viruses,'' she said. ``I can't catch coronavirus now.''

In May, organizations that promote the rights of Italian sex workers
sought to draw the government's attention and get support, arguing that
the pandemic showed the harm of forcing sex work underground.

In other European countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, sex
workers can enter formal contracts with their clients. During the
lockdown, those who were officially registered with the government were
eligible for economic relief.

Scotland also included sex workers in its relief programs. In Greece,
where prostitution is legal and regulated, brothels were allowed to
reopen on June 15, provided that sex workers kept their clients' names
and contact details for four weeks for tracing purposes.

In Italy,
\href{https://www.produzionidalbasso.com/project/covid19-nessuna-da-sola-solidarieta-immediata-alle-lavoratrici-sessuali-piu-colpite-dall-emergenza/}{various
charities and associations have raised money} for groceries, medicines,
bills and rent to benefit the country's sex workers. But for the most
part, Italian sex workers, who are often from immigrant communities,
have had to fend for themselves.

In March, Regina Satariano, a 60-year-old sex worker in Tuscany, started
hearing about colleagues who hadn't eaten, and a landlord who had
threatened to evict a group of 17 housemates, all sex workers who were
out of work because of the pandemic.

Ms. Satariano put together her savings and bought bags of pasta, tomato
sauce, chicken and soap to distribute to her colleagues. But without
support from the state, she said, many sex workers will continue to go
hungry. If officials don't change things now, she added, ``they never
will.''

A recent report by the Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network and the
International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe showed
that many sex workers defied lockdown rules in order to work, putting
both themselves and their clients at risk.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/27/world/virus-italy-sexwork2/merlin_174996948_eed41ddb-6613-4c98-9aa7-16778c68de37-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The day after the sex worker from Modica was hospitalized in Perugia, a
young woman in the Veneto region, who the authorities said was involved
in prostitution, was also hospitalized with Covid-19. Reports soon
spread about another sex worker with the virus near Venice.

Last month, Antonio Guadagnini, a Conservative councilor in the Veneto
region, said reopening brothels --- illegal in Italy since 1958 --- and
regulating prostitution would protect society. In Sicily, Ruggero Razza,
the top regional health official, said that authorities should reflect
on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in high-risk,
unregulated occupations such as sex work.

    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

``Once again we were excluded from the system,'' said Pia Covre, a
former sex worker and the founder of the Committee for the Civil Rights
of Prostitutes, which promotes the legal recognition and regulation of
sex work.

She added that, after being excluded from government economic support,
sex workers were also deprived regular coronavirus tests and the
opportunity to keep a record of their clients for contact tracing.

The regulation of sex work is opposed by those who argue that it would
lead to more exploitation and human trafficking. The pandemic, they say,
hasn't changed that.

Senator Alessandra Maiorino, the spokeswoman for the Five Star Movement,
Italy's governing political party, has said that up to 90 percent of sex
workers are victims of human trafficking. Last June she signed a
petition to demand that Escort Advisor, Europe's largest sex worker
review website, be shut down.

She and others argue that hitting demand is the only way to end
prostitution while also protecting victims of human trafficking. But
rights organizations claim that abolition would only put sex workers
more in danger by pushing the industry underground.

Francesca Bettio, a professor of economics at the University of Siena
who specializes in issues related to sex work and human trafficking,
said that the regulations in the Netherlands and Germany, while better
than those in Italy, are not perfect.

Even in those countries, she said, many sex workers, especially those
who are undocumented, have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/world/europe/amsterdam-red-light-coronavirus.html}{fallen
through the cracks of the welfare system during the coronavirus crisis}.
And no approach has eliminated the persistent stigma around sex work.

In the hunt for those who might be spreading the virus, she said, ``sex
workers are the perfect target.''
