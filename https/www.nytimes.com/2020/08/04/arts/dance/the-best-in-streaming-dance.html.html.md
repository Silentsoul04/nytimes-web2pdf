## Watch: High-Altitude All-Stars

Situated in a Rocky Mountain resort town, [the Vail Dance
Festival](https://vaildance.org/) has never been the most easily
accessible event. But in this summer of digital or
([nearly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/arts/dance/kaatsbaan-dance-festival-stella-abrera.html))
nothing, it’s available to all, on YouTube through Aug. 15. Since this
year’s four programs are mostly a selection of performances filmed in
recent years, they offer a chance to discover what, apart from its
alpine setting, has made the festival distinct.

Vail is a bit like fantasy football or a bunch of all-star games. New
York City Ballet luminaries join with big names from American Ballet
Theater, alongside performers like the tap dance leader Michelle
Dorrance and the Memphis jookin prodigy Lil Buck. And unlike in similar
gala situations, the teams really mingle — shuffling rosters, swapping
repertory, collectively contributing to commissioned novelties. The new
combinations and collaborations are sometimes rough or superficial,
sometimes fresh and exceptional.

The “Now: Premieres” program, debuting on Tuesday, features two new
made-for-the moment videos. In Robert Fairchild’s “A Summer Place,” he
does a dreamy song and dance on his roof. In Bobbi Jene Smith’s “Mercy,”
she and Melissa Toogood and Calvin Royal III writhe attractively at the
seashore. But the festival’s core spirit is best captured in the final
selection, dropping on Friday: Ms. Dorrance’s 2017 “we seem to be more
than one,” in which the motley masters of many disciplines are adroitly
woven together with rhythm and with Bill Irwin reciting Samuel Beckett.
Forget all-star game: This is the ultimate dance camp finale.

As chipper as Mr. Fairchild appears up on the roof, he’s gone through a
lot of changes lately: leaving City Ballet for Broadway and movies,
ending his marriage. He’s had to let go of who he used to be, and he
[drew on that
experience](https://www.dancemagazine.com/robbie-fairchild-short-film-2639173287.html?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5)
for the 2019 dance short “In This Life,” which is streaming on [the
website of WNET All
Arts](https://allarts.org/programs/all-arts-performance-selects/life-fvtylu/)
starting Wednesday.

The 11-minute film, directed by Bat-Sheva Guez and written by Ms. Guez
and Mr. Fairchild, is structured around the five stages of grief, each
one imagined by a different choreographer in a different striking
location. For “Bargaining,” Mr. Fairchild gets soaked in the ocean,
baptized in Andrea Miller moves. For “Depression,” he does a clingy
Christopher Wheeldon pas de deux with a masked figure in a restaurant
bathroom. “In This Life” is a little horror movie and what holds it
together is the versatility and presence of its leading
man.

The coronavirus has cooped up dancers, but it has also given rise to a
spate of short films in which performers who normally ply their trade on
stages exult in spreading their limbs outdoors. On Aug. 13, [San
Francisco Ballet](https://www.sfballet.org/sf-ballet-home/) is debuting
another: “Dance of Dreams,” directed by Benjamin Millepied.

The dream here is one of free motion in space, and, in two duets, of
physical connection. But the six-minute short is equally a celebration
of San Francisco as a grand location for film. The choreography is by
Justin Peck, Christopher Wheeldon, Janie Taylor and Dwight Rhoden, and
the excellent dancers look liberated. But oh, the settings: the cliffs
of Sausalito, the Golden Gate shrouded in mist. The film ends in the
Palace of Fine Arts, where Hitchcock shot some of “Vertigo,” and that
movie memory is also in the music: the rich “Scene d’Amour” from Bernard
Herrmann’s
score.

This has been the season of very short dance films, often grouped in
series. Amid a deluge of videos inspired mainly by the lack of anything
else to do, the Instagram series
[\#MOVEforBLACKLIVES](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/moveforblacklives/)
stands out for its clarity of purpose.

Initiated and produced by the New York company [Matheta
Dance](http://mathetadance.com/), it’s a fund-raising project for Black
Lives Matter organizations and bailout collections. Donors were invited
to a choose a word from a list — “rise,” “breathe,” “heal,” “protest.”
Then a dancer, responding to that word, improvised on video, and
Matheta’s company manager, Terri Ayanna Wright, edited the footage
into a one-minute physical statement.

Since the project began, on Juneteenth, dozens of videos have accrued.
You might [start with “Fear.”](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCmnTQMMm_g/)
As Kendrick Lamar, in his track by the same title, calmly lists the ways
he might die, the Alvin Ailey dancer [Chalvar
Monteiro](https://www.dancemagazine.com/on-the-rise-chalvar-monteiro-2366853607.html)
dances with tenderness and beauty in the shadow of a fire escape. Fear
is present, but not only
fear.

Back in spring, when parents were going nuts trying to occupy
stuck-inside children, the family friendly New Victory Theater provided
a great service with its [“Arts
Break”](https://newvictory.org/stories/category/family-engagement/new-victory-arts-break/)
series of activity videos.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This summer, the theater has adapted its [New Victory
Dance](https://newvictory.org/virtual-events/new-victory-dance-2020/)
program, [which normally provides free dance
performances](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/arts/dance/dancing-and-hoping-to-win-fans-for-life.html?searchResultPosition=2)
to day camps and summer schools, into an online series for ages 8 and
up. Each 20-minute episode focuses on a company or choreographer;
there’s a terrifically diverse array, from the Afro-Mexican fandango
of Ballet Nepantla to the same-sex tango of Kate Weare.

Hosted by Patrick Ferreri, who has the manner of a dance-world Mister
Rogers, these casual videos allow the choreographers to introduce
themselves and share a performance excerpt. Then Mr. Ferreri strikes up
a conversation about the dance with young New Victory staff members and
leads a brief dance class based in that episode’s idiom. This all
culminates in a dance party, with the cast demonstrating how it’s done
from their kitchens and living rooms. The end, arrived at
unintimidatingly, is education.

This week’s installment is particularly inspiring. It features [the tap
queen
Dormeshia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/Dormeshia-tap-dancing.html?searchResultPosition=4)
and part of [her knockout show “And Still You Must
Swing.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/arts/dance/dormeshia-and-still-you-must-swing-review.html?searchResultPosition=3)
