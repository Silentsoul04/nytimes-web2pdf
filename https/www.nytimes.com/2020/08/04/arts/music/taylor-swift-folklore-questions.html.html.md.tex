Taylor Swift's ``Folklore'' is currently
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard-chart.html}{the
No. 1 album in the country}, earning the
\href{https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9428290/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard-200-number-1}{third-biggest}
weekly total for any LP in four years. (Only Swift's previous two albums
had higher numbers.) It marks a new approach for the singer and
songwriter: announced on short notice, made in relative isolation,
experimenting with avant-pop production styles.

On this week's Popcast, a roundup of questions about Swift and
``Folklore'' from Popcast listeners. Topics include: the sonic and
thematic leaps between Swift's albums, Swift's work with Bon Iver,
Swift's push-and-pull relationship with country music, the state of her
ongoing collaboration with Jack Antonoff, how important (or not) genre
is when it comes to ``Folklore,'' the parallels between Swift's choices
and similar ones from the Chicks and Justin Timberlake, and more.

Guests:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lauren Michele Jackson, an assistant professor of English at
  Northwestern University
\item
  Lindsay Zoladz, who writes about music for The New York Times and
  others
\end{itemize}
