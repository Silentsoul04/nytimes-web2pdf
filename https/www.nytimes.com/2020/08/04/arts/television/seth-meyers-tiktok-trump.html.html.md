# Seth Meyers: After TikTok, Trump Could Ban Candy Crush

joked on Monday’s “Late Night.”

## Trump Takes On the Teens

President Trump recently told reporters that, in the interest of
national security, he was considering a [ban of the Chinese-owned social
video platform TikTok in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/style/tiktok-ban-threat-trump.html).
Then, on Monday, [Mr. Trump confirmed that he had given
Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html),
which has expressed interest in buying the app, or any additional
American companies until Sept. 15 to acquire it.
