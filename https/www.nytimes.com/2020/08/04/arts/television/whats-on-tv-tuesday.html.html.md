## What’s on TV

**JOHN LEWIS: CELEBRATING A HERO** *10 p.m. on CBS.* On Thursday,
Representative John Lewis, [who died on
July 17](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html),
was [eulogized by three former
presidents](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/john-lewis-live-funeral.html?searchResultPosition=8)
at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Lewis, a luminary of the
civil rights movement, represented the city in Congress for more than
three decades, following his years as an activist working alongside the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In a continued celebration of his
legacy, Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Gayle King and Brad Pitt will host
this one-hour special that looks back at Lewis’s tireless civil rights
work and political career, featuring appearances by Common, Jennifer
Hudson, John Legend, Trevor Noah, Billy Porter and more.

**THE SWAMP** *9 p.m. on HBO.* A key rallying cry during President
Trump’s 2016 campaign was his promise to[“drain the
swamp”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-lobbyists-swamp-campaign.html)
by battling the corruption of special interests, lobbyists and big-money
donors in Washington. This documentary follows three Republican
congressmen who have tried to champion that mission: [Rep. Matt
Gaetz](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-trump.html)
of Florida, [Rep. Thomas
Massie](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/thomas-massie-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=5)
of Kentucky and [Rep. Ken
Buck](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/trump-republican-party.html?searchResultPosition=12)
of Colorado. Over the course of a year, they navigate fund-raising
requirements; the process of securing key committee assignments; and
relationships with lobbyists and special interest groups. The result is
a look at what substantial reform might actually require.

and [John
Carlos](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/sports/john-carlos-of-68-olympics-protest-maintains-his-passion.html)
stepped up to the podium, accepted their medals and raised their fists
during the national anthem to protest the treatment of Black Americans.
“Depending on your perspective, their silent gesture of protest was
one of the most disturbing images in the history of American sports, or
one of the most inspiring,” William C. Rhoden wrote of the protest in
[The New York
Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/sports/olympics/john-carlos-tommie-smith-committee-apology.html)
This documentary looks back on the circumstances that led to that
moment, as well as the way their protest has [inspired outspoken
athletes

Russia.](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/28/sports/hockey-from-russia-with-endorsements.html)
After the fall of the U.S.S.R., the famed Russian Red Army hockey team
became a pet project for a group of American investors. Under the
marketing whiz Steven Warshaw, the games were transformed into
spectacle, including bears on skates and exotic dancers, until oligarchs
and the Russian mob got involved.
