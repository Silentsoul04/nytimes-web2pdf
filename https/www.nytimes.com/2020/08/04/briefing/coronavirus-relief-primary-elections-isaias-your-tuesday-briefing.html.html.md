## Good morning. Five states are holding primary elections today. And President Trump said he would support Microsoft’s acquisition of TikTok. Let’s start with the reasons the stimulus bill has languished in Congress.

Democrats and Republicans in Congress started far apart on negotiations
over the latest coronavirus stimulus bill last month. They haven’t
closed the gap much since — even though extended unemployment benefits
expired Friday.

What’s getting in the way of a deal?

The gulf between the two sides’ proposals is one reason for the impasse.
“The policy differences are just that significant,” says Emily Cochrane,
who covers Congress for The Times.

Democrats’ $3 trillion bill, which the House passed in May, was a
nonstarter for Senate Republicans. Their $1 trillion counteroffer,
unveiled last week, includes reduced funding for state and local aid and
omits Democratic priorities like election security. Democrats want to
revive the lapsed $600 weekly unemployment benefit through January;
Republicans want to slash it to about $200.

A deal has also remained elusive because Republicans aren’t all in
agreement.

President Trump has [complicated his own negotiators’
jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/congress-jobless-aid-talks-trump.html)
by insulting Democrats and floating proposals, like a payroll tax cut,
that congressional Republicans have long since ruled out. “Republican
lawmakers and aides acknowledge they lost a week of valuable negotiating
time just trying to get on the same page as the administration,” Emily
says.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other Republicans — especially those not up for re-election in November,
like Senator Ted Cruz — say they’re worried a large stimulus bill will
increase the national debt, putting them at odds with members of their
own caucus.

So what comes next? “Another flurry of meetings on Capitol Hill, with
administration officials shuttling across the complex in an effort to
hammer out differences,” says Emily.

**In other stimulus news:**

  - Ross Douthat, a Times Op-Ed columnist, argues that the fissures
    among congressional Republicans over the bill foreshadow [possible
    fault lines in a future post-Trump
    G.O.P.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/opinion/trump-republicans-tea-party.html)

A small fraction of students in the South and Midwest have returned to
classrooms, and [the coronavirus is already disrupting
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/school-closing-coronavirus.html).
In one Indiana school district, the superintendent sent out a note
Saturday thanking students and parents for “a great first two days of
school\!” He also said several staff members had tested positive — and
the high school was swiftly closed.

“I’ve been in the business over 40 years — I have never experienced
anything like this,” said Lee Childress, a superintendent in Mississippi
whose district has seen three students test positive since last week.
“It’s kind of like drinking out of a fire hose because it’s happening

## 2\. Primaries to watch

Voters in five states will cast ballots in primary elections today.
[Here are a few races to
watch](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/elections/primary-election-michigan-arizona-kansas.html):

**Kansas:** Kris Kobach, the polarizing former Kansas secretary of state
and staunch Trump supporter, [hopes to win his party’s nomination for
the
Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/kris-kobach-kansas-senate-primary.html).
Republicans fear his candidacy would give Democrats a better chance to
take the seat — and, potentially, a Senate majority.

**Michigan:** Representative Rashida Tlaib — a member of the “Squad” of
progressive women of color in Congress — is facing a rematch with a
primary challenger she narrowly beat in 2018.

**Missouri:** Cori Bush, [an activist backed by the progressive group
Justice
Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/cori-bush-william-lacy-clay-missouri.html),
hopes to unseat the 10-term Democratic House incumbent William Lacy
Clay.

**Arizona:** Joe Arpaio, the 88-year-old former sheriff of Maricopa
County whose hard-line immigration stance earned him a criminal
conviction, [is running in a three-way Republican primary for a shot at
reclaiming his old
job](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/arizona-election-joe-arpaio.html).

After an initial threat to ban TikTok, Trump yesterday voiced [his
approval for Microsoft to pursue an acquisition of the popular
Chinese-owned video
app](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html).
He also argued that the U.S. government should get a “big percentage” of
the sale for allowing it to happen, without explaining how such an
arrangement would possibly work.

The events followed a pattern that Trump set early on in his presidency,
[Ana Swanson and Michael D. Shear
write](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-business.html),
“in which some of the world’s most powerful companies have found
themselves at his whims.”

**Bridging the gap:** From the beginning, Zhang Yiming wanted to create
a global tech company based in China. This is the [story of how TikTok’s
owner tried, and failed, to cross the U.S.-China
divide](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html).

## Here’s what else is happening

  - Isaias [made landfall in North Carolina last
    night](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/isaias-storm-updates.html)
    after again strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane, threatening
    heavy rainfall and flash floods as it moves up the East Coast. See
    the storm’s latest position on [our tracking
    map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/hurricane-isaias-tracker-map.html).

  - The Manhattan district attorney’s office suggested yesterday that it
    had been investigating Trump and his company for [possible bank and
    insurance
    fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html).
    Before this, the D.A.’s case had appeared largely focused on
    hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election.

  - Gymnasts around the world are [speaking out against a culture in the
    sport](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/sports/olympics/gymnastics-abuse-athlete-a.html)
    that has tolerated coaches belittling, manipulating and in some
    cases physically abusing young athletes.

  - The former king of Spain, Juan Carlos, announced he was [abandoning
    his
    country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/juan-carlos-leaves-spain.html)
    amid investigations into possible money laundering and tax evasion.

  - **Lives Lived:** Lady Red Couture cut a radiant figure within the
    Los Angeles drag scene and found wider fame with “Hey Qween\!,” the
    L.G.B.T.Q. talk show. “Honey, she was unique,” said the drag queen
    impresaria Lady Bunny. “She was 6-foot-7, wore size 16 Converse
    sneakers with an evening gown.” [Lady Red died
    at 43](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/arts/lady-red-couture-dead.html).

### **IDEA OF THE DAY: Cultural institutions**

  - In Foreign Policy, the journalist Nosmot Gbadamosi wrote about [the
    movement to “decolonize” museums and repatriate looted African
    art](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/28/time-repatriate-africa-looted-art-artifacts-cultural-heritage-benin-bronzes-nigeria-ghana-europe-british-museum/)
    from Western institutions, which has been bolstered by global Black
    Lives Matter and anti-racism protests.

  - “Baseball is never just about baseball,” Doug Glanville, a former
    major league player, [wrote in an essay in The Times’s Opinion
    section](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/opinion/baseball-coronavirus-Marlins.html)
    about the sport’s recent outbreak of coronavirus infections. “It is
    called our national pastime for a reason. The virus has dealt a
    serious blow not just to the league’s operation but, in some sense,
    to the nation itself.”

  - Why are fans flocking to Disney World since its reopening,
    undeterred by Florida’s outbreak? In The Atlantic, [Shirley Li
    breaks down what makes the parks “not just attractive, but
    vital”](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/when-disney-world-essential-destination/614890/)
    to their devotees. “I felt safer going to Disney than going to the
    grocery store,” one attendee told
her.

## Everything old is new again

Good news for nostalgic gamers everywhere: Video game developers, much
like remake-loving Hollywood, [are looking to their archives for fresh
material](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/video-game-remake-remaster-nostalgia.html).
Popular ’90s and early-2000s franchises like Resident Evil and Tony
Hawk’s Pro Skater are being overhauled, often to critical and
financial success. Lesser-known titles are banking on sentimentality,
too: the 2003 game “SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom”
released a “rehydrated” remake in June.

What makes them so popular? “Because you can actually revisit those
virtual spaces, it’s a more powerful type of nostalgia,” said one
expert. “It’s the same when you go back to it; it’s the same as it was
when you were
7.”

Padma Lakshmi wants the food world to be a little less white. The host
of Bravo’s long-running cooking competition “Top Chef” makes that point
with her latest show, “[Taste the
Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/dining/padma-lakshmi-taste-the-nation.html),”
where she spotlights different cultures’ cuisines across the U.S., from
cracking crab shells with South Carolina’s Gullah Geechee community to
comparing flour and corn tortillas along the border in Texas.

But the road wasn’t always easy. [In an interview, she
discusses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/03/magazine/padma-lakshmi-interview.html)
the difficulties of getting the show greenlit and the need for more
inclusive representation in food media. “There’s such a laziness — it’s
not often malicious — about reaching for the thing that is most
familiar,” she said.
