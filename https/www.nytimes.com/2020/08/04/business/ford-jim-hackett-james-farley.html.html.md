# Ford, Struggling in a Changing Industry, Replaces Its C.E.O.

Jim Hackett, who failed to impress Wall Street, will be replaced by
James Farley, an auto industry veteran who started his career at Toyota.

Three years ago, Ford Motor brought in a new chief executive, Jim
Hackett, to streamline the company’s inner workings and raise profits.

Now, after he achieved mixed results, the company is again turning to a
new boss, hoping he can accelerate the process and finish the job.

On Tuesday, Ford said Mr. Hackett will retire on Oct. 1 and will be
succeeded by James D. Farley Jr., whose promotion to [chief operating
officer in
February](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/ford-motor-jim-farley.html)
had fueled speculation that Mr. Hackett’s tenure was nearing an end.

“I am very grateful to Jim Hackett for all he has done to modernize Ford
and prepare us to compete and win in the future,” said William Clay Ford
Jr., Ford’s executive chairman. [The
company](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/ford-motor-company), he
added, is becoming “much more nimble.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Farley will take the titles of president and C.E.O., and join Ford’s
board of directors, the company said.

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of Steelcase, an office furniture
manufacturer that is much smaller and less complex, was named to [the
top job at
Ford](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/business/jim-hackett-ford.html)
in May 2017, as the company’s business was slumping under his
predecessor, Mark Fields. Mr. Hackett promised to revitalize Ford’s
operations and steer the company toward vehicles that would generate
profits — pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles — and invest in
emerging technologies like electric and self-driving vehicles.

The company is starting to introduce some of the models developed under
Mr. Hackett, including a redesigned F-150 pickup truck and a new series
of S.U.V.s under its dormant Bronco brand. The Mustang Mach E, [an
electric S.U.V. styled to resemble the storied sports
car](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/ford-mustang-electric-suv.html),
has generated lots of buzz and is set to go into production later this
year.

“We have lots of work ahead of us to complete our mission, but thanks to
Jim, we are a very different company today than we were three years
ago,” Mr. Ford said in a conference call to discuss the leadership
change.

Mr. Hackett is credited with eliminating money-losing cars from Ford’s
North American lineup in favor of more profitable pickups and S.U.V.s.
He formed alliances [with
Volkswagen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/ford-vw-self-driving-electric-cars.html),
the [Indian automaker
Mahindra](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/business/ford-india.html)
and Rivian, a start-up working on electric trucks [in which Ford has
invested](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/business/ford-rivian-investment.html).
Mr. Hackett also accelerated plans to develop electric vehicles.

But so far, the turnaround has had little effect on the company’s bottom
line and stock price. Ford’s [profits fell in 2018
and 2019](https://s23.q4cdn.com/799033206/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2019/q4/Ford-4Q2019-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf),
dropping to $47 million last year. This year, the pandemic has hammered
its business, and the company lost $876 million in the first half of the
year.

“Making the C.E.O. change now could be viewed as Ford is ready to move
faster, more aggressively,” Joseph Spak, an analyst with RBC Capital
Markets, wrote in a note to clients. “Farley’s persona and style may be
what is needed for that.”

Wall Street analysts have criticized Mr. Hackett for stopping short of
presenting a full turnaround plan with detailed financial goals and
timetables. Ford had planned to do so early in his tenure, but changed
course and presented only broad targets and revealed its plans piecemeal
as it rolled out specific initiatives and projects.

Ford shares were trading at about $11 when Mr. Hackett arrived. The
stock closed at $6.86 on Tuesday, up 2.5 percent.

Mr. Hackett “faced challenges in technology changes and current
operations without technology or auto industry experience,” said Erik
Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows
the auto industry.

Investors value Ford at about $27 billion, just one-tenth the market
capitalization of [Tesla, the electric
automaker](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/tesla-motors-inc) that
makes far fewer cars and has been around only since 2003.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Farley, 58, joined Ford in 2007 from Toyota Motor, where he played a
key role in launching the company’s Lexus luxury brand. Since arriving
at Ford, he has held a variety of jobs, including running the company’s
marketing, its European operations and a new business strategy group.

Mr. Farley’s temperament is very different from Mr. Hackett’s. The
current chief executive has a cerebral, grandfatherly presence and is
known for writing long companywide emails about his thoughts on Ford and
its future. Mr. Farley is known as an intense and animated personality.

In a conference call, Mr. Farley noted the automaker has a history going
back 117 years. Over more than a century, Ford has competed with and
been closely compared to its two Detroit rivals, General Motors and the
company now known as Fiat Chrysler.

But given the technological changes and disruption now rippling through
the auto industry, Mr. Farley said Ford’s competitors today include
companies like Amazon, Tesla, Toyota and Baidu, a Chinese
artificial-intelligence technology company that is working on
self-driving cars.

Mr. Farley said his first priority would be to ensure a smooth
transition. He added that he is optimistic about the company’s prospects
now that it has introduced the new F-150, Bronco S.U.V. and the Mustang
Mach E. Ford is hoping the Mustang Mach E will emerge as a serious
challenger to Tesla, which [has faced little serious
competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/tesla-electric-car-audi-polestar.html).
The company is also taking aim at Jeep, a Fiat Chrysler brand, with its
new Bronco, for which it has taken 150,000 reservations.

On Mr. Farley’s list of tasks are raising Ford’s profit margin in North
America to 10 percent or more, cutting costs and reviving the company’s
sales in Europe, China and South America.

“I’m inspired by the momentum we are building,” Mr. Farley said in the
conference call. “To fulfill our mission, we need to swing for the
fences.”
