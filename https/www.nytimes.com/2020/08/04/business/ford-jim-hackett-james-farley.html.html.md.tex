C.E.O.}\label{ford-struggling-in-a-changing-industry-replaces-its-ceo}}

Jim Hackett, who failed to impress Wall Street, will be replaced by
James Farley, an auto industry veteran who started his career at Toyota.

Ford Motor said its chief executive, Jim Hackett, will retire on Oct. 1,
ending a three-year run in which the automaker has tried to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/business/ford-detroit-station.html}{streamline
its operations and focus its business on electric cars, trucks and
sport-utility vehicles} with mixed success.

Mr. Hackett, 65, will be succeeded by James D. Farley Jr., who had been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/ford-motor-jim-farley.html}{named
chief operating officer in February}.

``I am very grateful to Jim Hackett for all he has done to modernize
Ford and prepare us to compete and win in the future,'' said William
Clay Ford Jr., Ford's executive chairman.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/ford-motor-company}{The
company}, he added, is becoming ``much more nimble.''

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of Steelcase, an office furniture
manufacturer that is much smaller and less complex, was named to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/business/jim-hackett-ford.html}{the
top job at Ford} in May 2017, as the company's business was slumping. He
promised to revitalize Ford's operations and steer the company toward
vehicles that would generate profits and invest in emerging technologies
like electric and self-driving vehicles.

The company is starting to introduce some of the models developed under
Mr. Hackett, including a redesigned F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang
Mach E,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/ford-mustang-electric-suv.html}{an
electric S.U.V. styled to resemble the storied sports car}.

``We have lots of work ahead of us to complete our mission, but thanks
to Jim, we are a very different company today than we were three years
ago,'' Mr. Ford said in a conference call to discuss the leadership
change.

Mr. Hackett is credited with eliminating money-losing cars from Ford's
North American lineup in favor of more profitable pickups and S.U.V.s.
He formed alliances
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/ford-vw-self-driving-electric-cars.html}{with
Volkswagen}, the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/business/ford-india.html}{Indian
automaker Mahindra} and Rivian, a start-up working on electric trucks
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/business/ford-rivian-investment.html}{in
which Ford has invested}. Mr. Hackett also accelerated plans to develop
electric vehicles.

But so far, the turnaround has had little effect on the company's bottom
line and stock price. Ford's
\href{https://s23.q4cdn.com/799033206/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2019/q4/Ford-4Q2019-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf}{profits
fell in 2018 and 2019}, dropping to \$47 million last year. This year,
the pandemic has hammered its business, and the company lost \$876
million in the first half of the year.

Wall Street analysts have criticized Mr. Hackett for stopping short of
presenting a full turnaround plan with detailed financial goals and
timetables. Ford had planned to do so early in his tenure, but changed
course and presented only broad targets and revealed its plans piecemeal
as it rolled out specific initiatives and projects.

Ford shares were trading at about \$11 when Mr. Hackett arrived. The
stock was trading at \$6.77 Tuesday afternoon, up about 1 percent.

Mr. Hackett ``faced challenges in technology changes and current
operations without technology or auto industry experience,'' said Erik
Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows
the auto industry.

Investors value Ford at about \$27 billion, just one-tenth the market
capitalization of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/tesla-motors-inc}{Tesla, the
electric automaker} that makes far fewer cars and has been around only
since 2003.

Mr. Farley, 58, joined Ford in 2007 from Toyota Motor, and has held a
variety of jobs, including running the company's marketing, its European
operations and a new business strategy group.

Mr. Farley said his first priority is ensuring a smooth transition. He
added that he is optimistic about the company's prospects now that it
has introduced the new F-150, a new Bronco S.U.V. and the Mustang Mach
E, a potential Tesla rival slated to go into production late this year.

On his list of tasks are raising Ford's profit margin in North America
to 10 percent or more, cutting costs and reviving the company's sales in
Europe, China and South America.

``I'm inspired by the momentum we are building,'' Mr. Farley said in the
conference call. ``To fulfill our mission, we need to swing for the
fences.''
