The history of the newspaper business was on vivid display at a hearing
on Tuesday, when a federal bankruptcy judge confirmed the sale of the
[McClatchy
Company](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/media/hedge-fund-mcclatchy-newspapers.html),
a newspaper chain run by the same family since 1857, to a New Jersey
hedge fund in a deal valued at $312 million.

The sale of McClatchy, the owner of The Sacramento Bee, The Miami Herald
and more than two dozen other news outlets in 14 states, to Chatham
Asset Management was in the works since February, when McClatchy filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after more than a decade of losses
and cutbacks.

The deal, which will move a prestigious news publisher from family
control to an investment company, is in keeping with a broader trend
that has alarmed many press advocates, who argue that finance firms are
imperfect stewards of an industry built on the watchdog work of
chronicling government and commerce.

At the 3 p.m. hearing, Judge Michael E. Wiles approved the result of an
auction held last month in which Chatham, a fund that controls more than
$4 billion in assets, emerged as the winning bidder.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The hedge fund offered to convert the more than $262 million it owns in
McClatchy debt into equity in a Chatham-owned version of the company. It
also agreed to throw in roughly $49 million in cash and will pay
additional costs, including employee payroll, that McClatchy incurred
since filing for bankruptcy.

After the sale becomes official — probably by September — Chatham will
become the owner, and the publicly traded McClatchy will go private. The
company’s chairman, Kevin S. McClatchy, the great-great-grandson of the
founder, James McClatchy, and its chief executive, Craig Forman, said
they planned to depart once the deal closes.

The company will not be split up after it emerges from bankruptcy,
according to the terms of the agreement. In a July 24 news release,
McClatchy said Chatham’s bid would allow it to retain most of its
employees and honor its collective bargaining agreements.

After the judge announced his decision on Tuesday, Mr. Forman said in an
interview that the sale would benefit the company he has led since 2017.
“Now, with this successfully addressed, McClatchy is very well
positioned to go forward and continue to drive what we’ve built in the
last three years, a sustainable digital growth platform for local news,”
Mr. Forman said.

The runner-up bidder, [Alden Global
Capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/media/tribune-alden-board-seat.html),
a New York hedge fund that controls more than 200 news outlets through
MediaNews Group, lost out after having offered what amounted to
approximately $210 million in debt and cash, according to a court
filing. (An unspecified third party made a bid that was deemed
insufficient, according to a filing.)

Chatham has a growing presence in the news industry. In 2016, it took a
majority stake in Postmedia, one of Canada’s largest newspaper
companies. Since that deal went through, [1,600 Postmedia
employees](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html)
have been laid off, and more than 30 of its publications have been shut
down. Chatham is also the principal owner of American Media Inc., the
parent company of The National Enquirer and other supermarket tabloids.

By taking over McClatchy, a consistent winner of prestigious journalism
awards, Chatham will acquire 30 news outlets in the United States. In
addition to the McClatchy flagship paper, The Bee — which was founded in
the wake of the California gold rush — the chain includes The Charlotte
Observer, The Kansas City Star and the news agency McClatchyDC.

The mayors of several cities with McClatchy dailies, including
Sacramento and Lexington, Ky., filed letters with the bankruptcy court
urging civic-minded local ownership. Sree Sreenivasan, a professor of
digital innovation at Stony Brook University’s School of Journalism,
noted with dismay the absence of bidders who were not part of the
finance world.

“It’s a sad moment, because that tells you that people who traditionally
might have supported local journalism — including people with local
connections, local stakeholders — were not there,” Mr. Sreenivasan said.

The completion of the sale will extend the finance industry’s sway over
local news coverage. The nation’s largest newspaper chain,
[Gannett](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/business/media/gannett-gatehouse-merger.html),
the publisher of USA Today and some 250 other dailies, owes significant
debt to one private equity fund, Apollo Global Management, and is
controlled by another, Fortress Investment Group, which is owned by the
Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.

Alden, in addition to its roughly 200 news outlets, has a 32 percent
stake in another major chain, [Tribune
Publishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/media/tribune-alden-board-seat.html).
It also owns a large stake in Lee Enterprises, which publishes The
Buffalo News and roughly 75 other dailies in 26 states.

[McClatchy’s
troubles](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/business/media/newspaper-chain-agrees-to-a-sale-for-45-billion.html)
can be traced to 2006, when it bought its larger rival, Knight Ridder,
for $4.5 billion, plus the assumption of $2 billion in debt. Over the
next 12 years, McClatchy cut its work force from more than 15,000
full-time employees to around 3,300, according to public filings.

Chatham started investing in McClatchy in 2009 and became the chain’s
largest creditor. The fund was the leading candidate to buy McClatchy
after the company filed for bankruptcy, citing its inability to meet
obligations that were part of a $1.4 billion pension plan.

Chatham is led by Anthony Melchiorre, a Chicago-area native who worked
at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. In 2002, he was [let
go](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/morgan-stanley-cuts-leveraged-finance-as-bank-cull-hits-2500-20021121)
from Morgan Stanley as part of a round of layoffs. Soon after, he set up
[his
own](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/915802/000091580217000002/redmontprochathamsupplement0.htm)
hedge fund in Chatham, N.J. Some of its clients are listed under a
Cayman Islands address, where more favorable tax rates apply.

Hedge funds often find bargains by taking on properties that may seem
unattractive. The newspaper industry has been struggling for years as
the rise of digital media has cut deeply into advertising and
circulation revenue. Roughly a quarter of the newspapers in the United
States, most of them weeklies, were shut down between 2004 and 2019, and
about 50 percent of newspaper jobs were eliminated in that time.

Making the outlook grimmer is the economic slowdown imposed by the
coronavirus pandemic — meaning the new owner of McClatchy is in for a
challenge.

“We know the outlook is unpredictable in every single metric,” Mr.
Sreenivasan said. “How do even the best-intentioned of owners plan for
looking ahead?”
