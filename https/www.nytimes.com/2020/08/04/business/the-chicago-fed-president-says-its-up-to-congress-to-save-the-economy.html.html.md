The president of the **Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago** said the
central bank had limited room to do more and that Congress would need to
[support the
economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/business/fed-official-says-a-hard-lockdown-could-get-virus-under-control.html)
if the United States faced a full-fledged second wave of coronavirus
infections.

“The punchline ought to be that the ball is in Congress’s court,”
Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said on a call with
reporters.

The Federal Reserve cut its primary interest rate, the federal funds
rate, to
[near-zero](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/business/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates.html)
in March. Central banks abroad have cut borrowing costs into negative
territory, but Fed officials have been consistently skeptical that such
policies will be effective.

“We can’t lower the funds rate. Negative interest rates aren’t going to
be the tool that we decide to use at this point, or probably at any
point,” Mr. Evans said.

The Fed might be able to use a policy that would cap certain interest
rates — an approach commonly called “yield curve control” — but Mr.
Evans suggested that slightly higher medium-term rates are not the real
economic problem. The Fed has the ability to offer [emergency loans to
backstop turbulent
markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/economy/coronavirus-federal-reserve-policy.html),
but businesses and governments might need grants to make it through.

“At the moment, it’s really fiscal policy that needs to be addressing
this,” he said. Even now, more congressional support is needed to shore
up the economy as the pandemic wears on, Mr. Evans said.

The Chicago Fed chief was not alone in arguing that recently lapsed
expanded unemployment benefits should be in some way addressed, as
[Congress
debates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html)the
future of its pandemic response.

Thomas Barkin, president of the **Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond**,
[warned
that](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-barkin/feds-barkin-says-economy-faces-sinkhole-without-more-fiscal-support-idUSW1N2B8003)the
pandemic might be creating an economic “sinkhole,” rather than the
pothole policymakers initially believed they were facing. Robert S.
Kaplan, president of the **Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas**, said in an
interview on Bloomberg television on Monday that the policies [had
helped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-03/extension-of-jobless-benefits-to-buoy-growth-fed-s-kaplan-says?srnd=premium&sref=oZtxD6sa)
to bolster consumers, adding that “it’s important that we see an
extension of it.”
