A low-grade [hurricane that is slowly scraping along the East
Coast](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/isaias-storm-updates.html).
A wildfire in California that has led to evacuation orders for 8,000
people. And in both places, as well as everywhere between, a
[pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
that keeps worsening.

The daily morning briefing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
usually a dry document full of acronyms and statistics, has begun to
resemble the setup for a disaster movie. But rather than a freak
occurrence, experts say that the pair of hazards bracketing the country
this week offers a preview of life under climate change: a relentless
grind of overlapping disasters, major or minor.

The coronavirus pandemic has further [exposed

that put some communities [at greater

Experts argue that the country must fundamentally rethink how it
prepares for similar disasters as the effects of global warming
accelerate.

“State and local governments already stretched with Covid responses must
now stretch even further,” said Lisa Anne Hamilton, adaptation program
director at the Georgetown Climate Center in Washington. Better planning
and preparation are crucial, she added, as the frequency and intensity
of disasters increase.

By Tuesday morning Hurricane Isaias had pushed its way along the coast
of Florida and Georgia and made landfall in the Carolinas, its 75
mile-an-hour winds driving a storm surge as great as five feet in some
parts of North Carolina and drenching the Mid-Atlantic with rain,
according to the National Weather Service. Although it will weaken over
land, when it reaches the Canadian border by Wednesday it is expected to
have caused flooding in parts of New England.

Isaias makes nine named storms in the Atlantic so far this year,
something that has never before happened this early in the hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Forecasters had predicted [an
active
season,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/climate/hurricane-season-2020-noaa.html)
given warm ocean waters and other conditions, but 2020 is on track to be
one of the busiest ever. It follows three years of devastating
hurricanes, starting with Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017, then
Florence and Michael in 2018 and Dorian in 2019.

“Climate change is tough for people to grasp, but attribution studies
continue to find its DNA in today’s tropical systems, heat waves,
droughts and rainstorms,” said Marshall Shepherd, a professor of
atmospheric sciences and geography at the University of Georgia and
director of its atmospheric sciences program.

For hurricanes, warmer oceans provide more energy, making them stronger.
And warmer air holds more moisture, so [the storms bring more

Isaias has captured much of the public’s attention, but it’s far from
the only natural disaster facing the country. In Southern California,
firefighters were struggling Tuesday to contain a wildfire in the San
Bernardino Mountains 80 miles east of Los Angeles. It had spread rapidly
in the rugged terrain after first being reported on Friday.

Called the Apple Fire, it has burned 27,000 acres so far, though it
remains much smaller than other recent fires in the state. The largest,
the Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018, burned nearly half a million acres.
The disastrous [Camp Fire
of 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/31/magazine/paradise-camp-fire-california.html),
which burned 150,000 acres and killed 85 people, barely makes the Top 20
list.

“At a certain point in California’s history, 20,000 acres would have
been a pretty big fire,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the
University of California, Los Angeles. However, the warming climate and
shifting precipitation patterns have lengthened the state’s fire season
and contributed to an increase in larger fires.

The fires can grow more rapidly — in a matter of hours or days — as a
result of warming that has made vegetation drier and more likely to
ignite.

So far there are no reports of casualties from the Apple Fire. But there
is concern downwind, in Nevada and other states, as smoke from the
wildfire is [carried
eastward](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/jsloopLocalDiskDateDomainZipTZA.cgi?dsKeys=hrrr_smoke_jet:&runTime=2020080314&plotName=trc1_t4sfc&fcstInc=60&numFcsts=49&model=hrrr&ptitle=HRRR-Smoke%20Model%20Fields%20-%20Experimental&maxFcstLen=48&fcstStrLen=-1&resizePlot=1&domain=t4).
In Las Vegas, Clark County air-quality officials issued a two-day smoke
advisory, urging people with respiratory problems to stay indoors.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wildfire smoke contains high amounts of soot and other fine particles
that can [aggravate asthma and other respiratory
problems](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/climate/california-wildfires-climate-change.html).

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, there is heightened concern that the
smoke, while not necessarily increasing the rate of infection, can make
cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, worse, said Dr. John
Balmes, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San
Francisco. There is strong evidence from studies of influenza and other
viruses that smoke can increase the risk of deep-lung infections like
pneumonia, which occurs in severe cases of
Covid-19.

The combination of tropical storms, wildfires and other disasters,
coming after
[months](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/michigan-flooding-dams-midland.html)
of
[prior](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/tornado-storm-south.html)
[disasters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/us/winter-storm-tornadoes.html)
and the struggle to deal with the pandemic, has taken a growing toll on
the nation’s disaster response system. Part of the problem is that more
frequent disasters make it harder to recover, according to Samantha
Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at Massachusetts
Maritime Academy.

“What makes climate change so insidious is that it alters hazards, like
flooding, just enough to turn what otherwise could have been just an
emergency into a disaster, and disasters into catastrophes,” Dr. Montano
said. “Not only does this lead to more damage but also traps people in a
cycle of recovery.”

Coping with that change, she said, means that governments have to spend
more money before a storm or wildfire hits, reinforcing homes and
infrastructure, rather than just trying to build better afterward. And
local emergency departments need increased funding as their jobs expand.

When state and local governments can’t keep up with the need,
responsibility falls to FEMA. But the agency risks being overwhelmed,
according to Brock Long, who was FEMA’s administrator during the
hurricanes and wildfires of 2017 and 2018.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-1q1hscp">

<div id="CLIM">

</div>

“The current business model for the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
and the expectations placed upon it by the public and Congress, are
unrealistic at this point,” said Mr. Long, who is now executive chairman
of Hagerty Consulting, which advises companies and governments on
dealing with disasters.

That toll can be measured in the minutia of FEMA’s daily briefings.

Three years ago, before Hurricane Harvey marked the beginning of a
string of record natural catastrophes, FEMA was managing 27 major
disasters around the country, with a staff of slightly more than 10,000
people. As of Tuesday, the agency was handling about twice as many
disasters, not counting its pandemic response in every state and five
territories, despite a staff increase of just one-third. And the country
has yet to reach peak hurricane season.

In a statement, Lizzie Litzow, FEMA’s press secretary, said the agency
continues to help states hit by natural disasters.

“FEMA is well positioned with thousands of personnel in the field
supporting existing operations, thousands more ready to support emergent
disaster operations and more personnel joining the agency through
virtual onboarding every two weeks,” Ms. Litzow
said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the real solution, Mr. Long said, isn’t a bigger FEMA. Rather, local
governments have to impose tougher building codes and restrictions in
[vulnerable
areas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/california-s-wildfire-epidemic-blamed-on-bad-building-decisions?sref=UBrhZ1ro),
which home builders often oppose for fear of increased costs. If cities
and towns had better building codes, he said, fewer people would need to
evacuate their homes, reducing their exposure to the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mass evacuation has become a man-made disaster, because we failed to
put proper residential codes or building codes in place,” Mr. Long said.
“We have a severe case of hazard amnesia.”

Juan Declet-Barreto, a social scientist at the Union of Concerned
Scientists who works on climate vulnerability, laid part of the blame
with President Trump for difficulties in disaster response. The
president, he said, has
[politicized](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/climate/trump-hurricane-dorian-noaa.html)
the work of scientific agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the [National Weather
Service](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/climate/trump-noaa-hurricane-tweet.html)
that Americans rely on to navigate disasters, and has tried to [cut
their
budgets](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/trump-s-new-budget-cuts-all-favored-few-science-programs).

“They need to be well funded,” Dr. Declet-Barreto said. “They need to be
allowed to do their work.”

The twin disasters of climate change and the pandemic have something
else in common, he said, in addition to the failures of the Trump
administration to respond to them. Both disasters have
disproportionately hurt minorities.

“We shouldn’t be romanticizing some sort of pre-Covid ideal state. We
did not live in that,” Dr. Declet-Barreto said. “These threats that we
are living through are going to continue to expose the inequalities that
already exist.”
