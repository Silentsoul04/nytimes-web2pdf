## Headliner

### The Greens

Rooftop drinking and dining has become an attractive option amid the
pandemic: The venues are mostly outdoors and provide enough space for
social distancing. The Pier 17 complex, part of the Howard Hughes
Corporation’s development at the South Street Seaport, is a fine example
of that. Surrounded by promenades with views across the East River to
Brooklyn, its rooftop, open year-round, has a collection of cabana-like
pods set on patches of faux lawn for dining and drinking throughout the
day. There are 28 of them, each accommodating up to eight people, to be
reserved in advance. They’re equipped with umbrellas, lounge chairs,
coolers and USB ports, and you can order from your smartphone. The pods
require reservations; two other areas, a north patio and south patio,
are first-come, first-served. The menu for the entire rooftop consists
of fruity cocktails, some of them slushy, and food like fish and chips,
organic chicken sandwiches, and salmon and squash kebabs. On the pier’s
ground level, one restaurant, Malibu Farm, will open for outdoor dining
on Thursday. The Fulton by Jean-Georges Vongerichten is opening soon,
along with David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar, moving into the Bar Wayo
space. Another restaurant on the pier, Carne Mare from Andrew
Carmellini, which was supposed to make its debut in April, has yet to
announce an opening date.

## Opening

### Strangeways<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Local greenery, like bayberry, cherry laurel, river birch, lavender,
juniper and switchgrass, separates white picnic-style tables in this
restaurant’s spacious garden. The owners, Jamie Webb and the chef Ken
Addington, both of Eight Mile Creek in NoLIta, are using just the garden
for now to serve a globally inspired menu of crispy rock
shrimp,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>a cheeseburger, an
eggplant-shiitake burger, pork cheek vindaloo, fish and chips, and
spaghetti with clams. The cocktails, by Shannon Tebay, are refreshers,
like the Godspeed, a frozen mixture of tequila, grapefruit, cinnamon and
coconut, many of them sold to go in large format. (Opens Friday)

302 Metropolitan Avenue (Roebling Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
718-331-2000, [strangewaysbklyn.com](http://strangewaysbklyn.com/).

### Meno<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Milk teas featuring nuts, fruit, boba and coffee mixed with fruit
juices, including lemon and pineapple, star at this airy new beverage
shop. It’s the first American branch of Urban Tea, from Hunan, China,
where the company has nearly a dozen stores. Cheese tea, a concoction of
cold tea (green or black) topped with a thick, dense layer of foamlike
cream cheese, might tempt. It’s a creation from Taiwan and China that
has been nibbling at the edges of trendiness on the West Coast and in
New York [for
years](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/dining/food-trends-predictions-2019.html).
Counter Culture Coffee is the coffee supplier. A food menu includes
smoked chicken salad, bologna sandwiches and Japanese-style cheesecake
from Keki Modern Cakes based in Chinatown. Seating is outdoors only for
now; takeout and delivery are available. (Thursday)

218 Thompson Street (West Third Street), 646-226-9797.

### Rosella at Rooftop Reds

A pop-up preview of Rosella, a sushi restaurant opening this fall at 137
Avenue A (Ninth Street), will happen every Saturday in August at 7:30
p.m., at Rooftop Reds, a working vineyard on a Brooklyn Navy Yard roof.
Socially distanced seating will be set up, and guests will be served a
15-course tasting menu by the chefs Jeff Miller and Yoni Lang, who
worked at Uchi in Dallas and Uchiko in Austin, Tex. Tickets ($150 each)
are sold in pairs at
[eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rosella-sushi-at-rooftop-reds-tickets-115418023415).
Additional dates to be announced.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

### Bouillon Marseille<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

After 20 years, Simon Oren and his partners, including the chef Andy
D’Amico, have reconceived Marseille, their Hell’s Kitchen stalwart,
along the lines of the bouillon, a style of Parisian restaurant known
for traditional fare at modest prices. Most of the hors d’oeuvres,
including leeks vinaigrette, roasted bone marrow and steak tartare, top
out at $10. Mains like mussels provençales, a burger with grilled onions
and Gruyère, and tuna niçoise all come in at under $20.

## Chefs on the Move

### Takashi Igarashi<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Mr. Igarashi, a native of Sapporo, Japan, and a veteran of several
high-end kaiseki restaurants in New York, including Kyo Ya and Odo, is
the new chef at NR on the Upper East Side, and ROKC (ramen, oyster,
kitchen and cocktails) in Harlem. Shigefumi Kabashima, the owner of both
restaurants, is offering some of Mr. Igarashi’s new dishes, like
Hiroshima cold ramen with shredded daikon and pork belly, at the two
places. There’s a summer seafood carpaccio just at NR, and pork char siu
rice bowl assigned to ROKC.
