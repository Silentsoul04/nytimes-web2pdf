The storm that tore through New York City on Tuesday was second only to
Hurricane Sandy in knocking out service to Con Edison customers.

More than two and a half million customers lost power and at least one
person was killed after Tropical Storm Isaias tore through New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut on Tuesday, battering the region with heavy rain,
tornadoes and nearly hurricane-force winds.

In New York City and Westchester County, around 267,000 Con Edison
customers had lost power by nightfall as a result of Isaias --- second
only to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 in terms of storm-related outages, said
Allan Drury, a spokesman for the utility.

New Jersey was hit even harder.
\href{https://poweroutage.us/area/state/new\%20jersey}{More than 1.2
million utility customers} in the state were without service as of 10
p.m., as were \href{https://poweroutage.us/area/state/connecticut}{more
than 600,000 in Connecticut}. Across New York State,
\href{https://poweroutage.us/area/state/new\%20york}{more than 800,000}
had no service.

Many of those who were affected could be waiting a while for their power
to come back.

``It will be days, not hours,'' Mr. Drury said, citing the scale of the
repairs that workers would need to make once the damage had been
assessed.

East of the city, more than 300,000 of PSEG Long Island's nearly 1.2
million customers had no power as of 7 p.m. Elizabeth Flagler, a utility
spokeswoman, said ``some outages could last for an extended period''
even with crews working 16-hour shifts to restore them.

In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy offered a similar forecast for how
long it could take to bring power back to those who had lost it.

``Some of these outages may last for a few days due to the severity of
the storm,'' Mr. Murphy
\href{https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1290742757275906049}{wrote on
Twitter} at around 4 p.m.

The strong winds that caused some of the outages by knocking branches
and entire trees onto power lines also took a human toll.

A 60-year-old man who was sitting on the passenger side of a car on 84th
Drive in Briarwood, Queens, was killed when a tree fell on the vehicle
around 12:40 p.m., the police said.

About an hour and a half later, a 49-year-old woman was critically
injured when she was struck by a falling tree branch on Dumont Avenue in
the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the police said.

The storm, which made landfall in North Carolina as a hurricane,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/isaias-storm-updates.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage\#link-34e5d4e4}{moved
swiftly up the East Coast}. By 3 p.m., high winds were already causing
mayhem in and around New York City.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/nyregion/04tristate-storm2/merlin_175304475_b81c5a5b-5d99-4808-8ca2-63fd3f7dfcd3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

By 9 p.m., the city had gotten nearly 15,000 calls about storm-related
tree damage, including around 8,500 about downed trees and nearly 5,000
about downed limbs, a parks department spokeswoman said.

In some neighborhoods, the branches snapped off trees lining the streets
and fell onto cars. Near Washington Square Park in Manhattan, a tree
\href{https://twitter.com/michelledozois/status/1290733797344935936}{crashed
into a parked van} in the afternoon. A mile away, in Gramercy Park,
entire trees were toppled, with one splitting in half.

Arlene Harrison, the Gramercy Block Association's president, said she
was thankful that no one had been hurt.

``Trees are replaceable,'' she said.

Amando Flores, who has been Gramercy Park's caretaker for 25 years and
who was working in the park on Tuesday afternoon, said he had seen one
of his favorite trees, a magnolia that he helped plant nearly two
decades ago, being uprooted and collapsing.

``It was a sad day for Gramercy Park,'' Mr. Flores said.

Later, around 10 p.m., Rosie Iannotta's windows offered rare bursts of
light on 204th Street in Auburndale, Queens, thanks to a generator she
had bought after enduring Sandy and other, earlier storms.

Ms. Iannotta, a retired teacher, said a power surge had melted the
electrical lines on her block at 1:44 p.m., a terrifying event that she
filmed with her phone.

``I was freaking out,'' she said. Luckily, she added, no one was hurt.
``I'm just glad that everyone was safe.''

As expected, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also felt the
storm's impact, with some aboveground subway service, the Metro-North
Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road suspended temporarily. Service on
the Staten Island Ferry was also suspended. At least
\href{https://twitter.com/JFKairport/status/1290680225471356929}{55
flights were canceled} at Kennedy International Airport, and
\href{https://twitter.com/LGAairport/status/1290664182904426498}{at
least 78 were canceled} at La Guardia Airport.

Sarah Feinberg, the transit authority's interim president, said at an
afternoon briefing that she was not sure when full subway service would
resume. ``As soon as the trees and debris are removed, we'll obviously
be back to full service,'' she said.

By late afternoon, the rains brought by the storm had mostly passed
through the city, but the stiff winds continued, creating an odd
juxtaposition with the suddenly sunny skies. To the south, Patrick
O'Hara, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the agency was
tracking reports of at least two tornadoes: one in Strathmere, in South
Jersey, and another near Dover, Del.

In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had warned before the storm hit that
some inland areas could get up to six inches of rain. Most of the New
York City area wound up with less than two, with sections of Rockland
and Orange counties getting slightly more,
\href{https://nwschat.weather.gov/p.php?pid=202008050051-KOKX-NOUS41-PNSOKX}{according
to the Weather Service}.

In a statement issued later, the governor said staff members from
various agencies were helping with local response efforts ``to ensure
communities are safe, transportation is open and that utilities get the
power turned back on.''

By 10 p.m., he said, power had been restored to about 80,000 customers
across the state, or about 10 percent of those who had lost it.

Among those who were still waiting with no estimated time for when Con
Edison would restore their power were residents of about 20 properties
operated by the New York City Housing Authority, according to Barbaraâ€‹
Brancaccio, an authority spokesman. She said the authority was taking
several contingency steps to support tenants without electricity.

Magda Sepulveda, who lives in the Red Hook Houses complex in Brooklyn
with her two teenage children, was one of those tenants.

Standing outside her Richards Street building shortly after 9 p.m., she
debated whether to go back inside. Most of the building's windows were
dark, including those in the family's fifth-floor apartment. The
streetlights on the block were also out.

Ms. Sepulveda said she had returned home from work at around 5:30 p.m.
She climbed the stairs to her apartment using her phone's flashlight.
Both the stairwell and the hallway on her floor were ``pitch black,''
she said.

As night fell and the apartment began to darken, she and her children
left to charge their phones at a corner store, knowing they would
eventually have to climb the darkened stairwell again.

Staying with someone else, Ms. Sepulveda said, was ``not an option.''

Shortly before 9 p.m., three men standing outside her building said they
were waiting for a Con Edison crew to show up. They crossed the street
when one of the utility's emergency trucks arrived, its red lights
blinking.

A utility worker told the men that the failure of a nearby transformer
had caused the Red Hook outage. But with thousands of customers in
Brooklyn without power, he said, ``It's going to be a while'' before the
power returned.

Lauren Hard, Juliana Kim, Sean Piccoli and Daniel E. Slotnik contributed
reporting.
