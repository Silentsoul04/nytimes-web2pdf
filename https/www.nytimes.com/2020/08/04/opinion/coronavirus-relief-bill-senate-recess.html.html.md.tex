Millions of Americans can't wait while the Senate takes the rest of the
summer off.

On Friday, Congress effectively pushed millions of Americans off a
financial cliff when it failed to extend the enhanced unemployment
benefits put in place in March to soften the economic pain of the
coronavirus pandemic. Millions of Americans are also in imminent danger
of losing their homes as federal moratoriums on
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/opinion/coronavirus-evictions-rent.html}{evictions
expire}.

Preventing this widespread suffering should be the top priority for
lawmakers. Instead, the Republican-led Senate
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/mitch-mcconnell-coronavirus-economy.html}{dragged
its feet} for months on another aid package. The Democratic-led House of
Representatives passed a \$3 trillion relief plan
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/politics/house-simulus-vote.html}{in
mid-May}. It took until
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/27/us/politics/27reuters-health-coronavirus-usa-legislation-factbox.html}{July
27} for the Republican Senate leaders to offer their anemic, \$1
trillion counterbid, which everyone seems to have a problem with, albeit
for differing reasons. Democrats think it is insufficient to the
magnitude of the crisis. The White House favors a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/business/economy/virus-aid-trump.html}{short-term,
piecemeal fix} --- larded with unrelated measures, like \$1.75 billion
for a new F.B.I. headquarters and nearly \$400 million to
\href{https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/administration-west-wing-remodel-money-virus-bill-72061451}{renovate
the West Wing} --- and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html}{many
Republican members}
\href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/07/29/stimulus-package-republicans/\#4ec4dffa1164}{oppose
any} additional relief.

Negotiations are, to put it mildly,
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/senate-faces-crucial-week-on-coronavirus-relief-talks-390907?nname=playbook\&nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000\&nrid=0000014e-f10f-dd93-ad7f-f90fe5eb0000\&nlid=630318}{going
poorly}. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is engaged in a
political charade in which he proclaims himself a hapless bystander,
buffeted by the whims of the White House on one side and House Democrats
on the other. He is not even attending key meetings between Democratic
leaders and the administration's top negotiators.

But Mr. McConnell is far from without leverage. He must make clear to
his members that they need to compromise and help the millions of their
fellow Americans who are stuck in miles-long food lines, a hair's
breadth from eviction, jobless, financially ruined or ill because of
this terrible disease. One quick and direct way to send a message:
Cancel the Senate's August recess, or at least postpone it until a deal
is reached.

It may sound odd to call for treating high elected officials like
naughty schoolchildren by denying them their summer break. But lawmakers
value their time back home. In a brutal election cycle, with control of
the Senate on the line and Mr. Trump's weak poll numbers giving his
party agita, Republican members on the ballot in November are eager to
concentrate on their re-election prospects. Nothing focuses the
congressional mind quite like anxiety about one's own political
fortunes.

Staying in Washington until they get this crucial piece of the job done
is the least that senators can do to show their solidarity with the
legions of Americans who are facing far worse this summer than a
canceled holiday.
