**To the Editor:**

“[BlackRock Faces Test of
Principles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/argentina-debt.html)”
(Business, Aug. 1) questioned whether our firm’s role in Argentina’s
debt restructuring was consistent with our commitment to stakeholder
capitalism. The answer is a resounding yes.

[Argentina
announced](https://www.economia.gob.ar/en/argentina-and-three-creditor-groups-reach-a-deal-on-debt-restructuring/)
early Tuesday that it had reached agreement with its major creditors.
The breakthrough in negotiations, led by BlackRock, will provide
Argentina with $23 billion in upfront cash relief, virtually eliminating
contractual payments during the next four years. This will give
Argentina significant space to develop a credible plan to stabilize its
economy and create an environment where investment and employment can
thrive.

BlackRock, like other asset managers in our bondholder group, invested
in Argentina on behalf of millions of people around the world saving for
retirement. We are fiduciaries to our clients and seek outcomes that
benefit all stakeholders, including the countries in which we invest.
With this new agreement in place, we have successfully navigated that
outcome.

Using media and other third parties as a mechanism in negotiations is a
bad formula for a successful outcome. We are pleased that, in the end,
all parties engaged directly and constructively to achieve a consensual
outcome. Most important, with fair restructurings now in place,
Argentina (and Ecuador) can better address vital social needs posed by
Covid-19.

**To the Editor:**

“[Biden Could Quickly End Transgender Military
Ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/military-transgender-trump-biden.html)”
(news article, July 23) says President Trump’s ban on open transgender
military service “does not affect people who are already serving.”

First of all, the ban prohibits transgender service members who have not
already received a diagnosis from transitioning to live openly as who
they are. Second, although the ban conditionally grandfathered those
service members who already transitioned, it stamps them with a badge of
inferiority, marks them out as an exception to the rule and forces them
to serve under the constant threat of being summarily discharged for who
they are.

Transgender service members have proved time and time again over the
last four years that they are as competent and capable as their peers.
They have proved themselves in the most austere environments and have
deployed worldwide. We applaud the effort to move quickly to eliminate
the ban so that transgender service members can continue serving our
country without looking over their shoulders.
