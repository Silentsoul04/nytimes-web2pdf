# 5 Things You Need to Upgrade Your Tiny Outdoor Space

It’s never been more important to make your balcony, terrace, or patch
of cement cozy and hospitable. Here’s how.

Growing up in a squat ranch house in Ohio, I dreamed of moving to the
Big City (any big city) and serenading dewy-eyed writer boys on a
ukulele from my very own urban veranda. Now that I work at
[Wirecutter](http://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space)
and live in New York — which is cramped under the best circumstances,
let alone during a pandemic — I’ve found that wandering into my small
outdoor space has many more benefits, helping to alleviate the boxed-in
feeling I get from waking, working, relaxing and sleeping under one
roof. It’s a restlessness people are experiencing no matter where they
live during this summer of quarantine.

A few accessories can help the outdoors feel as comfortable as possible.
Whether you have a terrace, a balcony or a sunny patch of cement, here
are five things you can buy to make that small outdoor space more
pleasure than pain.

## Better Flooring

</div>

<div class="css-z3e15g" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper-hidden">

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0" data-aria-hidden="true">A wood
floor cover, like the ToiletTree Products Bamboo Bath Mat, can add
aesthetics and comfort to a rough outdoor
space.</span><span class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Caroline
Enos</span></span>](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/realestate/04wirecutter-outdoors6/04wirecutter-outdoors6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To reduce the risk that you’ll drop your phone through the cracks in
your balcony or suffer a sore tush from sitting on cement, you’ll want
some sort of floor cover.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Obviously the nicest fix is to install legitimate deck tiles, but if
you’re a renter — or, like me, you’re useless with home-improvement
projects — you’ll want a no-installation option. One easy solution is a
wood[bath
mat](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bathroom-rugs-and-bath-mats/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space).
The [ToiletTree Products Bamboo Bath
Mat](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bathroom-rugs-and-bath-mats/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#a-spa-style-wood-platform-toilettree-products-bamboo-bath-mat)
(about $50) is waterproof, vented to allow drainage without pooling
(which attracts mosquitoes), and durable enough to withstand years of
use. Plus, it has a nonskid surface and rubber feet to stop it from
sliding across your floor. The ToiletTree mat is also extremely cute,
and two or three of them should cover a small space with no effort.

If you’d rather not create a hard surface, you can use a [yoga
mat](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-yoga-mats/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space)
or a [picnic
blanket](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-picnic-blanket/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space)
as a comfortable seat in a pinch. In our tests, [Lululemon The
Reversible
Mat 5mm](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-yoga-mats/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#our-pick-lululemon-the-reversible-mat-5mm)
(about $70) and the [Nemo Victory
Blanket](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-picnic-blanket/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#best-overall-picnic-blanket-nemo-victory-blanket)
(about $50) emerged as the favorites for comfort. Neither will be good
for putting furniture on, and you won’t be able to leave them outside,
but if you just want to sit in the sun and gaze slackly into the middle
distance, both offer better padding than the hard
floor.

Even if you’re not trying to read on your balcony after sunset, a set of
string lights or a lantern can achieve more than pure function: It sets
a mood, transforming your anodyne patio into something dreamy.
Wirecutter has several suggestions for[good outdoor

(about $40) will look equally festive tacked to a wall or braided
through a railing. (Neither installation option will eat up any precious
square footage.)

This set of lights comes with a five-year warranty, it’s UL-listed for
outdoor use, and its Edison-style bulbs (75 lumens each) emit a cozy,
warm cast to show passers-by that you are the main character on the
stage that is your block. If you want a more concentrated source of
light or would like to read on your balcony, the rugged and powerful
[UST 60-Day Duro
Lantern](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-led-lantern/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#tabletop-lantern-ust-60-day-duro-lantern)

favorites.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If you live in a big city, your outdoor space is likely accompanied by
honking horns, sirens and, lately, fireworks. The problem with a lot of
Bluetooth speakers is that they’re simply not loud enough to drown out
the din. Also, they don’t hold a charge especially well. Our favorite
Bluetooth speaker solves both these problems in a vibrantly colored
[unit](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bluetooth-speaker/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space)
that’s about the size of a grapefruit. The[UE
Wonderboom 2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bluetooth-speaker/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#our-pick-ue-wonderboom-2)
(about $100), connects easily to any smartphone, offers great sound
quality and can play for up to eight hours on a single charge.

If you’re seeking the outdoors to escape sound altogether,
[noise-cancelling
headphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space)
may provide the silence you crave. For less than $100, our budget pick,
the[Anker Soundcore Life
Q20](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/#best-budget-over-ear-noise-cancelling-headphones-anker-soundcore-life-q20),
provides great noise cancellation, feels comfortable over the ears and
can last 30 hours without a
charge.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

It’s absolutely not OK to leave furniture on your fire escape (not just
according to me — [it’s the
law](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/realestate/can-a-neighbor-keep-flowerpots-on-a-fire-escape.html)),
and you don’t want to have your furniture stolen from a ground-floor
terrace. The solution? A[foldable
chair](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-folding-chairs/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space)
that stores easily inside your apartment and can be carried through your
open window with minimal effort. For those of you thinking back with a
shudder to the creak, badly designed folding chairs used in many an
outdated office, fret not. The [HDX Black Plastic Seat Foldable Folding
Chair](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-folding-chairs/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#our-pick-hdx-black-plastic-seat-foldable-folding-chair)
(about $25) is handsome, lightweight and surprisingly comfortable, even
after hours of sitting.

Another great option is a [camping
chair](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-portable-outdoor-chairs/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space).
The[Coleman Oversized Quad Chair With
Cooler](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-portable-outdoor-chairs/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#our-pick-coleman-oversized-quad-chair-with-cooler)
(about $30) — which provides two cup holders, a pouch for magazines and
a built-in cooler bag with room for four beers or sodas — is our
longtime pick, thanks to those features as well as its unparalleled
comfort.

Any flat surface that you’ll want for your tiny outdoor space — whether
to catch up on emails or balance a plate of palak paneer — should be
compact and lightweight. But it’s even better if it folds, allowing you
to take it to and from your terrace or porch rather than leaving it out
in the rain. One option we like is the [Lifetime 80160 Commercial Height
Adjustable Folding Utility
Table](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-folding-tables/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#a-small-table-for-kids-or-crafts-lifetime-commercial-height-adjustable-folding-utility-table)
(about $55). At only 4 feet long, with adjustable legs, it’s small
enough to store in a closet or under a bed.

If, on the other hand, you just need a flat surface on which to balance
your laptop or papers while working outside, a [lap desk is a cheap,
portable
option](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-lap-desk/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space).
The [LapGear
Designer](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-lap-desk/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#our-pick-lapgear-designer)
(about $30) is our favorite for its comfort and stability. But if you
prefer something that hovers over your lap rather than directly on it,
try the [Avantree
Multifunctional](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-lap-desk/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=outdoor-space#also-great-avantree-multifunctional)
(about $70), which keeps your lap cool during warmer months and has
adjustable legs, too.
