An anonymous anthropology professor remained outspoken about fairness in
academia even as she suffered for months with coronavirus.

“This person was a scientist who got Covid because they’d been forced to
teach,” said Michael Eisen, a fly geneticist at the University of
California, Berkeley, who had interacted on Twitter with the professor
for years. “It wasn’t the first person I knew who got Covid — but for a
lot of people it was one of the first people they knew who got it.”

He said that he had continued to exchange messages with the person
running the account through June and that this person frequently
discussed a difficult recovery.

Then BethAnn McLaughlin, another Twitter connection, announced on July
31 that the anonymous professor had died from complications of the
virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just a few days later, both the account of the anonymous professor and
of Ms. McLaughlin [were suspended for Twitter
policies](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/bethann-mclaughlin-twitter-suspension-fake-covid-death)
that, among other things, bar the coordination of fake accounts.

The same day, Gerardo Gonzalez, a spokesman for Arizona State
University, where the anonymous Twitter user was supposedly a professor,
described the anonymous account as a “hoax.”

The account had posted inaccurate information about the school, he said.
“We also have had no one, such as a family member or friend, report a
death to anyone at the university,” he added.

Among scientists and academics, the shock of mourning was already laced
with suspicion. Enough of them had unpleasant interactions with the
combative account and were troubled by its inconsistencies and seeming
about-turns.

“You have these internal alarms that are like, ‘Oh, I don’t trust you,’”
said Julie Libarkin, the head of the Geocognition Research Laboratory at
Michigan State University. “Kind of the same as when I worked with
BethAnn.”

## ‘My Actions Are Inexcusable’

On Tuesday, Ms. McLaughlin gave a statement to The New York Times
through her lawyer.

“I take full responsibility for my involvement in creating the
@sciencing\_bi Twitter account,” it said. “My actions are inexcusable. I
apologize without reservation to all the people I hurt.”

The anonymous account, @Sciencing\_Bi, was an active participant in the
corner of Science Twitter that frequently discusses issues of sexual
misconduct in the sciences. It claimed on at least [one
occasion](https://twitter.com/IsabelOtt/status/1290073135396528129/photo/1)
to have grown up in Alabama, to have “fled the south because of their
oppression of queer folk,” and to have attended Catholic school. The
account began to pointedly make reference to being Native American and,
earlier this year, began to identify as
Hopi.

Since 2016, it has posted often about issues around social justice in
the sciences, with a focus on activism and research about sexual
harassment.

It was also active in the career of Ms. McLaughlin, a neuroscientist.
(News of the relationship between the Twitter accounts [was reported by
Heavy.com](https://heavy.com/news/2020/08/sciencing_bi-bethann-mclaughlin-asu/),
[Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/twitter-account-embattled-metoostem-founder-suspended)
and the [Chronicle of Higher
Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/did-the-founder-of-metoostem-create-a-fake-online-persona-and-then-kill-it-off).)
It was key in promoting a
[petition](https://www.change.org/p/vanderbilt-don-t-fire-prof-bethann-mclaughlin-for-standing-against-sexual-harassment)
that called for Ms. McLaughlin to be given tenure at Vanderbilt
University. She was not given tenure in 2017, a decision she said was
influenced by her having testified against a former Vanderbilt professor
accused of sexual harassment. Her effort to reverse that decision was
unsuccessful in 2019, and [she left the university that
summer.](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/metoostem-founder-out-vanderbilt)

On one occasion, the account responded to someone asking Ms. McLaughlin
for information about Vanderbilt with [extensive
details](https://twitter.com/IsabelOtt/status/1290101201397329921/photo/1)
about the university’s salary structure.

In April, @Sciencing\_Bi began to undergo a drama that belonged solely
to her, announcing the coronavirus diagnosis in a tweet. It was Ms.
McLaughlin who announced that the anonymous professor had died.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I was pretty shocked,” said Erica Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at
Indiana University. “I had never had particularly great experiences with
@Sciencing\_Bi, but I thought that she was a whole real human who had
just died. I was surprised by how hard it hit me. I ate a pint of ice
cream about it.”

Ms. McLaughlin came across as particularly distraught. She mourned
@Sciencing\_Bi in a long thread, paying testament to her humanity and
toughness.

“She was supposed to get Hopi talisman for health as gifts for us but
she ran out,” Ms. McLaughlin tweeted. “God. The irony of running out of
health talisman.” She also said that she and the person behind the
account had been planning on getting matching tattoos in the Hopi
language.

Ms. McLaughlin has prompted particular frustration and disgust by posing
as a Hopi woman, right as the coronavirus has [caused disproportionate
harm](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html)
to [Indigenous communities in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/native-americans-coronavirus-data.html).

“There are millions who want to be us,” said Jacqueline Keeler, a writer
and the editor of [Pollen
Nation](https://www.pollennationmagazine.com/), a Native-led magazine.
“These people are centering themselves in our issues, they are heading
Native American departments, they are telling Native students what they
can and can’t study — it’s to protect their own position. And so it does
change our ability to advocate for ourselves when we are constantly
being replaced by frauds, white people or other people of different
backgrounds pretending to be us.”

## ‘It Just Became Obvious to Me’

The first time Mr. Eisen heard from the account was in defense of Ms.
McLaughlin. “The fact that @Sci-Bi was saying all these things about
BethAnn, saying that BethAnn had helped her, it didn’t make me trust
BethAnn — but it made me less willing to publicly criticize her because
I thought that public criticism would be felt by the people she was
helping,” he said. “Who turned out to be fake.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Melissa Bates, a professor at the University of Iowa, was among those
invited to a Zoom memorial via a Twitter thread. Ms. Bates said on
Twitter that when she showed up on the Zoom, it was just her, Ms.
McLaughlin, Mr. Eisen and another man.

Afterward, Mr. Eisen began to search for any evidence that
@Sciencing\_Bi had been a real person. He could not find any.

“The combination of the weird things that were happening on the call and
looking at the tweets and seeing how much they circled BethAnn, it just
became obvious to me,” he said. “‘Oh, this is BethAnn.’”

Ms. McLaughlin first began to make waves among those concerned about
sexual harassment in the sciences in May 2018. She [wrote and circulated
a petition that
month](https://www.change.org/p/national-academy-of-sciences-remove-sexual-harassers-from-national-academy-of-sciences)
calling for the National Academy of Sciences to revoke the membership of
those who had been punished for sexual harassment, retaliation and
assault.

In June 2018, she and Ms. Libarkin started a website, MeTooSTEM, which
quickly garnered attention, as women posted a series of largely
anonymous stories there about being harassed while working in science,
technology, engineering and math (STEM).

In the same month, Ms. McLaughlin further raised her profile when she
[used
Twitter](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/rate-my-professors-hotness-chili-pepper-sexist?bfsource=relatedmanual)
to successfully pressure the website ratemyprofessor.com to drop its
system of chili peppers used to rank the “hotness” of academics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In October 2018, Ms. McLaughlin, who had begun to make decisions for the
organization without informing her colleagues, created a fund-raiser for
MeTooSTEM on GoFundMe. It eventually raised more than $79,000.

Ms. McLaughlin’s colleagues at MeTooSTEM were already feeling
uncomfortable with her leadership at that point, and were made
particularly uneasy by the
GoFundMe.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“We were about to get in front of a crowd of people and say: ‘Give us
your money,’” said Ms. Smith. She didn’t know how the money would be
used, but did remember thinking: “We’re too broke to participate in
white-collar crime.”

Former colleagues of Ms. McLaughlin at MeTooSTEM said they did not know
where that money ultimately went. A 2019 report from MeTooSTEM said that
the money, along with other donations, had “provided free services for
18 months to over 500 clients.”

In November 2018, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab
awarded its [Disobedience
Award](http://news.mit.edu/2019/call-for-nominations-media-lab-disobedience-award-0529)
to Ms. McLaughlin; Tarana Burke, a founder of the \#MeToo movement; and
Sherry Marts, who left academia after being harassed by a colleague in
her graduate lab. The award recognizes “ethical, nonviolent acts of
disobedience” and comes with $250,000, which that year was split among
the three recipients.

As Ms. McLaughlin received more public recognition, her colleagues at
MeTooSTEM began to leave the organization, accusing her of frequent
verbal abuse and citing the dysfunction plaguing the organization. By
May 2019, seven members had resigned, according to a [report in
BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/metoostem-sexual-harassment-science?bfsource=relatedmanual)
at the time.

Deanna Arsala recently received a doctorate from the University of
Illinois at Chicago and was one of the few women of color at MeTooSTEM.
She said that @Sciencing\_Bi had claimed to know details about
leadership meetings that included only BethAnn and a few other people.
“I remember thinking, ‘Is this BethAnn?’” Ms. Arsala said.

Ms. Arsala left the organization in part because she and another
colleague, also a woman of color, felt that white leadership did not
prioritize what they had to say.

Kathryn Clancy, an anthropology professor at the University of Illinois
who was also involved in the MeTooSTEM movement and who is white, said
that even as Ms. McLaughlin’s leadership issues brought bad publicity,
her issues with race had gone largely overlooked, even as women of color
inside and outside the organization had tried to get others to see them.

In February of 2020, [another BuzzFeed
report](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/bethann-mclaughlin-metoostem-resignation-harassment)detailed
further strife and resignations at MeTooSTEM. Activists including Ms.
Marts [publicly distanced
themselves](https://twitter.com/sherrymarts/status/1231059406328074240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1231059406328074240%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeednews.com%2Farticle%2Fpeteraldhous%2Fbethann-mclaughlin-metoostem-resignation-harassment)
from the embattled MeTooSTEM leader; they even officially resigned from
the hashtag.

## ‘It’s So Easy to Mislead People’

In retrospect, the symbiosis of the two accounts makes sense to those
who were aware of both for years. As Ms. McLaughlin lost some
credibility, the account gained it.

And Ms. McLaughlin’s invention of the character behind @Sciencing\_Bi
was not as unusual as it may seem — nor would it have been unusual for
her to have killed off the account.

Dr. Marc Feldman is a psychiatrist [who studies factitious
disorders](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/20/science/a-great-pretender-now-faces-the-truth-of-illness.html)
in which a person acts as if they, or a loved one, have a disease. He
specializes in what he calls Munchausen by internet, in which such
deceptions take place online, and said he hears about a new case every
couple of weeks.

“I think it happens online more than offline these days because it’s so
easy to mislead people via social media,” Dr. Feldman said. He added
that Covid-19 had been a boon for those with such disorders. “Nobody
wants to be near a Covid-19 sufferer so they say, ‘We can’t meet,’” he
said. “There’s no way to arrange a face-to-face meeting.”

In her statement, Ms. McLaughlin said: “As I’ve reflected on my actions
the last few days, it’s become clear to me that I need mental health
treatment, which I’m pursuing now. My failures are mine alone, so I’m
stepping away from all activities with MeTooSTEM to ensure that it isn’t
unfairly criticized for my actions.”

“These Pretendians are better at it than we are, because they don’t
carry our specific trauma," Ms. Keeler said. And: “They are ethnic
opportunists and that is a colonial endeavor that has been going on for
centuries in this hemisphere.”

Even the lack of tenure of the pretend professor served a purpose,
giving the account a perfectly good reason for remaining anonymous.

“This is a good thing about Science Twitter, that it gives people who
are marginalized a voice,” Mr. Eisen said. “It sucks that BethAnn took
advantage of that.”
