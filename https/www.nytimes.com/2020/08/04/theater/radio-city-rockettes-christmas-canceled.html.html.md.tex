For the
\href{https://www.rockettes.com/blog/fun-facts-about-the-radio-city-christmas-spectacular-and-the-rockettes/}{first
time in 87 years}, the show at Radio City Music Hall won't go on, the
owner of the venue said Tuesday.

``We regret that the 2020 production of the~`Christmas Spectacular
Starring the Radio City Rockettes''' has been canceled, MSG
Entertainment said in a statement, citing ``uncertainty associated
with~the Covid-19 pandemic.''

According to \href{https://www.rockettes.com/blog/}{the Rockettes'
website}, more than 75 million people have seen the dancers perform
since the Christmas show began in 1933. During a typical busy season,
each of the 80 Rockettes may perform up to four shows a day, with each
one kicking up to 650 times. As the news broke, several of the dancers
posted their own statements on Instagram.

``Christmas has officially been cancelled,''
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CDeIBq_j0f0/?igshid=ejai6nxe4mff}{wrote
Samantha Berger}, who has been performing with the Rockettes for 15
seasons. ``Until Next year,'' she added with two broken-heart emojis.
``Please Wear a Mask.''

A spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden Entertainment, which also
manages the show, confirmed that the Madison Square Garden Company plans
to lay off 350 people --- about one-third of the company's corporate
work force,

New York Post} reported.

``While we believe this is a necessary step to protect the long-term
future of our businesses, we continue to actively pursue solutions that
will allow us to safely reopen our doors,'' MSG Entertainment and MSG
Sports said in a statement, ``so we're able to bring as many employees
back as quickly as we can, once a return date for live events is
established.''

The Rockettes are now selling tickets for November 2021, and many of the
performers are holding out hope.

``We were all preparing for this, but the confirmation of a cancelled
season confirms the heartbreak,''
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CDeFKMNhVPe/?igshid=v8q5sop9v4qz}{Danni
Heverin} wrote on Instagram. ``Please, I beg of you, think of others and
do the right thing. Wear a mask. Socially distance.''

``We are in this together,'' she wrote. ``Looking forward to the next
time we can celebrate Christmas time again in NYC.''
