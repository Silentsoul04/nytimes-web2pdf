## Positive vaccine news

Novavax, the little-known Maryland company that received $1.6 billion
from the federal government to produce an experimental coronavirus
vaccine, announced encouraging results in two preliminary studies on
Tuesday.

In one study, 56 volunteers produced a high level of antibodies against
the virus without any dangerous side effects. In the other, researchers
found that the vaccine strongly protected monkeys from coronavirus
infections.

There are other vaccines that are further along with clinical trials,
but Novavax’s stands out because it is protein-based — the same proven
technology used for existing vaccines against diseases like shingles —
which could make it safer and easier to manufacture in large amounts.

Our colleague Carl Zimmer, a science writer and author of “A Planet of
Viruses,” thinks there will be a number of coronavirus vaccines that
will turn out to be safe and effective. “I think that there will be a
patchwork,” he told us. India, China, and Russia, could all end up with
their own successful vaccines, he said, and “there may be vaccines that
are better for old people and other groups.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite the promising initial results, it won’t be possible to say
whether the Novavax vaccine is safe and effective until the company
conducts a large-scale study — known as Phase 3 — comparing people who
get vaccinated to people who get a
placebo.

## The strain on Main Street

Even as the larger economy is showing signs that it’s beginning to heal,
small businesses are still reeling from the pandemic.

In New York City, family-run restaurants, independent bookstores and
other small businesses are the backbone of the economy, but when the
pandemic eventually wanes, [roughly one-third (around 80,000) may never
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-small-businesses-closing-coronavirus.html).
Many American small businesses have exhausted federal and local aid,
while [others have received only a fraction of what they
need](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
to stay afloat.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The situation is perhaps most dire for Black business owners, who [had a
harder time securing federal
aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/paycheck-protection-program-bias.html)
than their white counterparts, own businesses in areas that were hit
hard by the outbreak, and now [appear to be closing their ventures at
nearly twice the
rate](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/04/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#black-owned-businesses-face-a-double-blow-as-the-pandemic-strikes-minority-communities)
of the average business owner.

**Questionable beneficiaries**. A well-connected trucking company
[received more than $700 million in federal pandemic
aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/yrc-coronavirus-relief-funds.html)

help the firm — even as the company was being sued by the Justice
Department over claims that it had defrauded the federal government.

## The second wave crashing over Australia

Australia looked as though it might be one of the few success stories in
the fight against the coronavirus, thanks to a rapid, tough response
from the government. But after the outbreak had largely been brought
under control, [cases and deaths have spiked in
Melbourne](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html),
the country’s second-largest city, showing just how tenuous any victory
can
be.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The Stage 3 lockdown, once the toughest level, has given way to even
more restrictive policies that will last at least six weeks. Residents
are now under curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.

Nearly everyone traveling for a job deemed essential must carry a signed
work permit. And after a campaign to check in on people with Covid-19
found that one in four was not at home, a fine equivalent to about
$3,500 was established for future violators. Some of the new rules have
led to widespread confusion, with unclear guidance for everything from
dog-walking to seeing romantic partners.
