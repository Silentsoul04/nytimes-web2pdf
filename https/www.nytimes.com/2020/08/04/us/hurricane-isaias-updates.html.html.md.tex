Officials warned residents to stay out of harm's way as at least two
people were killed by tornadoes, and two others from fallen trees.
Millions were left without power.

WINDSOR, N.C. --- Isaias pounded the Atlantic Coast on Tuesday with
ferocious wind and driving rain, flooding communities, knocking out
power for millions and spawning a series of tornadoes along its path.

Although it quickly weakened to a tropical storm, Isaias made landfall
in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane and maintained a punishing
level of power as it raked over the Eastern Seaboard, forcing a swath of
the country --- from the Carolinas to the Northeast --- to grapple with
its devastation.

In North Carolina, one tornado killed at least two people as it
eviscerated a rural patch of roughly a dozen mobile homes, leaving only
two standing. ``The rest of them is pretty much gone,'' the Bertie
County sheriff, John Holley,
\href{https://www.13newsnow.com/video/news/local/north-carolina/bertie-county-sheriff-john-holley-talks-about-fatality-in-north-carolina/291-99306d30-d640-4e9a-97fa-0221d565f5df}{told
a local television station}.

``It don't look real,'' he said. ``It's sad and it's hard.''

Officials throughout the storm's path declared states of emergency and
urged residents to stay out of harm's way, underscoring the multitude of
perils lingering in the storm's wake.

A woman in St. Mary's County, Md., was killed after a tree fell and
crushed her vehicle as she drove; the authorities said it took several
hours to remove the woman's body from the wreckage. At least one other
person was killed under similar circumstances in Queens, officials said,
after the storm swept into New York City.

``At my direction, the state has activated all available resources to
respond, and our team will continue to monitor the storm's path,'' Gov.
Larry Hogan of Maryland said on Tuesday. ``We urge Marylanders to heed
all warnings, avoid travel if possible, and use common sense.''

More than three million utility customers along the storm's path in
North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and New York were without power on Tuesday night, according to
\href{https://poweroutage.us/}{Poweroutage.us}, a website that tracks
and aggregates reports from utilities.

Nearly 1.2 million customers were without power in New Jersey, a number
significantly higher than in any other state. In New York, more than
800,000 people lost electricity, and Connecticut had at least 600,000
customers without power.

Because the projected path of the storm, which reached Canada late
Tuesday night, had shifted slightly westward, New York City and the
surrounding areas got a slight reprieve from the heaviest expected
rainfall. Tropical storm warnings reached as far up the Atlantic Coast
as Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, and a tornado watch was in effect
throughout the day for New York City, Long Island, much of New Jersey
and parts of Connecticut.

Forecasters warned of the possibility of flash floods across much of the
Mid-Atlantic region by Tuesday evening, with ``potentially
life-threatening urban flooding'' possible in Washington, D.C.,
Baltimore and other cities along and just west of Interstate 95,
according to the National Hurricane Center.

Isaias, which is written as Isa√≠as in Spanish and pronounced
ees-ah-EE-ahs, mustered the strength to become a hurricane again as it
churned off the coast, and the center of the storm made landfall late
Monday in Ocean Isle Beach, N.C., after delivering only a glancing blow
to Florida and largely sparing Georgia.

Morgan Strenk watched from her vacation home in Ocean Isle Beach as
rising water flooded the streets and filled her basement. She said she
stepped outside and smelled smoke; a fire had engulfed a house across
the street and then spread to a neighboring house.

``The streets are just covered with debris,'' she said. ``A lot of
houses right on the shoreline lost their stairs. There's random pieces
of furniture all over the place.''

Officials said that the storm's rapid pace, moving as quickly as 35
m.p.h., helped to limit river flooding and allowed the authorities to
mobilize swiftly to assess the toll.

``All in all, this storm got in, got out pretty quickly,'' Gov. Roy
Cooper of North Carolina said in an interview on ``Good Morning
America'' on Tuesday. Because of that, he added, the damage was not ``as
great as it could have been.''

A series of tornadoes cropped up along its path as the storm barreled up
the coast, including in southeastern Virginia and southern New Jersey.
It is not uncommon for storms like Isaias to spawn tornadoes, created in
the outer rain bands of hurricanes.

In Bertie County, N.C., in the northeast corner of the state, emergency
workers contended with fierce wind and rain in the early morning
darkness as they pulled people from their shredded homes. Officials said
14 people were treated at a hospital and released.

Dana White, who lives nearby, was jolted awake at 2 a.m. when a friend
called to check on her. ``When I got up, it would rain real hard and
then just be real calm,'' she said. ``And then the wind would pick up,
and the rain would blow in all different directions.''

Ed Goodwin, a Republican state representative, surveyed the aftermath in
much of his district, which includes Bertie County. He noted the storm's
capriciousness, as some areas were virtually spared and others
devastated.

He saw houses that had shingles shaved from their roofs and tin siding
stripped off barns. But he said the residents of the mobile home
community, known as Cedar Landing, would need the most help in the
coming days.

``Not only have they lost their home and had the scare of their lives,
they've also lost most of their earthly possessions,'' Mr. Goodwin said.

He said that he knew the broader community would support them, in part
because the threat of storms like Isaias is a recurring one and could
hit anyone. ``Only by the grace of God that could be I,'' he said.

Kathryn Abrams Dupree, who owns a barbecue restaurant in nearby Windsor,
said a friend called her at 2:30 a.m. to tell her the restaurant had
been damaged in the storm. When she arrived, she was alarmed by the
severity, and said it would likely take weeks of work to renovate it.

``The windows were blown in,'' she said, ``ceiling blown out, the roof
was lifted up, there was water standing everywhere.''

Yet she said she had a sense of perspective. She has employees who lived
in Cedar Landing and they were alive.

``We can replace this,'' Ms. Abrams Dupree said of her battered
restaurant. ``We couldn't replace them.''

Michael Venutolo-Mantovani reported from Windsor, and Rick Rojas from
Atlanta. Lucy Tompkins contributed reporting from Bozeman, Mont., Will
Wright from Jersey City, N.J., and Mihir Zaveri from New York.
