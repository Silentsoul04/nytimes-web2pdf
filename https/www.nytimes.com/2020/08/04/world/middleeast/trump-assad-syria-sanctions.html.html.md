Without a broader diplomatic effort, the newest and toughest penalties

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has embarked on its toughest round
of economic sanctions against Syria, intending to break President Bashar
al-Assad’s reign over the country and stop a civil war that has claimed
over half a million lives.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the administration will not end the
pressure campaign on Mr. al-Assad and his backers until he agrees to a
United Nations resolution prompting peace talks and a transition of
power.

But diplomatic and humanitarian assistance experts are wary of the
strategy, saying economic sanctions alone, no matter how punishing, will
do little to bring Mr. al-Assad to the negotiating table and will only
worsen the humanitarian crisis in Syria, which has been exacerbated by a
[collapsing
economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/world/middleeast/syria-economy-assad-makhlouf.html).

Critics also warn that the Trump administration will waste the broadened
sanctioning power Congress gave it if diplomatic outreach to the Syrian
government and its allies does not accompany economic punishment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Sanctions alone cannot solve the problem,” said [John E.
Smith](https://www.mofo.com/people/john-smith.html), the former director
of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “It’s
difficult to see what else the U.S. government is doing in Syria other
than putting a bunch of Syrian regime insiders on a list that they don’t
really care one way or the other they are on.”

The newest round of sanctions on Syria comes as the [Caesar Syria
Civilian Protection
Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/us/politics/us-syria-sanctions-war-crimes.html),
which President Trump signed into law in December, went into effect in
mid-June.

The legislation — named after a military photographer, code-named
Caesar, who leaked over 50,000 photos of torture and other atrocities
taking place in Mr. al-Assad’s prisons — is stronger than previous
sanctions, which started in 1979 when Washington first [declared
Syria](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/) a state
sponsor of terrorism.

It allows the United States to freeze the assets of any person or
business dealing with al-Assad’s government, regardless of nationality.
It also targets Russia and Iran, Mr. al-Assad’s primary backers.

The law also punishes individuals and corporations anywhere in the world
dealing with three crucial sectors of the Syrian economy: the domestic
oil industry, the Syrian military and engineering or construction
businesses operating in government-held regions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Congress is giving companies around the world a choice,” Mr. Smith
said. “You can go do business in Syria if you would like, but if you do,
you risk being cut off from the almighty dollar and the U.S. financial
system.”

Since June, over 40 elites have been sanctioned, including Mr.
al-Assad’s wife and his oldest son, other members of his extended
family and senior military leaders. Business people crucial to the
reconstruction of government-held Syria have also been
targeted.

Experts note that sanctions have caused widespread concern in the
country. Companies interested in rebuilding Syria’s cities and
countryside — which could require $250 to $400 billion to reconstruct —
may be scared away from doing business in the region, stalling Syria’s
path to recovery.

Ahead of the United States announcing its first round of Caesar Act
sanctions in mid-June, Syria devalued its currency by 44 percent.

But Trump administration officials say their efforts, billed as a
“sustained campaign of economic and political pressure,” has just
started, and they expect many more actions to come.

“This will continue to be the ‘summer of Caesar,’” said [Joel D.
Rayburn](https://www.state.gov/biographies/joel-d-rayburn/), the State
Department’s special envoy for Syria. “There will be no end to them
until the Syrian regime and its allies accede.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The sanctions arrive at a time when Mr. al-Assad has nearly won Syria’s
nine-year civil war, and finds his economy
crumbling.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The currency is nearly worthless, making basic commodities unaffordable
to large swaths of the population. Protests against poor living
conditions have erupted in parts of the country. The
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
is also taking hold. And Syria’s main trading partner, Lebanon, is
dealing with an economic meltdown that has spillover effects into its
own economy.

Former government officials agree that the sanctions, piled on top of
the current state of Syria’s economy, could have a devastating impact on
the humanitarian situation in a country where nearly 80 percent of the
people live in poverty.

Others note that Mr. Trump’s [increasing
reliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/trump-iran-sanctions.html)
on sanctions against repressive governments like Iran and North Korea
has done little to change behaviors of the ruling class, whose members
often find ways to evade the punitive measures or pass down the
punishing effects onto their citizens.

“The regime elites continue to flourish, they continue to get luxury
goods, they continue to do their shopping trips,” Mr. Smith said. “It is
generally the people of the jurisdiction that pay the ultimate penalty
from the poverty that is inflicted on that government.”

There is little question that American sanctions, writ large, have made
life harder for many ordinary Syrians.

Business and factory owners describe the headache of importing and
exporting goods using channels outside the American banking system and
of losing international customers and suppliers who do not want to run
afoul of the sanctions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Cheaper but inferior Syrian- and Iranian-made products have replaced
other imported ones at supermarkets. Iran, struggling with its own
American sanctions, cannot throw Syria a major lifeline.

But the causes of Syria’s economic crisis go far beyond the sanctions,
including a civil war that has decimated its cities, factories,
infrastructure and hospitals.

A shopkeeper from the al-Midan neighborhood of Damascus blamed runaway
inflation and soaring food prices on corrupt dealings between the
government and Assad cronies.

“The corruption and government checkpoints and looting are making our
lives and our business harder than the American sanctions,” said the
shopkeeper, Abu Muhammad, 60.

Democratic and Republican lawmakers have put provisions into the Caesar
Act ensuring humanitarian organizations are still able to provide food
and aid to Syrians.

But humanitarian workers operating in the country note that despite best
intentions of lawmakers, the reality on the ground will be different.

They note medicine is already becoming harder to bring into the country.
Insurance companies are telling aid organizations they will not cover
certain procedures. A.T.M.’s have shut down, causing relief workers to
waste precious time standing in line to withdraw salaries.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This may not all be directly because of the sanctions, aid experts said,
but the vast nature of the United States’ sanctions efforts is scaring
companies away from the region, even though they may be legally allowed
to
operate.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

“It’s a double-edged sword,” said [Basma
Alloush](https://www.mei.edu/experts/basma-alloush), policy and advocacy
adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian organization
that operates in Syria. “If the U.S. is using such sweeping, vast
sanctions to yield some kind of political goal, they’re not paying
enough attention to the unintended consequences.”

She added: “With the U.S. adding this additional pressure on ordinary
people that have gone through hell and back, they really need to do a
lot more to demonstrate how exactly they’re going to be protecting these
civilians.”

To hear the Syrian government tell it, American sanctions are the root
of all of Syria’s economic problems. Strident propaganda to that effect
fills state television and the mouths of government loyalists.

“The moment the United States of America lifts the sanctions and stops
the Caesar Act, the prices of goods, commodities and foodstuffs will
drop at least 50 percent,” Mohammed Samer al-Khalil, the economic
minister, said at a talk on July 15.

Defiance is a common response. A government employee in Damascus, Abu
Nidal, noted that Syrians had already survived punishing American
sanctions from the 1980s on without succumbing to what he called
“American hegemony.”

“These measures will never ever change the peoples’ loyalty and support
for President Bashar al-Assad and his war against the terrorist groups
and to retake every inch of Syria,” added Abu Nidal, 50, who, like most
Syrians interviewed, asked to be identified by a nickname because he
feared repercussions for speaking to a foreign journalist.

Mr. al-Assad’s government, like the aid groups, insists that the
sanctions snarl the process of importing medicines, vaccines and medical
equipment. But verifying those claims has proved difficult in a country
with little transparency and an interest in vilifying the United States.

During a [rare
visit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/world/middleeast/syria-recovery-aleppo-douma.html)
to Syria by New York Times journalists last year, the government did not
allow them to visit a hospital or interview doctors about what officials
said were medical shortages caused by the sanctions that preceded the
Caesar Act.

A physician at a government hospital in Damascus, interviewed this week,
however, said he had not seen any gaps recently.

“The Syrian health minister keeps saying the Caesar Act is badly
affecting the health sector,” said Dr. Muhammad, 45, who asked to be
identified by his first name to avoid punishment for speaking, “but I
haven’t noticed it.”

Experts note a major goal for these sanctions is to restrict the flow of
capital from Russia and Iran into Syria. The rationale is that if Mr.
al-Assad’s primary backers feel the financial pain of sanctions, they
could be persuaded into helping negotiate a peace deal.

But absent a diplomatic strategy to accompany economic sanctions,
critics worry the Trump administration will not get Mr. al-Assad’s
allies to change the status quo.

“As Russians will tell you, they’ve been sanctioned themselves — it’s
not a game changer to them,” said [Alexander
Bick](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/alexander-bick), who was
director for Syria in President Barack Obama’s National Security
Council. “Ultimately, sanctions are a tool in a diplomatic process.”

He added that any change in Syrian leadership would be “embarrassing” to
Russia: “It would undermine Putin’s message — which has been, ‘I stand
by my clients’ — and would undermine Russia’s broader goal to prevent
America from changing regimes at will.”

Some scholars say the Caesar Act sanctions could be leverage to achieve
small, specific goals, such as the release of political prisoners.
Others think they could have a greater effect — with the broad
jurisdiction Congress has provided the Trump administration helping to
achieve peace in a region that has been plagued by a brutal civil war.

But they note that only thirteen businesses and individuals that have
been sanctioned since June are actually under the new law. Most are
sanctioned under executive orders signed by Mr. Trump in October 2019.

Some question why Russian individuals and entities have not been
sanctioned, given their outsized role in the conflict.

“Does this fall into that huge area of uncertainty about how willing the
Trump White House is to take actions against Russia?” said [Steven
Heydemann](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/steven-heydemann/), a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It risks calling the
credibility of the administration’s commitment to the sanctions into
question.”

employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Damascus.
