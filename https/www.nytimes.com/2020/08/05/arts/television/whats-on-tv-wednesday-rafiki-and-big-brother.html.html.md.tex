Brother'}\label{whats-on-tv-wednesday-rafiki-and-big-brother}}

A forbidden love story comes to Criterion. And a longstanding game show
begins its 22nd season.

\textbf{RAFIKI} (2019) \emph{Stream on}
\href{https://www.criterionchannel.com/rafiki}{\emph{Criterion}}\emph{.}
Not only is this love story controversial in Kenya, where ``Rafiki'' was
filmed ---
\href{https://www.npr.org/2019/05/24/726541735/kenyas-judges-uphold-laws-that-criminalize-gay-sex}{it
is illegal}. The movie itself is illegal, too; it was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/africa/kenya-cannes-film-lesbians-banned.html}{banned
in Kenya} two weeks before its premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film
Festival, where it was the first ever Kenyan film to be shown.

Living in a country where gay sex is criminalized, Kena (Samantha
Mugatsia) and Ziki (Sheila Munyiva) begin a romantic relationship rooted
in struggle and dissent. They are also the daughters of two men running
against each other for a seat in the county assembly, making their love
especially forbidden. ``Rafiki'' is ``sharp at rendering the hesitancy
of their flirtation,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/movies/rafiki-review.html}{Ben
Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times}, ``as well as the
forces --- parental expectations, religion, an ever-watchful gossip ---
arrayed against them.'' It is a debut film from the director Wanuri
Kahiu.

\textbf{ARKANSAS} (2020) \emph{Stream on}
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Arkansas-Liam-Hemsworth/dp/B085NNRX6J}{\emph{Amazon}}\emph{.}
Clark Duke is a writer, producer and the director of this Southern crime
film based on a novel by John Brandon. He also plays Swin, the
counterpart to a low-level drug dealer named Kyle (Liam Hemsworth).
``Less a mob thriller than a ruminative drama about a life built around
orders and betrayals,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/movies/arkansas-review.html}{Devika
Girish wrote in her review for The Times}, ``Arkansas'' shifts between
the antics of Kyle and Swin and the back story of their elusive boss,
Frog (Vince Vaughn). John Malkovich also makes an appearance as Ranger
Bright, who works for Frog and intercepts the duo on an interstate
mission gone wrong.

\textbf{BEFORE SUNRISE} (1995) \emph{Stream on}
\href{https://www.hbo.com/movies/before-sunrise}{\emph{HBO Max}}\emph{.}
What do you do if you think you've met your soul mate --- a French
student named Céline (Julie Delpy) --- on a train passing through
Europe? If you're Jesse (Ethan Hawke), an American traveler, you ask her
to get off the train with you in Vienna and spend the day together,
fully knowing you'll have to part ways the next morning.

In ``Before Sunrise,'' directed by Richard Linklater, ``there's more
than romantic love in the air,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/movies/film-review-strangers-on-a-train-and-soul-mates-for-a-night.html}{Janet
Maslin wrote in her review for The Times}: ``There's also the
exhilaration of making contact with a kindred spirit, of instant
conversational intimacy between two strangers whose paths could lead
them anywhere.'' Jesse and Céline do meet again, nine years later, in
\textbf{BEFORE SUNSET} (2004) --- also available on
\href{https://www.hbo.com/movies/before-sunset}{HBO Max} --- before they
make a final appearance in \textbf{BEFORE MIDNIGHT} (2013).

\textbf{BIG BROTHER} *9 p.m. on CBS. ``*Big Brother'' returns for its
20th year and its 22nd season on TV. An ``All-Star'' cast, which
includes winners and fan favorites from previous seasons, will live
together in a house filled with video cameras and microphones. A
different contestant will be voted out of the house every day, and the
last contestant left will win \$500,000. This season, the show will
forgo its usual studio audience to reduce the spread of Covid-19.
