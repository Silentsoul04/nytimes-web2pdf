## Enormous explosion shatters central Beirut

A massive shock wave [rocked the center of the Lebanese
capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-blast.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
on Tuesday, damaging buildings miles away and sending a giant pink cloud
skyward near the port. At least 78 people were killed and 4,000 injured,
Lebanon’s health minister said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With the wounded still streaming into hospitals and the search for
missing people underway, [the toll was expected to
rise](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-blast.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).
Hospitals were so overwhelmed that they were turning wounded people
away.

There were two blasts within moments of each other, the second one much
larger. Prime Minister Hassan Diab said Wednesday would be a national
day of mourning. Images show [the extent of the
devastation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-explosions-photos.html).

**The cause:** An estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, commonly
used in fertilizer and bombs, had been kept in a depot at the blast site
for six years, top officials said. “Those responsible will pay a price
for this catastrophe,” said Mr. Diab, who hinted that neglect had led to
the disaster.

**First-person account:** Our correspondent Vivian Yee was at home [when
the blast shook her
building](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/lebanon-explosion-beirut.html),
leaving her bloodied and dazed. The Lebanese who helped her in the hours
that followed “had the heartbreaking steadiness” that comes from
experience with catastrophe, she wrote. “Nearly all of them were
strangers, yet they treated me like a
friend.”

## House of Lords list revives cronyism concerns

One is a Russian-born British newspaper baron whose father was once a
K.G.B. officer. Another is the [prime minister’s younger
brother](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/house-of-lords-boris-johnson.html).

Theirs are among the names on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s first list
of appointments to the House of Lords. The handing out of peerages, as
the lifetime appointments are called, is one of Britain’s most
dependable displays of cronyism, regardless of who the prime minister
is.

But critics say Mr. Johnson’s nominations could further undermine the
credibility of the long-troubled institution. He created 36 new peers,
the second-highest number in more than two decades, bringing the chamber
to nearly 800 members. He also nominated Brexit supporters from the
opposition Labor Party, which could have unpredictable results.

**Why it matters:** At its best, the House of Lords serves as a check on
the more unruly House of Commons. In recent decades, though, it has
become known mainly as a sinecure for well-connected types and wealthy
donors.

## Melbourne tries ‘shock and awe’ as virus surges

Australia’s second-largest city has imposed some of the toughest
restrictions in the world to beat back a new wave of coronavirus
infections. Officials are promising a “[shock and awe” attack on the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html)
that will last at least six weeks.

There are signs that people in Melbourne are getting fed up. Our Sydney
bureau chief writes that “the new waves of restrictions feel to many
like a bombing raid that just won’t end.” A door-to-door campaign to
check in on 3,000 people who had contracted the virus found that 800 of
them were not at home.

The police are facing opposition as they enforce the rules. Officers
recently smashed the windows of cars and pulled people out after they
refused to provide their names and addresses.

**The second wave**: Melbourne thought it had beat the virus in June.
But the city’s hotel quarantine program broke down, with travelers
passing the virus to security guards, who carried it to their
neighborhoods.

**Details:** Under the new restrictions, stores will close, schools will
return to at-home instruction and restaurants will offer only takeaway
or delivery. An 8 p.m. curfew is in place. The outbreak in the state of
Victoria, whose capital is Melbourne, peaked at 753 new cases on July 30
and has hovered at about 500 a day ever since.

Here are the [latest
updates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
and
[maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
of the pandemic.

In other developments:

  - Recent studies of [patients with severe Covid-19
    cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html)
    found that their immune systems unleashed a misguided barrage of
    weapons that could wreak havoc on healthy tissues.

  - After Russia announced a vaccination program set for October,
    raising concerns that inoculations may begin before tests are
    complete, the World Health Organization urged it to follow
    guidelines for [producing safe and effective
    vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-7bfa12a5).

  - Two preliminary studies of an experimental vaccine in the U.S. have
    [yielded encouraging
    results,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/coronavirus-cases.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-1228a480)
    said Novovax, the company developing the
vaccine.

Chloe Gilliland, 29, a former member of the Australian national team,

bad child” because she was too heavy.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Catherine Lyons, 19, once a top junior competitor for Britain,
said coaches would hit her and harass her about her weight, and even
shut her inside a cupboard for crying when she was a child. Above, Lisa
Mason, a 2000 British Olympian, said many gymnasts “are done with
normalizing the abuse that we were told was needed to make champions.”

The gymnasts’ stories are part of a push for change empowered by the
\#MeToo movement. National gymnastics federations in Britain, Australia,
the Netherlands and Belgium say they are trying to curb abuses.

**Pakistan:** Hindus in the country often face discrimination in
housing, jobs and access to government programs. Now, community leaders
say economic hardship is driving [an uptick in conversions to
Islam](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/asia/pakistan-hindu-conversion.html).

### And now for the Back Story on …

## Examining medical bills during a pandemic

*Americans have been battling surprise medical bills for coronavirus
treatment for nearly as long as they’ve been fighting the virus itself,
according to Sarah Kliff, our investigative reporter on health issues.*

*So she started a project that uses those bills, sent by readers, to
examine the cost of testing and treatment. We’ll be sharing their
stories as we explore how the virus outbreak is changing health care in
the U.S. Here’s* [*what she wrote about the
project*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/reader-center/coronavirus-medical-bills.html)*.*

I’m a reporter who has been writing articles about those bills since
mid-February. My first article focused on an American man and his
3-year-old daughter who faced more than $3,900 in bills for care
received during a government-mandated
quarantine.

“I assumed it was all being paid for,” the man, [Frank
Wucinski,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-medical-bills.html)said
at the time. “We didn’t have a choice. When the bills showed up, it was
just a pit in my stomach, like, ‘How do I pay for this?’”

Since then, my colleagues and I have written about $2,315 coronavirus
tests and $401,886 bills for treatment. We’ve discovered that the price
of a coronavirus test can vary by 2,700 percent within the same
emergency room.

I’ve run similar projects that have inspired legislation and demystified
American medical billing. Because health care providers keep their
prices secret, bills play a critical role in helping us understand how
Americans are grappling with medical costs during the health crisis.
