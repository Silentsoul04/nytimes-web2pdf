If you’re looking for something to read during this summer of
coronavirus and you tend toward the macabre, here’s a suggestion: Sign
up for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s daily operations
briefing, released via email around 9:30 Eastern time most mornings, and
count the number of ongoing disasters.

Wednesday morning’s edition included Hurricane Isaias, which had just
plowed up the East Coast, knocking out power for millions of households
across a dozen states; wildfires in California and Nevada; the risk of
“severe thunderstorms” in the Central Plains; parts of Texas still
waiting for damage assessments from Hurricane Hanna last weekend; and,
of course, Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which
has killed 155,204 Americans, according to the agency’s latest count.

As Henry Fountain and I [wrote this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/climate/hurricane-isaias-apple-fire-climate.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage),
this is what living with climate change will look like: Not just an
epic, Katrina- or Sandy-scale catastrophe every few years (though
probably that, too), but a relentless grind of overlapping disasters,
major and minor. The number of disasters that FEMA is handling is about
twice what it was three years ago, before Hurricane Harvey struck Texas,
and that doesn’t include its pandemic response. Disaster preparation and
recovery have blurred into a single frenzied motion, never ending but
also never quite succeeding.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The consequences of that shift are only starting to become apparent.
Homeowners begin rebuilding after a flood, only to flood again; cities
watch their [tax rolls
shrink](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-02/the-u-s-climate-strategy-of-total-retreat-is-failing?sref=UBrhZ1ro)
as property values fall; emergency managers at every level of government
are exhausted. And then, there’s the money: Federal watchdogs have begun
warning, with increasing urgency, that the nation’s disaster spending is
[not sustainable](https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/702215.pdf).

The additional pressure of the pandemic has focused new attention on why
disasters are so damaging in the United States: Underfunded emergency
and public health agencies, weak [home construction
standards](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/climate/building-codes-secret-deal.html)
that make evacuation so frequently necessary, and racial and income
disparities that put [some
communities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/climate/pollution-poverty-coronavirus.html)
at [greater
risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/climate/houston-flooding-race.html).
But the growing toll of disasters might also generate the pressure
required to address those problems, experts say.

#### Keep Up on the Latest Climate News

Updated Aug. 7, 2020

Here’s what you need to know about the latest climate change news this
week:

  -   - The move toward [opening the Pebble
        Mine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/pebble-mine-trump-alaska.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&context=storylines_keepup)
        in Alaska has surfaced a rare dispute between Donald Trump Jr.
        and his father’s administration.
      - Scientists at NOAA [updated their

        for the 2020 hurricane season, and now expect as many as 25
        named storms.
      - [Twin emergencies on two coasts this
        week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/climate/hurricane-isaias-apple-fire-climate.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&context=storylines_keepup)
        — Hurricane Isaias and the Apple Fire — offer a preview of life
        in a warming world and the steady danger of overlapping
        disasters.

“We have got to use this as a politically neutral, unifying effort to
instill resilience,” said Brock Long, who ran FEMA until last year. “If
we don’t make holistic changes in the emergency management and public
health industries, as a result of going through ’17, ’18 and now
Covid-19, then we are learning nothing.”

Officials should still have plenty of opportunities this year to work on
their disaster strategies. There are four months left in hurricane
season, and the worst storms usually don’t hit until the fall.

## One thing you can do: Help a neighbor beat the heat

Cities around the world are facing [more frequent and more deadly heat
waves](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/heatwave-climate-change.html),
and New York is no exception. Officials took note this year, delivering
thousands of air-conditioners to low-income seniors, providing millions
in aid for summer utility bills, and modifying the city’s cooling center
program to account for risks from the coronavirus.

But community organizers say the city’s response could use some help in
one key area: communication. The most heat-vulnerable New Yorkers —
seniors, people of color and people with chronic illnesses — sometimes
don’t know about the programs available, according to activists.

“I know a lot of people who don’t realize they are there or have trouble
accessing them,” Sonal Jessel, a policy and advocacy coordinator at [WE
ACT for Environmental Justice](https://www.weact.org/), said of the
various New York City resources.

Getting the word out doesn’t just depend on the city. Community groups
and individuals can play an important role, too.

Ms. Jessel noted, for example, that the locations of cooling centers in
New York City can be found on an [online
map](https://maps.nyc.gov/cooling-center/inactive.html?1596560400000) or
by calling 311. The cooling centers change location, though, and you
can’t check the map if you you’re not online. The phone line is more
accessible, but can be hard to navigate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Jessel had suggested the city do more targeted outreach, like taking
advantage of communications tools that are already widely used within
target groups. “We have a lot of immigrant populations that use WhatsApp
as a primary mode of communication,” she said. “How can we find a way to
get that information to them in the spaces that they are already using?”

Mike Harrington, an assistant director at The New School’s Tishman
Environment and Design Center, also said community outreach was crucial.
“People tend to trust community groups and people that they see almost
every day more than the city, or other political bodies,” he said.

## How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born?

See how days at or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit have changed in your
lifetime and how much hotter it could get.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Harrington said groups distributing food aid in cities, which are
currently very active because of the coronavirus, could easily provide
information on extreme heat. This conversation could be as
straightforward as: “Hey, here’s your food. Also, next week there’s
going to be a heat wave event. So, make sure if you don’t have an AC
that you have somewhere you can go, or you have people you can reach out
to.”

New York City officials noted that the [GetCool Air Conditioner
Program](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-03305) had
installed more than 48,000 AC units for low-income seniors, and that the
city does support direct outreach programs.

The city’s Be a Buddy program, for instance, started in 2017, works with
community organizations to pair volunteers with residents in
heat-vulnerable neighborhoods and check in on them during heat waves.

“The buddy program is one of the core pieces of our Cool Neighborhood
Strategy, which is our overall heat-resiliency strategy for the city,”
said Jainey Bavishi, director of the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency. “Heat
is often known as a silent killer because most people who die from
extreme heat actually die in their homes, so we want to make sure we are
checking in on those residents on hot days.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

However, the program is still in the pilot phase, yet to secure a
permanent spot in New York City’s hotter future.

The good news is that you don’t need to be in a formal program to be a
buddy. And you don't need to be in New York. As Mr. Harrington said, it
doesn’t take long to check on a neighbor. Making sure they know where to
go to cool off and hydrate could make a big difference in the next heat
wave. You could even help them get a free air-conditioner.
