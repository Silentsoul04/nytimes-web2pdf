The man — bearded, shirtless, a Marlboro Light clutched between two
fingers as it smolders uncomfortably close to his temple — looks as if
he has something heavy he wants to get off his chest. Like a person
attending his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, he seems at once eager
and apprehensive. “Hi, my name is Josh. I live in North Carolina, and I
voted for Donald Trump,” he begins, in a tone of abject resignation. He
cocks his head and rolls his eyes. “My bad, fam,” he apologizes. “Not my
proudest moment. I will not be voting for him again.”

The confession comes from Josh Harrison, a 40-year-old exterminator from
the Raleigh area, and it appears on the website and social media
platforms of a group called Republican Voters Against Trump. Created by
the conservative writer Bill Kristol and a handful of his fellow Never
Trump Republicans, RVAT, as its name indicates, is dedicated to
defeating the president this November. Toward that end, the group has
curated an online collection of more than 500 selfie videos from
Republicans, many of whom voted for Trump in 2016 and all of whom plan
to vote against him in 2020.

Harrison recorded his confession in June, sitting on his back deck
around 2 in the morning, after consuming some White Claw and red wine.
“It’s the first time I’ve ever voted for a Democrat,” he says in the
video. “But if Joe Biden drops out and the D.N.C. runs a tomato can, I
will vote for the tomato can, because I believe the tomato can will do
less harm than our current president.” When Harrison sent the video,
unsolicited, to RVAT, he felt as if he were shouting into a void. But
since RVAT posted the video online, it has been viewed more than a
million times on the group’s Twitter account, seen more than 100,000
times on its YouTube channel and received plenty of media attention.

The Never Trump Republican advertising space is a crowded one this
campaign. The Lincoln Project releases new spots seemingly every day —
one blaming Trump for the pandemic, another claiming that he’s seriously
ill, yet another intimating that his genitalia are small. But while the
slick Lincoln Project ads “work exclusively on the predispositions of
the faithful,” as [Andrew Ferguson has written in The
Atlantic,](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/tactics-lincoln-project/613636/)
the bare-bones RVAT testimonials are intended to do that rarest of
things in politics these days: persuade. And the method RVAT has chosen
to persuade Republicans to vote against Trump is an interesting one:
These videos are the group’s attempt to help create a “permission
structure” for voters to act in ways they never expected.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The permission-structure strategy was used to great effect by Barack
Obama’s old political strategist, David Axelrod. Before Axelrod went to
work for Obama, he cut his teeth helping to elect Black mayors in cities
like Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia. The key to winning those
races, which often featured multiple African-American candidates, was
attracting a sizable percentage of the white vote. To do that, Axelrod
spent a lot of time and effort working to win his Black clients what he
called “third-party authentication” — endorsements from individuals
(like elected officials) and institutions (like newspaper editorial
boards) that white voters trusted to make safe, conventional decisions
about whom to vote for. Once Axelrod’s Black candidates had those stamps
of mainstream validation, white voters believed they had permission to
vote for them.

Axelrod’s track record of selling Black candidates to white voters is a
big reason Obama hired him to run his 2004 Senate campaign in Illinois.
In that race, Axelrod planned to use Paul Simon, a former Illinois
senator, as a third-party authenticator, but Simon died, suddenly,
before he could make an official endorsement. Instead, Axelrod filmed an
ad featuring Simon’s daughter, Sheila, in which she said Obama and her
father were “cut from the same cloth” — a powerful signal to the rural
white Illinoisans who had repeatedly cast votes to send Simon to the
Senate.

RVAT has taken Axelrod’s strategy and updated it for our current
political moment — in large part by inverting *where* voters are looking
for permission. The group isn’t seeking third-party authentication from
conservative institutions, or notable politicians, or decorated military
officials, or even former members of Trump’s administration —
Republicans’ loss of faith in precisely those people is why they voted
for Trump in the first place. Instead of Mitt Romney or The Weekly
Standard-in-exile or William McRaven or John Bolton telling Republicans
that it’s OK to vote against Trump, RVAT has turned to Tom from Arizona
(“I’ve been a Republican all my life, and this November I’m voting for
Joe Biden for president”), Kelly from Florida (“Biden has my vote
because we need to do whatever we can to get that monster out of the
White House”) and Josh from North Carolina to grant permission.
Scrolling through the testimonials on RVAT’s website, the message to
Biden-curious Republicans is clear: You are not alone.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That sense of belonging, after all, was part of what propelled voters
into Trump’s corner in 2016. They may not have seen many elected
officials or *éminences grises* getting behind Trump, but they didn’t
need to; it was enough to see their friends and neighbors, or people who
looked like their friends and neighbors, packing airplane hangars or
lining up outside arenas. Those crowds signaled to potential Trump
voters that the outré reality-TV star they liked watching in the debates
— the one all the pundits dismissed as a novelty act — was, in fact, a
realistic candidate to support.

As Axelrod’s career attests, this kind of social permission isn’t a rare
thing to try to offer voters. It’s fascinating, though, to watch it
happen at a moment like this. Americans find themselves seeking
permission for a lot of actions these days, like abiding by (or
flouting) mask requirements and sending (or not sending) their children
to school. Things once viewed as inconceivable are now unavoidable;
things once taken as givens are now in doubt. The unfamiliarity of the
moment has also made its political possibilities seem endless, ranging
from drastic public-health and economic measures to aggressive changes
in policing.

When everything is abnormal, social guidance becomes all the more
powerful. That reassurance is what RVAT is trying to provide. In an era
of extreme polarization and negative partisanship — one in which
political allegiances are determined less by affection for one party
than by hatred of the other — the notion of a Republican voting for
Biden feels aberrant. But there’s so much aberrant about America right
now that nothing, presented in the right voice by the right messenger,
seems especially outlandish. Not even voting for a tomato can.
