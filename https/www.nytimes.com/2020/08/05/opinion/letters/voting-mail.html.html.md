Re “[Trump’s Attacks on Mail Service Sow Voting
Fears](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html?searchResultPosition=38)”
(front page, Aug. 1):

President Trump’s systematic assault on the U.S. Postal Service and
unfounded warnings that mail-in ballots will lead to widespread fraud
are the latest example of his desperate, illegal efforts to undercut the
Constitution and the rule of law.

Rather than sitting idly by while Mr. Trump works to suppress the vote
in November through delays, reduced service and other practices intended
to slow mail delivery and spur fear and distrust, the private sector
should step in and offer free ballot delivery for any voter wishing to
vote by mail.

U.P.S., FedEx and other private carriers have reliable networks that
Americans trust. They have drop-off locations, and they provide pickups.
By offering their services, they will earn important public kudos while
helping to ensure fair elections — as critical for any business to
thrive as it is for the survival of our democracy.

Rona Cohen  
Montclair, N.J.  

**To the Editor:**

As a California transplant to Oregon, for the last five years I have
happily participated in the latter’s 100 percent mail-in voting system.
It works like a charm. There is automatic voter registration at the
state’s motor vehicles department; results are reported expeditiously,
without a whiff of irregularities. Of course, the system depends on a
well-functioning Postal Service, a vital cog that Congress really needs
to do more about protecting.

**To the Editor:**

President Trump’s recent actions regarding the U.S. Postal Service
(limiting overtime, cutting back hours of operation and so on) are the
beginning of the corruption of the election that he is ominously
forecasting.

His warning echoes his past explicit and implicit solicitation of
foreign help to undermine his political rivals (“Russia, if you’re
listening,” etc.). Hobbling the Postal Service and warning about an
opportunity of a particular pathway to intervene in our November
elections signal and invite foreign governments to take advantage of
that opportunity.

Susan Relin Korn  
Newton, Mass.

**To the Editor:**

President Trump’s attack on the dangers of mail-in voting and the Post
Service’s complicity in raising the specter of reduced service are fake
news. The Postal Service delivers [billions of
pieces](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2019/1107-20-million-packages-to-be-delivered-daily-this-holiday-season.htm)
of first-class mail at Christmastime. U.S. citizens [cast 140 million
ballots](https://www.eac.gov/news/2017/06/29/newly-released-2016-election-administration-and-voting-survey-provides-snapshot)
in the 2016 presidential election. The capacity is clearly there.

James Biltekoff  
Buffalo, N.Y.

**To the Editor:**

Congress needs to speak up to deflect irrational tweets about fraud and
unreliable absentee voting. It should declare a national holiday for
voting to encourage turnout to the fullest extent possible, and it
should bolster support for the Postal System to enhance voting by mail.

Mary Elizabeth Etheridge  
Atlanta

**To the Editor:**

Given the current undermining of the Postal Service, here’s a
suggestion: Why don’t we keep the polls open nationwide for a full week?
Then we can avoid crowds and lines at the polls.

**To the Editor:**

Why not mail absentee ballots to all registered voters at the beginning
of September? That way, there would be sufficient time for voters to
reply and help ensure that their votes are counted.

Barbara Grossman  
Hillsdale, N.J.

**To the Editor:**

Instead of fanning the flames of fear and anxiety concerning mail-in
ballots, wouldn’t President Trump be wise to report to American
taxpayers the steps he is taking to ensure that all ballots cast by mail
amid a global pandemic will be counted? Increased funding for temporary
staff within the U.S. Postal Service to accommodate the surge of mail
would reflect a leader who knows how to fix problems in a prudent
manner.

Leslie Porter  
Rockville, Md.

**To the Editor:**

According to the Postal Service, 75.7 billion pieces of marketing mail
were delivered in 2019. This works out to many millions of pieces of
delivered mail each day. If the Postal Service is worried about handling
the mass of anticipated mail-in ballots for the presidential election,
it should declare a moratorium on any delivery of marketing mail for two
weeks before the election.

Steven Schreiber  
Voorheesville, N.Y.

**To the Editor:**

One effective way to improve mail-in balloting is readily available:
public service announcements, or P.S.A.s, which are disseminated by TV,
radio and the internet, without charge, to raise awareness of important
issues of public interest. Celebrities should be encouraged to
participate.

State and local officials should direct that these P.S.A.s commence well
ahead of the Nov. 3 election, spelling out their state’s mail-in ballot
procedures — simple, clear and nonpartisan — and the various deadlines.
The announcements should also reinforce the [Postal Service’s timing
recommendations](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2020/0529-usps-provides-recommendations-for-successful-2020-election-mail-season.htm).

Citizens must be provided the information they need to exercise their
right to vote, whether at the ballot box or at the mailbox, and be
assured that it will count.
