OK, people, I know you're feeling a little wan and helpless these days.
Sure does seem like a long time until November.

So let's take an early vote and pick Donald Trump's Worst Cabinet
Member. The competition is intense this year. Some days it feels as if
everybody in the administration is trying to grab the grand prize. That
they're running around with a list in their pocket titled Things to
Screw Up.

\textbf{Vice President} \textbf{Mike Pence} has been a faithful
hanger-on from Day

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  He's now doing double duty as Trump's coronavirus czar. In which
  capacity he predicted on April 24 that the epidemic would be ``behind
  us'' by Memorial Day weekend.
\end{enumerate}

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/trump-cabinet-worst.html}{Last
season's winner}, \textbf{Attorney General William Barr,} certainly
hasn't been resting on his laurels. At a recent House Judiciary
Committee hearing, he had to be prodded twice before acknowledging that
presidential candidates aren't supposed to accept foreign assistance.
When asked if he agreed with Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html}{shocking
suggestion} that a president could move Election Day, Barr said, ``I've
never looked into it.''

\textbf{Secretary of State Mike Pompeo} came in second-most-awful
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/trump-cabinet-worst.html}{last
time around}. Can he make the big leap? He got a boost recently from my
colleague Tom Friedman, who hinted at his opinion in a piece called
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/mike-pompeo.html}{``Mike
Pompeo Is the Worst Secretary of State Ever.''}

Nothing like the tried-and-true Trump veterans when it comes to
top-notch terrible. But there's new talent, too, thanks to all the
shuffling that keeps going on. \textbf{Chad Wolf}, \textbf{the acting
head of homeland security,} is the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/16/us/politics/all-the-major-firings-and-resignations-in-trump-administration.html}{fifth
person to lead the department} in the current administration. If he can
hang on until after the election, he'll have racked up more than a year
on the job --- a Trump administration achievement that is no doubt due
to all the prior experience Wolf had
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-chad-wolf-became-trumps-favorite-dhs-chief/2020/08/01/221604ec-d45c-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html}{as
a travel industry lobbyist}.

The \textbf{postmaster general} is no longer officially in the cabinet,
for reasons way too dense to explain. But we're going to leave
\textbf{Louis DeJoy} in the mix because of his vigorous efforts to wreck
the postal system --- a goal that we're sure has nothing to do with the
president's hatred of voting by mail. DeJoy's top qualification for the
job appears to be
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-republican-fundraiser-and-trump-ally-to-be-named-postmaster-general-giving-president-new-influence-over-postal-service-officials-say/2020/05/06/25cde93c-8fd4-11ea-8df0-ee33c3f5b0d6_story.html}{more
than \$2 million in donations} to Republican causes during the Trump
regime.

Did we mention his wife has been nominated to be ambassador to Canada?

The Worst contenders keep on coming: \textbf{Secretary of Commerce
Wilbur Ross Jr.,}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/trump-cabinet-wilbur-ross.html}{another
previous winner}, has been relatively quiet recently. Literally, since
he reportedly keeps
\href{https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/wilbur-ross-falling-asleep}{dozing
off at meetings}. The man is 82 --- what do you expect? But he's still
plugging away at the administration's priorities, like
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/2020-census-ending-early.html}{shutting
down the census count} four weeks early.

\textbf{Interior Secretary David Bernhardt} is a former lobbyist for the
oil and gas industries, a résumé you will notice crops up frequently.
This has given him the in-depth understanding that allowed him to take a
lead in the administration's massive financial
\href{https://readsludge.com/2020/07/15/trump-admin-bails-out-oil-and-gas-companies-that-gave-millions-to-gop-groups/}{relief
package for oil and gas companies}.

Bernhardt also seems to have been one of the central administration
players in the drama of Lafayette Square, when protesters were
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/floyd-protests-live.html}{ejected
by military police} to make way for Trump and his Bible.

But he's not volunteering any information. ``The Babe Ruth of
stonewalling,'' said Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon who's
been following Bernhardt's career for a long time. Bernhardt traveled
recently to Wyden's home state where he met with Native American tribes
--- and
\href{https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/508803-democrats-bernhardt-refusing-mask-meeting-tribes-oregon}{refused,
Wyden noted, to wear a mask}.

If you're into the environment and want another option, there's
\textbf{E.P.A. head Andrew Wheeler}, a former lobbyist for --- wait for
it --- energy companies. His latest crusade is
\href{https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/509792-epa-rule-extends-life-of-toxic-coal-ash-ponds}{extending
the life} of gigantic pits of coal sludge.

Or how about \textbf{U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer?} He's
not in the news as much as some of the others, but we'll always remember
\href{https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3092578/us-negotiator-robert-lighthizer-says-i-dont-know}{his
speech defending Trump's China wars}, revealing, ``I don't know what the
end goal is.''

More! How about h\textbf{ealth and human services head Alex Azar}? He's
been on the job a couple of years now, which by Trump standards makes
him a hardened veteran. When he's not busy failing to respond to the
pandemic, one of his other missions is overseeing the administration's
attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act and replace it with \ldots{}
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-28/azar-suggests-no-obamacare-replacement-plan-before-election?sref=Q23PdzcT}{some
other thing}.

You don't have to reward splashy bad behavior if you prefer the more
modest figures who prefer to screw everything up from behind the scenes.
Like \textbf{Education Secretary Betsy DeVos}, whose
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/opinion/betsy-devos-trump-worst-cabinet-member.html}{standing
in the Worst poll soared} when people realized they had a secretary of
education who didn't like public schools.

\textbf{Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao} may not have done much
for infrastructure, but she sure is connected. Wife of Mitch McConnell,
Chao is also a member of a wealthy and powerful family that's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/us/politics/elaine-chao-china.html}{deeply
into shipping contracts}. That
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/07/firm-run-elaine-chao-and-mitch-mcconnells-family-got-federal-ppp-loan/5390273002/}{got
up to \$1 million} from our government's recession-fighting Paycheck
Protection Program.
