# The Coronavirus Is New, but Your Immune System Might Still Recognize It

</div>

Some people carry immune cells called T cells that can capitalize on the
virus’s resemblance to other members of its family tree.

Eight months ago, the new coronavirus was unknown. But to some of our
immune cells, the virus was already something of a familiar foe.

A [flurry](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/48/eabd2071) of
[recent](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674\(20\)30610-3.pdf)
[studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z) has
revealed that a [large
proportion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2598-9) of the
population — [20 to 50
percent](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0389-z.pdf) of
people in some places — might [harbor immunity
assassins](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148916v1)
called T cells that [recognize the new
coronavirus](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/04/science.abd3871)
despite having never encountered it before.

These T cells, which lurked in the bloodstreams of people long before
the pandemic began, are most likely stragglers from past scuffles with
other, related coronaviruses, including four that frequently cause
[common colds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3416289/).
It’s a case of family resemblance: In the eyes of the immune system,
germs with common roots can look alike, such that when a cousin comes to
call, the body may already have an inkling of its intentions.

The presence of these T cells has intrigued experts, who said it was too
soon to tell whether the cells would play a helpful, harmful or entirely
negligible role in the world’s fight against the current coronavirus.
But should these so-called cross-reactive T cells exert even a modest
influence on the body’s immune response to the new coronavirus, they
might make the disease milder — and perhaps partly explain why some
people who [catch the
germ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html)
become very sick, while others are dealt only a glancing blow.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If you have a population of T cells that are armed and ready to protect
you, you could control the infection better than someone who doesn’t
have those cross-reactive cells,” said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at
the University of Washington who is studying the immune responses of
Covid-19 patients. “That’s what we’re all hoping for.”

T cells are an exceptionally picky bunch. Each spends the entirety of
its life waiting for a very specific trigger, like a hunk of a dangerous
virus. Once that switch is flipped, the T cell will clone itself into an
army of specialized soldiers, all with their sights set on the same
target. Some T cells are microscopic assassins, tailor-made to home in
on and destroy infected cells; others coax immune cells called B cells
into producing virus-attacking antibodies.

The first time a virus infects the body, this response is sluggish; it
takes several days for the immune system to sort out which T cells are
best suited for the job at hand. But subsequent encounters typically
prompt a response that is stronger and faster, thanks to a reserve force
of T cells, called memory T cells, that lingers after the initial threat
has passed and can quickly be called into action again.

Usually, this process operates best when T cells must battle the same
pathogen again and again. But these recruits are more flexible than they
are often given credit for, said Laura Su, an immunologist and T cell
expert at the University of Pennsylvania. Should these cells chance upon
something that bears a strong resemblance to their germ of choice, they
can still be roused to fight, even if the invader is a total newcomer.

In theory, cross-reactive T cells can “protect almost like a vaccine,”
said Smita Iyer, an immunologist at the University of California, Davis,
who is studying immune responses to the new coronavirus in primates.
Previous studies have shown that cross-reactive T cells may guard people
against [different
strains](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303473/) of [the
flu virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458262/), and
perhaps confer a trace of immunity against [dengue and Zika
viruses](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00517/full),
which share a family tree.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The case for coronaviruses is less clear cut, said Alessandro Sette, an
immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology who has led
several studies examining cross-reactive T cells to the new coronavirus.
Researchers have found people in the United States, Germany, the
Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom who have never been
exposed to the new coronavirus but who carry T cells that react to it in
the lab.

Researchers are eager to understand the history of these T cells,
because that might help reveal who is more likely to have them. A
growing body of evidence, including data published [this week in
Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/04/science.abd3871)
by Dr. Sette and his colleagues, points to common-cold coronaviruses as
a potential source. But even unrelated viruses can share similar
features, and researchers may never know for sure what originally “drove
their development,” said Avery August, an immunologist and T cell expert
at Cornell University.

Whatever the origin of T cells, their mere existence could be
encouraging news. There is much more to the immune system than T cells,
but even a semblance of pre-existing immunity could mean that people who
have recently grappled with the common cold may have an easier time
fighting off a nastier member of the coronavirus clan.

Cross-reactive T cells alone probably would not be enough to completely
stave off infection or disease. But they might alleviate symptoms of the
coronavirus in people who happen to carry these cells, or extend the
protection provided by a vaccine.

“That would be awesome,” Dr. Iyer said.

Children, who share lots of germs with their peers, might be good
candidates for this hypothetical scenario.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

But cross-reactive T cells are not necessarily a benevolent force. They
could instead be ineffectual souvenirs of infections past, with
“absolutely no relevance” to how well people fare against the new
coronavirus, Dr. Sette said.

There is even a small chance that pre-existing T cells could raise the
risk for serious symptoms of Covid-19, although experts consider this
possibility unlikely. T cells that are primed to recognize common-cold
coronaviruses might marshal only a lackluster response to the current
coronavirus, potentially sapping resources from other populations of
immune cells that have a better shot at defeating the new invader. “Now
you have your immune system distracted,” Dr. Iyer said.

T cells are also expert orchestrators. Depending on the signals they
send out, they can synchronize cells and molecules from disparate parts
of the immune system into a tag-teamed attack, or quell these assaults
to return the body to baseline. If it turns out that cross-reactive T
cells tend toward quieting the response, they could suppress a person’s
immune defense before it has a chance to kick into gear, Dr. August
said.

Then again, many types of T cells exist, and all operate as part of a
complex immune system. “It’s almost like some people are trying to say
this is ‘good’ or ‘bad,’” Dr. Su said. “It’s probably more nuanced than
that.”

Teasing it all apart will not be easy. Unlike antibodies, which are
inanimate proteins that often circulate in the blood, T cells are living
cells that often hole up in hard-to-reach tissues. That makes them much
more difficult to extract, maintain and analyze, Dr. Pepper said.

Researchers could learn more by testing whether cross-reactive T cells
are more abundant in patients who have had mild or serious cases of
Covid-19, although such studies cannot prove cause and effect. A more
laborious effort might involve measuring cross-reactive T cell levels in
large groups of healthy people, then waiting to see if they became
infected or sick from the current coronavirus, Dr. Sette said.

Strong evidence could also come from an animal model, like the rhesus
macaques that Dr. Iyer studies in her lab. Researchers could dose
primates with common-cold coronaviruses, and then see how their immune
responses stack up against the new coronavirus.

Less than a year into this pandemic, plenty of questions remain
unanswered, Dr. Pepper said. Immunologists cannot fully forecast how the
human immune system will respond to this new virus; even with science at
its speediest, that interaction must be studied in real time.

It’s a frustrating reality, Dr. Pepper said: “Until we see it in real
life, we just don’t know.”
