The following report compiles all significant security incidents
confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the
past seven days. It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials
refuse to confirm casualty information. The report includes government
claims of insurgent casualty figures, but in most cases these cannot be
independently verified by The Times. Similarly, the reports do not
include Taliban claims for their attacks on the government unless they
can be verified. Both sides routinely inflate casualty totals for their
opponents.

## July 31-Aug. 6, 2020

At least 42 pro-government forces and 41 civilians were killed in
Afghanistan during the past week. The Taliban announced a three-day
cease-fire during Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, starting Friday.
The Afghan Ministry of Interior said that the Taliban carried out 38
attacks during the cease-fire, killing 20 civilians and wounding 40
others. The deadliest attack took place in Nangarhar Province, where
Islamic State militants and affiliated groups attacked the main prison
in Jalalabad City, the provincial capital. At least 30 people —
including 11 police officers, five prisoners and 14 civilians — were
killed. In Baghlan Province, the convoy of a former member of the
provincial council was ambushed by the Taliban in the Chemai Sher area
of Pul-i-Kumri, the provincial capital. The 12 police officers guarding
the convoy were all killed.
