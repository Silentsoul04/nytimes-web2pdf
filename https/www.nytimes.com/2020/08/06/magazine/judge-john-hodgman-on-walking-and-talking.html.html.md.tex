\textbf{Doug writes:} \emph{My girlfriend, Susan, and I enjoy long,
brisk walks and quickly fall into great conversations. Oft times, after
I share a witty remark, she stops in her tracks to laugh, leaving me
walking alone, sometimes for 15 to 20 seconds. Her habit interrupts the
flow of our clever banter. She argues she has the right to react as she
sees fit.}

Dear Aaron Sorkin (you can't fool me): Your zippy walk-and-talk fantasy
dialogue looks good onscreen, but it's not really how typical humans
interact. So I'm not surprised Susan has countered with her own
cinematic cliché: the dead stop. Presuming your bon mots are truly as
bon as you think, you should be flattered that she stops to laugh; and
given that you are in love, you should probably try to notice when she
is and isn't around, lest she eventually let you keep walking forever.
Also, you wrote ``oft times.'' Come on, Aaron: Listen to how actual
humans speak some day!
