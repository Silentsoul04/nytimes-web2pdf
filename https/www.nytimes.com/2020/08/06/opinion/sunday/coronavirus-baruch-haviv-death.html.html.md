New York City’s streets and restaurants were still packed in early
March, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio argued over
methodology, logistics and the economic repercussions of whether to shut
the city down to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

The government
[dismissed](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/30/coronavirus-masks-trump-administration-156327)
the benefits of wearing masks. But my sisters, Tamar, Talia and Elana,
and I knew that our father, Barry Haviv, an 82-year-old stroke survivor
who lived in Midtown, needed protection. We got him N95 masks and begged
him not to leave his apartment.

Our father first came down with a cough and a fever, and then, on April
8, he was taken to the hospital after collapsing. The city’s health care
system was already overwhelmed, so he was sent back home. The next day,
he received a diagnosis of Covid-19.

Ten days after our father became ill, he was admitted to Mount Sinai
West in Manhattan, a short walk from where two of my siblings and I
live. And yet, he may as well have been in another state. Suddenly we
had become one of the many families for whom Zoom and caring strangers
became a link for loved ones. It was surreal to communicate with him in
this way.

It was hard to hear him over the roar of air purifiers and oxygen
machines, and it was nearly impossible to make out what his doctors were
saying through their double masks and face shields. We strove to set up
routines and waited for his body to heal. Amazed when he seemed closer
to himself and crushed when he wasn’t.

Because our father lapsed into a contentious state that affected his
care, the hospital agreed to allow one family member to visit in person.
My sister Talia, who had recovered from Covid-19, stayed with him. The
hospital provided a mounted iPad linked to Zoom, which enabled us to
spend hours together every day, Talia in person and the rest of us in a

But was what we saw onscreen real life? One day we were told that our

things did not appear so dire. After all, he responded to our voices and
reacted when we played songs from his favorite operas and Broadway
musicals.

Our father hated hospitals. Months after he suffered a stroke four years
ago, he flew overseas on his own to visit friends. He had defied medical
predictions in the past, and we were reluctant to accept this latest
one.

The next day another doctor told us that he was going to make it. But
each day would bring a new health issue. Did we want to intubate if
needed? Resuscitate? Some decisions he had already made in his living
will; others were left to us to figure out. The pressure was immense.

We had another conversation about taking him home to die. Then within
hours, we were told he was accepted into a plasma trial. Again we went
from discussing taking him home to die to trying something new.

In the end, after our father was hospitalized for five weeks and even
tested negative for the coronavirus, a doctor told us there was nothing
left that the staff could do for him, and asked, did we want to take him
home? We listened to the digital transmission, unable to fully accept
what was being said. I couldn’t help but wonder what would have happened
if he had been given plasma a week earlier. We still held out hope that
once home, away from the noise and medical interruptions, he could
improve.

I have spent my career shining a light on how the decisions leaders make

what I documented in Iraq, the Balkans and other war zones. He shouldn’t

I can’t imagine how our family would have coped if my sister hadn’t been

normal at other times, was extraordinary during this time. For our
father to have had the chance to have his daughter nearby, and his
children to have had more time with him, albeit through a screen, is
irreplaceable. With [infections
spiking](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
