City}\label{summertime-in-the-partly-reopened-city}}

While life is not quite back to normal, we found city dwellers making
the most of strolling the High Line, outings to Governors Island and
exploring a new section of Brooklyn Bridge Park.

For about four months, as the pandemic bore down on New York City, an
island had been left practically deserted in New York Harbor.

In a typical year, as spring turns into summer, Governors Island becomes
packed with picnickers and families on bicycles; tour groups weave
through the island's intricate paths and lines of sun-kissed couples
form for the next ferry back to the mainland.

But the pandemic forced the stewards of the island to close it to the
public to prevent a pleasant summer getaway from turning into a
super-spreader event.

It wasn't until last month, when outdoor attractions like zoos and
botanical gardens were preparing to open, that Governors Island did as
well. On July 15,
\href{https://twitter.com/Gov_Island/status/1283509265345458179}{it
welcomed} its first visitors of the pandemic era, and the next day,
\href{https://twitter.com/highlinenyc/status/1283495932202561539}{so did
the} High Line in Manhattan. In Brooklyn Bridge Park, more than three
acres of new parkland had
\href{https://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/blog/news-media/pier-2-uplands-opens-july-6-2020}{recently
opened} for strolling and lounging.

The picnickers and bicyclists were welcomed back to the island, as were
the pedestrians looking to amble down the elevated pathway of the High
Line --- but this time, they would only be able to walk in one
direction, northward, to aid in social distancing.

What is different about these visits is that there is not the same
opportunity for spontaneity. Gone are the days of impulsive ferry rides
to Governors Island; instead, visitors
\href{https://govisland.com/visit-the-island/ferry}{must book} ferry
tickets online in advance. And to visit the High Line, there are free
timed
\href{https://www.thehighline.org/visit/?utm_source=signage\&utm_medium=signage\&utm_campaign=visit\&utm_content=welcome}{entry
passes} to reduce congestion (though a limited number of walk-up passes
are available).

Other rules turn these day trips into a more regimented experience:
Markers on the ground of the High Line show how far visitors must stand
from one another, and people are only allowed to use the southernmost
entrance on Gansevoort Street near the Whitney Museum.

On Governors Island, tours remain canceled and two historical monuments
--- Castle Williams and Fort Jay --- are closed.

Still, there is plenty of fun to be had, and New Yorkers are coming out
to find it. \emph{JULIA JACOBS}
