### Listen to ‘The Daily’: Jack Dorsey on Twitter’s Mistakes

“Do you believe that you are one of the most powerful people on Earth
right now?”

Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s C.E.O., was quick to deflect. “No,” he laughed.
“Everything that has made Twitter powerful has come from the people
using it.”

That was one of the first questions that Michael asked Mr. Dorsey in a
wide-ranging interview on the role of his platform in shaping public
discourse and beliefs in America. The conversation that followed probed
the limits, dangers and responsibilities of that role — revealing just
how complicated the struggle against misinformation and polarization on
social media can be.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the four years since the 2016 election revealed social media’s role
in the American electoral process, governments around the world have
[grappled with how to
regulate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/technology/europe-big-tech.html)
the scale and scope of tech giants. Some social networks, like Facebook,
have been slower to acknowledge a need for change, but Twitter has
embraced the challenge, acknowledging that the company made mistakes in
the past. Still, [Twitter itself is
divided](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/technology/twitter-trump-dorsey.html)
over how to design products and policies that assign visibility to users
working in the public interest.

With three months to go until the 2020 election, we asked Mr. Dorsey to
reflect on his regrets and on his platform’s flaws — and on what he
hopes to change as he forges a new path for his company.

## Three key moments from our interview with Twitter’s C.E.O.

### What the platform should have done differently from the start

Twitter was founded without a plan, Mr. Dorsey said. “It wasn’t
something we really invented, it was something we discovered. And we
kept pulling the thread on it.”

The unraveling was “electric,” he said, as the small, localized platform
he built for friends to share updates on their lives morphed into a
global social network. In the process, though, Mr. Dorsey said he now
believes that he made a critical mistake: not hiring experts to help him
understand the potentially far-reaching importance of apparently small
design choices.

“The disciplines that we were lacking in the company in the early days,
that I wish we would have understood and hired for,” he said, were “a
game theorist to just really understand the ramifications of tiny
decisions that we make, such as what happens with retweet versus retweet
with comment and what happens when you put a count next to a like
button?”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Without this expertise, he said he thought that the company had built
incentives into the app that encouraged users and media outlets to write
tweets and headlines that appealed to sensationalism instead of
accuracy. At the time, he noted, he struggled to envision the app’s
potential social implications — and what those design decisions might
mean for “how people interrelate with one another, how people converse
with one another.”

Still, he said he believed that his company had played a correlative,
not a causal role in shaping public discourse — amplifying trends that
existed “in parallel” to the platform.

Abuse and harassment did not start after this polarization or the
political dialogue coming on Twitter,” he said. “It’s been on the
internet forever.”

### Building nuance and openness into the platform's design

Mr. Dorsey said that he, and his company, intended to learn from past
mistakes.

“It would be silly for us not to change Twitter,” he said. To Mr.
Dorsey, the company “should become irrelevant if it doesn’t change, if
it doesn’t constantly evolve and if it doesn’t recognize gaps and
opportunities to get better.”

He said he also hoped to build that openness, and admission of
wrongdoing, into the platform’s discourse. “It’s important that we
continue to allow the space for people to express their past and their
history in context,” he said, responding to the critique that Twitter,
with its limited character count and incentives for pith, promotes
intolerance.

“If we can’t express that, we can’t learn from it, and then we can’t
really progress,” he said, “or improve as a culture, or as individuals
either.”

To do this, Mr. Dorsey said that he was considering alterations to how
Twitter worked. In some iterations of the platform’s algorithm, he said,
“the most salacious or controversial tweets will naturally rise to the
top because those are the things that people naturally click on or share
without thinking about it or reply to.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Solving this issue, he said, requires demystifying the code that governs
social networks — an issue the industry has generally shied away from.
“They are way too much of a black box,” he said.

“We need to open up and be transparent around how our algorithms work
and how they’re used, and maybe even enable people to choose their own
algorithms to rank the content or to create their own algorithms, to
rank it. To be that open, I think, would be pretty incredible.”

### Should President Trump be censored?

Since he first sat behind the Resolute Desk, iPhone in hand, President
Trump has [reshaped the
presidency](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html)
— and the nation — with the help of more than 11,000 tweets. His account
is a forum for early-morning musings, personal vendettas and
off-the-cuff policy decisions. The platform has also facilitated digital
connections between the president and [extremists, impostors and
spies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-disinformation.html).

While Mr. Dorsey acknowledged that President Trump had leveraged
Twitter’s algorithms to create visibility “to great effect,” he
challenged the assertion that Twitter gave the president an unmediated
platform to share his views — and misinformation.

“I think it’s important that we do recognize, number one, that these
annotations are happening by the crowd in real time all the time,” he
said, noting that through replies, comments and retweets with added
context, users around the world have the opportunity to qualify,
challenge or engage with the president.

However, he said he did believe that there were particular areas in
which Twitter had a responsibility to intervene — specifically with
regard to language that encourages violence or voter suppression or that
challenges electoral integrity.

Twitter has recently risked provoking Mr. Trump’s ire after [placing
some of the president’s
tweets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/trump-twitter-label-seattle.html)
behind a warning label saying that they violated the company’s policies
forbidding abusive behavior. Mr. Dorsey said that the platform was
working to make the decision-making process about when to apply such
warnings “as tight as possible” and that he hoped to “make those
interventions as infrequent as possible.”

Still, he added, the company “won’t hesitate” to take action on accounts
that violate Twitter’s terms of service.
