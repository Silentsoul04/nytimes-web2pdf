# How Accurate Are Virus Tests? Ohio Governor’s Results Show Positives and Negatives

</div>

With testing delays nationwide, experts are increasingly recommending a
new type of rapid test that gives less accurate results. It is
imperfect, but as one expert put it, “pretty good is a lot better than
none.”

Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio received a [negative coronavirus test
result](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/us/mike-dewine-coronavirus.html)
on Thursday, hours after a positive test result had stopped him from
meeting with President Trump in Cleveland. The contradictory results
during a high-profile moment underscored the challenges of testing, an
issue that has repeatedly stymied the virus response in the United
States.

“I’m sure the internet is lighting up with, ‘Well, you can’t believe any
test,’” Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said [during an interview with 92.3
WCOL](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/433-woody-the-wake-up-call-28200119/episode/governor-mike-dewine-talks-about-his-69800541/?autoplay=true),
a Columbus radio station, on Friday.

“No one should take the results of this test and say, ‘Oh, none of these
numbers are right,’” he added. “There is always a possibility for
error.”

At issue are two types of coronavirus tests that are increasingly taking
center stage as part of the virus response in the United States. As part
of a screening by the White House, Mr. DeWine first received an antigen
test, a newer type of test that provides faster results but is less
accurate than traditional laboratory testing. He was later tested using
a more standard procedure known as polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R.,
an accurate but time-intensive method that requires samples to be
processed at a laboratory.

Widespread, fast testing is the cornerstone of any virus response and an
area where the United States has consistently fallen short. In order to
ramp up testing to a level needed to stop the spread of the virus,
experts are increasingly recommending a strategy that casts a wide net
with [widespread adoption of faster, less accurate
tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html).
But that comes with drawbacks.

To better understand the difference between the two types of tests and
the accuracy of testing overall, we spoke with Dr. Bill Miller, an
epidemiologist at the Ohio State University.

## What is the difference between a P.C.R. test and an antigen test?

A P.C.R. test is the test that is probably most familiar to Americans.
It involves taking a swab from a person’s nose and sending the sample to
a laboratory to process.

The approach amplifies a sequence of nucleic acids in order to detect
tiny amounts of the virus. Because the process amplifies the sequence,
the test is highly accurate, but the results can take hours or days to
process. “It allows you to get very high sensitivity, meaning most
people who have the virus who have a P.C.R. test are going to get
identified,” Dr. Miller said.

But there have been problems with access to the tests. As cases spiked,
the demand overwhelmed laboratories, and shortages in the supply chain
meant many Americans had to wait days — or even weeks — for results.
[The delays render the tests largely
useless](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html).
Experts say results are needed within 24 to 48 hours to effectively
quarantine and contact trace. In the United States, turnaround times are
often stretching three to five days, or more.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Antigen tests look for a protein that is a part of the virus. They can
also be done using a nasal swab, but can provide [faster,
easy-to-decipher
results](https://www.bd.com/en-us/offerings/capabilities/microbiology-solutions/point-of-care-testing/bd-veritor-sars-cov-2),
similar to a pregnancy test.

Antigen tests can provide results in [less than an
hour.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
But because the process does not amplify particles, Dr. Miller said “the
ability to detect the virus is lower by definition.”

## How accurate are the results?

All virus tests have the possibility of an inaccurate result. “It is
just a fact of clinical testing,” said Dr. Miller, who recommended using
common sense about the risk of exposure when evaluating unexpected
results.

But antigen tests are generally less sensitive and less accurate than
the traditional nasal swab, laboratory test. Interestingly, antigen
tests are more likely to produce false negatives — missing someone who
has the virus — than false positives, the opposite of what appears to
have happened to Mr. DeWine.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

Mr. DeWine is expected to be tested again on Saturday.

States are increasingly turning to antigen tests as part of a strategy
to ramp up testing. Mr. DeWine is part of a bipartisan group of
governors — four Republicans and four Democrats — who are negotiating to
purchase the tests from two medical companies, Becton, Dickinson &
Company and the Quidel Corporation. The companies were the [first to
receive emergency
authorization](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
for antigen tests from the Food and Drug Administration, but the tests
could produce false negative results between 15 and 20 percent of the
time.

## If the results are not always accurate, why are experts pushing for more rapid testing?

The United States is currently testing at a daily rate of 241 tests per
100,000 people, [according to an estimate by Harvard Global Health
Institute](https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/).
By the same estimate, the country would need 355 tests per 100,000
people to slow the spread of the virus, and more than 1,000 tests per
100,000 people to truly suppress the virus by detecting and responding
to outbreaks as they occur.

To ramp up enough testing, experts say the United States cannot rely on
traditional one-by-one laboratory tests alone.

Antigen tests offer one strategy that could prove useful for crowded
settings like nursing homes or schools. “You have the advantage of being
able to quickly identify people who might be infected and getting them
isolated and separated,” Dr. Miller said. “Whereas where you have to
wait 48 or 72 hours for a test result to come back, you have that window
of time where people are often not fully isolated or quarantined.”

In short, there are societal benefits to casting a wide net with faster,
less accurate tests, but it can cause confusion on a personal level, as
the DeWine case seems to show.

Speaking from his home in Cedarville, Ohio, on Friday, Mr. DeWine said
it had been “quite a big shock” to be told that he had tested positive.
He recalled that after receiving the news, he and his wife, Fran, came
back home. “Fran fixed me some chicken and rice soup,” he said. “She
thought we were settled in for the long haul here.”

But by Thursday evening, he had received better news.

“The antigen tests do give us a cheap way to do a lot of tests that are
pretty good,” Dr. Miller said. “Pretty good is a lot better than none,
and it collectively gets us a lot closer to the goal of being able to
isolate and quarantine people when they need to be.”
