# Abolish the Police? Those Who Survived the Chaos in Seattle Aren’t So Sure

What is it like when a city abandons a neighborhood and the police
vanish? Business owners describe a harrowing experience of calling for
help and being left all alone.

SEATTLE — Faizel Khan was being told by the news media and his own mayor
that the protests in his hometown were peaceful, with “[a block party
atmosphere](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/06/12/seattle_mayor_durkan_chaz_has_a_block_party_atmosphere_could_turn_into_summer_of_love.html).”

But that was not what he saw through the windows of his Seattle coffee
shop. He saw encampments overtaking the sidewalks. He saw roving bands
of masked protesters smashing windows and looting.

Young white men wielding guns would harangue customers as well as Mr.
Khan, a gay man of Middle Eastern descent who moved here from Texas so
he could more comfortably be out. To get into his coffee shop, he
sometimes had to seek the permission of self-appointed armed guards to
cross a border they had erected.

“They barricaded us all in here,” Mr. Khan said. “And they were sitting
in lawn chairs with guns.”

For 23 days in June, about six blocks in the city’s Capitol Hill
neighborhood were claimed by left-wing demonstrators and declared
police-free. Protesters hailed it as liberation — from police
oppression, from white supremacy — and a catalyst for a national
movement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the wake of the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police,
the Black Lives Matter movement is calling to defund the police, arguing
that the criminal justice system is inherently racist.

Leaders in many progressive cities are listening. In New York City,
Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan to [shift $1 billion out of
the police
budget](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/nyregion/nypd-budget.html).
The Minneapolis City Council is [pitching a major
reduction](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html),
and the Seattle City Council is pushing for a 50 percent cut to Police
Department funding. (The mayor said that plan goes too far.)

Some even call for “[abolishing the
police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html)”
altogether and closing down precincts, which is what happened in
Seattle.

That has left small-business owners as lonely voices in progressive
areas, arguing that police officers are necessary and that cities cannot
function without a robust public safety presence. In Minneapolis,
Seattle and Portland, Ore., many of those business owners consider
themselves progressive, and in interviews they express support for the
Black Lives Matter movement. But they also worry that their businesses,
already debilitated by the coronavirus pandemic, will struggle to
survive if police departments and city governments cannot protect them.

On Capitol Hill, business crashed as the Seattle police refused to
respond to calls to the area. Officers did not retake the region until
July 1, after four shootings, [including two fatal
ones](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/seattle-autonomous-zone-chop-shootings.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now a group of local businesses owners — including a locksmith, the
owner of a tattoo parlor, a mechanic, the owners of a Mexican restaurant
and Mr. Khan — is [suing the
city](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/capitol-hill-residents-and-businesses-sue-city-of-seattle-for-failing-to-disband-chop/).
The lawsuit claims that “Seattle’s unprecedented decision to abandon and
close off an entire city neighborhood, leaving it unchecked by the
police, unserved by fire and emergency health services, and inaccessible
to the public” resulted in enormous property damage and lost revenue.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Seattle lawsuit — and interviews with shop owners in cities like
Portland and Minneapolis — underscores a key question: Can businesses
still rely on local governments, which are now rethinking the role of
the police, to keep them safe? The issue is especially tense in Seattle,
where the city government not only permitted the establishment of a
police-free zone, but provided infrastructure like concrete barriers and
portable toilets to sustain it.

The economic losses that businesses suffered during the recent tumult
are significant: One community relief fund in Minneapolis, where early
protests included vandalism and arson, has raised $9 million for
businesses along the Lake Street corridor, a largely [Latino and East
African business
district](http://www2.minneapolismn.gov/ncr/engagement/WCMS1P-143470).
“We asked the small businesses what they needed to cover the damage
that insurance wasn’t paying, and the gap was around $200 million,” said
Allison Sharkey, the executive director of the Lake Street Council,
which is organizing the fund. Her own office, between a crafts market
and [a Native American support center](https://www.diw-mn.org/), was
burned down in the protests.

Some small businesses have resorted to posting [GoFundMe
pleas](https://www.gofundme.com/f/1101-e-lake-street-minneapolis-mn) for
donations online.

Many are nervous about speaking out lest they lend ammunition to a
conservative critique of the Black Lives Matter movement. In Portland,
Elizabeth Snow McDougall, the owner of Stevens-Ness legal printers,
emphasized her support for the cause before describing the damage done
to her business.

“One window broken, then another, then another, then another. Garbage to
clean off the sidewalk in front of the store every morning. Urine to
wash out of our doorway alcove. Graffiti to remove,” Ms. McDougall wrote
in an email. “Costs to board up and later we’ll have costs to repair.”

The impact of the occupation on Cafe Argento, Mr. Khan’s coffee shop on
Capitol Hill, has been devastating. Very few people braved the
barricades set up by the armed occupiers to come in for his coffee and
breakfast sandwiches. Cars coming to pick up food orders would turn
around. At two points, he and his workers felt scared and called 911.
“They said they would not come into CHOP,” said Mr. Khan, referring to
one of the names that protesters gave to the occupied Capitol Hill area.
“It was lawless.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He had to start chipping in for private security, a hard thing to do
when his business had already been hurt by the coronavirus.

But he considers himself lucky — and he was. Even weeks after the
protests, blocks of his previously bustling neighborhood remained
boarded up and covered in shattered glass. Many business owners are
scared to speak out, Mr. Khan said, because of worries that they would
be targeted further.

One mid-July morning in the neighborhood, workers in orange vests were
mopping off the sidewalks and power-spraying graffiti off the sides of
buildings. Two window repair guys said they had their hands full for
weeks. Shattered street lamps were being unscrewed and replaced.

A confusing array of security teams wandered around, armed with handguns
and rifles. Some wore official-looking private security uniforms. Others
wore casual clothes and lanyards identifying their affiliation with
Black Lives Matter. A third group wore all black with no identifying
labels and declined to name their group affiliation.

When a tall man in a trench coat and hiking boots walked over to
question Mr. Khan, the man spread his coat open, revealing several
pistols on harnesses around his chest and waist. He presented a badge on
a lanyard that read “Black Lives Matter Community Patrol.”

His name is Rick Hearns and he identified himself as a longtime security
guard and mover who is now a Black Lives Matter community guard, in
charge of several others. Local merchants pay for his protection, he
said as he handed out his business card. (Mr. Khan said he and his
neighbors are now paying thousands of dollars a month for protection
from Iconic Global, a Washington State-based private security
contractor.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Hearns has had bad experiences with the police in his own life. He
says he wants police reform, but he was appalled by the violent tactics
and rhetoric he witnessed during the occupation.

He blamed the destruction and looting on “opportunists,” but also said
that much of the damage on Capitol Hill came from a distinct contingent
of violent, armed white activists. “It’s antifa,” he said. “They don’t
want to see the progress we’ve made. They want chaos.”

Many of the business owners on Capitol Hill agreed: Much of the violence
they saw and the intimidation of their patrons came from a group these
business owners identified as antifa, which they distinguished from the
Black Lives Matter movement. “The idea of taking up the Black movement
and turning it into a white occupation, it’s white privilege in its
finest definition,” Mr. Khan said. “And that’s what they did.”

Antifa, which stands for anti-fascist, is [a radical, leaderless leftist
political
movement](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-antifa-trump.html) that
uses [armed, violent
protest](https://newrepublic.com/article/154110/antifa-arming-trump-crackdown)
as a method to create what supporters say is a more just and equitable
country. They have [a strong presence in the Pacific
Northwest](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-violent-left/534192/),

When the occupation in Seattle started in early June, Mayor Jenny Durkan
seemed almost amused. “We could have the Summer of Love,” she said.

After President Trump took aim at the governor of Washington State and
Seattle’s mayor [on
June 11](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1271142274416562176),
Ms. Durkan [defended the occupation on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/MayorJenny/status/1271226494858129409) as
“a peaceful expression of our community’s collective grief and their
desire to build a better world,” she wrote, pointing to the “food
trucks, spaghetti potlucks, teach-ins, and movies.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The lawsuit by the small-business owners, filed by the firm Calfo Eakes
on June 24, seizes on such language, pointing out that the city knew
what was happening and provided material support for the occupation.

Matthew Ploszaj, a Capitol Hill resident, is one of the complainants. He
said his apartment building, blocks from Mr. Khan’s shop, was broken
into four times during the occupation. The Seattle Police were called
each time and never came to his apartment, according to Mr. Ploszaj.
When he and another resident called the police after one burglary, they
told him to meet them outside the occupation zone, about eight blocks
away. He and other residents spent nights at a friend’s house outside
the area during the height of the protests.

The employees of Bergman’s Lock and Key say they were followed by
demonstrators with baseball bats. Cure Cocktail, a local bar and
charcuterie, said its workers were asked by protesters to pledge loyalty
to the movement: “Are you for the CHOP or are you for the police?” they
were asked, according to the lawsuit.

The business owners also found that trying to get help from the Seattle
Police, who declined to comment for this article, made them targets of
activists.

Across from Cafe Argento is a funky old auto repair shop called Car
Tender run by John McDermott, a big soft-spoken man. On June 14, Mr.
McDermott was driving his wife home from their anniversary dinner when
he received a call from a neighbor who saw someone trying to break into
his shop.

Mr. McDermott and his 27-year-old son, Mason, raced over. A man who was
inside the shop, Mr. McDermott said, had emptied the cash drawer and was
in the midst of setting the building on fire. Mr. McDermott said he and
his son wrestled the man down and planned to hold him until the police
arrived. But officers never showed up. A group of several hundred
protesters did, according to Mr. McDermott, breaking down the chain-link
fence around his shop and claiming that Mr. McDermott had kidnapped the
man.

“They started coming across the fence — you see all these beautiful
kids, a mob but kids — and they have guns and are pointing them at you
and telling you they’re going to kill you,” Mr. McDermott said. “Telling
me I’m the K.K.K. I’m not the K.K.K.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The demonstrators were livestreaming the confrontation. Mr. McDermott’s
wife watched, frantically calling anyone she could think of to go help
him.

Later, Mr. McDermott’s photo and shop address appeared on a website
called Cop Blaster, whose stated aim is to track police brutality but
also has galleries of what it calls “Snitches” and “Cop Callers.” The
McDermotts were categorized as both of those things on the website,
which warned they should “keep their mouths shut.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many of the listings include names and addresses of people who are said
to have called the police. Since the Cop Blaster post went up, Mr.
McDermott’s shop has received so many harassing phone calls and messages
that some employees have had to take time off.

A block away is Bill Donner, the owner of Richmark Label, who let police
officers use the roof of his factory to monitor the demonstration.
Inside, his company had spent 50 years making labels for products like
whiskey, soaps and natural beef jerky. Many days during the occupation,
Mr. Donner, who said he was in favor of police reform, had to negotiate
with the occupiers of the zone for access to his factory.

Twice, he called 911 and was told that the police would not be coming
into the area.

The experience of the small-business owners seems a universe away from
the rhetoric of Seattle’s politicians. As the violence turned deadly,
Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, who represents Capitol Hill, defended the
protesters’ use of their own armed guards instead of the police.

“Elected committees of self defense have historically played vital roles
during general strikes, occupations and in mass movements, in order for
the working class and marginalized people to defend themselves and carry
out necessary functions in place of the forces of the state,” [she
wrote](https://council.seattle.gov/2020/06/20/statement-on-the-shooting-at-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/).
She has called for the local police precinct to be permanently placed
under “community control.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the mayor did send in police officers to end the occupation after
the shootings, Ms. Sawant [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/cmkshama/status/1278848527460757505?lang=en),
“Shame on Mayor Jenny Durkan for deploying Seattle police yesterday in a
brutal attack against peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters & homeless
neighbors at the Capitol Hill Organized Protest.”

Many protesters who remained in early July were milling around a small
tent encampment on a lawn at Seattle Central College, some with rifles
slung over their shoulders. The smell of weed drifted through. The
streets were full of moving trucks.

The crowds were gone, but every now and then, the demonstrators gave
speeches about the importance of disbanding the police. Sometimes the
activists spoke about what went wrong with the occupation. One young
woman on a bullhorn argued to passers-by that the police left too
quickly and that a sustainable police-free region would have to be built
