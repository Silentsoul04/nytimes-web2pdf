Jerry Falwell Jr., one of President Trump’s most prominent and
controversial evangelical supporters, will take an indefinite leave of
absence from his role as president and chancellor of Liberty University,
[the board of trustees
announced](http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=380385)
on Friday.

The news comes days after Mr. Falwell posted, and then deleted, a
photograph on Instagram of him posing alongside a woman with his pants
unzipped and his arm around her.

Mr. Falwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier in the week, he apologized for the photo.

Franklin Graham, who leads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association,
defended Mr. Falwell in an interview on Friday evening.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He is a great leader and he has taken this school — it is one of the
largest universities in the United States. He’s done an incredible job,”
Mr. Graham said. “He is a great leader and I certainly support him.”

Mr. Graham said he had not spoken with Mr. Falwell about the photograph
or his leave.

About the photograph, Mr. Graham said: “All of us in life have done
things that we’ve regretted. I think he certainly has regretted that. It
was a foolish thing.”

Under the Falwell family’s leadership, Liberty has grown in five decades
from a modest Baptist college to an evangelical powerhouse with cash
investments and endowments of nearly $2 billion, nearly 46,000
undergraduates and a campus that sprawls across Lynchburg and
neighboring counties in Virginia.

The university was founded by Mr. Falwell’s father as a bastion of
social conservatism, one that was unabashedly assertive as it trained
what it called [“Champions for
Christ.”](https://www.liberty.edu/aboutliberty/index.cfm?PID=6925)

Jerry Prevo, the chairman of the board, [said in a
statement](http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=380387)
that Liberty had experienced academic, financial and spiritual success
during Mr. Falwell’s tenure.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Unfortunately, with this success and the burdens of leading a large and
growing organization comes substantial pressure,” Mr. Prevo said. He
added that the decision for Mr. Falwell to take a leave of absence “was
not made lightly.”

The decision was made by the executive committee on behalf of the full
board, but not all members of the board were contacted in advance of the
decision, according to one board member who declined to speak publicly.

In the photograph, both Mr. Falwell and the woman have their pants
unzipped. His hand is close to her chest. “More vacation shots,” the
post said. “Lots of good friends visited us on the yacht. I promise
that’s just black water in my glass.”

Mr. Falwell responded to criticism of the photo earlier this week in an
interview with WLNI, a local Lynchburg radio station. “Yeah, it was
weird. She’s pregnant. She couldn’t get her pants zipped and I was like
trying to like … I had on a pair of jeans I haven’t worn in a long time
and couldn’t get zipped either. So, I just put my belly out like hers.
She’s my wife’s assistant, she’s a sweetheart. I should have never put
it up and embarrassed her. I’ve apologized to everybody. I promised my
kids I will try to be a good boy from here on out.”

A now-deleted video of a party on the yacht, titled “Trailer Park Boys,”
showed Falwell family members and friends in costumes in an apparent
reference to the Canadian mockumentary series.

Students from Liberty expressed outrage about the photo on social media.
Several pointed out that it was in direct violation of the school’s code
of conduct.

On Thursday, Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina
and a former instructor at Liberty, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/RepMarkWalker/status/1291490728762368003)
that Mr. Falwell’s “ongoing behavior is appalling.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m convinced Falwell should step down,” he wrote.

Several pastors also joined Mr. Walker’s public call. Colby Garman, a
Liberty alumnus who serves on the executive committee of the Virginia
Southern Baptist denomination, called for Mr. Falwell to step down.

“In order to preserve the many great advances that have been made at
@LibertyU and honor the ongoing work of the excellent faculty there he
should step down and make way for new leadership,” Mr. Garman [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/ColbyGarman/status/1291849732759998466?s=20).

Mr. Falwell is a member of the board’s executive committee. [Members of
the board](https://www.liberty.edu/trustees/) include his brother,
Jonathan Falwell, who leads Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg; and
Mr. Graham’s son William F. Graham IV.

Mr. Falwell has been involved in a number of controversies in recent
years.

In May he [tweeted Blackface and Ku Klux Klan
imagery](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/jerry-falwell-blackface.html),
prompting demands for his firing and resignations of at least four Black
faculty and staff members.

In April a student filed a class-action lawsuit against Liberty over how
it has handled the coronavirus pandemic.

Last year the former editor of the Liberty student newspaper wrote an
[op-ed in The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/24/inside-liberty-universitys-culture-fear-how-jerry-falwell-jr-silences-students-professors-who-reject-his-pro-trump-politics/?arc404=true&itid=lk_inline_manual_17)
calling Mr. Falwell out for silencing students and faculty who spoke out
against his support of Mr. Trump.

Calum Best, 22, who graduated from Liberty in May and who has spoken out
against Mr. Falwell’s political activity, called the move “a victory.”

“It feels like they did it more because they were embarrassed, more than
because it was the correct thing to do,” he said. But, he said, “it’s
great that he is gone.”

“He is the one who holds up Liberty’s culture of focus on money,
material well-being, political nationalism,” he said. “Without Falwell
gone, we can’t really change any of that.”
