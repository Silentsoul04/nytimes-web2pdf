Just because you can’t go to the games doesn’t mean your summer has to

Even after months of postponed seasons and canceled events, sports
leagues continue to struggle to rebound (at least, in the United
States). For fans, this means that 2020 will most likely be a year with
fewer games and without any in-person games. Fortunately, there’s a raft
of podcasts that can give seasoned fans some content to fill that void —
and these four shows are so entertaining and enlightening that even the
most sports-disinterested person will probably enjoy tuning in. Find
them in your listening app of choice.

## [Tea With A & Phee](https://teawithaandphee.libsyn.com/website)

Wonder what life is like inside “[the
bubble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/sports/basketball/nba-bubble-life-twitter.html),”
the campus in Florida where all W.N.B.A. players areliving in order to
play their abbreviated season? Thanks to two of the league’s players,
A’ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces and Napheesa Collier of the
Minnesota Lynx, you can gaze into the bubble, but also into their
pro-level camaraderie. In the first episode, which debuted last month,
Wilson, the No. 1 draft pick in 2018 and Collier, 2019’s rookie of the
year, make each other laugh as they share their friendship’s origin
story and reminisce about their college athletic careers. Every week for
a half-hour, the pair promise to peel back the curtain on what it’s like
to play in this unprecedentedly weird season of pro sports, addressing
everything from the dearth of hair dressers in the bubble to the
league’s [Black Lives Matter
activism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/sports/basketball/wnba-dream-loeffler-warnock.html).

## [Sideline Tackle](https://www.sidelinetackle.com/listen)

There’s a style of history podcast, with just a single narrator and
evocative sound design, that can be almost mesmerizing, even as it
delivers “edu-tainment.” Joining the likes of such shows is “Sideline
Tackle” — a short but rich dive into different moments in soccer
history. In less than 15 minutes per episode, the host Leslie Gideon
charts a journey to pitches past, going back to, say, 2001, when
Southampton F.C. hired a pagan witch to reverse its bad luck in its new
home stadium, or to 1994, when the United States hosted the World Cup
and the men’s national team showed off its Americana-inspired denim
uniforms. Gideon’s well-written narration is enhanced by deftly applied
ambient sounds that serve as an immersive backdrop to the story, making
you feel as if you’re right there on the field. The result is a
bite-size step into a time machine of soccer history.

## [Trickeration](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-trickeration-63877804/)

Who doesn’t love a good prank? Each week on iHeartRadio’s
“Trickeration,” the host Matt Waxman goes right to the source of
some of the boldest cheats, practical jokes and hoodwinks in sports
history. Through interviews with the pranksters and schemers alike,
Waxman gets the firsthand accounts from people like Matt McGough, a
former Yankees batboy who was punked by the team’s captain, Don
Mattingly, on his first day, and Trevor Kraus, who wrote a book on how
to sneak into the Super Bowl.

## [Horse](https://www.horsehoops.com/)

Hosted by the podcaster Mike Shubert and the comedian Adam Mamawala,
this goofy basketball podcast promises to cover everything about
basketball “except for the wins and losses.” Where many sideline chat
shows can quickly get lost in the weeds, “Horse” is a structured comedy
that requires no prior knowledge of the N.B.A. The hourlong episodes,
which come out twice a month, ground the laughter in regular segments
like “Full Court Press” (“get it, like, the news?”), a discussion of the
latest in basketball news, broken down for the uninitiated; “That
Actually Happened,” wherein the hosts share a different wacky anecdote
of the sports history; and “3 on 3,” a ranking of bests and worsts of
things like 3-point celebrations. With a back catalog of 55 episodes and
counting, “Horse” might be the least intimidating, most celebratory
approach to the culture around the game itself.
