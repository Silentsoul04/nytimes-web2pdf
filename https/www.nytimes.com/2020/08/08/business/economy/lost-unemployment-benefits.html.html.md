# Without $600 Weekly Benefit, Unemployed Face Bleak Choices

A federal supplement to jobless pay was a lifeline for millions and for
the economy. Its cutoff, even if temporary, may have lasting
consequences.

When Latrish Oseko lost her job last spring, government aid helped
prevent a crisis from becoming a catastrophe.

A $1,700 federal stimulus payment meant that when her 26-year-old car
broke down, she could replace it. The $600 a week in extra unemployment
benefits from the federal government allowed her to pay rent and buy
food. When her day care provider closed, she was able to get her
4-year-old daughter a subscription to ABCmouse, an online learning app.

But the federal money has run out, and talks in Washington over how to
replace it have broken down.

So Ms. Oseko, 39, is spending much of her time sitting in the Delaware
hotel room where she has lived since her landlord kicked her out at the
end of July, applying for jobs on her phone while watching the debate
play out on the local news.

“I’m glued to it because I want to know, is there going to be hope for
me?” she said. “They’re fighting, and I have to watch them fight, but
they have a place to sleep at night.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Until a few days ago, most analysts expected Congress to agree on a new
emergency spending bill that would include at least a partial extension
of the extra unemployment benefits, perhaps including retroactive
payments for the period when the program lapsed.

But negotiations stalled, and in an appearance at his golf club in New
Jersey on Friday, President Trump said that if no deal was reached, he
would issue an executive order extending the extra benefits in some
form. It is unclear whether he has the authority to do so, or how long
it will take for states to start paying out the benefits if he does.

For many of the 30 million Americans relying on unemployment benefits,
it could already be too late to prevent lasting financial harm. Without
the extra $600 a week, which ran out at the end of July, they will need
to get by on regular state unemployment benefits, which often total a
few hundred dollars a week or less. For many families, that will not be
enough to prevent eviction, hunger or mounting debt that will make it
harder to climb out of the hole.

Households and the broader economy are particularly vulnerable at this
moment. [Eviction
moratoriums](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/housing-economy-eviction-renters.html)
are expiring or have expired in much of the country, although Mr. Trump
threatened to bypass Congress to reinstate a partial federal moratorium.
The Paycheck Protection Program, which helped thousands of small
businesses to retain workers, ends this week.

There are already signs that the economy has slowed down this summer as
virus cases have surged in much of the country. On Friday, the [Labor
Department reported a net gain of 1.8 million
jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/july-jobs-report.html)
in July, a smaller increase than in May or June. Many economists warn
that layoffs could begin rising again without more government support.
Food banks say they are bracing for a new wave of demand.

Before the pandemic, Ms. Oseko and her family were making ends meet,
albeit with little margin for error. She earned $15 an hour as a
contractor doing data entry. Her boyfriend earned a bit less cleaning
dormitories at the University of Delaware. They were able to rent a
two-bedroom house near a park where their daughter could play.

When the pandemic hit, Ms. Oseko’s hours were cut and her boyfriend was
furloughed. Then, in May, she lost her job altogether. In the midst of
that crisis, another one appeared: Their landlord sold her building and
gave them 60 days to leave. They moved out last week and are burning
through their meager savings at a rate of $76 a night at a Delaware
motel that is filling up with families in the same predicament.

Without a job, Ms. Oseko hasn’t been able to find a new apartment;
without an apartment, it has been hard to find a job.

“The jobs that I am qualified for want me to work from home, but I have
no home,” she said.

The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has disproportionately
affected low-wage workers like Ms. Oseko who have little in savings.
[Research from the last
recession](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170537)
found that when unemployment benefits ran out, people cut their spending
on food, medicine and other necessities, suggesting they were able to do
little to prepare for the drop in income.

The more generous benefits offered during this recession may have
allowed families to save some money, but those savings won’t last long,
particularly when food prices are rising at the fastest pace in years.

As a result, families are being forced to make decisions with lasting
consequences.

When Jason Depretis and his fiancée lost their Florida restaurant jobs
in early March, they started falling behind on their rent and their car
payment. The $600 unemployment supplement was a lifeline, allowing them
to hold on to their home and their car. But on July 28, that lifeline
snapped: The repo man showed up for the car on the day that their
landlord delivered a three-day notice of eviction.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With the extra $600 a week, Mr. Depretis, 42, would probably have been
able to pay enough to hold off both creditors. Without it, he had to
choose. He paid his landlord $650 to stave off eviction, and watched the
car be towed away.

But it was a terrible time to lose the car. He had found a job starting
in September at a restaurant, but it is 45 minutes away, and there is no
bus service that corresponds with his hours. The closest food bank is 30
minutes away, and he can’t get there without a vehicle. He said he
didn’t know how he and his fiancée would put food on the table for
themselves and their two children.

“Without the $600, there’s absolutely no way that my family’s going to
make it,” he said.

For families like Mr. Depretis’s, even a temporary loss of income can be
the start of a downward spiral, said Elizabeth Ananat, a Barnard College
economist who has been studying the pandemic’s impact on low-wage
workers. Wealthier families may be able to draw on savings to get
through until Congress reaches a deal. But for lower-income households,
even a temporary lapse in benefits can have lasting consequences. An
eviction can make it hard to rent in the future. Having a car
repossessed can make it hard to find another job. And for children,
periods of hunger, homelessness and stress can have long-term effects on
development and learning.

“Children cannot smooth their eating over the year,” Ms. Ananat said.
“Families that do not have access to credit cannot smooth their food,
their electricity, any of their necessities.”

Many Republicans argue that the extra benefits were keeping recipients
from looking for work, especially because many were getting more on
unemployment than they had made on the job. Business owners have
complained that they are struggling to fill positions.

But
[several](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3664265)
[studies](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0kcoix35jxt1u4/UI_Employment_HPS.pdf?dl=0)
have found [no
evidence](https://news.yale.edu/2020/07/27/yale-study-finds-expanded-jobless-benefits-did-not-reduce-employment)
that the supplement was discouraging job hunting, and many workers
[appear to be accepting
jobs](https://twitter.com/ernietedeschi/status/1283832188434362368) even
when the pay is less than their unemployment benefits. And by injecting
billions of dollars into the economy each week, the benefits almost
certainly prevented even more layoffs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The lapse in benefits will push some people to return to work. But that
decision, too, can carry costs.

When the pandemic hit, Enrique Guzman, a fleet service clerk at Los
Angeles International Airport, was given the choice: to keep working or
to stay home and receive a portion of his income, the equivalent of 10
hours a week.

Mr. Guzman, 27, decided to stay home. He has asthma, which puts him at a
higher risk of complications if he were to catch the coronavirus, and he
lives with his girlfriend and her mother, whose age, 51, makes her
vulnerable to the virus. Between unemployment benefits and the partial
paychecks from the airline, he was able to bring in $1,050 a week — less
than he earned working full time, but enough to support his girlfriend
and her mother.

But without the extra money, Mr. Guzman can no longer afford the $1,875
rent for their two-bedroom apartment in Montebello, Calif., plus the
cost of utilities, food, and his student and car loan payments.

On Monday, with a sinking feeling in his stomach, he put on his uniform
and returned to the airport for his first shift since the pandemic
started. Mr. Guzman said he had no other choice.

“It wasn’t something that I wanted to do, but I’m the only income in my
household now and I needed to go back to work so we can afford to pay
our rent, afford to pay our bills,” he said. “I’m putting myself at risk
so that we can afford to stay afloat.”
