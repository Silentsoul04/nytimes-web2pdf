# Pelosi Is Playing Hardball on Coronavirus Relief. She Thinks She’ll Win.

</div>

Emboldened by Republican divisions and a favorable political landscape,
the speaker is refusing to agree to a narrow relief measure, unbothered
by charges that she is an impediment to a deal.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — As the clock ticked down Thursday on a self-imposed
deadline for a breakthrough in coronavirus relief talks with no deal in
sight, Jim Cramer, the brash CNBC host, had an on-air proposal for
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.

Why not try invoking the memory of [the late civil rights icon John
Lewis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html) to
try to persuade Republicans to agree to help the most vulnerable
Americans, including “minorities” struggling to weather a pandemic and a
recession?

Ms. Pelosi flashed a forced smile. “Perhaps,” she deadpanned, “you
mistook them for somebody who gives a damn for what you just described.”

The comment — unusually coarse for Ms. Pelosi, 80, who was educated by
nuns — was part insult, part dare and part slogan for a woman who
believes she has the upper hand in crisis negotiations and does not
intend to lose it. And it reflected how, two weeks into stalled talks
over another round of federal assistance to prop up a battered economy,
and less than three months before Election Day, the speaker of the House
is going for the jugular.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She has publicly heaped disdain on her White House negotiating partners
as she plays hardball in daily private meetings in her Capitol office
suite, convinced that she has political leverage to force Republicans to
agree to far more generous aid than they have offered. She has been
unwilling to bow to the Trump administration’s demands for a much
narrower bill or a stopgap solution.

“We’re not doing short-term action, because if we do short-term action,
they’re not going to do anything else,” she said of Republicans Friday
afternoon during an interview in her office, after negotiators blew past
their own deadline without a deal. “That’s it — like a sucker punch, you
know — ‘Let us just do this little bit,’ and then you know what? We’ll
never see them again.”

Instead, Ms. Pelosi is pushing for a sweeping package that includes
billions of dollars for state and local governments and schools, food
and rental assistance, and additional aid for election security and the
Postal Service.

All the while, Ms. Pelosi has made it clear that she does not much trust
President Trump’s advisers — she has taken to asking negotiators to turn
over their electronic devices before entering sessions in her office —
nor does she think highly of their ability to forge a compromise.
“You’ve never done a deal,” she has reminded Mark Meadows, the White
House chief of staff and former congressman, according to a person
familiar with the talks who described them on the condition of
anonymity.

Ms. Pelosi’s strategy carries substantial political risk and real
collateral damage, at least in the short term. In holding out for a
sweeping relief package, Democrats have swatted away Republican pleas to
pass weeklong extensions of the expired [$600-per-week in extra federal
jobless
pay](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/business/economy/lost-unemployment-benefits.html)
that millions of Americans have relied upon, drawing Republican charges
of obstruction.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The impasse has prompted Mr. Trump [to threaten unilateral
action](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/trump-congress-stimulus.html)
in the coming days to provide relief on his own — though it remains
unclear if he has the legal authority to do so. And it has sown
uneasiness even among some rank-and-file Democrats, particularly those
who represent politically competitive districts and are eager to show
voters their party is capable of bipartisan compromise on pressing
issues.

“We cannot let desperate Americans and small businesses be used as pawns
— even in the face of a president and Senate majority leader who appear
incapable of empathy,” said Representative Dean Phillips, a first-term
Democrat from Minnesota.

Republicans have been far sharper in their criticism of her tactics,
blaming Ms. Pelosi for the lapse in jobless aid even though she included
a full extension of the payments in her May legislation, which
Republicans are trying to make deep cuts to.

“Speaker Pelosi has refused, again and again and again, to do what’s
right for the country, to work together in a bipartisan way to come up
with a package to help provide relief in terms of Covid and the economic
crisis,” Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, told Fox News
Radio last week.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Ms. Pelosi, in her second term as speaker and arguably as powerful
as she has ever been, has seen little reason to change course. Instead,
with public opinion she says is in favor of expansive government
intervention and polls showing Republicans up and down the ballot
sagging under the weight of Mr. Trump’s coronavirus response, the
speaker and Democrats have been [emboldened to press their
advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/coronavirus-democrats-strategy.html).

“At the core of her negotiations are values, and that steers her right,”
said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority
leader. “It’s real. What she says out there, she says inside.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Pelosi’s hand has been strengthened by the [divisions among
Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/coronavirus-stimulus.html),
many of whom do not want to provide any additional aid, meaning that the
White House will need broad support from Democrats to push through any
stimulus plan.

Ms. Pelosi set the stage for the dynamic in May, when — quick on the
heels of the enactment of nearly $3 trillion in pandemic aid bills — she
corralled the Democratic votes needed to approve an additional $3.4
trillion in relief. Senate Republicans [waited until late last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-republicans-blowback-aid.html)
to unveil their own $1 trillion plan, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly
undercut their position.

White House officials say it is Ms. Pelosi who has hamstrung the talks.

“It’s interesting just to hear the comments from Senator Schumer and
Speaker Pelosi saying that they want a deal,” Mr. Meadows declared on
Friday, after negotiations broke up with no resolution and Ms. Pelosi
addressed the news media. “Their actions do not indicate the same
thing.”

Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said Ms. Pelosi and
Democrats were motivated not by substantive policy differences, but by
politics. They “still think it’s politically beneficial for nothing to
happen,” he said.

It is not the first time that Ms. Pelosi has found herself with
considerable leverage in a high-stakes negotiation with Republicans at a
time of crisis. During the financial meltdown of 2008, as Republicans
balked at [a $700 billion bailout
package](http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/200904_CREDITCRISIS/recipients.html)
that George W. Bush’s administration had requested to stave off further
financial ruin, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary,
famously [went down on one
knee](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/business/26bailout.html) at the
White House to beg Ms. Pelosi not to pull her support from the plan.

“It’s not me blowing this up. It’s the Republicans,” Ms. Pelosi told him
then, adding bitingly, “I didn’t know you were Catholic.”

This time, though, it has become progressively less clear whether Mr.
Trump — who has been [more an irritant than an active
participant](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/congress-jobless-aid-talks-trump.html)
in the negotiations — even wants the deal that he needs Ms. Pelosi to
deliver.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Up and until now, she has rationally assumed there was some
self-interest on the part of Trump that would lead to a deal,” said
former Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who
joined Ms. Pelosi that day at the White House in 2008. “If, in fact,
that turns out not to be the case, you have a whole new ballgame to
think about.”

Though she acknowledges political differences with Mr. Bush, Ms. Pelosi
is far more blunt about her disdain for Mr. Trump, with whom she has
[developed a toxic
relationship](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/trump-pelosi-photo.html).

“This president is the biggest failure in our history,” she said on
Friday. “I can’t think of anybody worse.”

He appears to return the sentiment, referring again to Ms. Pelosi this
week as “Crazy Nancy.”

While she said she has had productive negotiations with Steven Mnuchin,
the Treasury secretary — so much so that Mr. Mnuchin has felt compelled
to privately answer complaints from Republicans that he has given too
much — she is more skeptical of Mr. Meadows, who made his name in
Congress blowing up bipartisan deals from the right, not constructing
them. Talks have been “less efficient” than the discussions that led to
the first phases of pandemic relief, she said.

“Mark Meadows is in the room as an enforcer," she said, adding that she
was not sure whether “he’s a clone for the president, or the president’s
a clone for him.”

Ms. Pelosi said she also questioned the overall approach of the
administration, comparing their negotiating tactics to “Sophie’s
Choice,” a film in which a mother must choose which of her children to
send to their death.

At one point during one of the negotiations, Mr. Mnuchin had inquired
what WIC, a nutritional program specifically for women, infants and
children, was, according to a person familiar with the talks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“On any given day, you might say, why am I even talking to these people?
They don’t care,” Ms. Pelosi said.

“But the fact is, we’re there — we have an opportunity to do something.”
