the 2020
Race}\label{trumps-axios-interview-kanye-wests-campaign-the-latest-in-the-2020-race}}

President Trump wants to brand Joe Biden as a doddering gaffe machine.
But the incumbent's own rhetoric causes so much controversy it is
overwhelming the strategy.

  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-finance.html}{President
  Trump's campaign raised more than Joe Biden's in July}, announcing a
  \textbf{\$165 million} haul for the month along with the Republican
  National Committee. The Biden campaign said it raised \textbf{\$140
  million} in July. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had
  raised more than Trump in the two previous months.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A poll this week showed Trump's support stabilizing in Iowa. Trump led
  Biden among registered voters
  \href{https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_080520/}{in
  the Monmouth University poll}, \textbf{48 percent} to \textbf{45
  percent}. Trump appears weaker in the state than he was in 2016, when
  he won Iowa by more than 9 points, but his support appears to be
  holding steady there in recent polling.
\item
  The Biden campaign spent \textbf{\$11.8 million} on television ads,
  and the Trump campaign spent \textbf{\$4.4 million}.
\item
  On Facebook, Trump again outspent Biden, roughly \textbf{\$723,000} to
  \textbf{\$17,000}.

If President Trump and his allies wanted to cast Joe Biden as an
error-prone politician of yesteryear, this week they got some help.

Mr. Biden's interview with a slew of Black and Latino journalists
produced two clippable comments for Republicans: At one point, Mr. Biden
got testy with a reporter who asked him about taking a mental aptitude
test, suggesting the reporter should be tested for cocaine and asking,
\href{https://twitter.com/errolbarnett/status/1290940305865400321?s=20}{``Are
you a junkie?''} At another stage of the interview, Mr. Biden contrasted
Black and Latino communities by saying the latter had more diversity.

But both comments, and Mr. Biden's eventual attempt to walk back his
remarks about Black diversity, were overshadowed by Mr. Trump's own
statements, a consequence of the president's lack of discipline in
executing his own campaign strategy. Mr. Trump's charge that Mr. Biden,
a practicing Catholic, was ``against God'' drew ire from across the
political spectrum and supplanted Mr. Biden's comments in the news
cycle.

It was a microcosm of Mr. Trump's current political struggle: He
succeeded in 2016 as advisers ``let Trump be Trump.'' Now, he can't seem
to stand down, even when it would be helpful to let Biden be Biden.

\hypertarget{biden-and-trump-both-loved-trumps-axios-interview}{%
\subsection{Biden and Trump both loved Trump's Axios
interview}\label{biden-and-trump-both-loved-trumps-axios-interview}}

Between his regular appearances in the White House briefing room, his
overactive Twitter feed and his endless interviews with anchors on Fox
News, President Trump can often feel like a leader who is unavoidable
for comment. But Mr. Trump's
\href{https://www.axios.com/full-axios-hbo-interview-donald-trump-cd5a67e1-6ba1-46c8-bb3d-8717ab9f3cc5.html}{interview
last week with Jonathan Swan}, a reporter for Axios, still managed to
show the president in a different light.

``It is what it is,'' Mr. Trump told Mr. Swan when pressed about how he
could claim the pandemic was under control with the United States
averaging more than a thousand deaths per day.

The callous statement from a president who has been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/donald-fred-trump.html}{unable
to demonstrate empathy in public} throughout the coronavirus pandemic
was quickly
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CDe2axiFopA/?igshid=1n57idhulpl2m}{promoted
by Mr. Biden}, who has been running a campaign based in large part on
the simple notion that the country needs an empathetic leader at this
time.

The strange part: Mr. Trump and his aides liked the interview, too. ``I
thought it was a good interview,'' Mr. Trump said afterward. Many of his
aides deemed
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/trump-john-lewis-axios.html}{the
hoopla over Mr. Trump's comments} overrated, but did not see the
interview as a mistake.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In fact, with rallies off the calendar for the foreseeable future, Mr.
  Trump's aides said they planned to have him do more interviews like
  the one with ``Axios on HBO.'' They think interviews with Sunday show
  hosts, television network anchors and mainstream news outlets are
  ultimately helpful to Mr. Trump, in addition to his steady diet of
  softball sitdowns with Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity.
\item
  Mr. Trump is also directing some of the coverage himself, suggesting
  to his aides the reporters he wants to meet with and pushing for those
  interviews himself.
\item
  Mr. Swan's interview also underscored the uneven playing field that is
  the briefing room, where Mr. Trump controls the give-and-take with
  journalists. Faced with a well-prepared reporter who had the time and
  space to follow up on his own questions, Mr. Trump appeared defensive
  and flat-footed in his understanding of his own administration's virus
  response.

Why?}\label{republicans-are-helping-kanye-wests-campaign-why}}

The realness of Kanye West's presidential campaign depends on whom you
ask. The cultural icon and rap artist has filed forms declaring his
candidacy in several states. This week, reports exposed an interesting,
if not surprising, twist:
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/kanye-west-president-republicans.html}{Republican
operatives in swing states were helping Mr. West's efforts}, gathering
signatures in places like Wisconsin and Colorado to give the
self-proclaimed Yeezus more legitimacy.

Why are some Republicans helping his campaign? According to
\href{https://twitter.com/patrickdmarley/status/1291029714950389760?s=20}{a
political reporter in Wisconsin}, the state G.O.P. was hoping Mr. West
could play the role of spoiler in November, siphoning votes from Mr.
Biden. That is a big bet, riddled with assumptions and lacking
supporting evidence. Here is what we know:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is no evidence Mr. West would win a significant number of Black
  voters. **** In 2018, when Mr. West was included in
  \href{http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/05/11/rel5x.-.kanye.west.pdf}{a
  national CNN poll}, he was viewed favorably by only 20 percent of
  nonwhite adults, about the same as his rating among white adults. And
  he was viewed more favorably by Republicans (35 percent) than by
  Democrats (12 percent).
\item
  The lane for spoiler candidates in 2020 is smaller than in 2016. ****
  In polling, Mr. Biden's unfavorable ratings are much lower than those
  for Hillary Clinton, the previous Democratic nominee. That leaves less
  room for third-party candidates to capitalize on voters who dislike
  both candidates.
\item
  Mr. West's political views are \ldots{} inconsistent. He has given
  money to and supported progressive Democrats, donned a ``Make America
  Great Again'' hat, denounced the oppression of Black people and
  criticized abortion. There is no clear ideological home.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The debate about the
debates}\label{the-debate-about-the-debates}}

This much is clear: The Trump campaign and the Biden campaign have
agreed to three debates, scheduled for late September and October. This
week, however, the Trump campaign requested a fourth presidential debate
to be held earlier in September. The idea was floated by Mr. Trump's
confidante and personal lawyer, the former New York City mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani.

The gambit was shot down by the nonprofit commission that governs
presidential debates, but it's another sign Republicans are desperate to
shake up the race. Mr. Trump's supporters have crowed for months that in
a one-on-one setting, the president would expose Mr. Biden as feckless
and out of touch. They have tried to paint Mr. Biden as scared to debate
Mr. Trump.

The Democratic presidential primary should be instructive for this
approach. Many of Mr. Biden's primary opponents also assumed he would
flail on the debate stage, but in key moments he rose to the occasion.
And the predictions that Mr. Biden would be a poor debater lowered the
bar enough that he could clear it. Be careful what you wish for.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The Democratic National Convention is going all virtual.
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/joe-biden-milwaukee.html}{Not
  even Mr. Biden will appear in Milwaukee} to accept the party's
  nomination. It's a blow to a city that had prepared to host thousands
  and more recently has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. In
  terms of politics, Democrats are hoping voters reward them for taking
  the virus seriously.
\item
  Vice President Mike Pence thinks Mr. Biden's decision to stay home has
  created an opportunity for the president's re-election campaign ---
  and has
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/pence-wisconsin-biden-convention.html?smid=tw-share}{scheduled
  his own campaign trip to Wisconsin on Aug. 17} with the hope of
  filling the void.
\item
  Mr. Trump on Friday night called a surprise ``news conference'' at his
  private club in Bedminster, N.J. There, he said the coronavirus was
  ``disappearing, it's going to disappear,'' a return to the kind of
  dismissive attitude toward the virus his aides have tried to convince
  him is hurting his re-election chances.
