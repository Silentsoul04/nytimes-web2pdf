The stormy once-in-a-lifetime [Florida recount
battle](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/us/bush-prevails-single-vote-justices-end-recount-blocking-gore-after-5-week.html)
that polarized the nation in 2000 and left the Supreme Court to decide
the presidency may soon look like a high school student council election
compared with what could be coming after this November’s election.

Imagine not just another Florida, but a dozen Floridas. Not just one set
of lawsuits but a vast array of them. And instead of two restrained
candidates staying out of sight and leaving the fight to surrogates, a
sitting president of the United States unleashing ALL CAPS Twitter
blasts from the Oval Office while seeking ways to use the power of his
office to intervene.

The possibility of an ugly November — and perhaps even December and
January — has emerged more starkly in recent days as President Trump
complains that the election will be rigged and Democrats accuse him of
trying to make that a self-fulfilling prophesy.

With about 85 days until Nov. 3, lawyers are already in court mounting
pre-emptive strikes and preparing for the larger, scorched-earth
engagements likely to come. Like the Trump campaign, Joseph R. Biden
Jr.’s campaign and its network of Democratic support groups are
stocking up on lawyers, and Democrats are gaming out worst-case
scenarios, including how to respond if Mr. Trump prematurely declares
victory or sends federal officers into the party’s strongholds as an
intimidation tactic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The emerging battle is the latest iteration of the long-running dispute
over voting rights, one shaped by the view that higher participation
will improve the Democratic Party’s chances. Republicans, under cover of
dubious or unfounded claims about widespread fraud, are trying to
prevent steps that would make it easier for more people to vote and
Democrats are pressing more aggressively than ever to secure ballot
access and expand the electorate.

But that clash has been vastly complicated this year by the challenge of
holding a national election in the middle of a deadly pandemic, with a
greater reliance on mail-in voting that could prolong the counting in a
way that turns Election Day into Election Week or Election Month. And
the atmosphere has been inflamed by a president who is already using
words like
[“coup,”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1290250416278532096)
[“fraud”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266172570983940101)
and
[“corrupt”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1285540318503407622?s=20)
to [delegitimize the vote even before it
happens](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-tweet-democracy.html).

The battle is playing out on two tracks: defining the rules about how
the voting will take place, and preparing for fights over how the votes
should be counted and contesting the outcome.

“The big electoral crisis arises from the prospect of hundreds of
thousands of ballots not being counted in decisive states until a week
after the election or more,” said Richard H. Pildes, a constitutional
scholar at New York University School of Law.

If the candidate who appears ahead on election night ends up losing
later on, he said, it will fuel suspicion, conspiracy theories and
polarization. “I have no doubt the situation will be explosive,” he
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some flash points have already emerged:

  - A long-troubled Postal Service, [now run by a Trump megadonor and
    seemingly
    overwhelmed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html)
    by the prospect of delivering tens of millions more votes cast by
    mail with an administration resistant to providing substantial new
    funding.

  - Concern among Democrats that Mr. Trump or Attorney General William
    P. Barr could use their bully pulpits to raise loud enough alarms
    about voter fraud to lead sympathetic state and local officials to
    slow or block adverse results.

  - Fights over [whether mailed ballots should be
    counted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-congress-carolyn-maloney-ballots.html)
    if received by Election Day or simply postmarked by Election Day,
    not to mention what to do if the post office does not postmark them
    at all.

  - Fights over the use of drop boxes to return ballots and the number
    of polling places for in-person voting amid the risk of disease.

  - Fights over whether witnesses should still be required for absentee
    votes in a socially distant moment and what to do if signatures do
    not match those on file.

Already, by Mr. Pildes’s count, party organizations, campaigns and
interest groups have filed 160 lawsuits across the country trying to
shape the rules of the election. About 40 have been filed in 17 states
by Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee, some in
response to Democratic lawsuits, as part of an expansive $20 million
litigation campaign against policies making it easier to vote on the
grounds that they could lead to fraud.

[“See you in
Court\!”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1290250416278532096)
Mr. Trump tweeted a few days ago to Nevada, which just passed universal
mail-in balloting legislation, under which the state sends a mail-in
ballot to every registered voter.

“They are just really efforts to throw tacks in front of the tires to
make it so states can’t run their elections this time,” said Michael
Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice and a former
aide to President Bill Clinton.

Democrats and their allies, led by Marc E. Elias, the general counsel of
the Democratic National Committee, are seeking to expand voting options,
particularly through mail-in voting. They have active litigation in
numerous battleground states, pursuing relief on deadlines, signature
and witness requirements, among others.

Republicans said their own court efforts were aimed at preventing
Democrats from changing the rules in the middle of the game.

“People are viewing it as an attack on vote-by-mail,” said Justin
Riemer, the chief counsel for the Republican National Committee. But in
fact, he said, “it’s by and large protecting the safeguards that are in
place.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump, who also made unfounded claims about fraud in the 2016
election even though he won, has signaled that he will not hesitate to
go back to court after Election Day if he does not like the result.
Unlike in 2000, when the Justice Department largely stayed on the
sidelines, Democrats worry that Mr. Barr will intervene with civil
suits, investigations or public statements, casting doubt on the result
if Mr. Trump appears to lose. And some Democrats say they are not sure
how Mr. Trump would respond, with the presidency on the line, to a court
ruling against him.

Some Democrats even express fear that Mr. Trump would send federal
agents into the streets as [he did in recent weeks in Portland,
Ore.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-portland-federal-agents.html)
Democrats have game-planned situations in which Mr. Trump deploys
immigration officers into Hispanic neighborhoods to intimidate citizens
shortly before the election and suppress turnout.

“It is very, very much a concern,” said Alex Padilla, the secretary of
state of California.

Mr. Trump’s advisers dismiss such talk as overheated partisan messaging.
Justin Clark, the president’s deputy campaign manager, said states like
California and Nevada trying to expand mail-in voting on the fly were
the ones setting the stage for a chaotic election.

“Rushing to implement universal vote-by-mail leads to delays in counts,
delays in results and uncertainty about who won an election,” he said.

[It took six weeks for the New York
authorities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/nyregion/maloney-torres-ny-congressional-races.html)
to determine the winners of two House Democratic congressional primaries
as they struggled with 10 times the normal number of absentee ballots, a
case study in the potential for a lengthy count in the fall even if not
an example of fraud as Mr. Trump has falsely claimed.

Mr. Clark is one of the party’s top warriors on election fraud fights.
In a recording from 2019, he told fellow Republicans: “Traditionally,
it’s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places. Let’s start
protecting our voters.”

Republicans, he said, should be more aggressive. “Let’s start playing
offense a little bit,” he said then. “That’s what you’re going to see in
2020. It’s going to be a much bigger program, a much more aggressive
program, a much better-funded program.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He later said he was referring to false accusations made against
Republicans. A federal judge in 2018 lifted a consent decree in place
since 1982 that barred the Republican National Committee from certain
so-called ballot security efforts.

Asked about those comments, Mr. Clark said: “Democrats have always
accused Republicans of voter suppression. The fact of the matter is all
Democrats have done this year is pushed crazy voting laws.”

The Trump team has also tried to halt another pillar of absentee voting
— the drop box. In 2018 in Colorado, one of five states that already
votes nearly entirely by mail, 75 percent of ballots were returned
through a drop box or at a polling place. In Pennsylvania, the Trump
campaign sued against expanding the use of drop boxes, an action that
has concerned election officials across the country.

Jena Griswold, the secretary of state of Colorado, said the president’s
attacks on the Postal Service and his refusal to devote enough resources
to fix its problems showed his disingenuous motives.

“You do all that and then you attack drop boxes, the alternative to
voting safely, it’s a pattern of voter suppression,” she said. “It’s a
pattern of voter suppression and I just think it’s really
reprehensible.”

Others are looking to head off disqualifying ballots over procedural
issues like postmarks and the date of receipt. “Voting shouldn’t be a
game of gotcha,” said Ann Jacobs, the chairwoman of the Wisconsin
Elections Commission.

The Help America Vote Act, [passed on large bipartisan votes
in 2002](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/17/us/2002-campaign-ballot-overhaul-congress-passes-bill-clean-up-election-system.html)
in response to the Florida recount, was meant to help states upgrade and
standardize voting procedures. But it gives the attorney general the
power to file civil suits to enforce its provisions and some critics
said Mr. Barr could use that to step in.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some Democrats said they were less worried about direct intervention by
Mr. Trump or Mr. Barr, but said they could use their positions to prod
sympathetic state and local officials to block votes while fostering a
narrative undercutting the credibility of a vote count going against the
president.

“The president has very little, if any, power with how elections are
conducted,” said Mr. Elias, the Democratic lawyer. “Trump’s power is
that he has no shame and that shamelessness has infected his entire
political party.”

He added, “You cannot imagine the party of George Bush or of John McCain
or Mitt Romney or even Reince Priebus saying out loud the things Donald
Trump screams out loud on Twitter, in the Oval Office and the Rose
Garden on daily and weekly basis.”

With the prospect of an extended and messy count lasting long past
Election Day, new attention is focusing on deadlines set by federal law.
Under the so-called safe harbor provision, states have until Dec. 8 to
resolve disputes over the results, meaning only five weeks — the same
deadline that [led to the Florida recount being called
off](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/us/bush-prevails-single-vote-justices-end-recount-blocking-gore-after-5-week.html)
in 2000 with George W. Bush in the lead.

Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, warning about [“a nightmare
scenario for our
nation,”](https://medium.com/@SenatorMarcoRubio/americans-should-expect-election-chaos-7fa8a9ac5aa1)
introduced legislation on Thursday [extending that
deadline](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7c86cdcc-19c2-4abd-9164-bacc5e66a499/27CC6B97AB3A0618568E38775DD4B657.mcg20709.pdf)
to Jan. 1, giving states three-and-a-half more weeks to count. The
Electoral College would then meet Jan. 2 instead of Dec. 14, still in
time to provide their results to Congress to ratify the outcome on Jan.
6 as scheduled.

In the end, it may depend on how close the count really is.

If “it’s clear one candidate or the other has a clear majority in the
Electoral College, then I don’t think there’s much Trump could do if
he’s the loser except to complain,” said Trevor Potter, the president
of the Campaign Legal Center and former chairman of the Federal Election
Commission. “But if it’s close, then I think there is the potential for
lots of mischief.”
