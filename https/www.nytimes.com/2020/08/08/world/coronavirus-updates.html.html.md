At 5 million cases, the U.S. has passed another coronavirus milestone.

While politicians wrangled over a pandemic relief package and schools
struggled over whether to open their doors to students, the United
States passed another milestone on Saturday: more than five million
known coronavirus infections.

No other country has reported as many cases. Brazil ranks second, with
about three million, and India is third with two million. (In cases per
capita, the United States ranks eighth, between Oman and Peru.)

The data, from [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
is based on reports of known cases from federal, state and local
officials. Public health experts have warned that the actual number of
people infected is far greater.

Cases are trending upward in seven states, as well as in Puerto Rico,
Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and decreasing in 17, according to The
Times database. In the past week, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida had
the most new cases relative to population.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The United States reported its millionth case on April 28, more than
three months after the first reported case. The country passed two
million cases on June 10, three million on July 7 and four million on
July 23.

The United States now tests roughly 720,000 people a day, according to
[data from the Covid Tracking
Project.](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily)

The number of new coronavirus cases daily peaked on July 16, with
75,697. It has been slowly tapering off since then, to a seven-day
average of around 54,000 per day.

The seven-day average daily death toll is hovering around 1,000. That is
down from a peak of more than 2,200 on a single day in mid-April, when
bigger cities like New York and Seattle were hit the hardest. (The most
deadly single day was April 15, with 2,752.)

At least 161,000 people have died since the pandemic began. But the
seven-day average daily death toll is now significantly higher than it
was in early July, when it was around 500. Cases have surged since then
— [particularly in the Sun Belt
states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html)
and in communities where officials moved quickly to
[reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/09/us/coronavirus-cases-reopening-trends.html).
Many of the places with the most cases per capita have been smaller
cities and rural communities in the South and the Midwest.

With Congress at an impasse, Trump signs actions for another round of
economic aid.

President Trump took executive action on Saturday to circumvent Congress
and try to extend an array of federal pandemic relief, resorting to a
legally dubious set of edicts whose impact was unclear, as negotiations
over [an economic recovery
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/world/coronavirus-updates.html)
appeared on the brink of collapse.

It was not clear what authority Mr. Trump had to act on his own on the
measures or what immediate effect, if any, they would have, given that
Congress controls federal spending. But his decision to sign the
measures — billed as a federal eviction ban, a payroll tax suspension,
and relief for student borrowers and the unemployed — reflected the
failure of two weeks of talks between White House officials and top
congressional Democrats to strike a deal on a broad relief plan as
crucial benefits have expired with no resolution in sight.

Mr. Trump’s move also illustrated the heightened concern of a president
staring down re-election in the middle of a historic recession and a
pandemic, and determined to show voters that he was doing something to
address the crises. But despite Mr. Trump’s assertions on Saturday that
his actions “will take care of this entire situation,” the orders also
leave a number of critical bipartisan funding proposals unaddressed,
including providing assistance to small businesses, billions of dollars
to schools ahead of the new school year, aid to states and cities and a
second round of $1,200 stimulus checks to Americans.

“Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital
assistance hostage,” Mr. Trump said, savaging the two top Democrats
during a news conference at his private golf club in New Jersey, his
second in two days. A few dozen club guests were in attendance, and the
president appeared to revel in their laughter at his jokes denouncing
his political rivals.

Five months after its first case of Covid-19, Brazil on Saturday passed
the bleak milestones of 100,000 deaths and three million cases,
[according to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/americas/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html).

President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied the severity of Brazil’s
coronavirus crisis even as the death count has risen more quickly than
the government anticipated.

Mr. Bolsonaro’s refusal to support social distancing measures pushed two
health ministers out, leaving the country’s response to the virus to be
led by a general with no experience in public health.

The ministry has yet to reach an agreement with city and state
officials, who have been scrambling to respond with varying levels of
success, on how to combat the pandemic.

In early March, officials at Brazil’s Ministry of Health predicted the
virus would kill at least 100,000 of the country’s citizens. But they
estimated that number would only be reached in September, said Julio
Croda, who then headed the ministry’s department overseeing immunization
and transmissible diseases.

“The presidency wouldn’t believe in these numbers,” he said. “It’s one
month ahead of schedule because the social distancing measures fell.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since June, Brazil has frequently reported more than 1,000 new deaths a
day, as the number of new infections and deaths plateaued at a high
level. Dr. Croda believes the country will continue on this trajectory
for some weeks, adding tens of thousands of deaths to its toll in the
coming months.

The numbers, he believes, will eventually fall — as they have begun to
do in severely hit states such as Amazonas — when a large number of
Brazilians acquire immunity to the virus.

But that “has nothing to do with the government,” Dr. Croda said. “It is
a consequence of tragedy.”

The usual parental worries about college-bound children — whether they
will be happy, or productive, or find a suitable major leading to a
stable career — are getting sidelined this fall by one overwhelming
concern: With coronavirus cases [spiking in many parts of the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
will students be safe at school?

[More than a quarter of U.S.
colleges](https://collegecrisis.shinyapps.io/dashboard/) plan to begin
fall instruction fully or mostly online, but many are still opening up
their dorms. And at many schools, upperclassmen are returning to
off-campus apartments, or fraternity or sorority houses. That leaves
parents with the choice of forcing their 20-year-olds to stay home
against their will, or allowing them to leave and join their friends,
knowing the infection data may not be in their favor.

“This is a situation where you have to pray for the best and be ready
for the worst,” said Kelly Hutchison, a retired firefighter and [single
father](https://books.apple.com/us/book/book-title/id1291492202?ls=1) in
Chicago whose daughter, Katelyn, is a student at Ithaca College.

Some parents are still debating whether their child should take the year
off entirely. For schools on the semester system, tuition bills for
thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars, are due this month. But
up until those due dates, colleges are trying to be flexible. In many
cases, “you can defer admission, or you can take an academic leave, and
they’ll allow you to come back,” said Lynn Pasquerella, the president of
the Association of American Colleges and Universities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Taking such a break, however, may not be realistic, said Jill
Schwitzgebel, a college counselor in Celebration, Fla. “What is your
child going to do with a gap year?” she said. “Getting a job is tough.
Flying overseas is not happening.”

Other updates from around the U.S.:

  - **Princeton**
    [announced](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/08/07/fall-2020-update-undergraduate-education-be-fully-remote)
    Friday that all undergraduate classes would be held online during
    the fall semester. In a statement, the university’s president said
    that the pandemic “prevents a genuinely meaningful on-campus
    experience for undergraduates.” On Monday, the university also said
    it would cut tuition by 10 percent for all undergraduates during the
    2020-21 school year.

  - **Johns Hopkins University** [made a similar
    announcement](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/08/06/university-moves-undergraduate-instruction-online/)
    on Thursday, moving to remote learning and reducing undergraduate
    tuition by 10 percent for the fall term.

  - Gov. Gavin Newsom of California released

Tens of thousands of [motorcyclists

the streets of Sturgis, S.D., on Saturday for an annual rally despite
[objections from
residents](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/us/sturgis-motorcyle-rally-coronavirus.html)
— and with little regard for the coronavirus.

The herds of people driving recreational vehicles, bikes and classic
cars overran every street in town, making no effort to keep six feet
apart. Few masks could be seen, and free bandannas being passed out were
mostly folded, or wrapped around people’s heads.

With temperatures in the low 80s and not much cloud cover, many people
crowded under shopping tents where “Screw Covid” shirts were sold,
seeking shade.

The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, a 10-day affair that began Friday, is
expected to attract roughly 250,000 enthusiasts this year — about half
the number who attended last year, but a figure that puts it on track to
be among the country’s largest public gatherings since the first
coronavirus cases emerged.

South Dakota is one of several states that did not impose a lockdown,
and state officials have not required residents to wear masks.

Health experts say the coronavirus is less likely to spread outdoors,
especially when people wear masks and socially distance. But large
gatherings like the motorcycle rally also increase the number of
visitors inside restaurants and stores.

A few businesses in Sturgis put up signs limiting the number of
customers who could enter, but most did not.

Over the past week, South Dakota has reported an [average of 87
coronavirus cases per

At least two new virus deaths and 106 new cases were reported on

Hundreds of children in America, most of them previously healthy, have
experienced an inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19, and most
became so ill that they needed intensive care, according to [a new
report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e2.htm?s_cid=mm6932e2_w#T1_down)
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The syndrome, which can be deadly, has rattled parents and education
officials as schools across the United States struggle with the prospect
of reopening in the fall and the coronavirus continues its spread.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The researchers said that from early March to late July, the C.D.C.
received reports of 570 young people — ranging from infants to age 20 —
who met the definition of the new condition, called [Multisystem
Inflammatory Syndrome in
Children](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/health/coronavirus-multisystem-fnflammatory-syndrome-children-teenagers.html)
or MIS-C. The reports came from health departments in 40 states, as well
as New York City and Washington, D.C.

The patients were disproportionately people of color, echoing a pattern
in adults who have been struck by the respiratory disease caused by the
virus. About 40 percent were Hispanic or Latino, 33 percent were Black,
and 13 percent were white, the report said. The median age was 8. About
25 percent of the patients had obesity before becoming sick.

MIS-C was first recognized in May as a condition linked to Covid-19 that
appears to occur in children and young people who often had not
developed any of the respiratory symptoms that are the primary way the
virus attacks adults.

The syndrome, which can include a fever, rash, pinkeye, stomach
distress, confusion, bluish lips, muscle weakness, racing heart rate and
cardiac shock, appears to emerge days or weeks after the initial viral
infection, and experts believe it may be the result of a revved-up
immune system response to defeating the virus’s first assault.

The C.D.C. reported that about two-thirds of the patients had no
previous underlying medical conditions, and most experienced
complications that involved four or more organ systems, especially the
heart. Ten died. Nearly two-thirds were admitted to intensive care units
for a median of five days.

The blockaded Gaza Strip might be among the few places in the world
where no cases of community transmission of the coronavirus have been
recorded — a phenomenon attributed to the coastal enclave’s isolation as
well as to swift measures taken by its militant Hamas rulers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the pandemic has not left Gaza untouched.

Citing a need to combat the virus, the authorities that control Gaza’s
borders have imposed new restrictions on movement outside the territory.
That has exacerbated an already challenging situation for Palestinians
who say they urgently need to travel to Israel and the West Bank.

In March, fearing an outbreak in Gaza, the Hamas authorities ordered all
travelers returning to the territory by way of Israel and Egypt to enter
quarantine facilities for three weeks. They could not leave quarantine
until they had passed two virus tests.

The system seems to have succeeded. All 78 known infections in the
territory were detected at quarantine facilities.

Still, experts did not rule out the possibility of the pandemic
penetrating into the area’s densely populated cities and towns.

“All it takes is one small mistake,” said Gerald Rockenschaub, the head
of the World Health Organization’s mission to the Palestinians. “There’s
no guarantee the virus won’t get inside.”

Mr. Rockenschaub warned that Gaza lacked the resources to deal with a
widespread outbreak, noting that medical institutions had only about 100
adult ventilators, most of which were already in use.

Before the coronavirus hobbled the U.S. economy, many low-wage workers
were already struggling to make ends meet.

After [mass
layoffs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/05/upshot/us-unemployment-maps-coronavirus.html)
and a deep recession followed in the early months of the pandemic,
millions of workers found themselves faced with evictions, late car
payments, and crushing medical bills. For many, the main solace through
the worst months of the crisis was a broad range of stimulus measures,
including $600 per week in extra unemployment benefits.

But with those measures expiring, and [no clear indication of whether
new
ones](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/trump-congress-stimulus.html)
will replace them, many unemployed workers now find themselves in limbo,
struggling to find work in an economy that remains significantly
weakened.

[Eviction
moratoriums](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/housing-economy-eviction-renters.html)
are expiring or have expired in much of the country, and [a report
released

warned that 30 million to 40 million tenants [risk losing their homes in
the coming
months](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/housing-economy-eviction-renters.html).
The Paycheck Protection Program, which helped thousands of small
businesses to retain workers, also ends this week.

[Research from the last
recession](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170537)
found that when unemployment benefits ran out, people cut their spending
on food, medicine and other necessities, suggesting they were able to do
little to prepare for the drop in income.

While wealthier families may be able to draw on savings to get by until
Congress strikes a deal to prolong the stimulus, lower-income households
face serious long-term consequences from even a temporary lapse in
income. An eviction can make it hard to rent in the future. Having a car
repossessed can make it hard to find another job. And for children,
periods of hunger, homelessness and stress can have long-term effects on
development and learning.

Even as the coronavirus continues to spread widely, and public health
officials have urged people to move activities outside as much as
possible, the summer heat still tends to demand a great deal of time
spent indoors.

For those who regularly share home or office spaces with others for
extended periods, this may raise questions about indoor air quality. A
growing number of scientists are convinced that significant coronavirus
transmission can occur through the air indoors, and that poor
ventilation magnifies the risk. But the options available for increasing
airflow or filtering out are not all created equal.

Experts have a few recommendations.

If the temperature outside is tolerable, consider opening a few windows
to let outdoor air in. This can be amplified by blowing air inside with
a box fan.

“The more outside air you have, the more you dilute the virus,” said
Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosol scientist at the University of Colorado
Boulder.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In hotter climates, some air-conditioners can be used safely if they
cool and circulate both outdoor and indoor air. But be wary of certain
models that only recirculate the air inside.

Those looking to be especially cautious may consider using air filters.
But as with air-conditioners, to derive any real benefit consumers
should look to those that meet specifications to filter out virus
particles that are far smaller than other airborne particles like dust
or pollen.

Above all, experts caution that airflow patterns are difficult to
predict. The best way to prevent spreading the virus inside may be to
avoid holding indoor gatherings altogether.

Even a pandemic could not bring Belgium’s fractious political parties

The country has been operating with an emergency minority coalition
throughout the coronavirus epidemic.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Making ambitious change to the political system or taking up an
aggressive economic stimulus package would most likely require a
full-fledged majority government, something that has eluded Belgium
since December 2018. Leaders of the two largest parties — the
conservative Flemish separatist party known as the N-VA and the
French-speaking Socialists — are seeking a majority coalition with
smaller parties.

But party leaders said Saturday that they were unable to meet the
deadline set by King Philippe, the Belgian head of state. The king
extended the deadline, once again, to Aug. 17.

The country is polarized along regional and linguistic lines, making
governing perpetually difficult. This is now the longest period without
a formal government in Belgian history.

“I hope to form a government as soon as possible,” said Paul Magnette,
the head of the French-speaking Socialists. “Our country needs it to
effectively combat the epidemic, which sadly is rising again.”

in New York that left tens of thousands dead, disproportionately
ravaging low-income communities and neighborhoods with high numbers of
Black and Latino people.

Illegal raves are growing in popularity in Europe, including in Berlin,
in London and near Paris, as coronavirus lockdowns are eased across the
continent but most nightclubs remain closed.

Outdoor events for hundreds — in some cases, thousands — organized via
social media and messaging apps, are in full swing each weekend, causing
headaches for police forces and lawmakers, and stirring public debate
and news media panic.

Worries that nightlife activity would fuel the spread of the virus have
in the meantime led Curaçao, the Caribbean island, to close its bars and
clubs for at least two weeks since Friday, according to the Dutch
newswire ANP. The nearby island Aruba was reported to have almost 300
confirmed cases over the last five days.
