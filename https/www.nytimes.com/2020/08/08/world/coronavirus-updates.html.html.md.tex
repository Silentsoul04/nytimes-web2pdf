Talks on a new U.S. pandemic relief package are stalled and its crucial
benefits are expiring. President Trump said he would use executive
orders to provide aid, but it is unclear whether he has the power to do
so.

Right Now

In Belgium, party leaders again failed to form a new government. The
country has been operating with an emergency minority coalition
throughout the coronavirus epidemic.

Universities make reopening plans, and parents see tough choices no
matter what.

The usual parental worries about college-bound children --- whether they
will be happy, or productive, or find a suitable major leading to a
stable career --- are getting sidelined this fall by one overwhelming
concern: With coronavirus cases
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{spiking
in many parts of the country}, will students be safe at school?

\href{https://collegecrisis.shinyapps.io/dashboard/}{More than a quarter
of U.S. colleges} plan to begin fall instruction fully or mostly online,
but many are still opening up their dorms. And at many schools,
upperclassmen are returning to off-campus apartments, or fraternity or
sorority houses. That leaves parents with the choice of forcing their
20-year-olds to stay home against their will, or allowing them to leave
and join their friends, knowing the infection data may not be in their
favor.

``This is a situation where you have to pray for the best and be ready
for the worst,'' said Kelly Hutchison, a retired firefighter and
\href{https://books.apple.com/us/book/book-title/id1291492202?ls=1}{single
father} in Chicago whose daughter, Katelyn, is a student at Ithaca
College.

Some parents are still debating whether their child should take the year
off entirely. For schools on the semester system, tuition bills for
thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars, are due this month. But
up until those due dates, colleges are trying to be flexible. In many
cases, ``you can defer admission, or you can take an academic leave, and
they'll allow you to come back,'' said Lynn Pasquerella, the president
of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.

Taking such a break, however, may not be realistic, said Jill
Schwitzgebel, a college counselor in Celebration, Fla. ``What is your
child going to do with a gap year?'' she said. ``Getting a job is tough.
Flying overseas is not happening.''

A C.D.C. report on children shows hundreds were sent to intensive care
for a syndrome connected to Covid-19.

Hundreds of children in America, most of them previously healthy, have
experienced an inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19, and most
became so ill that they needed intensive care, according to
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e2.htm?s_cid=mm6932e2_w\#T1_down}{a
new report} from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The syndrome, which can be deadly, has rattled parents and education
officials as schools across the United States struggle with the prospect
of reopening in the fall and the coronavirus continues its spread.

The researchers said that from early March to late July, the C.D.C.
received reports of 570 young people --- ranging from infants to age 20
--- who met the definition of the new condition, called
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/health/coronavirus-multisystem-fnflammatory-syndrome-children-teenagers.html}{Multisystem
Inflammatory Syndrome in Children} or MIS-C. The reports came from
health departments in 40 states, as well as New York City and
Washington, D.C.

The patients were disproportionately people of color, echoing a pattern
in adults who have been struck by the respiratory disease caused by the
virus. About 40 percent were Hispanic or Latino, 33 percent were Black,
and 13 percent were white, the report said. The median age was 8. About
25 percent of the patients had obesity before becoming sick.

MIS-C was first recognized in May as a condition linked to Covid-19 that
appears to occur in children and young people who often had not
developed any of the respiratory symptoms that are the primary way the
virus attacks adults.

The syndrome, which can include a fever, rash, pinkeye, stomach
distress, confusion, bluish lips, muscle weakness, racing heart rate and
cardiac shock, appears to emerge days or weeks after the initial viral
infection, and experts believe it may be the result of a revved-up
immune system response to defeating the virus's first assault.

The C.D.C. reported that about two-thirds of the patients had no
previous underlying medical conditions, and most experienced
complications that involved four or more organ systems, especially the
heart. Ten died. Nearly two-thirds were admitted to intensive care units
for a median of five days.

As U.S. relief talks falter again, Trump says he's prepared to act on
his own.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/07/business/07vid-trump/07vid-trump-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg}

Crisis negotiations between the White House and top Democrats teetered
on the brink of collapse on Friday, as both sides said they remained
deeply divided on an economic recovery package and President Trump
indicated that he was prepared to act on his own to provide relief,
although it was unclear whether he has the authority to do so.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/trump-news-conference-bedminster.html}{At
a news conference on Friday} evening at his golf resort in Bedminster,
N.J.,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007279339/trump-says-he-will-act-on-his-own-if-congress-doesnt-agree-on-relief.html}{Mr.
Trump said} that if an aid agreement with congressional Democrats could
not be reached, he would sign executive orders reinstating a national
moratorium on evictions, deferring student loan interest and payments
``until further notice,'' and ``enhancing unemployment benefits''
through the end of the year.

He also said he would defer payroll taxes, retroactive from July 1
through the end of the year.

The president **** did not specify how the deferral would work, and it
was unclear whether he had the authority to take such an action without
approval from Congress. The move, which would not help unemployed
workers, faces opposition from both Democrats and Republicans in
Congress.

The news conference came after a meeting between administration
officials and Democratic leaders that ended with no agreement and no
additional talks scheduled.

Democrats, who had earlier said they would be willing to lower their
spending demands to \$2 trillion from \$3.4 trillion, said the White
House needed to return with a higher overall price tag after Mr. Trump's
negotiators declined to accept that offer. Republicans have proposed a
\$1 trillion plan.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mark Meadows, the White House
chief of staff, called for Democrats to lower the amount of aid for
state and local governments and to provide more specifics on how they
proposed to revive lapsed unemployment benefits.

While the executive orders have not been finalized, Mr. Meadows said it
was likely that action would come over the weekend.

The blockaded Gaza Strip is nearly untouched, except for tough new
limits on movement.

cancer.Credit...Shbair Fatima for The New York Times

The blockaded Gaza Strip might be one of the only places in the world
where no cases of community transmission of the coronavirus have been
recorded --- a phenomenon attributed to the coastal enclave's isolation
as well as to swift measures taken by its militant Hamas rulers.

But the pandemic has not left Gaza untouched.

Citing a need to combat the virus, the authorities that control Gaza's
borders have imposed new restrictions on movement outside the territory.
That has exacerbated an already challenging situation for Palestinians
who say they urgently need to travel to Israel and the West Bank.

In March, fearing an outbreak in Gaza, the Hamas authorities ordered all
travelers returning to the territory by way of Israel and Egypt to enter
quarantine facilities for three weeks. They could not leave quarantine
until they had passed two virus tests.

The system seems to have succeeded. All 78 known infections in the
territory were detected at quarantine facilities.

Still, experts did not rule out the possibility of the pandemic
penetrating into the area's densely populated cities and towns.

``All it takes is one small mistake,'' said Gerald Rockenschaub, the
head of the World Health Organization's mission to the Palestinians.
``There's no guarantee the virus won't get inside.''

Mr. Rockenschaub warned that Gaza lacked the resources to deal with a
widespread outbreak, noting that medical institutions had only about 100
adult ventilators, most of which were already in use.

Low-wage and unemployed workers find themselves in limbo as stimulus
measures expire.

emergency relief, wondering, ``Is there going to be hope for
me?''Credit...Hannah Yoon for The New York Times

Before the coronavirus hobbled the U.S. economy, many low-wage workers
were already struggling to make ends meet.

After
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/05/upshot/us-unemployment-maps-coronavirus.html}{mass
layoffs} and a deep recession followed in the early months of the
pandemic, millions of workers found themselves faced with evictions,
late car payments, and crushing medical bills. For many, the main solace
through the worst months of the crisis was a broad range of stimulus
measures, including \$600 per week in extra unemployment benefits.

But with those measures expiring, and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/trump-congress-stimulus.html}{no
clear indication of whether new ones} will replace them, many unemployed
workers now find themselves in limbo, struggling to find work in an
economy that remains significantly weakened.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/housing-economy-eviction-renters.html}{Eviction
moratoriums} are expiring or have expired in much of the country, and
\href{https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/The_Eviction_Crisis_080720.pdf}{a
report released Friday} warned that 30 million to 40 million tenants
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/housing-economy-eviction-renters.html}{risk
losing their homes in the coming months}. The Paycheck Protection
Program, which helped thousands of small businesses to retain workers,
also ends this week.

\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170537}{Research
from the last recession} found that when unemployment benefits ran out,
people cut their spending on food, medicine and other necessities,
suggesting they were able to do little to prepare for the drop in
income.

While wealthier families may be able to draw on savings to get by until
Congress strikes a deal to prolong the stimulus, lower-income households
face serious long-term consequences from even a temporary lapse in
income. An eviction can make it hard to rent in the future. Having a car
repossessed can make it hard to find another job. And for children,
periods of hunger, homelessness and stress can have long-term effects on
development and learning.

While the U.S. economy has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/07/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus}{slowly
added back some jobs} that vanished at the beginning of the pandemic,
the unemployment rate still stands at over 10 percent. For those who may
not return to work for some time, the loss of protections has only added
to uncertainty about the future.

Cases are increasing in Belgium, where the parties missed another
deadline to form a government.

separatist party known as the N-VA, King Philippe and Paul Magnette, the
Socialist party leader in the French-speaking Walloon region, in
Brussels on Saturday.Credit...Olivier Hoslet/EPA, via Shutterstock

Even a pandemic could not bring Belgium's fractious political parties
together.

Party leaders blew through a Saturday afternoon deadline to form a new
government, more than a year and a half after the last one collapsed.
The country has been operating with an emergency minority coalition
throughout the coronavirus epidemic.

But the crisis has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/world/europe/coronavirus-nursing-homes-elderly.html}{exposed
the weaknesses in a bureaucratic political system} --- it has among the
highest Covid-19 death
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{rates
in the world}. Belgium has nine health ministers who answer to six
parliaments. Officials have acknowledged being slow to respond to the
outbreak as they haggled over who was responsible for what.

Making ambitious change to the political system or taking up an
aggressive economic stimulus package would most likely require a
full-fledged majority government, something that has eluded Belgium
since December 2018. Leaders of the two largest parties --- the
conservative Flemish separatist party known as the N-VA and the
French-speaking Socialists --- are seeking a majority coalition with
smaller parties.

But party leaders said Saturday that they were unable to meet the
deadline set by King Philippe, the Belgian head of state. The king
extended the deadline, once again, to Aug. 17.

The country is polarized along regional and linguistic lines, making
governing perpetually difficult. This is now the longest period without
a formal government in Belgian history.

``I hope to form a government as soon as possible,'' said Paul Magnette,
the head of the French-speaking Socialists. ``Our country needs it to
effectively combat the epidemic, which sadly is rising again.''

Are illicit parties endangering New York City?

and Queens, many people did not wear masks.Credit...Jimmy Escobar

New Yorkers, by and large, have adhered to rules mandating social
distancing and mask wearing. The diligence has helped keep the
coronavirus under control in the city even as outbreaks have raged
across the United States, primarily in the South and the West.

As the summer wears on, however, mounting reports of parties, concerts
and other social events, like a recent rave under the Kosciuszko Bridge,
are raising fears that New York's hard-earned stability may be tenuous.

Over the last few weeks, videos and photos posted on social media have
shown densely packed, mask-free crowds.

``It's illegal,'' Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at a recent news conference,
referring to the partying. ``It not only violates public health, but it
violates human decency.''

The images contrast sharply with the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/style/coronavirus-nyc-historic-season.html}{memories}
of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/nyregion/coronavirus-hospital-brooklyn.html}{a
brutal spring} in New York that left tens of thousands dead,
disproportionately ravaging low-income communities and neighborhoods
with high numbers of Black and Latino people.

Illegal raves are growing in popularity in Europe, including in Berlin,
in London and near Paris, as coronavirus lockdowns are eased across the
continent but most nightclubs remain closed.

Outdoor events for hundreds --- in some cases, thousands --- organized
via social media and messaging apps, are in full swing each weekend,
causing headaches for police forces and lawmakers, and stirring public
debate and news media panic.

Worries that nightlife activity would fuel the spread of the virus have
in the meantime led Curaçao, the Caribbean island, to close its bars and
clubs for at least two weeks since Friday, according to the Dutch
newswire ANP. The nearby island Aruba was reported to have almost 300
confirmed cases over the last five days.

As Myanmar's tourism collapses, horses become too expensive to keep
alive.

sites.~~Credit...Sai Aung Main/Agence France-Presse --- Getty Images

When a coronavirus lockdown
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/asia/coronavirus-myanmar-jobs-china.html?searchResultPosition=7}{sealed
Myanmar's borders} in March, the tourism industry was devastated, even
if the country was spared from disease.

Now, in the hill town of Pyin Oo Lwin, owners of horse carts that used
to clip-clop through streets laden with visitors are sending their
animals to slaughterhouses because they can no longer afford to keep
them alive.

``I feel sad about selling the horse, because he is like a family
member,'' said U Maung Win, a horse cart owner. ``He worked so hard to
save our lives, and I could not save his life.''

For months now, no tourists have come to ride through the town, with its
cool breezes and pretty gardens, Mr. Maung Win said, but the horses
still needed to be fed, at a cost of a couple dollars a day. The
slaughterhouses paid about \$500 per animal.

Mr. Maung Win, who supports a family of six, now works as a mason and is
paid less than \$10 a week.

``It's better than nothing,'' he said.

With his horse and a cart painted like a fairy-tale stagecoach, Mr.
Maung Win could pull in \$10 in a single day, delivering tourists to the
botanical gardens or cafes offering fresh strawberries. Couples posed
for wedding pictures in the carriages, holding the bell-adorned reins in
their intertwined hands.

Two-thirds of the 100 or so horse carts in town are now gone, Mr. Maung
Win said.

``I tried not to sell the horse to the slaughterhouse, but I had no
choice,'' he said. ``I still feel sad talking about this.''

Lucky friends, he said, had two horses. But he owned only one.

When the virus hit, nursing home residents in some countries were left
to die.

were available.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York Times

Of all the missteps by governments during the pandemic, few have had
such an immediate and devastating impact as the failure to protect
nursing homes. Tens of thousands of older people have died ---
casualties not only of the virus, but of more than a decade of ignored
warnings that nursing homes were vulnerable.

Public health officials around the world excluded nursing homes from
their pandemic preparedness plans and omitted residents from the
mathematical models used to guide their responses.

In recent months, as the United States has blundered its way into the
world's largest death toll, about 40 percent of those fatalities
\href{https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/\#stateleveldata}{have
been linked} to long-term care centers. Yet European countries still
lead the world in deaths per capita, in part because of what happened
inside their nursing homes.

Spanish prosecutors
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/europe/Spain-coronavirus-nursing-homes.html}{are
investigating cases} in which residents were abandoned to die. In
Sweden, overwhelmed emergency doctors have acknowledged
\href{https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/overlakare-logn-att-patienter-inte-prioriterats-bort/}{turning
away elderly patients}. In Britain, the
\href{https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-care-homes-nhs-hospital-discharges-deaths-a9544671.html}{government
ordered thousands of older hospital patients} --- including some with
Covid-19 --- back to nursing homes to make room for an expected crush of
virus cases. (Similar policies were in effect in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/nursing-homes-coronavirus.html}{some
U.S. states}.)

The response in Belgium has offered a gruesome twist: Paramedics and
hospitals sometimes flatly denied care to elderly people, even as
hospital beds sat unused.

``Paramedics had been instructed by their referral hospital not to take

More than 5,700 residents of nursing homes in the country have died,

to newly published data}. During the peak of the crisis, from March
through mid-May, residents accounted for two out of every three
coronavirus deaths.

How `superspreading' events may be a case of being in the wrong place at
the wrong time.

Most people won't spread the coronavirus widely. The few who do are
probably in the wrong place at the wrong time in their infection, new
models suggest.

In a paper
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169920v1.full.pdf}{posted
Friday to the website medRxiv} that has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/science/coronavirus-disinformation.html}{not
yet been through peer review}, scientists reported that superspreading
events --- which have been traced to

centers},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-south-dakota-meat-plant-refugees.html}{meat
processing facilities},

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-funeral-albany-georgia.html}{and
more} --- were most likely to happen when an infected person was
shedding large amounts of virus in a setting where there are plenty of
other people around to catch it.

The riskiest window for such transmission may be extremely brief --- a
one- to two-day period in the week or so after a person is infected,
when coronavirus levels are at their highest, according to Dr. Joshua
Schiffer, a physician and mathematical modeling expert who studies
infectious diseases at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle. He is one of the authors of the paper.

The virus can still ** spread outside this window, and people outside it
should not let up on measures like mask-wearing and physical distancing,
Dr. Schiffer said. But the longer an infection lasts, the less likely a
person is to be contagious --- a finding that might help experts advise
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/coronavirus-isolation-testing.html}{when
to end self-isolation}.

``It really is about opportunity,'' said Shweta Bansal, an infectious
disease ecologist at Georgetown University who was not involved in the
study. ``These processes really come together when you are not only
infected, but you also don't know you're infected because you don't feel
crummy.''
