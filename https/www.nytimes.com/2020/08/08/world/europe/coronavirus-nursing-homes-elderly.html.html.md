BRUSSELS — Shirley Doyen was exhausted. The Christalain nursing home,
which she ran with her brother in an affluent neighborhood in Brussels,
was buckling from Covid-19. Eight residents had died in three weeks.
Some staff members had only gowns and goggles from Halloween doctor
costumes for protection.

Nor was help coming. Ms. Doyen had begged hospitals to collect her
infected residents. They refused. Sometimes she was told to administer
morphine and let death come. Once she was told to pray.

Then, in the early morning of April 10, it all got worse.

First, a resident died at 1:20 a.m. Three hours later, another died. At
5:30 a.m., still another. The night nurse had long since given up
calling ambulances.

<div id="100000007240537" class="section css-1lpvp6o capsule-content" data-uri="nyt://capsule/b49668fb-2e01-5ae1-9496-f17bdbcc1c16">

Ms. Doyen arrived after dawn and discovered Addolorata Balducci, 89, in
distress from Covid-19. Ms. Balducci’s son, Franco Pacchioli, demanded
that paramedics be called and begged them to take his mother to the
hospital. Instead, they gave her morphine.

“Your mother will die,” the paramedics responded, Mr. Pacchioli
recalled. “That’s it.”

The paramedics left. Eight hours later, Ms. Balducci died.

Runaway coronavirus infections, medical gear shortages and government
inattention are woefully familiar stories in nursing homes around the
globe. But Belgium’s response offers a gruesome twist: Paramedics and
hospitals sometimes flatly denied care to elderly people, even as
hospital beds sat unused.

Weeks earlier, the virus had overwhelmed hospitals in Italy. Determined
to prevent that from happening in Belgium, the authorities shunned and
all but ignored nursing homes. But while Italian doctors said they were
forced to ration care to the elderly because of shortages of space and
equipment, Belgium’s hospital system never came under similar strain.

Even at the height of the outbreak in April, when Ms. Balducci was
turned away, intensive-care beds were no more than about 55 percent
full.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They wouldn’t accept old people,” Ms. Doyen said. “They had space, and
they didn’t want them.”

Belgium now has, by some measures, the world’s highest coronavirus death
rate, in part because of nursing homes. More than 5,700 nursing-home
residents have died, [according to newly published
data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136234v1.full.pdf).
During the peak of the crisis, from March through mid-May, residents
accounted for two out of every three coronavirus deaths.

Of all the missteps by governments during the coronavirus pandemic, few
have had such an immediate and devastating impact as the failure to
protect nursing homes. Tens of thousands of older people died —
casualties not only of the virus, but of more than a decade of ignored
warnings that nursing homes were vulnerable.

Public health officials around the world excluded nursing homes from
their pandemic preparedness plans and omitted residents from the
mathematical models used to guide their responses.

In recent months, the coronavirus outbreak in the United States has
dominated global attention, as the world’s richest nation blundered its
way into the world’s largest death toll. Some 40 percent of those
fatalities [have been
linked](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#stateleveldata)
to long-term-care facilities. But even now, European countries lead the
world in per capita deaths, in part because of what happened inside
their nursing homes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Spanish prosecutors [are investigating
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/europe/Spain-coronavirus-nursing-homes.html)
in which residents were abandoned to die. In Sweden, overwhelmed
emergency doctors have acknowledged [turning away elderly
patients](https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/overlakare-logn-att-patienter-inte-prioriterats-bort/).

In Britain, the [government ordered thousands of older hospital
patients](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-care-homes-nhs-hospital-discharges-deaths-a9544671.html)
— including some with Covid-19 — sent back to nursing homes to make room
for an expected crush of virus cases. (Similar policies were in effect
in [some American
states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/nursing-homes-coronavirus.html).)

But by fixating on saving their hospitals, European leaders sometimes
left nursing-home residents and staff to fend for themselves.

“We thought about it, and we said, ‘Care homes are important,’” Matt
Keeling, a British emergency adviser, testified recently. “We thought
they were being shielded, and we probably thought that was enough.”

It wasn’t. Only [about a third of European nursing
homes](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-long-term-care-facilities-surveillance-guidance.pdf)
had infectious-disease teams before the Covid-19 pandemic. Most lacked
in-house doctors and [many had no
arrangements](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/healthcare-associated-infections-point-prevalence-survey-long-term-care-facilities-2013.pdf)
with outside physicians to coordinate care.

Few countries embody this lethally ineffective pandemic response more
than Belgium, where government officials excluded nursing-home patients
from the testing policy until thousands were already dead. Nursing homes
were left waiting for proper masks and gowns. When masks did arrive from
the government, they came late and were sometimes defective.

“Tape the masks to the bridge of your nose,” regional health officials
advised in one email.

One nursing-home executive, bereft of options, ordered thousands of
ponchos after seeing animal-keepers wearing them in a countryside zoo.
Another home managed to get 5,000 masks from a staff member’s father in
Vietnam. The precious cargo arrived through the embassy’s diplomatic
pouch.

Belgian officials say denying care for the elderly was never their
policy. But in the absence of a national strategy, and with regional
officials bickering about who was in charge, officials now acknowledge
that some hospitals and emergency responders relied on vague advice and
guidelines to do just that.

The situation was so dire that the charity Médecins Sans Frontières
dispatched teams of experts more accustomed to working in war-hardened
countries. On March 25, when a team arrived at Val des Fleurs, a public
nursing home a few miles from European Union headquarters, they were
greeted by the stale smell of disinfectant and an eerie stillness,
pierced only by the song of a caged canary.

Seventeen people had died there in the past 10 days. There was no

“I never thought I would work with M.S.F. in my own country. That’s
crazy. We are a rich country,” said Marine Tondeur, a Belgian nurse who
has worked in South Sudan and Haiti.

Ms. Tondeur was horrified at her country’s response.

“I feel a bit ashamed, actually, that we forgot those homes.”

## ‘Firefighters in Pajamas’

In February, as the coronavirus was taking root in northern Italy,
Belgian officials expressed little alarm. Maggie De Block, Belgium’s
federal health minister, spent the month playing down the risk. She saw
[no need to
worry](https://plus.lesoir.be/282733/article/2020-02-25/maggie-de-block-sur-le-coronavirus-au-soir-il-faut-eviter-les-reflexes-de)
about hospital capacity or testing capabilities.

“It isn’t a very aggressive virus. You would have to sneeze in someone’s
face to pass it on,” [she
said](https://www.maggiedeblock.be/coronavirus-er-is-veel-paniekzaaierij-de-tijd-03-03-2020/)
on March 3, adding, “If the temperature rises, it will probably
disappear.”

Even after the World Health Organization [highlighted the importance of
creating
plans](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)
to protect nursing homes, a spokesman for the health authority in
Belgium’s Dutch-speaking region said there was no reason to worry.

“The risk of infection is very small for now,” he said.

Yet the warning signs were there. Belgium has one of the world’s largest
nursing-home populations per capita, and [years of
research](http://www.nsih.be/download/LTCF/Rapport/HALT-3_Nat%20Rapport_FR_V3.pdf)
has shown that respiratory illnesses like Covid-19 are among the most
common diseases in such facilities. Data from China demonstrated that
the elderly were most at risk from Covid-19.

Government reports as far back as 2006 had called for infectious-disease
training for nursing-home doctors and public help to stockpile
protective equipment. A separate report in 2009 recommended adding
nursing homes to the national pandemic plan. Both proposals went
nowhere.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So, at the beginning of March, nursing homes were effectively on their
own. Belgium’s internal risk-assessment documents did not even mention
nursing homes among the top concerns.

“We have received no specific recommendations from the ministers,” the
nursing-home association Femarbel wrote to its members.

Nursing homes around the world operate at the seams of local, regional
and national oversight, but Belgium magnifies that problem. Divided by
language and [perpetually difficult to
govern](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/world/europe/right-wing-migration-belgium-collapse.html),
Belgium has so many layers of bureaucracy that it is sometimes referred
to as an administrative lasagna.

The country has not one but nine health ministers, who answer to six
parliaments. The federal government takes a coordinating role in a
pandemic, but nursing homes are the purview of regional authorities.

So even when officials realized the threat posed by Covid-19, they could
not act decisively.

“We needed several weeks to figure out who was responsible,” Pedro
Facon, a top federal health official, testified this month.

By the middle of March, with the coronavirus spreading rapidly, regional
governments offered nursing homes advice — yet it was unhelpful on key
points. Government documents stressed the importance of masks, while
simultaneously declaring them all but unavailable.

“There are virtually no masks available on the market,” one document
said. Caregivers were advised to reuse masks, withhold them from
administrative staff members, and scrounge for gear from nearby
hospitals.

And scrounge they did. At the Christalain home, Steve Doyen — the
co-owner and Ms. Doyen’s brother — said he found a handful of gowns and
goggles through a friend who liked dressing up as a doctor for
Halloween.

Worsening the problem, Belgium was unable to test even a fraction of
those infected. So the health authorities decided to test severely ill,
hospitalized patients. Everyone else was told to recover at home.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That meant leaving contagious people inside crowded, understaffed,
underequipped nursing homes.

“We got the impression quite early on that we would take the back seat,”
said Lesley Moreels, the director of a public nursing home in Brussels.
“We felt that we were going to be firefighters in pajamas.”

## Test, Return, Infect

Belgium went into lockdown on March 18. Dozens of nursing-home residents
had already died. Three days later, Jacqueline Van Peteghem, a
91-year-old resident at the Christalain home, was sent to UZ Brussel, a
nearby hospital, where she was tested for Covid-19. Within days, her
test came back positive.

Shirley and Steve Doyen assumed Ms. Van Peteghem would remain
hospitalized for treatment and to prevent the disease from spreading to
scores of other residents. But her symptoms had stabilized, and Mr.
Doyen said that a hospital doctor declared her healthy enough to return
home.

So, on March 27, paramedics in hazmat suits delivered Ms. Van Peteghem,
on a stretcher, to the door of Christalain.

Mr. Doyen greeted them wearing a surgical mask.

“Is this mask all you have?” the paramedics asked, Mr. Doyen recalled.

“Yes,” he said.

“Good luck,” they responded.

For the next hour, Christalain staff members watched as the paramedics
decontaminated themselves and their ambulance. Asked later about the
hospital’s policies, the chief executive, Prof. Marc Noppen, said
infectious patients were not normally returned to nursing homes but that
it may have happened in some cases.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No one can be certain if Ms. Van Peteghem’s return was the reason, but
Covid-19 infections in the home increased. Residents began dying. Ms.
Van Peteghem, who initially survived the virus, died last month.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child

        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

The committee recommended testing nursing-home residents and
establishing locations to house Covid-19 patients who would otherwise be
returned to homes.

But national and regional authorities could not agree on those
recommendations, and the country remained a hodgepodge of policies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For another two weeks, even as the government expanded its testing
capability, health advisers resisted adding nursing homes to the
national testing priority list. They worried that even the newfound
capacity would be unable to meet the demand under the broadened
criteria, according to documents and government officials.

“The federal government had tests. Hospitals had tests,” said Dr.
Emmanuel André, a virologist who was tapped as a top government adviser
and who advocated for broader federal testing. “But nursing homes? There
were no tests allowed.”

As a stopgap measure, Philippe De Backer, a minister who had been tapped
to expand testing, pushed out an initial batch of nursing-home tests in
early April. But he and others wanted residents formally added to the
testing priority list. Support for that change finally coalesced on
April 8. Mr. De Backer dialed into a conference call of the government’s
risk-management group — one of many committees that set policy in
Belgium.

“You can stop debating,” he said. “We’re testing in care homes.”

When the first results were announced, one in five residents tested
positive. By then, more than 2,000 residents had already died.

As the testing debate unfolded in late March and early April, hospitals
quietly stopped taking infected patients from nursing homes.

The policy — officially it was just advice — took shape in a series of
memos from Belgian geriatric specialists.

“Unnecessary transfers are a risk for ambulance workers and emergency
rooms,” read an early memo, signed by the Belgian Society for
Gerontology and Geriatrics and two major hospitals.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Extremely frail patients and the terminally ill should receive
palliative care and not be hospitalized, the memo said. The document
offered a complex flowchart for deciding when to hospitalize
nursing-home residents.

The gerontology society says that its advice — drafted in case of an
overwhelmed hospital system — was misunderstood. The society is not a
government agency, doctors there note, and it never intended to deny
hospital care for the elderly.

But that is what happened.

## Do Not Admit

On the morning of April 9, Dr. André, the government adviser, was
preparing for the daily news briefing when one question, submitted in
advance by a journalist, caught him by surprise: Would nursing-home
residents soon be allowed to go to the hospital?

“Why is this question coming?” Dr. André remembers thinking. “Yes, of
course they can.”

But time and again, nursing-home residents with Covid-19 symptoms were
denied hospitalization, even when referred by doctors who had assessed
that they might recover.

“The decision not to accept residents in hospitals really shocked me,”
said Michel Hanset, a doctor in Brussels who tried in vain to admit
several nursing-home patients.

No data exists on how often this happened, but Médecins Sans Frontières
says about 30 percent of the homes it worked in during its deployment
reported this problem.

Government figures are also telling. During the first weeks of the
crisis, nearly two thirds of nursing-home residents’ deaths occurred in
hospitals. But as the crisis worsened, and the geriatric memos began
circulating, that number plummeted.

At the peak of the outbreak, a mere 14 percent of gravely ill residents
made it to hospitals. The rest died in their nursing homes, according to
government data [compiled by Belgian
scientists](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136234v1)
and released to The New York Times.

It is impossible to know how many deaths were preventable. But hospitals
always had space. Even at the peak of the pandemic, 1,100 of the
nation’s 2,400 intensive care beds were free, according to Niel Hens,
a government adviser and University of Antwerp professor.

“Paramedics had been instructed by their referral hospital not to take
patients over a certain age, often 75 but sometimes as low as 65,”
Médecins Sans Frontières said in a July
[report](https://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/2020-07/Left%20behind%20-%20MSF%20care%20homes%20in%20Belgium%20report.pdf).

Some senior regional and national officials acknowledge this problem.

“I heard from staff in care homes that emergency doctors were arriving,
taking residents and then they were sending them back to care homes,
saying they could not keep them in the hospital,” Christie Morreale, the
top health official in Wallonia, Belgium’s French-speaking region, said
in an interview.

Ms. De Block, the national health minister, declined to be interviewed
and did not respond to written questions. In interviews, senior hospital
doctors defended their policies. They said that nursing-home staff
sought hospital care for terminally ill patients who needed to be
comforted into death, not dragged to the hospital.

If nursing-home residents were denied admission, they say, it was
because a doctor determined that they were unlikely to survive.

“If you think medical treatment is of benefit for that patient, he or
she will be hospitalized,” said Professor Noppen, the UZ Brussel
executive. “It’s as simple as that.”

Nursing-home administrators are adamant that was not the case.

“At a certain point, there was an implicit age limit,” said Marijke
Verboven of Orpea group, which owns 60 homes around Belgium.

Mr. Moreels, whose nursing home, Val des Roses, also had an intervention
from a Médecins Sans Frontières team, agreed. “The ambulance wouldn’t
take them,” he said. “There was no detailed consultation. They just said
‘Why did you even call us?’”

The Brussels ambulance service denied any policy of refusing to take
nursing-home residents to the hospital. Yet even some doctors are
skeptical.

“We learned that people from care homes believed it was not even worth
calling an ambulance,” said Dr. Charlotte Martin, the chief
epidemiologist at Saint-Pierre Hospital in central Brussels. “They
should have been the first ones to get in the pipeline. And instead they
were just forgotten.”

At the Christalain home, activities resumed this summer and life inched
toward something resembling normal. But a shadow remains: 14 residents
have been confirmed to have died of Covid-19. Another, devastated and
confused from the quarantine, killed herself in April.

Mr. Pacchioli, whose mother died after being refused hospitalization, is
haunted by a question. “Maybe it wasn’t too late,” he said. “If she had
gone to the hospital, maybe she would have survived.”

The Médecins Sans Frontières teams concluded their nursing-home missions
in Belgium in mid-June. Some members returned to developing countries.
Others now work in another rich nation in crisis: the United States.

Today, Ms. De Block, Belgium’s national health minister, speaks about
the nursing homes as if they were [an unfortunate
footnote](https://www.politico.eu/article/in-defense-of-belgium-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-response/)
in a story of a successful government response. She notes with pride
that Belgium never ran out of hospital beds.

“We took measures at the right moment,” she said in an
[interview](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20200528_04974067), adding,
“We can be proud.”
