Fifteen other states have rescheduled their contests because of the

**The Latest:** Delaware has postponed its presidential primary election
for a second time, moving it to July 7.

As the coronavirus pandemic [upends the presidential
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/politics/coronavirus-2020-campaign.html),
states across the country have postponed primary elections and expanded
vote-by-mail options, citing the difficulty of holding elections during
the outbreak.

One state, [New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/nyregion/ny-house-primaries.html),
attempted to cancel its already-postponed presidential primary after the
Democratic presidential race was settled, but a federal judge [ordered
that the election go
forward](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/politics/ny-presidential-primary.html)
in June.

Fifteen other states and two territories — Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New
Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Wyoming, and
Guam and Puerto Rico — have either pushed back their presidential
primaries or switched to voting by mail with extended deadlines.

Some states have even postponed their primaries multiple times.

Several states have now conducted contests during stay-at-home orders,
with many voters casting ballots by mail but some participating in
person. Wisconsin [forged ahead with its
elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-election-coronavirus.html)
on April 7 after state Republicans blocked efforts to postpone voting
there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The remaining presidential primaries have been rendered largely
irrelevant since Bernie Sanders [dropped out of the Democratic
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html)
on April 8, establishing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the presumptive nominee.
But Mr. Sanders still wants to collect delegates to the national
convention, which was
[rescheduled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html)
from mid-July to mid-August. Some states also have local elections
coming up.

Here’s a running update of major changes in an election transformed,
including rescheduled primaries and caucuses and a few other key races.

## March 17: Arizona, Florida, Illinois (voted)

The three states held their primaries as scheduled (and [Joseph R. Biden
Jr. won all of
them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/biden-florida-illinois-primary.html)).

Voting in major cities in Illinois was [rife with
confusion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/primary-voter-turnout-2020.html)
and turnout in many areas was significantly lower than expected, leading
to complaints from poll workers and clashes between Chicago officials
and the statehouse.

But Florida and Arizona [exceeded turnout
levels](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/march-17-democratic-primary.html#link-2e84c23f)
seen in the 2016 Democratic primary, despite the coronavirus outbreak.
Both states had invested heavily in early voting systems, and they
encouraged early voting and voting by mail as the outbreak worsened, in
order to help reduce crowds at polling places on Primary Day.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## April 7: Wisconsin (voted)

Long lines, health jitters, flaring tempers and a dose of chaos and
confusion marked Wisconsin’s presidential primary and local elections on
April 7, as [voters were forced to
choose](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-election-coronavirus.html)
between staying safe during a pandemic and exercising their civic duty.

Wisconsin Democrats wanted to extend absentee voting and even postpone
the election altogether, but [Republicans successfully blocked both in
court](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-pandemic-primary-republicans.html).
Democrats feared that their voters would be most affected, yet they got
the result they wanted: A liberal challenger [scored a shocking
upset](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/wisconsin-primary-results.html)
in a State Supreme Court race, unseating a Trump-backed incumbent.

(The election was also the last competitive contest of the Democratic
presidential primary, with Mr. Biden easily beating Mr. Sanders, who had
dropped out of the race before the results were announced.)

Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, had issued an executive order
postponing in-person voting and extending to June the deadline for
absentee ballots. But Republican leaders succeeded in getting [the
state’s top court to stay the
decree](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/wisconsin-primary-voting-coronavirus.html).

In a separate decision, the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative-leaning
majority [ruled against extending the deadline for absentee
voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/supreme-court-voting-wisconsin-virus.html)
by six days, saying such a change “fundamentally alters the nature of
the election.” The court’s liberals dissented, with Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg writing that “the court’s order, I fear, will result in massive
disenfranchisement.” [Final tallies
showed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/wisconsin-election-voting-rights.html)
that thousands of Wisconsinites lost their chance to vote.

## April 10: Alaska (voted by mail)

The Alaska Democratic Party canceled in-person voting in its
presidential primary, originally scheduled for April 4, and mounted an
effort to expand voting by mail. It also extended the deadline for the
party to receive ballots by more than two weeks, to April 10 from March
24.

While Gov. Mike DeWine had initially proposed a June 2 primary as a
substitute, the Ohio legislature moved the official date to April 28.
Ballots postmarked by April 27 were counted. Only those voters who are
disabled or who do not have a permanent address were encouraged to vote
in person by appearing at their local elections boards.

## May 22: Hawaii (now voting by mail)

Hawaii Democrats announced they were canceling in-person voting for the
presidential primary in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The state
party will be mailing out a “third round” of ballots and is encouraging
voters to register before April 4, with the deadline for returning
ballots May
22.

## June 2: D.C., Indiana (new date), Maryland (new date), Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania (new date), Rhode Island (new date), South Dakota

### Indiana primary (postponed from May 5)

Gov. Eric J. Holcomb of Indiana signed an executive order suspending the
state’s primary elections until June 2. The presidential primary was
originally scheduled for May 5.

The governor announced the postponement of the primary with members of
the Indiana Democratic and Republican parties.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The right of citizens to elect their leaders in a free and open
election is one of the cornerstones of America,” Mr. Holcomb said. “In
order to balance that right with the safety of county employees, poll
workers and voters, delaying Indiana’s primary election is the right
move as we continue to do all we can to protect Hoosiers’ health.”

Officials also announced that the state would expand the option to vote
by mail to all voters for the upcoming primary election, and that any
mail-in ballots previously printed with a May 5 date on them would still
be valid.

### Maryland primary (postponed from April 28)

Gov. Larry Hogan announced that the April 28 primary would instead be
held on June 2. Limited polling places will be open to accommodate
disabled voters and those without permanent addresses. Gov. Hogan urged
all others to vote by mail.

“Like other states have done, all the primary elections will be
postponed until June, which gives everyone time to prepare,” Mr. Hogan
said. “Free and fair elections are the very foundation of American
democracy, and while there are many valid reasons for unease and
uncertainty right now, ensuring that the voices of Maryland citizens are
heard shouldn’t be one of them.”

Mr. Hogan said that a special election in Maryland’s Seventh
Congressional District to replace the late Representative Elijah E.
Cummings would not be rescheduled from April 28. That election also will
be run mostly by mail.

### Pennsylvania primary (postponed from April 28)

Gov. Tom Wolf signed a bill postponing the state’s presidential primary
election from April 28 to June 2.

State lawmakers had unanimously approved the delay, citing the pleas of
county elections officials, who said the uncertainty surrounding the
outbreak made it impossible to gear up for an election by the end of
April.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The delay also affects a number of other elections in Pennsylvania,
including congressional primaries.

The Pennsylvania secretary of state has [reminded voters of the state’s
mail-in ballot
option](https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/State-Details.aspx?newsid=374),
which permits any voter to request a ballot.

### Rhode Island primary (postponed from April 28)

Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order to move the state’s
presidential primary election from April to June.

“Last week, the Board of Elections requested that the presidential
primary election be postponed from April 28 to June 2 and that the
election take place primarily by mail ballot,” [Ms. Raimondo said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/GovRaimondo/status/1242146911945216009). “I
am following the advice of the Board of Elections, and will sign an
executive order to do this.”

Nellie M. Gorbea, the Rhode Island secretary of state, said the state
would “send all registered voters a mail ballot application with a
postage-paid return envelope.”

## June 6: Virgin Islands (caucuses)

## June 9: Georgia (new date), West Virginia (new date)

### Georgia (postponed from March 24)

Georgia’s secretary of state has postponed the presidential primary
election for a second time in an effort to protect the public from
possible coronavirus exposure.

The secretary, Brad Raffensperger, [had first moved the primary from
March 24 to
May 19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/georgia-primary-virus-2020.html).
After Gov. Brian Kemp extended the state’s public health state of
emergency, Mr. Raffensperger delayed the primary again, to June 9. He
said it was the latest it could be rescheduled.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Raffensperger said in-person voting would proceed on June 9, but he
has also [mailed absentee ballot request
forms](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-mail-absentee-ballot-request-forms-all-active-voters/s1ZcJ57g8qqIwyG6LNWfIM/)
to 6.9 million active voters. “I certainly realize that every difficulty
will not be completely solved by the time in-person voting begins for
the June 9 election, but elections must happen even in less than ideal
circumstances,” he said.

### West Virginia (postponed from May 12)

Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, announced at a news briefing that West
Virginia would postpone its election for 27 days, from May 12 to June 9.

“We have voted in wartime and in peace and in absolute tough
situations,” Mr. Justice said, adding that older voters, especially,
“value the treasure of being able to vote. We often take it for
granted.”

Mr. Justice said he was hopeful that the June 9 election would see a
large turnout at polling places, but added that he was extending the
deadline to obtain an absentee ballot for those who are unable to make
it to the
polls.

## June 23: Kentucky (new date), New York (new date), Virginia congressional primaries (new date)

### Kentucky (postponed from May 19)

Kentucky’s secretary of state, Michael G. Adams, announced the state
would delay its primary election to June 23 [in a video on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/KYSecState/status/1239657695520739328).

“Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican
secretary of state and Democratic governor agreed, and so do county
clerks from both parties,” Mr. Adams said. “My hope is that this delay
will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will
allow me, the State Board of Elections and our county clerks time to
assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary
election.”

### New York (postponed from April 28, then canceled, then reinstated by a federal judge)

A federal judge on May 5 ordered elections officials in New York State
to hold its Democratic primary election on June 23 and reinstate all
qualifying candidates on the ballot. The ruling came after the
presidential primary had been
[canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/us/politics/democratic-primary-canceled-coronavirus.html)
over concerns about the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The order, filed by Judge Analisa Torres of United States District
Court, came in response to a lawsuit filed by the former Democratic
presidential candidate Andrew Yang. He sought to undo the New York State
Board of Elections’ decision to cancel the contest. (The primary was
originally scheduled for April 28, but had been postponed to June 23.)

An appeals court upheld the ruling, and the state does not plan to
appeal further, so the election will be held.

Mr. Yang said in [a statement on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1257826412851011584) that
he was “glad that a federal judge agreed that depriving millions of New
Yorkers of the right to vote was wrong.”

The move to cancel the presidential primary also drew a backlash from
the campaign of Mr. Sanders, who is seeking to amass delegates to the
Democratic National Convention to influence the party’s platform.

### **Virginia congressional primaries (postponed from June 9)**

Virginia’s elections scheduled for June 9 have been postponed until June
23, Gov. Ralph Northam announced. The state’s presidential primary was
held March 3, before the risk of coronavirus became widely realized in
the United States. The remaining elections include House of
Representatives primaries and a Republican primary to pick the candidate
who will compete against Senator Mark Warner in the fall.

## July 7: Delaware (new date), New Jersey (new date)

### Delaware primary (postponed from April 28)

[Using a state of emergency
declaration](https://news.delaware.gov/2020/05/07/governor-carney-reschedules-presidential-primary-for-july-7/),
Gov. John Carney has postponed the Delaware presidential primary
election for a second time, to July 7, after first moving it to June 2.

The state will mail absentee ballot applications to all registered
Democrats and Republicans. Normally, Delaware voters must have a valid
excuse to request an absentee ballot, but the governor’s order permits
all voters to select the “sick” option on their applications, even if
they are not exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Delawareans have a basic, fundamental right to vote, and these changes
will allow all Delaware voters to safely exercise that right,” Mr.
Carney said in a statement.

### New Jersey (postponed from June 2)

New Jersey has postponed its presidential primary from June 2 to July 7,
extending the Democrats’ primary calendar deeper into the summer amid
the coronavirus outbreak.

The decision by Gov. Philip D. Murphy to delay the primary is a signal
from a major Democratic state that in-person voting may not be safe by
June. The rescheduled election would be the first time in the modern
history of the primary system that a state contest is held in July.

After the D.N.C. announced that it would postpone the party’s convention
from July to August, officials in New Jersey saw the move as a way to
give states some breathing room to put off their primaries further.

Mr. Murphy is announced an executive order postponing the primary and
extending deadlines for voting by mail to line up with the new date. He
signed an expansive vote-by-mail law in 2018, and [updated it in
January](https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/01/murphy-approves-fix-to-law-encouraging-voting-by-mail-after-it-was-killed-by-powerful-board.html),
to automatically send mail ballots to any voter who had requested one
during the previous election. The state has allowed voters to request
mail ballots for any reason for years.

## July 11: Louisiana (postponed from April 4)

Louisiana has postponed its April 4 primary twice: first to June 20, and
then even further, to July 11, buying more time in hopes the coronavirus
pandemic will dissipate. Officials said they were working on a plan that
would broaden the use of early voting and mail ballots.

When Louisiana rescheduled its primary for the first time, in mid-March,
[it was the first
state](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/primary-voting-coronavirus.html)
to adjust its election calendar in response to the disease’s spread.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## July 12: Puerto Rico (postponed from March 29)

The Democratic presidential primary will be held July 12, according to
Charles Rodríguez, the chairman of the Puerto Rico Democratic Party.

Puerto Rico officials had first postponed the presidential primary
election from March 29 to April 26, and had then delayed it indefinitely
as they monitored the virus’s
spread.

## July 14: Alabama Republican primary runoff for U.S. Senate seat (postponed from March 31)

Gov. Kay Ivey postponed the Republican runoff battle for a U.S. Senate
seat, which pits former Attorney General Jeff Sessions against Tommy
Tuberville, a former college football coach and ESPN analyst. The new
date for the runoff is July 14.

The winner will face Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, in a race that is
closely watched because it could be a chance for Republicans to pick up
a Senate seat in a red state.

President Trump has endorsed Mr. Tuberville against his onetime attorney
general, Mr. Sessions, a longtime politician in
[Alabama](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/supreme-court-alabama-voting-restrictions.html)
who served in the U.S. Senate from 1997 to 2017.

## Aug. 11: Connecticut primary (postponed from April 28)

Gov. Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut was postponing its
presidential primary for a second time, this time to Aug. 11 — the
Tuesday before the Democrats’ rescheduled national convention. The state
already has primaries scheduled that day for other federal, state and
local races.

By the time of Mr. Lamont’s decision, New Jersey had already extended
the Democrats’ calendar deeper into the summer than ever before, pushing
its primary to July. Connecticut would be the first state to hold its
nominating contest in August in the history of the modern primary
system.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“To protect the health and safety of voters, poll workers, and the most
vulnerable populations, it just makes most sense to extend the date out
to August,” Mr. Lamont said in a statement. He had previously pushed the
primary to early June from its original date, April 28.

## T.B.D.: Guam (postponed from May 2)

A new date has not been set for Guam’s Democratic
caucus.

## Week of Aug. 17: Democratic National Convention (postponed from July 13-16)

[The Democratic National Committee postponed its national
convention](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html)
because of the coronavirus, moving it from mid-July to mid-August. The
convention will still be held in Milwaukee, as planned, officials said.

An August convention is likely to be smaller than the planned July
event. One senior Democratic official said the event would probably be a
“bare minimum” convention, with scores of people who had planned to come
staying away either because of health concerns or because they had other
plans for mid-August.

## Aug. 24-27: Republican National Convention

Republicans still plan to gather in Charlotte, N.C., to renominate
President Trump.
