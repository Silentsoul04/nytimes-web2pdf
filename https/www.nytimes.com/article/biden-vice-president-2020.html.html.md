[Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
says he will choose his vice-presidential nominee the week of Aug. 3,
and aides say the public announcement will come the week of Aug. 10 —
ahead of the Democratic National Convention that begins the following
week.

Mr. Biden’s search committee has completed [thorough vetting reports on
several
candidates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html),
and his campaign has conducted focus groups and polling to study the
political strengths of the finalists. And Mr. Biden intends to conduct
in-person interviews with the most serious contenders, though the exact
circumstances are still unclear because of concerns about the
coronavirus.

Some of the best-known candidates, like Senators Elizabeth Warren and
Kamala Harris, remain strong contenders. But there have been intensive
lobbying efforts on behalf of several others who have risen in the
vetting process as potential consensus candidates who could have broad
appeal to Democrats and general-election swing voters.

Among those candidates are Susan Rice, the former national security
adviser; Representative Karen Bass of California, who is getting a big
boost from her colleagues in the House; and Senator Tammy Duckworth of
Illinois, an Iraq war combat veteran.

But it is tricky to game out the prospects of each candidate when the
decision is ultimately expected to be made by just one person, guided by
a distinctive sense of the vice presidency and a hunger for personal
chemistry with his running mate — Mr. Biden.

Top
contenders

## Kamala Harris

<div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper">

<div class="css-z3e15g" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper-hidden">

</div>

<div class="css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15" data-testid="photoviewer-children">

<div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height:386.6666666666667px">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** Senator from California since 2017; former presidential
candidate; served as district attorney in San Francisco and state
attorney general.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Harris, 55, has
long been seen as among the likeliest candidates to be chosen.

**Signature issues:** Proposed [cutting middle-class
taxes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/cory-booker-kamala-harris-2020.html);
recently advocated policing reform; pushed a Senate bill to make
lynching a federal crime; played a high-profile role in the confirmation
hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

**Relationship with Biden:** Harris had a friendly relationship with
Biden before they competed in the 2020 primaries, and Harris knew his
late son, Beau, when they served as attorneys general. But Harris also
attacked Biden more harshly than any other Democrat in the 2020 race,
[rebuking him in the first televised
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-busing.html)
for having worked with segregationist senators [to oppose school busing
policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
in the 1970s.

**Pros and cons:** Harris is among the best-known Black women in
American politics, with appeal to both moderates and liberals. But she
[ran an unsteady presidential
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html)
last year and struggled with questions about her law-enforcement record.
The way she and her advisers handled the 2020 primary left some in the
Biden campaign with [significant
reservations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html).

**On being considered for vice president:** “I know that conversation is
taking place in the press and among the pundits, and I’m honored to even
be considered, if that’s the
case.”

## Elizabeth Warren

<div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper">

<div class="css-z3e15g" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper-hidden">

</div>

<div class="css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15" data-testid="photoviewer-children">

<div class="css-zjzyr8">

<div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height:386.6666666666667px">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** Senator from Massachusetts since 2013; former presidential
candidate; former Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert;
[architect of the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/us/politics/elizabeth-warren.html).

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Warren, 71, has
been among the strongest contenders to be Mr. Biden’s running mate.

**Signature issues:** Has long criticized wealth concentration and
corporate power; proposed plans to break up big companies, tax the
extremely rich and use proceeds to fund new social benefits; recently
called for investigations of how the Trump administration has
distributed economic stimulus money and pushed a measure to strip the
names of Confederate generals from military bases.

**Relationship with Biden:** Warren and Biden have a relationship of
mutual respect, framed by [significant ideological
differences](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/politics/democrats-biden-warren-ticket.html).
When Biden was a senator and Warren a Harvard professor, they clashed in
a Senate hearing over bankruptcy regulation. But when Biden was mulling
a campaign for president in 2016, he met with Warren privately and
considered the idea of asking her to run with him.

**Pros and cons:** Warren would bring sterling progressive credentials
and a forceful economic message to Biden’s ticket. But she does not
represent racial or generational diversity, and her populist record
could unnerve some moderates.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I’m focused right now on
this
crisis.”

</div>

</div>

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Duckworth, 52,
has been interviewed by the Biden team and she has been asked to submit
documents for vetting.

**Signature issues:** Has been a prominent spokeswoman for her party on
national security and [the concerns of
veterans](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/army-veteran-deported.html)
and military families; championed policies to protect people with
disabilities.

**Relationship with Biden:** Duckworth does not have an especially close
relationship with Biden, but as vice president he backed her 2016
candidacy to unseat a Republican senator, Mark Kirk. Duckworth
introduced Biden’s late son, Beau, as a speaker at the 2008 Democratic
National Convention.

**Pros and cons:** [Duckworth’s personal
story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-birth.html)
could be powerful in a presidential campaign; she would be the first
veteran on a national ticket since John McCain, and the first female
veteran ever. She is a less prominent voice on some of the issues most
central to the campaign, like policing and the economy.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I can push back against
Trump [in a way others
can’t](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-vice-president-joe-biden.html).”

## Susan Rice

</div>

<div class="css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15" data-testid="photoviewer-children">

<div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height:386.6666666666667px">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** National security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations
under President Obama.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Rice, 55, has
been among the candidates furthest along in the vetting process.

**Signature issues:** Closely identified with the Obama administration’s
foreign policy breakthroughs, including [the Iran nuclear
deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/trump-iran-deal-foolish.html)
and the Paris climate agreement; recently [called for
statehood](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/opinion/trump-military-washington-statehood.html)
for Washington, D.C.

**Relationship with Biden:** Rice served with Biden in the Obama
administration for eight years, and their working relationship dates
back to the 1990s when Rice was an assistant secretary of state and
Biden was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

**Pros and cons:** Rice’s international experience would leave little
doubt that she is ready for the most sensitive parts of the job. But she
has [never been a
candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/politics/susan-rice-biden-vice-president.html)
before and the learning curve of a national campaign can be a steep one.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I’m humbled and honored to
be among the extremely accomplished women who are reportedly being
considered in that
regard.”

## Karen Bass

<div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** Representative from California since 2011; chair of the
Congressional Black Caucus; former speaker of the California State
Assembly.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Bass, 66, [joined
the process
later](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/karen-bass-joe-biden-vp.html)
than some of the other candidates, but she has emerged this summer as a
top contender for the vice presidency.

**Signature issues:** Has been a prominent figure in the House debate
over police reform; introduced legislation on public health, student
debt and foster care; leads a House subcommittee on Africa, global
health and human rights.

**Relationship with Biden:** Bass and Biden do not have a deep
relationship, but they appeared together at several events when he was
vice president and Bass endorsed his candidacy in March.

**Pros and cons:** Bass has a longer legislative record — in Washington
and California — than almost anyone else under consideration. She has a
rich political record that has involved confronting civil unrest in Los
Angeles and helping steer her state through the Great Recession. But she
is little-known nationally and is only now receiving close scrutiny for
aspects of her biography, including making multiple visits to Cuba under
Fidel Castro.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I’m willing to serve my
country in whatever way I am called
upon.”

<div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height:386.6666666666667px">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** Representative from Florida since 2017; [served as police
chief](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/who-is-val-demings.html)
in Orlando after [a long career
there](https://www.nytimes.com/article/val-demings-biden-vp.html) as an
officer.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Demings, 63, has
been interviewed at length and vetted intensively by the Biden team.

**Signature issues:** Has been an outspoken voice in the House on issues
related to gun control and law enforcement; [served as an impeachment
manager](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/impeachment-briefing-meet-the-managers.html)
in the Senate trial of President Trump.

**Relationship with Biden:** Demings and Biden do not have a
longstanding relationship, but they campaigned together for Florida
Democrats during the 2018 elections.

**Pros and cons:** Demings is a strong campaigner with a résumé that
matches the moment, and she comes from a crucial part of the country’s
biggest swing state. But she has not been closely vetted by the press
and her experience in elected office is relatively brief.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I hope, regardless of how
it turns out, that when boys and girls and young men and women around
this nation hear my personal story and they’ve been told that they can’t
make it for whatever reason, that they will be inspired.”

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Very seriously. Bottoms, 50, has
been interviewed by the Biden team and she has drawn even closer review
as her national profile has grown this summer.

**Signature issues:** Among the [most prominent city
leaders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/police-protests-atlanta-keisha-bottoms.html)
grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and answering the calls for
police reform and racial justice; quickly called for the firing of the
officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks and then [announced new
restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/rayshard-brooks-keisha-bottoms-atlanta.html)
on the use of force by police; made criminal justice reform a major
priority, including strictly limiting the use of cash bail.

**Relationship with Biden:** Bottoms was an early supporter of Mr. Biden
in the presidential race, serving as a fiercely loyal campaign
surrogate, even when he was down in the polls.

**Pros and cons:** Bottoms has **** cut an impressive figure during a
national reckoning over race and policing, and she hails from a crucial
political battleground. But her short time in high office could be an
obstacle.

**On being considered for vice president:** “It’s going to be important
for Joe Biden to have a strong V.P. who can help him heal our nation and
lead our nation, and it’s going to be important to have a person beside
him who can help him defeat Donald
Trump.”

**Bio:** Governor of Michigan since 2019; former Democratic leader in
the Michigan State Senate; [delivered the Democratic
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/us/politics/gretchen-whitmer-state-of-the-union.html)
to President Trump’s State of the Union address in February.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Somewhat seriously. Whitmer, 48,
has acknowledged she has had contact with the Biden search team, but
seems like a less prominent candidate than she was in the spring.

**Signature issues:** Ran for governor on a platform of rebuilding
Michigan’s broken roads, raising the minimum wage and investing in
education; has [grappled with the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-protests.html)
pandemic reshaping her administration, putting public health and
budgetary challenges at the center of her agenda.

**Relationship with Biden:** Whitmer has described herself as having
been friends with Biden for years, and he endorsed her campaign for
governor in 2018. She returned the favor before the Michigan
presidential primary in March.

**Pros and cons:** Whitmer is a popular young leader from an important
swing state, who has played a major role in responding to the
coronavirus. But she would not bring racial diversity to the ticket and
she has faced Republican attacks at home for engaging in national
politics.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I am making a little bit of
time to stay connected to the campaign but the most important thing that
I have to do right now is be the governor of my home
state.”

## Tammy Baldwin

**Bio:** Senator from Wisconsin since 2013; served seven terms in the
House; the [first openly gay
person](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/fashion/tammy-baldwin-on-the-edge-of-making-history.html)
to win a seat in the Senate.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Somewhat seriously. Baldwin, 58,
has been interviewed by the Biden team and she is seen as a politically
safe choice for the job.

**Signature issues:** Has championed universal health care for decades
and other changes to the health care system; has been an [important
voice on
trade](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/senate-democrats-seek-to-outdo-trump-on-trade.html)
and manufacturing, and a critic of China’s trade practices.

**Relationship with Biden:** Baldwin and Biden do not have a deep
relationship, but she served in the Senate during his second term as
vice president and they campaigned together in both the 2012 and 2018
elections, when Baldwin was on the ballot.

**Pros and cons:** Baldwin would bring populist credentials and local
popularity that could help deliver Wisconsin’s crucial Electoral College
votes to Biden. But Baldwin is relatively little known nationally and
many Democrats might object to an all-white ticket.

**On being considered for vice president:** “If he were to ask me to be
his running mate, I certainly
would.”

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** Governor of New Mexico since 2019; served three terms in
Congress and was chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; former
New Mexico secretary of health.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Pretty seriously. Lujan Grisham,
60, is probably the top candidate among the governors and she has been
asked to submit documents for vetting.

**Signature issues:** Enacted sweeping clean-energy legislation and a
minimum wage hike as governor; pushed for major liberal priorities like
[free public
college](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/us/new-mexico-free-college-tuition.html);
now heavily focused on [containing the coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/coronavirus-new-mexico.html)
and managing the damage of an economic recession.

**Relationship with Biden:** Lujan Grisham and Biden do not have a close
relationship. He endorsed her candidacy for governor in 2018.

**Pros and cons:** Lujan Grisham appears to be the only Latina candidate
under consideration, with the potential to give Biden a boost across the
Southwest. She has a compelling story to tell about leading a state
through a national crisis, but she is a lower-profile leader than many
of the other candidates in the mix.

**On being considered for vice president:** “What I hope the Biden
campaign continues to do is to look for not just a V.P. pick, but to be
really clear in building a cabinet and an agenda for America, that these
are folks who can run government.”

**Bio:** Former Democratic leader in the Georgia House of
Representatives before narrowly losing a race for governor in 2018; the
leader of an advocacy group, [Fair Fight
Action](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/politics/stacey-abrams-fair-fight-2020.html),
focused on voting rights.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Not too seriously. Some senior
Democrats are supportive of Abrams, 46, but she does not seem to be a
priority for the Biden team right now.

**Signature issues:** Has championed voting rights; advocated for
expanding health care at the state level during her time in the
legislature and worked with then-Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, on
criminal justice reform.

**Relationship with Biden:** Abrams and Biden do not have a longstanding
relationship, but [they met privately last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-election.html)
as Biden was weighing his decision to enter the 2020 race and his
advisers were floating the idea of announcing a running mate during the
Democratic primaries.

**Pros and cons:** Abrams is an agile political messenger with a strong
national following. But the highest office she has held is state
legislator, raising questions about her readiness.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I would be an excellent
running mate. I have the capacity to attract voters by motivating
typically ignored
communities.”

</div>

</div>

**Bio:** Senator from New Hampshire since 2017; served as governor there
from 2013 to 2017 and was previously the Democratic leader in the New
Hampshire State Senate.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Not too seriously. Hassan, 62,
agreed to be vetted by the Biden team but it is not clear that her
candidacy moved much past that point.

**Signature issues:** Has focused on health care and drug addiction; as
governor, expanded Medicaid at the state level, and in the Senate,
sponsored large-scale legislation [addressing the opioid
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-new-hampshire-opioid-plan.html).

**Relationship with Biden:** Like most top Democrats in the crucial
primary state of New Hampshire, Hassan has known Biden for some time.
They are not especially close but he consistently praised her during
visits to the state last year.

**Pros and cons:** Hassan has strong credentials as a governor and
senator from a state Hillary Clinton [barely won
in 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/new-hampshire-senate-hassan-ayotte.html).
But she is barely known outside New Hampshire. If she were elected vice
president, a Republican governor would name her replacement.

**On being considered for vice president:** “I am not going to comment
about his process, whatever that may be. My focus each and every day
continues to be serving the people of NH in the US
Senate.”

</div>

**Bio:** Governor of Rhode Island since 2015; served as state treasurer;
former venture capital executive; was chair of the Democratic Governors
Association in 2019.

**How seriously is she being vetted?** Not too seriously. Raimondo, 49,
has had some contact with the Biden team but she did not get as far
along in the process as others.

**Signature issues:** Has made economic development her central cause,
frequently pushing her party to adopt a more pointed message on economic
opportunity and job creation; overhauled the state’s [unstable public
pension
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/business/dealbook/rhode-island-averts-pension-disaster-without-raising-taxes.html),
a political victory that yielded lasting bad blood with some labor
unions.

**Relationship with Biden:** Raimondo and Biden are cut from the same
ideological cloth, and Biden has campaigned for her in the past. But
Raimondo [endorsed a different
moderate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020-presidency.html)
in the Democratic primaries: Michael R. Bloomberg.

**Pros and cons:** Raimondo may be more closely aligned with Biden in
her political sensibilities than anyone else in the running. But she is
viewed with distrust by the left and some important Democratic labor
unions, and she is relatively untested as a national figure.

**On being considered for vice president:** “Let me just say this. I’m
spending zero time on politics right
now.”

The Minnesota senator [announced on
June 18](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-biden-vice-president.html)
that she had withdrawn from the search process, after renewed scrutiny
of [her record as a
prosecutor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/politics/klobuchar-minneapolis-george-floyd.html)
greatly diminished her chances.

When protests swept her home state after the killing of George Floyd,
Klobuchar found herself struggling to explain why she had not done more
to take on police misconduct as district attorney. Pulling out of the
V.P. search, Klobuchar said she urged Biden in a phone call to choose a
woman of color for the
ticket.
