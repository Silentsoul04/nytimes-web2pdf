# ‘Every Work of American Literature Is About Race’: Writers on How We Got Here

</div>

Amid the most profound social upheaval since the 1960s, these novelists,
historians, poets, comedians and activists take a moment to look back to
the literature.

*Almost 100 years ago, responding to the public outcry over the violent
drowning of a Black boy by a white mob at a public beach on Lake
Michigan, a citywide (multiracial but white-led) commission published
“The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot.”*

*“Centuries of the Negro slave trade and of slavery as an institution …
placed a stamp upon the relations of the two races which it will require
many years to erase,” the nearly 700-page 1922 report began. “The past
is of value only as it aids in understanding the present; and an
understanding of the facts of the problem … is the first step toward its
solution.”*

*As protests spread across America once more, bringing to front pages
and the forefronts of our minds ugly truths about our country that
shouldn’t have been forgotten in the first place, we turn again to the
written record, to the literature. In an effort to deepen our
understanding of race and racism in America, we asked writers to share
with us the texts that have done the most to deepen theirs. Together
these histories, novels and verses have helped shape our collective
consciousness of a subject that is irreducible, and universal.*

## Gabriel Bump, *novelist*

Appreciating social movements in hindsight is a complicated endeavor.
Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Harriet Tubman are often
whitewashed to appease modern sensibilities. Some, like [Bayard
Rustin](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/obituaries/bayard-rustin-is-dead-at-75-pacifist-and-a-rights-activist.html),
are almost forgotten entirely.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I came across John D’Emilio’s **[LOST
PROPHET](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/books/the-organizer.html)**
(2003) by chance, in my local bookstore in college. I don’t often take
notes while reading for pleasure, but this time I made a detailed index
on the back flap, marking pages and lines I wanted to save for future
reference.

For example, did you know Rustin introduced Gandhian tactics of
nonviolent protest to Dr. King? Did you know he helped organize the
first Freedom Rides, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a
boycott of segregated New York City public schools?

As a young Black man with a temper, I credit Rustin with strengthening
my faith in pacifism. He was a Black queer Quaker from Pennsylvania who
went to jail for his sexuality and his refusal to fight in American
wars. When I myself came face to face with armored cops a few weeks ago,
I felt a powerful calm. I didn’t want to lash out. I wanted them to look
me in the eye and see I wasn’t afraid; I wasn’t going to move. They
could attack me, arrest me, shoot me with gas and rubber, and still, I
wasn’t going to move.

## Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, *novelist and essayist*

**[UNEXAMPLED
COURAGE](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/books/review/richard-gergel-unexampled-courage.html)**
(2019), by Richard Gergel, is a remarkable book. In clear and elegant
prose, Gergel — a United States district judge in South Carolina —
strips legal cases of jargon and presents them as what they essentially
are: human drama. The result is intellectually and emotionally
satisfying. The author’s loving admiration of Judge J. Waties Waring —
who descended from slave-owning Confederates, but turned his back on
“the doctrine of white supremacy” in his courtroom — is obvious, but
the evidence for it is rendered so dispassionately that it feels apt. As
I finished it I felt deeply moved all around, but mostly by the
incredible courage of the ordinary Black Americans in the 1951 Briggs v.
Elliott case, over school segregation. Meticulously researched and full
of heart, this book is important at this time when the United States is
confronting its ever-present past.

## Clint Smith, *poet*

Ira Katznelson’s **[WHEN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS
WHITE](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html)**
(2005) was one of the first books that helped me concretely understand
how racism was embedded into federal policy. In my American history
classes growing up, the New Deal had been celebrated as the great
catalyst of intergenerational opportunity and wealth for millions across
the country. And it was. What I had not been taught, however, was how
New Deal legislation was intentionally crafted to prevent millions of
Black Americans from having access to its benefits. As Katznelson
outlines, in the 1930s, 75 percent of Black workers in the South were
employed as either maids or farmworkers. People in those professions
were excluded for decades from social programs that set the minimum
wage, regulated work hours, created labor unions and Social Security —
which is to say, the programs that were the economic bedrock for
millions of White Americans.

## Sandra Cisneros, *novelist*

Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz’s **AN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES** (2014) helped me clarify my place in this country. It confirmed
what had been told to me by my ancestors: that Indigenous peoples, from
the North Pole to the South, have been here since before the world was
known as round. As a conquering nation, the United States has rewritten
history to make people of the U.S. forget our past as natives to this
land. This is especially apparent in the Mexi-phobic, immigrant-phobic
policies of our time.

If every politician were to read and understand this book — which should
be required in every high school curriculum — we would have a
reconsideration of our current border policies and our practice of
detaining human beings in cages. Our present is made of a past of
genocide and colonialism. This book is necessary reading if we are to
move into a more humane future.

## Reginald Dwayne Betts, *poet*

Right now I’m rereading Marlon James’s **[BLACK LEOPARD, RED
WOLF](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/books/review/black-leopard-red-wolf-marlon-james.html)**
(2019). Wild that fantasy is where I turn to think about race and these
states. But the book’s first line, “The child is dead,” begins all our
troubles these days. George Floyd, still his mother’s son, calling for
her with his last breath. James’s book follows in the tradition of
Octavia Butler and Toni Morrison: In his world, like our own, everyone
is complicit. A few pages in, I remember that the one telling us what
has happened is in a cell — death and prison, aren’t these the sources
of this nation’s discontent? Name a story more American than that. And
still, the story gives me hope. On the first page is tragedy; the next
600 explore, challenge and critique an encyclopedia of phobias and isms,
in language so rich and a story so compelling that you aren’t even aware
the reading is making you wiser until it already has.

## Desus Nice & The Kid Mero, *late night co-hosts and authors*

**Desus:** As a child, I attended a program for extremely gifted
children. We were so advanced we read Richard Wright’s **BLACK BOY**
(1945) in third grade. I still have my copy and it’s in shambles,
because that became my favorite book. The vivid description of Richard’s
life in the South fascinated me — and, as a young boy in the Bronx, I
could still relate. His depiction of racist situations, and being called
the “N-word,” hit me; because at that age I too had already been called
the “N-word.” That book showed me Black people have been going through
the struggles I’d been going through forever.

**Mero:** I read **TO BE A SLAVE** (1968), by [Julius
Lester](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/obituaries/julius-lester-chronicler-of-black-america-is-dead-at-78.html),
illustrated by Tom Feelings, in around seventh grade. My teacher,
shout-out to Mr. Adeghe, was from Ghana and very passionate. All the
“American History” classes I took prior to that were all about
Pilgrims and Native Americans shaking hands and eating turkey. This book
was like a nuclear bomb of knowledge that made me connect even more with
my Afro-Latino identity and roots.

## Jill Leovy, *journalist*

For understanding the Jim Crow South, I always recommend **AFTER
FREEDOM** (1939), based on the anthropologist [Hortense
Powdermaker](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/17/archives/hortense-powdermaker-is-dead-an-authority-on-varied-cultures.html)’s
hard-won observations in Mississippi and the best of the great fieldwork
studies from that era. Less often read, although it ought to be more, is
Mark Schultz’s **THE RURAL FACE OF WHITE SUPREMACY: Beyond Jim Crow**
(2005). Schultz spent years on this oral history project, capturing the
fascinating personal stories of elderly black and white residents of a
Georgia county who spoke candidly about race relations in the first half
of the 20th century. For contemporary inner-city politics and violence
issues, check out Cid Martinez’s **THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS ITS OWN RULES**
(2016), an astute analysis of activist politics in Los Angeles. Although
it is not about America, **INFORMAL JUSTICE IN DIVIDED SOCIETIES**
(2002), by Colin Knox and Rachel Monaghan, helped me place our domestic
race issues in a global context. Americans tend to view this country’s
racial situation as singular and distinct, but in the streets of Watts
ring echoes of Belfast and Cape Town.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Darryl Pinckney, *novelist and essayist*

Among the books I have gone back to in this historic moment are:
**DARKWATER: Voices From Within the Veil** (1920), by W.E.B. Du Bois,
because of his thoughtful insights 100 years ago into the very matters
that now call people into the streets at some risk; and **DARKNESS OVER
GERMANY: A Warning From History** (1943), by E. Amy Buller, because of
what she tells us about the mass psychology of fascism.

## Tressie McMillan Cottom, *sociologist and essayist*

Race is a living, breathing thing that morphs across time and context
and even our own understanding; so the most important books that have
shaped my understanding of race are tied to who I was at the time that I
read them. The list will change as I change, and that is as it should
be.

I read Anne Moody’s **COMING OF AGE IN MISSISSIPPI** (1969) as a child,
before I knew what memoir was. But still the book resonated with me, as
I already understood what it meant to be a Black girl in a world where
race and gender circumscribed who we could become. As a young adult, I
read **[A FINE
BALANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/books/an-accidental-family.html)**
(1996), by Rohinton Mistry, and for the first time understood that
racism in the United States has genealogies other than the global slave
trade. (I immediately signed up for courses on South Asian studies at my
historically Black college.) As an adult, I think of Derrick Bell’s
science-fiction story **THE SPACE TRADERS** (1992) at least once a week,
mostly wishing everyone else had also read it so that we could stop
reliving its message. Finally, there is no book more important to
understanding the underpinnings of race, racism and uprisings right now
than a new book by William A. Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen, **FROM
HERE TO EQUALITY** (2020). ** Part history and part social policy, it
takes economic reparations for Black Americans seriously. I wish we
could say the same for America.

## Henry Louis Gates Jr., *historian and literary critic*

Few reading experiences on the history of race in America have been as
profound for me as the works of Eric Foner. From
**[RECONSTRUCTION](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/22/books/a-moment-of-terrifying-promise.html)**
(1988), ** his definitive study of the era, to last year’s tour de force
on the trio of constitutional amendments that established **[THE SECOND
FOUNDING](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/books/review/the-second-founding-eric-foner.html)**
after the Civil War, no one has done more since W.E.B. Du Bois’s **BLACK
RECONSTRUCTION IN AMERICA** (1935) to refute the racist fabrications of
previous generations of Lost Cause “scholars.” In rescuing the facts
about the promise and violent overthrow of our country’s most thrilling
experiment in interracial democracy, Foner has proved that no one set of
historians has the final word. “The slave went free; stood a brief
moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery,” Du Bois wrote
— succinctly, poetically and so very sadly — of the period of
Reconstruction’s nakedly racist rollback (perversely named “Redemption”)
that ushered in nearly a century of Jim Crow.

I’m also inspired by a new generation of scholars — from Kimberlé
Crenshaw’s **CRITICAL RACE THEORY** (1995) to Martha Jones’s
**VANGUARD** (2020) — who are shining a light on this crucial chapter in
our story, pointing out its harbingers in earlier efforts to circumvent
the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments (especially voter suppression). As
dark and unsettling forces attempt to roll back the gains of what
historians sometimes call “The Second Reconstruction” of the 1960s, and
as tyrannical impulses seek to curtail our most foundational and sacred
constitutional rights, let us look to these examples of great
scholarship, which preserve the noble tale of the triumphant
determination of black people to rise undiminished out of the ashes of
racial repression, violence and
lynching.

## Danzy Senna, *novelist*

Every work of American literature is about race, whether the writer
knows it or not. That said, these are some nonfiction books that have
given me necessary tools to think about our culture. In college I read
both [bell
hooks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/books/bell-hooks-min-jin-lee-aint-i-a-woman.html)’s
**BLACK LOOKS** (1992) ** and Donald Bogle’s **[TOMS, COONS, MULATTOES,
MAMMIES &
BUCKS](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/09/archives/greater-expectations-books-of-the-times-liberation-from-illusions.html)**
(1973), and was never the same. Toni Morrison’s **[PLAYING IN THE
DARK](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/books/the-clearest-eye.html)**
(1992) is utter genius, revealing through literary analysis how
whiteness doesn’t exist without blackness. [Nella
Larsen](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/18/books/on-writers-and-writing-authentic-american.html)’s
**QUICKSAND** (1928) and **PASSING** (1929), both published during the
Harlem Renaissance, feel just as contemporary and lucid today in their
portrayal of mixed-race women and the perils of white passing. More
recently, I have been enamored by the brilliance of both Hilton Als’s
**[WHITE
GIRLS](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/white-girls-by-hilton-als.html)**
(2013) and Margo Jefferson’s
**[NEGROLAND](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/margo-jeffersons-negroland-a-memoir.html)**
(2015)*.*

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Mitchell Duneier, *sociologist*

Gunnar Myrdal’s massive sociological study **AN AMERICAN DILEMMA**
(1944) saw “the Negro problem” as something that could never be
understood through data about black living conditions alone, but as a
phenomenon of the majority’s power. It was a moral situation in which
conflicting values were held both within the white population and,
importantly, within white individuals themselves.

If change did not come about, Myrdal predicted uprisings. “America can
never more regard its Negroes as a patient, submissive minority,” he
writes. “They will organize for defense and offense. … They have the
advantage that they can fight wholeheartedly.”

Myrdal perceptively noted that the average white Northerner did not
understand racism as something in which he or she was taking part every
day. But he also argued that whites were deeply troubled by the
contradiction between their egalitarian principles and their attitude
toward black citizens. This was the “American dilemma.”

There is much value in this big book, but even more to be learned today
from Myrdal’s naïveté. By the time of the civil rights movement, it had
become clear to a new generation of critics that the whites Myrdal had
interviewed — perhaps like many today who are rushing to issue public
statements or participating in multiracial rallies — were still
perfectly capable of compartmentalizing words and deeds, living with
moral dissonance.

## Valeria Luiselli, *novelist and essayist*

So-called third-world problems — hunger, poverty, violence — are often
explained as a result of particular “political cultures” endemic to
specific nations. But while partly true, that narrative is also
reductionist. All countries interact with other countries, and most
“developing” nations have to sustain unequal relations with larger
powers that systematically abuse them through military interventions,
economic sanctions or unequal treatises. The borderlands between Mexico
and the United States are a clear and poignant example of this
interrelatedness. In **THE FEMICIDE MACHINE** (2012), Sergio González
Rodríguez focuses on Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso,
Texas, where the rate of femicides started escalating drastically in the
early 1990s, after decades of mutually accorded industrialization
programs that resulted in NAFTA. “The Femicide Machine” discusses the
politics of killing women for being women not within the oversimplifying
framework of Mexican culture alone, but as a result of the economic
interactions between Mexico and the U.S., and the geopolitical
conditions that fuel them.

## Eddie S. Glaude Jr., *professor*

I find myself these days reaching for James Baldwin’s **NO NAME IN THE
STREET** (1972), his first book after Dr. King’s assassination, which
broke him. Shadowed by grief and trauma, this memoir is as fragmented as
Baldwin’s memories. “Much, much, much has been blotted out,” he writes,
“coming back only lately in bewildering and untrustworthy flashes.”
The book is also Baldwin’s attempt to come to terms with America’s
latest betrayal of Black people, and his effort to muster the energy and
the faith to keep fighting — to give Black people the language to keep
fighting. The prose is angry, because Baldwin is profoundly wounded. If
“The Fire Next Time” (1963) was prophetic, “No Name in the Street” was
the reckoning.

## Albert Woodfox, *activist*

I read **THE NATURE OF PREJUDICE** (1954), by Gordon W. Allport,
sometime in the ’70s, while I was in prison. This book had the greatest
impact on my ability to understand the difference between prejudice and
racism. Prejudice is a normal reaction to the unknown. Racism is a
premeditated sickness.

## Kerri Greenidge, *historian*

Harriet Jacobs’s **INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL** (1861), for
its sophisticated critique of slavery, 19th-century feminism and the
gendered nature of white supremacy. Paula Giddings’s **WHEN AND WHERE I
ENTER** (1984), for the groundbreaking nature of her research, and
because in the post-Kerner Commission era, when black women were blamed
for “the state of the black family” and stereotyped as “welfare queens,”
Giddings provided historical context for understanding the black women I
knew as a child. Robin D.G. Kelley’s **HAMMER AND HOE** (1990) managed
to contextualize black radical politics within a rural, Southern and
Marxist framework, challenging the liberal argument that civil rights
was concerned only with integrated lunch counters, not the dismantling
of global racial capitalism.

## Carol Anderson, *historian*

Jesmyn Ward’s **[SING, UNBURIED,
SING](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/books/review-sing-unburied-sing-jesmyn-ward.html)**
(2017); Isabel Wilkerson’s **[THE WARMTH OF OTHER
SUNS](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html)**
(2010); Kiese Laymon’s
**[HEAVY](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/books/review/kiese-laymon-heavy.html)**
(2018); David Oshinsky’s **WORSE THAN SLAVERY** (1996); Claudia
Rankine’s
**[CITIZEN](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/claudia-rankines-citizen.html)**
(2014); J. Mills Thornton’s **DIVIDING LINES** (2002); John W. Dower’s
**WAR WITHOUT MERCY** (1986); Patrick Phillips’s **[BLOOD AT THE
ROOT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/books/review-blood-at-the-root-a-tale-of-racial-cleansing-close-to-home.html)**
(2016); Françoise Hamlin’s **CROSSROADS AT CLARKSDALE** (2012); Joshua
Bloom and Waldo E. Martin Jr.’s **BLACK AGAINST EMPIRE** (2013).

Each speaks, in some way, to the power of racism, and sometimes just
sheer, raw, unadulterated anti-blackness, in destroying millions upon
millions of lives. Each also lays out the power of the refusal to accept
subjugation. And that the subsequent and ongoing battles between
anti-blackness and freedom are
messy.

## Morgan Jerkins, *essayist and memoirist*

**TELL MY HORSE: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica** (1938), by Zora
Neale Hurston (1938): Determined to tell the stories of Black people
outside of distant, scientific analysis, Hurston writes of her
experiences of spiritual practices in these two Caribbean nations.

**SING, UNBURIED, SING,** by Jesmyn Ward: This is one of the best novels
I’ve ever read. Set in Mississippi, it involves an odyssey to the
notorious Parchman Farm penitentiary to pick up a lover; a ghost who
haunts an elderly former inmate at said prison; and a young boy who
observes it all.

**[MINOR
FEELINGS](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/books/review-minor-feelings-cathy-park-hong.html)**
(2020), by Cathy Park Hong: This wonderfully crafted essay collection is
a necessary read for those who want to understand Asian-American
experiences — as well as immigration and migration, intergenerational
trauma and even
anti-Blackness.

**[THICK](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/books/review/thick-tressie-mcmillan-cottom.html)**
(2019), by Tressie McMillan Cottom: In her second book, the sociologist,
a savant and wordsmith, addresses the intersections of race, gender and
class with enviable grace and
confidence.

**[CANNIBAL](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/t-magazine/black-women-writers.html)**
(2016), by Safiya Sinclair: One of my favorite poetry collections.
Sinclair covers so much ground: her Jamaican background, spirituality,
womanhood, America, race relations. She laces words together in a
beautiful tapestry, full of history, life, death and, most of all,
renewal.

## Natalie Diaz, *poet*

Reading is a way of practicing the imagination necessary to broaden our
capacities to understand ourselves and others. These four books
constellate conversations that have long been held separate from one
another, lest their accumulation create an energy perilous to the
colony: Simone Browne’s **DARK MATTERS** (2017), Dina Gilio-Whitaker’s
**AS LONG AS GRASS GROWS** (2019), Dolores Dorantes’s **STYLE** (2016)
and Mahmoud Darwish’s **JOURNAL OF AN ORDINARY GRIEF** (1973). Each book
exists separately within its own conditions, while taking on exponential
meaning in relation to one
another.

## David Treuer, *novelist and historian*

**[BELOVED](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/01/11/home/14013.html?mcubz=3)**
(1987), by Toni Morrison: I read this when I was 19. No book, no matter
the intelligence behind it, can put the reader into the position of
unfreedom in which African-Americans lived as enslaved people. Morrison,
I think, knew this. What “Beloved” taught me to see and to feel was what
it might be like to have the things we think of as universally human —
in this case, a mother’s love for her children — twisted and deformed by
the institution and experience of slavery.

**[CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR
SINS](https://www.nytimes.com/1969/11/09/archives/custer-died-for-your-sins-an-indian-manifesto-by-vine-deloria-jr.html)**
(1969): In this essay collection, the lawyer and activist Vine Deloria
Jr. shouts, chides, teases and preaches about the pain and absurdity of
being Native American in a modern world.

**NOTES OF A NATIVE SON** (1958), by James Baldwin: No other writer has
written as lucidly, powerfully and productively about what it means to
be black in America — and, as a result, what this country means.

**[ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF
SOLITUDE](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/08/archives/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-memory-and-prophecy-illusion-and.html)**
(1967), by Gabriel García Márquez: Billed as a Latin American fantasy,
the Colombian-Mexican author’s magical-realist epic is as much an
American fantasy, about the lives caught in the web of 19th- and
20th-century colonialism.

## Thomas Chatterton Williams, *memoirist and critic*

There are several dozen books explicitly about race in America that have
left lifelong marks on me, but only two have reversed the course of my
own thought. The first is [Albert
Murray](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/books/albert-murray-essayist-who-challenged-the-conventional-dies-at-97.html)’s
**THE OMNI-AMERICANS** (1970). ** Murray’s argument is simple but
profound: America is a mongrel nation, both culturally and in its DNA.
Though we may come up with all kinds of methods to obscure this basic
truth, “any fool can see,” he writes, “that the white people are not
really white, and that black people are not black.”

The second is **RACECRAFT** (2012), by Barbara J. Fields and Karen Elise
Fields. The Fields sisters prove with witty, withering brilliance that
racism — and the ideology of white supremacy, rooted in economic
exploitation — creates race, and not the other way around.

Finally, though it’s trans-Atlantic in scope, the British sociologist
[Paul
Gilroy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/paul-gilroy-holberg-prize.html)’s
monumental work **AGAINST RACE** (2000) argues that race is not
something intrinsic and immutable but something fluid, illusory and
imposed, “an afterimage — a lingering effect of looking too casually
into the damaging glare emanating from colonial conflicts at home and
abroad.”

All three books convinced me that we will never transcend racism so long
as we continue to reify the illusory, inherently hierarchical color
categories that it gives us.

## Richard Rothstein, *historian*

Whites may find it challenging to confront stereotypes and comprehend
the deeply embedded legacies of slavery and Jim Crow, but even harder is
embracing remedies, because seemingly race-neutral policies perpetuate
our racial caste system. With engaging profiles of housing advocates and
the opposition they face, Conor Dougherty’s **[GOLDEN
GATES](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/books/review/golden-gates-housing-conor-dougherty.html)**
(2020) focuses on California, but has lessons for all metropolitan
areas. Smugly deeming itself racially progressive, the state allows
high-wage employment (mostly for whites and educated immigrants) to grow
faster than housing supply, ensuring that priced-out black and Hispanic
families will suffer greater homelessness and displacement to
job-starved distant suburbs. Segregation increases as voters enact local
zoning codes to prevent new home-building, but those in desperate need
of housing can’t register to vote in the no-growth towns that ban them.
That’s structural racism.
