Protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis swept across
the state, prompting at least two countywide curfews in parts of
Northern and Southern California.

Protests have erupted in at least 140 cities across the United States in
the days after George Floyd, a black man,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation}{died
in police custody} in Minneapolis.

Some of the protests turned violent, prompting the activation of the
National Guard in at least 21 states, including California, where troops
were concentrated in the southern region.

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom spoke forcefully about recognizing the
outrage, fear and hurt among black Americans who he said have been
promised change too many times without results, long before the killing
of Mr. Floyd.

``The black community is not responsible for what's happening in this
country --- we are,'' the governor said. ``People have lost patience for
a reason.''

As protests swelled throughout the state, several cities and counties
began imposing curfews over the weekend and early into the week,
including

of Los Angeles and Alameda Counties}.
