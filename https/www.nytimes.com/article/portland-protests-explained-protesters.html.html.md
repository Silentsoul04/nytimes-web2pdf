# What Do Portland Protesters Want, and How Have the Police Responded?

</div>

Eight weeks after the death of George Floyd, here’s a look at why
longstanding protests in the city have recently intensified.

When a video showing George Floyd’s death in police custody spread
across social media, cities and towns nationwide soon erupted in
protests against systemic racism and police brutality. But while
protests in many places subsided after a few weeks,
[Portland](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/portland-protests-fact-check.html),
Ore., has been holding demonstrations every night since May 29.  
  
[The arrival of federal forces in the
city](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/portland-protests.html) this
month — and concerns they were [exceeding their
authority](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/portland-protests.html)
and violating protesters’ rights — drew the ire of local officials and
reinvigorated nightly demonstrations. With renewed force, marchers have
spray-painted the walls of [the U.S. District Court
building](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/portland-protests-courthouse.html),
demanding that federal agents go home. Groups of mothers have banded
together, locking arms and
[chanting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/portland-protests.html):
“Feds stay clear. Moms are here.”

and set some of the offices on fire, and the Portland police have
reported cases of looting. More recently, demonstrators have thrown
rocks and bottles at federal officers. But many have protested
peacefully, and Gov. Kate Brown has called the presence of federal
agents an “abuse of power.”

## What are the protesters demanding?

What started out as a movement for police accountability and racial
justice has morphed into a complex mobilization. The protesters’ goals
now include defunding the police, addressing income inequality and
pushing federal agents out of the city.

In Portland, which is [one of America’s whitest
cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/portland-oregon-protests-white-race.html)
and has a racist history, protesters have maintained a public call for
change that has subsided elsewhere in the country.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Experts
say](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/portland-oregon-protests-white-race.html)
the protests bring together a coalition of racial justice proponents and
anti-fascist advocates, who have long been active in Portland. The
groups share some intersecting grievances and common goals, such as
cutting police budgets and installing more civilian oversight of the
police.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Signs such as “White Silence=Violence” and “Black Lives Matter” are
widespread, and calls at the demonstrations to address racial inequities
persist. One woman held a sign that said: “My Black Child is Watching\!
\#BLM She Will Know Her Life Matters.”

Demonstrators have also expressed increasing frustration with the
federal presence and the Trump administration.

“What is making more people come to the street every night now is the
brutalization that’s happening to regular community members at the hands
of Portland police and these federal agents,” Jo Ann Hardesty, a city
commissioner, said at a news conference.

## How has the city responded?

Street protests began four days after the death of Mr. Floyd in
Minneapolis. As the demonstrations continued and officers used tear gas
to disperse crowds, public outrage against aggressive police tactics
increased and calls to defund the police escalated.

On June 8, after more than a week of large-scale demonstrations
involving thousands of marchers, the chief of the Portland Police Bureau
[stepped
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/george-floyd-protests.html),
saying new leadership was needed to rebuild public trust. Shortly after,
a federal judge upheld restrictions on tear gas put in place by Mayor
Ted Wheeler, barring the use of the chemical agent except when life or
safety was at risk.

The City Council also passed a budget that would cut $15 million from
the police in the upcoming fiscal year, a demand sought by protesters.

## Why have the protests continued this long?

By late June, the size of protests had diminished significantly. Rose
City Justice, a major mobilizing force in Portland, announced plans to
pull back on organizing efforts. Nightly marches, numbering in the
hundreds, became more decentralized.

But after federal agents, including some from the Department of Homeland
Security, arrived in July, reports soon emerged that they had forcefully
[pulled people into unmarked
vehicles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/politics/portland-federal-agents-trump.html),
injured protesters, and deployed tear gas. Mayor Wheeler, who called the
situation “an attack on our democracy,” was [tear-gassed with a group of
protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/portland-protest-tear-gas-mayor.html)
outside the federal courthouse.

By the time the federal agents arrived, city leaders said, the situation
on the streets had de-escalated. But outrage at the Trump
administration’s deployment reinvigorated the daily rallies.

## Which federal law enforcement agencies are involved?

[The federal agents present in
Portland](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/homeland-security-portland-oregon.html)
include personnel from the U.S. Marshals and tactical agents from
Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
in addition to the Federal Protective Service, which was already
stationed to protect federal property in Portland.

Some of the agents are from a group known as BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s
equivalent of a SWAT team, which typically investigates drug smuggling
organizations.

## What is motivating the movement in Portland?

Oregon has a history of white supremacy. A law passed in 1844 said that
any Black person would be “whipped twice a year until he or she shall
quit the territory” and leaders also later banned Black people from
entering the territory.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some protesters say the state’s deeply racist history is still reflected
in Portland’s structures. One protester, Reginald Liggins, who is Black,
[told The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/portland-oregon-protests-white-race.html)
that he began commuting by bus after being pulled over multiple times by
the Portland police without reason. Liza Lopetrone, a veterinary nurse
who is white and joined the Wall of Moms protest this week, said she
wanted to bring the state’s white supremacist legacy to light.

Others were not moved to participate until federal agents entered the
city. Christopher J. David, a Navy veteran who was filmed being [beaten
with a
baton](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html)
by federal officers, had not followed the protests until U.S. agents
were deployed. He came to the protests to ask officers about their use
of violent tactics against protesters, which he said conflicted with
their oath to uphold the Constitution.
