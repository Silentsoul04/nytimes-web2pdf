They are a rite of passage as well as anxiety-inducing letters for
millions of students: the
[SAT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/at-home-sat-coronavirus.html)
and ACT.

But with many high schools closed or teaching remotely for the rest of
the academic year, a growing number of colleges and universities are
waiving standardized test requirements amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Some went further than that, with leaders of the University of
California system voting on May 21 to [phase out the SAT and ACT as an
admissions
requirement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/university-california-sat-act.html)
over the next four years.

The test will be optional through 2024, when the system’s 10 schools
could develop its own admissions test. The system had already eliminated
the standardized test requirement because of the outbreak of the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Proponents of the change said the university system would still attract
top students and that too much weight had been given to the tests.

“No one has ever asked me, ‘What was your SAT?’” said Lark Park, a
regent for the University of California system.

At least two Ivy League schools adjusted their policies for applicants.
On April 22, Cornell University suspended its testing requirements,
saying in a
[statement](https://admissions.cornell.edu/news/cornell-university-suspends-actsat-testing-requirement-2021-applicants)
that “due to this extraordinary circumstance,” students could submit
applications without ACT or SAT exam results starting in August
2021.

“We can’t pre-define in absolute, comprehensive terms what economic or
personal disruptions will look like,” the statement added. “We don’t
plan to require any students to justify their reasons for not submitting
test results.”

And Harvard College recently told applying high school juniors that they
would not face penalties if they were unable to submit SAT subject test
results and Advanced Placement test scores.

“We know that there are fewer opportunities to take the SAT or ACT given
the cancellations to date,” Harvard [said in a
statement.](https://college.harvard.edu/about/news-announcements/special-message-high-school-juniors-applying-harvard)
“You will not be disadvantaged in any way if you do not submit subject
tests.”

Two other Ivy League schools, Princeton and the University of
Pennsylvania, do not require students take SAT subject tests for
admission. In a recent
[message](https://admission.princeton.edu/how-apply/standardized-testing/statement-applicants-princetons-class-2025)to
potential applicants, Princeton’s dean of admission, Karen Richardson
said, “while our policy has long been that SAT subject tests are
recommended but not required, now seems the appropriate time to
reiterate that applicants who do not submit subject tests will not be
disadvantaged in our process.” She added, **“**SAT or ACT test scores
are only one part of our holistic review.”

So far, Dartmouth College, Yale and Brown University still require them,
as do Stanford and highly selective colleges on the West Coast. But many
of the schools that compete with those big names are moving ahead to
make the tests optional.

More than two dozen institutions — including highly selective liberal
arts colleges like
[Williams](https://communications.williams.edu/news-releases/4_6_2020_test_optional/)
and [Amherst](https://www.amherst.edu/news/press-releases/node/768482),
both in Massachusetts — announced this spring that the tests would be
optional for applicants seeking to enroll in 2021.

The easing of test requirements comes as education reform groups have
criticized the SAT and ACT, which they contend give wealthier students
an advantage because their families can afford expensive prep exams and
coaches. The nonprofit National Center for Fair and Open Testing keeps a
growing list of hundreds of higher education institutions already moving
away from requiring the tests.

Williams College, which U.S. News & World Report ranked as the [top
national liberal arts college in its annual
guide](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/williams-college-2229) this
year, took the step last week and said it was waiving the requirement
for both first-year and transfer applicants.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is an unprecedented moment for students and colleges alike and it
calls for a change to the usual way of doing things,” Liz Creighton, the
dean of admission and financial aid at Williams, said in a statement on
April 6.

The same day that Williams made the exams optional, so did its rival,
Amherst.

“If future test dates are not available in students’ local areas or if
students are worried about how to test in a socially distant manner, we
do not want them to feel pressure to put themselves in situations that
are not in their best interest,” Matt McGann, the dean of admission and
financial aid at Amherst, said in a statement. “And we wanted to provide
clarity and ease anxiety as soon as we
could.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The College Board, which administers the SAT, said on May 12 that it
supports colleges “that are rightfully emphasizing flexibility for the
admissions process for next year” and noted that the organization’s
“responsibility is to ensure that every student has the option and the
opportunity to take the SAT.”

“As many colleges are considering temporary shifts to test-flexible and
test-optional admissions policies due to the coronavirus, it is
important that they help students understand how these changes will
impact admission, access to specialized programs, and scholarships,” the
College Board said.

A spokesman for the ACT said it “respects the right of every college to
determine its own admission policies, particularly in the midst of a
crisis such as Covid-19 where flexibility and managing disruption is
paramount,” while noting that “despite the immediate effects of Covid19
on admissions, it is clear that ACT scores add meaningful insight and
significant value above and beyond other factors used in the college
admission process.”

“We are committed to supporting students’ needs for obtaining an ACT
score during these trying times by working to provide them with multiple
options to take the test,” the spokesman said.
