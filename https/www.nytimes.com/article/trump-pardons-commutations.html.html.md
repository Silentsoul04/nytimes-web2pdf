# Trump Adds Roger Stone to His List of Pardons and Commutations

</div>

The president’s decision to commute Mr. Stone’s sentence continues a
pattern of his presidency: granting clemency to friends whose cases
resonate with him personally.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Trump on Friday [commuted the sentence of Roger J. Stone
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html),
a longtime friend and former campaign adviser who had openly expressed
loyalty to him throughout a congressional investigation into ties
between Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.

“The simple fact is that if the special counsel had not been pursuing an
absolutely baseless investigation, Mr. Stone would not be facing time in
prison,” the White House [said in a statement on Friday
evening](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grant-clemency-roger-stone-jr/).

Mr. Stone had been days away from reporting to a federal prison to serve
a 40-month sentence for seven felonies, including lying to federal
investigators, tampering with a witness and impeding a congressional
inquiry. He had [aggressively
lobbied](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/roger-stone-prison.html)
for clemency, both in the courts and on social media.

The commutation, which was immediately criticized by Democrats, adds Mr.
Stone to a list of beneficiaries of Mr. Trump’s clemency in cases that
resonate with him personally — or with people who have a direct line to
him through friends or family — over thousands of other cases awaiting
his review.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to the Justice Department, Mr. Trump has commuted the
sentences of [10
people](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/commutations-granted-president-donald-trump-2017-present),
not including Mr. Stone, but he has received 7,786 petitions for
commutation. This puts him far behind his most recent predecessor,
President Barack Obama, who
[commuted](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics#obama) the
sentences of 1,715 people, but closer to President George W. Bush, who
commuted the sentences of 11 people.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution gives presidents
unlimited authority to grant pardons, which excuse or forgive a federal
crime. A commutation, [by
contrast](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/washington/03commute.html),
makes a punishment milder without wiping out the underlying conviction —
in Mr. Stone’s case, the White House did not argue that he was innocent.
Both are forms of presidential clemency.

Here are some of the pardons and commutations issued by Mr. Trump:

Pardon: Aug. 25, 2017

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Joe Arpaio, an anti-immigration crusader who enjoyed calling himself
“America’s toughest sheriff,” [was the first
pardon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/27/us/joe-arpaio-sheriff-pardon.html)
of Mr. Trump’s presidency.

Once one of the most popular — and divisive — figures in Arizona, Mr.
Arpaio was elected sheriff of Maricopa County five times before he was
[ultimately charged with criminal
contempt](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/us/sheriff-joe-arpaio-convicted-arizona.html)
for defying a court order to stop detaining people solely on the
suspicion that they were undocumented immigrants.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a move that drew outrage from Democrats and immigration advocates,
Mr. Trump, who has staked much of his political capital around
zero-tolerance immigration policies, pardoned Mr. Arpaio less than a
month after he was found guilty.

Pardon: May 15, 2019

## Conrad M. Black

Conrad M. Black, a former press baron and friend of Mr. Trump’s, was
granted a full pardon 12 years after his sentencing for fraud and
obstruction of justice.

Mr. Black, who once owned The Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and
The Daily Telegraph of London, among other newspapers, was convicted of
fraud in 2007 with three other former executives of Hollinger
International. They had been accused of skimming millions of dollars
from the media
company.

Pardon: May 31, 2018

## Dinesh D’Souza

Dinesh D’Souza received a presidential pardon after pleading guilty to
making illegal campaign contributions in 2014. Mr. D’Souza, a filmmaker
and author whose subjects often dabble in conspiracy theories, had long
blamed his conviction on his political opposition to Mr. Obama.

“What happened here is Obama and his team — Eric Holder, Preet Bharara
in New York — these guys decided to make an example of me, and I think
that the reason for this was Obama’s anger over my movie that I made
about him,” Mr. D’Souza said on “Fox and Friends,” one of Mr. Trump’s
favorite shows.

His reasoning seemed to strike a nerve with the president: In issuing
his pardon, Mr. Trump said that Mr. D’Souza had been “treated very
unfairly by our government,” echoing a claim the commentator has often
made himself.

Pardon: May 24, 2018

## Jack Johnson

Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, was tarnished
by a racially tainted criminal conviction in 1913 — for transporting a
white woman across state lines. It haunted him even well after his death
in 1946.

Politicians and celebrities alike tried for years to secure a pardon,
but in the end, Mr. Trump was swayed by a friendly phone call from
Rambo.

“Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing
champion [Jack

Mr. Trump [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/987768453338673152)
just weeks before announcing his decision. “His trials and tribulations
were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at
this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am
considering a Full Pardon\!”

Ten years ago, Bernard B. Kerik, a former New York City police
commissioner, was [sentenced to four years in
prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/nyregion/19kerik.html) after
pleading guilty to eight felony charges, including tax fraud and lying
to White House officials. Around the time of his sentencing, federal
prosecutors denounced Mr. Kerik as a corrupt official who sought to
trade his authority for lavish benefits.

Mr. Trump said he heard from more than a dozen people about pardoning
Mr. Kerik, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and
Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. Mr. Kerik’s rise to prominence dates to the
1993 campaign for mayor in New York City, when he served as Mr.
Giuliani’s bodyguard and chauffeur. After the pardon was announced,
Mr. Kerik [expressed his
gratitude](https://twitter.com/BernardKerik/status/1229842151799959555)
to Mr. Trump on Twitter. “With the exception of the birth of my
children,” he wrote, “today is one of the greatest days in my life.”

## I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby Jr.

I. Lewis Libby Jr. was Vice President Dick Cheney’s top adviser before
Mr. Libby [was convicted
in 2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/washington/07libby.html) of
four felony counts, including perjury and obstruction of justice, in
connection with the disclosure of the identity of a C.I.A. officer,
Valerie Plame.

Mr. Libby had maintained his innocence for years, and his portrayal as a
victim of an unfair prosecution ultimately found favor with Mr. Trump.

“I don’t know Mr. Libby,” Mr. Trump said in a statement, “but for years
I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full
pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.”

## Clint Lorance, Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher

Mr. Trump’s decision to clear three members of the armed services who
had been accused or convicted of war crimes signaled that the president
intended to use his power as the ultimate arbiter of military justice.

He ordered full pardons of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant who
was serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians, and
[Maj. Mathew L.
Golsteyn](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/mathew-golsteyn-special-forces-murder-charges.html),
an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing
an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker.

The president also reversed the demotion of Chief Petty Officer [Edward
Gallagher](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/navy-seal-trident-insignia.html),
a Navy SEAL who had been [acquitted of murder
charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/navy-seal-trial-verdict.html)
but convicted of a lesser offense in a high-profile war crimes case.

All three had been championed by prominent conservatives who had
portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in
the heat and confusion of battle.

Michael R. Milken was the billionaire “[junk bond
king](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/business/29sorkin.html)” and a
well-known financier on Wall Street in the 1980s. In 1990, he [pleaded
guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/business/michael-milken-trump-opportunity-zones.html)
to securities fraud and conspiracy charges and [was sentenced to 10
years in
prison](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/22/business/the-milken-sentence-milken-gets-10-years-for-wall-st-crimes.html),
though his sentence was later reduced to two. He also agreed to pay $600
million in fines and penalties. After his release, Mr. Milken created
the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.

Mr. Milken did not have a pardon or commutation application pending at
the Justice Department’s pardons office, meaning that the president made
that decision entirely without official department input. Among those
arguing for Mr. Milken to be pardoned were Mr. Giuliani, who as the U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of New York prosecuted Mr. Milken.

Washington influence peddling. Mr. Safavian was convicted of obstruction
of justice and making false statements.

“Having served time in prison and completed the process of rejoining

identify problems with the criminal justice system and work to fix
them,” the White House said in the statement announcing his pardon.

re-entry outcomes for people returning to their communities upon release
from
prison.”
