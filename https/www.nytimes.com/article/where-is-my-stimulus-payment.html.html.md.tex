Tens of millions of people have already received their payments, but if
you haven't, these are the things you should check on.

It's been weeks since people started getting
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html}{coronavirus
relief payments}. You've checked and rechecked your eligibility, just to
be sure.

But still, no \$1,200
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/politics/mnuchin-congress-stimulus.html}{stimulus
payment} has arrived in your bank account or mailbox. Perhaps \$3,400 is
riding on this for you, your spouse and your two children, for whom
you're supposed to get \$500 each.

Tens of millions of people have already received their payments, but
many others are still waiting or wondering. There are a lot of reasons
you could be among them, even if the government has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/business/coronavirus-stimulus-social-security.html}{removed
some of the hurdles} it initially set up.

So what do you do if yours hasn't arrived?

\subsection{Try the I.R.S. tool again.}\label{try-the-irs-tool-again}}

A couple of weeks ago, the I.R.S. introduced its
\href{https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment}{Get My Payment}
tool to help people figure out when and how their money might be
arriving. The unveiling didn't go so well: Many users did not realize
how picky the site was about, say, entering an address that precisely
matched the one on their most recent tax return.

Also, there were lots of confusing messages indicating that there was no
information available at all. Things have improved some since then, and
the I.R.S. is updating the information once each day, usually in the
middle of the night.

You may need information from recent tax returns at the ready to use the
tool, and it doesn't work for recipients of Supplemental Security Income
and Veterans Affairs benefits.

\hypertarget{make-sure-youve-filed-the-right-paperwork}{%
\subsection{Make sure you've filed the right
paperwork.}\label{make-sure-youve-filed-the-right-paperwork}}

People who don't usually file a tax return should give the I.R.S. an
assist.

If you haven't had to file a return because your gross income did not
exceed \$12,200 (\$24,400 for married couples), you still qualify for a
payment. But if you're not a recipient of S.S.I. or V.A. benefits, you
should fill out
\href{https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here}{a
special form for non-filers}.

The government is also crosschecking all the Social Security and V.A.
databases and issuing payments to those recipients for whom it does have
bank account or similar information, but that process can add time.

But May 5 is an important deadline: S.S.I. and V.A. beneficiaries who
didn't have to file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 and have children 16 or
under should register online with the I.R.S. non-filer tool to get the
\$500 per child payment
\href{https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/va-ssi-recipients-with-eligible-children-need-to-act-by-tuesday-may-5-to-quickly-add-money-to-their-automatic-economic-impact-payment-plus-500-push-continues}{more

\subsection{Don't (necessarily) panic if the payment went to a strange
account.}\label{dont-necessarily-panic-if-the-payment-went-to-a-strange-account}}

One known quagmire: If you filed taxes in 2018 or 2019 with the help of
a third-party company, you may have taken advantage of something called
a refund anticipation loan. The company may have set you up with a
temporary account to process the loan and give you access to that money.

The bank information the I.R.S. has for you may be for that account,
which may be closed at this point. That means that when the I.R.S. tries
to deposit the stimulus money there, the process will break down.

At that point, the I.R.S. is supposed to send a paper check to the
address on the most recent tax return, or one on file with the U.S.
Postal Service.

You should be able to track this whole messy process using the Get My
Payment service, but it could take several more weeks to get your
payment.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

A lot of money is flowing right now, so people will indeed try to steal
it. The I.R.S. knows this, so 15 days after it issues your payment, it
is supposed to send confirmation letters to the most recent address it
has on file for you.

That letter should explain exactly how the I.R.S. made the payment. If
you haven't received the money yet, that's the time to worry about
whether someone else took it. The letter will contain contact
information for the I.R.S. if you need help.

\hypertarget{speed-up-delivery-this-way}{%
\subsection{Speed up delivery this
way.}\label{speed-up-delivery-this-way}}

For any number of reasons, the I.R.S. may not have up-to-date
information --- or any at all --- about your address or bank account.
For instance, plenty of people don't trust the I.R.S. with their
checking account information for direct deposits or payments. Instead,
they pay tax bills with paper checks and collect refunds that way, too.

If you're in that category but are willing to change your approach, you
may be able to get your payment more quickly. If the government hasn't
already started the process of sending you a paper check, it may still
be possible to enter your checking account information via the
\href{https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment}{Get My Payment
tool} to get your money more quickly.

\hypertarget{check-your-eligibility-again}{%
\subsection{Check your eligibility
again.}\label{check-your-eligibility-again}}

People with higher incomes
\href{https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center\#eligibility}{might
not get a payment}. The \$1,200 payment decreases until it stops
altogether for a single person earning \$99,000 or a married couple who
have no dependent children, file their taxes jointly and earn \$198,000.
And if someone else claimed you as a dependent, you don't get a check.

\hypertarget{check-with-the-irs-for-more-information}{%
\subsection{Check with the I.R.S. for more

The agency got off to a pretty slow start in explaining how things would
work, but it has now answered 38 questions in its
\href{https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center}{F.A.Q.}
It has also published a
\href{https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-to-use-the-tools-on-irsgov-to-get-your-economic-impact-payment}{chart}
to help you figure out what, if any, additional information you may need
to hand over to receive a payment or get one more quickly.
