  Study

  In the view of some American diplomats, Mr. Johnson's willingness to
  carry out President Trump's request to seek the British government's
  help in moving the British Open to his golf resort in Scotland was
  only the latest example of the envoy's poor judgment.

  Woody Johnson, the N.F.L. owner, Trump donor and ambassador to
  Britain, was warned not to get involved in trying to move the
  tournament to a Trump resort in Scotland, but he raised the idea
  anyway --- and he failed.
