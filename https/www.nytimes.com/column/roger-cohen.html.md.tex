Roger Cohen joined The New York Times in 1990. He was a foreign
correspondent for more than a decade before becoming acting foreign
editor on Sept. 11, 2001, and foreign editor six months later.

Since 2004, he has written a column for The International New York
Times, formerly known as The International Herald Tribune. In 2009 he
was named a columnist of The New York Times. His columns appear every
Wednesday and Saturday.

Mr. Cohen has written ``Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo,'' an
account of the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction, and ``Soldiers and
Slaves: American POWs Trapped by the Nazis' Final Gamble.'' He has also
co-written a biography of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, ``In the Eye of
the Storm.'' His family memoir, ``The Girl From Human Street: Ghosts of
Memory in a Jewish Family,'' was published in January 2015. Raised in
South Africa and England, he is a naturalized American. Follow him on
