Would you like to improve your mental flexibility, learn a few
interesting things every day and establish bragging rights among your
friends? Solving crossword puzzles is like mental yoga — both
challenging and relaxing at the same time. Plus, it’s fun, especially if
you appreciate words and wordplay as much as I do. I believe that with
patience and practice anyone can learn to solve crosswords. Once you
master a few basic strategies, you’ll find that puzzle-solving is not
only possible, but highly addictive. So let’s get solving\!

> “Solving crosswords eliminates worries. They make you a calmer and
> more focused person.”  – Will Shortz, New York Times crossword editor
> and NPR puzzle master.

If you’ve ever picked up a crossword puzzle and said to yourself, “I am
not smart enough” or “I don’t have a big enough vocabulary for this,”
please allow us to let you in on a little secret:  

> *A crossword puzzle is not a test of intelligence, and solving is not
> really about the size of your vocabulary. Becoming a good solver is
> about understanding what the clues are asking you to do.*

You can absolutely learn to do that. We’re here to let you in on some of
the rules that most clues follow, and to teach you how to read those
clues so that they become easier to solve. It would be impossible to
cover every instance of clueing, but we can get you up and running.  

We’ve even included some tips and encouragement from the puzzle pros to
help keep you motivated, like our very funny friend, Megan Amram, a
writer for television shows like “The Simpsons” and “The Good Place.”
Ms. Amram is a devoted solver and has also [<span class="underline">made
a
puzzle</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2016/06/23)that
ran in The New York Times.

> *“I understand how intimidating starting the crossword can be, but the
> bottom line is, believe in yourself. YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DO THE
> PUZZLE. Look at me. I do The New York Times crossword puzzle every
> day, and I once tried to shoot a basket on the wrong hoop when I was
> on my 6th grade basketball team. Crossword puzzles are not about
> intelligence, they are about keeping your mind nimble and knowing what
> the sneaky trickster Will Shortz is asking of you. Show Will Shortz
> who's boss by attempting the puzzle\!”* —
> [<span class="underline">Megan
> Amram</span>](https://twitter.com/meganamram)

Got it? Now let’s get started.

First, decide how you want to solve: Are you a print-only person? Do you
enjoy the extra help that comes from [playing on the
web](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) or [on-the-go with the
app](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/apps)? If you subscribe, you get
access to all the daily puzzles and the archive.  And once you log in,
you can save your progress across all the digital platforms.

### Start With the Monday Puzzles

<div class="media-asset-layout-bottom">

<div class="media-copy">

The Monday New York Times Crosswords are the easiest, and the puzzles
get harder as the week goes on. Solve as many of the Mondays as you can
before pushing yourself to Tuesday puzzles. You can thank us later.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.You know what
it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for
something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his
ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your
officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and
turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

**The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week.**
Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the
hardest, or involve the most wordplay. Contrary to popular belief, the
Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. They’re just
bigger.

directly to the answer. Don’t believe

<div class="text-container">

<div>

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference
between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword
entry. 

**The Monday Clue:** *“Nabisco cookie,” “Cookie with creme filling” or
“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”*

**The Saturday Clue:** *“Snack since 1912,” “It has 12 flowers on each
side” or “Sandwich often given a twist”*

The answer to all of these clues is the same: “OREO.” Those delicious
sandwich cookies are so popular in crossword puzzles that they’ve been
dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword.

But we weren’t kidding you. There is a *big* difference between a Monday
puzzle clue and a Saturday puzzle one. Late-week clues might require
more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats.

If you’re just getting started, **make your life easy and solve as many
Monday puzzles as you can**. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a
challenge, and that’s when you move on to the Tuesday puzzles.

### Practice Makes, If Not Perfect, a Much Better Solver

<div class="text-container">

<div>

Once you’ve learned some of the shorter answers and how they are clued,
you can almost be sure you’ll see them again. The brain works in weird
and wonderful ways, and when you start solving crosswords consistently,
you will feel really good when you can say, “Hey, I know that one\!”

> “Do more puzzles. The more you solve, the better you’ll get. It’s also
> useful to read
> [<span class="underline">Wordplay</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/column/wordplay)
> and other puzzle blogs, which helped me internalize the tricks and
> tropes of crossword clues while I was learning the ropes.”  -- *Dan
> Feyer, seven-time champion of the* [<span class="underline">*American
> Crossword Puzzle
> Tournament*</span>](http://www.crosswordtournament.com/)

And don’t worry if you make a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. That’s
what erasers and the backspace key are for. It even happens to advanced
solvers, so don’t let it get you down if you don’t know something or
need to change an answer. 

> “Try to solve as much as you can in each puzzle, and don't stress when
> you can't finish one. For the ones you don’t know, if it's something
> way out of your knowledge comfort zone, look it up and read a bit more
> about it. It's fun, really\! There is no shame in missing an answer or
> not finishing the puzzle. The key is learning what you missed. The
> more puzzles you solve, the easier it gets.” — *Howard Barkin, 2016
> champion of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament*

### Find Your ‘Gimmes’

<div class="text-container">

<div>

When you start a puzzle, get comfortable, pour yourself a glass of your
favorite beverage — it’s important to stay hydrated — and then scan the
clue list before solving. 

**Pick out the clues that are meant to be the easiest** **and tackle
them first.** See anything you definitely know? Those are your ‘gimmes.’
Are there any fill-in-the-blanks clues? Those are usually the easiest. 

Trust us: There’s no better boost to your solving ego than to be able to
fill in a few entries right off the bat.

You already know more than you think you do. To borrow a sports term, a
puzzle or individual clue on topics that you know well is said to be “in
your wheelhouse.” You’ll be able to find at least a few entries in each
puzzle that you know.

> “Good crosswords connect to everything in life.” *– Will Shortz*

Fill-in-the-blank clues tend to be easier because they have definite
answers. 

Don’t believe us? Try these clues that are designed to be easy for most
people:

1\. Clue: **“Winnie-the-\_\_\_” **

*Your brain knows the answer to this: It’s POOH, the “hunny”-loving bear
from the stories by A. A. Milne*

Easy clues don’t even have to be fill-in-the-blanks. Your brain will
fill them in even when there is no blank.

2\. Clue: **“Actor Brad of ‘12 Years a Slave’”**

*Somewhere in your travels, your brain must have noticed that actor Brad
PITT was in the award-winning movie “12 Years a Slave.”*

Once you have a few answers in the puzzle, sit back and congratulate
yourself. You’re solving\!

### Use the Crossings, Luke

<div class="media-copy">

**Tip:** You can confirm whether an answer is right by solving the
entries that cross it.

Let’s look at an example of why it pays to work those crossings. You
might not see this in a Monday puzzle, but say the clue is “Black
Halloween animal,” and you have confidently written in “CAT.” 

Then you look at the entry that crosses the first letter of CAT and the
clue is “Honest \_\_\_ (presidential moniker).” The answer to that one
is ABE, so CAT must be wrong. 

Now what do you do?

Stay flexible and remember that a BAT is *also* a “black Halloween
animal.” Yes, it’s tricky, but it’s doable. 

Conversely, you can also work your way through an answer that you can’t
get completely by solving the crossings. Once you have enough letters
filled in, take your best guess based on the pattern of letters you’ve
uncovered.

### It’s Not Cheating, It’s Learning

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Tip:** Don’t be afraid to look up answers. You’ll become a better
solver for it.

Let me say something that may be controversial, but it needs to be said:
It’s O.K. to look something up when solving a crossword. 

Crosswords are ultimately learning tools, whether you’re learning some
trivia or an interesting new word or phrase. When you look something up,
you’re learning so you’ll know it for next time. 

Of course, some solvers may tell you that looking up the answer to a
clue is “cheating,” but to us, that way lies frustration and a path to
giving up. And that’s no fun. Crosswords are a game, and games are
supposed to be fun. 

Still not sure looking things up is fair? Here is outright permission:

### Take a Break if You Get Stuck

<div class="text-container">

<div>

We’re big fans of the brain here, especially its incredible work ethic.
But even brains get tired, so if you are stuck at some point in the
puzzle, one of the best things you can do is put it down and take a
break from it for a while. 

I’m not sure how this works, but your brain will continue working on the
clue in the background while you go about your day. When you come back
to it, you might be surprised at the “Aha\!” moment you experience when
you thought you didn’t know the answer.

### Solve With a Friend

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Tip:** Solving with another person can work to your advantage. 

Your wheelhouse might be stuffed with
[<span class="underline">sports</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/01/crosswords/CROSSWORDS-baseball-terms.html)
[<span class="underline">trivia</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/19/crosswords/CROSSWORDS-sports-names.html).
Your BFF’s wheelhouse might be crammed to the rafters with a deep
knowledge of
[<span class="underline">opera</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/19/crosswords/CROSSWORDS-operas.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fwordplay).
*Vive la différence*, right?

You know things your friend doesn’t know, and he or she knows things
that you don’t know. That’s roughly twice as much stuff that you can
solve, and it’s a good excuse to spend time together. 

In fact, you never know when it could lead to something more, [like a
marriage proposal. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73EDetVQzCs)

But don’t limit yourself. Try to master the skills you need to get

Some good news about crossword puzzles: A clue and answer pairing will
always be fair, even if it takes solvers a while to see it. And who
doesn’t *love* being set up to win, even if it’s after a mental
tug-of-war?

But how *are* you supposed to win? How are you supposed to beat your
braggart of an officemate in a solving race? **The key is to learn some
easy-to-remember ways to read those devilish crossword clues**. 

To keep things fair between constructor, editor and solver, most
crossword clues follow certain predictable “rules.” **** We’re going to
let you in on some of those rules and, if you practice using the Minis
that are included in this guide, you will get a lot further in your
solving.

    **If a clue is in a certain tense (such as past tense), then the
    answer has to be in that tense as well.** This is an easy rule to
    start with that will immediately improve your solving. For example,
    if you see the past tense clue “Adored” in a puzzle, the answer has
    to be past tense. So if the answer is a form of the word “love,” the
    answer would not be LOVE, LOVES or LOVING. It would be LOVED,
    because that’s the past tense form.
    
    Give your new knowledge a try with this mini. Some clues and answers
    will be present tense, some will be past tense. Just remember to
    make sure that the tenses of each clue and its answer match. We
    won’t spoil the answer, but as an example, note that the clue for
    1-Across is in present tense and the clue for 5-Across is in past
    tense. Read the clues

    clue is primarily a verb, the answer must be a verb. And so on.
    
    Take the word BOOK, for example. BOOK can be *both* a noun and a
    verb, so you may see a noun clue or a verb clue for the word. The
    answer will be the same, but how you get there will be very

    What would be the answer for these two clues?
    
    “Library unit”
    
    “Make reservations”
    
    In both cases, the answer would be BOOK. But the first would lead to
    the *noun* BOOK, that bound object with pages, while the second clue
    is for the *verb* BOOK, because “Make reservations” is a verb
    clue.

    **If a clue is plural, the answer has to be plural.** 
    
    There are a few different ways you might see plural answers clued:
    
      - The plural noun answer GRAPES might be clued “They might be
        sour.” “They” indicates the plural.
      - The plural noun answer STATES might be clued as “North *and*
        South Dakota,” because the “and” indicates more than one state.
    
      
    
    **Tip**: If you are struggling with an answer that has a plural
    clue, you can make yourself feel like you’ve at least got a grip on
    it by dropping the letter “S” in at the end. Then, come back when
    you have enough letters filled in from the crossings to solve the
    rest of the

    No surprise here. **If you see a foreign language clue, expect a
    foreign language answer. **
    
    If there is a non-English word or phrase in the crossword, the clue
    will signal it by either including a word or phrase in the same
    language, or by connecting the answer to a place where that language
    is spoken or a person who might speak it. For the most part, foreign
    words or phrases included in puzzles they are very common words that
    most people will know, providing they paid attention in their high
    school language classes.
    
    For example, the Spanish word ESTA, which means “this” or “it is,”
    might be clued early in the week as “It is, en español.” Don’t
    worry, the answer is in your brain somewhere. And remember: If you
    need to, take a break and come back to the puzzle. And work those
    crossings.
    
    You might also see ESTA clued as “It is, in Ibiza” or “This, in
    Tijuana.”
    
    A tantalizing glimpse at the late week wordplay you can look forward
    to when you push past the Mondays: If the entry was in a deviously
    tricky late-week puzzle, you might see the clue: “What this is in
    Spain.” 
    
    And no, the puzzle constructors and editors don’t hate you. They
    just want you to stretch your mind a
    bit.

    **A partner clue wants you to come up with a word that is typically
    partnered with another word, separated by the word “and.” **
    
    An example of this would be the clue, “Partner of live” for which
    the answer would be LEARN, because the popular phrase is “Live and
    learn.” Occasionally, the word “and” is not needed as a separator,
    as in the clue “Partner of neither,” for the answer NOR, because
    “neither” and “nor” are partnered in sentences.
    
    So let your mind wander and try to think of possible partners for
    the word in the clue. If you need to come up with an answer for the
    clue “Partner of sciences,” for example, the answer would be either
    “Sciences and \_\_\_” or “\_\_\_ and sciences.” In this case, the
    answer is ARTS, for “arts and
    sciences.”

another without having to stop.

The real fun and challenge of crossword solving lies in cracking the
really tough clues.

From being duped by magic tricks to pondering those brain-twisting
crossword clues, why do humans [so love being
fooled?](https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/fool-for-being-fooled/)
Is it the rush of the “Aha\!” moment, when their expectations are
defied?

Of course, some solvers say simply that figuring out a really tricky
clue makes them feel smart. And there is nothing wrong with that,
especially when you’re learning how to decipher them. 

Here are some more clue types to conquer:

    **Tip:** A question mark at the end of a clue means that it should
    not be taken at face value. The answer is likely to be a pun, a
    misdirection, or some other type of wordplay. Ask yourself if the
    words in the clues might have different meanings from the ones you
    think they do.
    
    These are the forehead slappers of crossword clues. The puzzle maker
    and the editor are playing around with words and phrases in a clue
    like this, so free your mind up and think about other ways the words
    in the clues might be used. *Question everything.*
    
    Solvers will often see a “?” in clues that are part of a crossword
    theme involving wordplay, but any clue involving wordplay could
    conceivably have a “?” A clue might receive a “?” depending on on
    how “stretchy” it is — that is, how far a clue is from being
    factually true. It may also depend on which day of the week the clue
    appears: Early week puzzles might get a “?” to help you, whereas
    later week clues might not.
    
    But the most important thing to remember is that this is when it
    really gets fun. So it’s worth it to practice.
    
    Here are two examples:
    
      - **“Fitness center?”** On the surface, this clue sounds like it’s
        asking for a GYM, since a gym is also known as a fitness center.
        But what if we told you that the answer is a four-letter word?
        Can you think of any other way the words in the clues can be
        used?
    
      
    
    *When you are trying to stay fit, it’s important to work the center
    of your body, or your CORE. *
    
      - **“Current events?”** Here’s another clue that misdirects you
        from a popular phrase to something totally different. On the
        surface, you might think that the clue is asking you about the
        current events you read about in the newspaper, but think: What
        *other* kinds of currents do you know? The answer is five
        letters long. 
    
      
    
    *The answer is TIDES, because they are events that involve currents
    in the sea. *
    
    Sneaky? Maybe. But we promise you’ll learn to love this, and the
    more you practice solving, the easier it will be to spot these
    delicious opportunities to play with words and
    language.

    **Tip:** The New York Times Crossword speaks to all ages. It pays to
    learn both older and more modern slang and vernacular. And you will
    certainly learn it if you solve the crossword, dawg.
    
    Language is a living, evolving thing, and the entries in the
    crossword tend to reflect that. Therein lies a challenge: Older
    solvers have to keep up with our changing language and younger
    solvers have to learn words that might have fallen out of favor long
    before they were born.
    
    People who have not yet learned to enjoy The New York Times
    Crossword tend to believe that it is a stodgy pursuit for older
    people, but the truth is, there are both modern and retro references
    in almost every puzzle. So while you might see the words MASHER
    (slang for a man who makes often unwelcome advances to women) and
    MOOLA (slang for money), you will also see BAE (slang for a
    boyfriend or girlfriend) and BROMANCE (slang for a close, platonic
    friendship between two
    men).

    **Tip:** Clues in quotes and brackets will make it seem like your
    puzzle is talking to you. It’s only a problem if you answer.
    
    A clue that is in quotes can be the title of a song, a movie or a
    book. But it can also mean something else: A clue in quotes that is
    something someone might say out loud has an answer that is a synonym
    for that verbalization. Here are a few examples of clues with
    possible answers:
    
      - **“Stop\!”:** HALT, ENOUGH, HOLD IT, FREEZE
      - **“That’s the way the cookie crumbles”:** C’EST LA VIE
      - **“I goofed\!”:** MY BAD
    
      
    
    You might also see clues in brackets. A clue in brackets suggests an
    answer that might be nonverbal: 
    
      - **\[That’s painful\]:** GRIMACE
      - **\[I don’t care\]:** SHRUG
      - **\[\!\!\!\!\]:** I’M

    **Tip:** Watch out for one of the most devious cluing traps in
    crosswords: Hiding a proper name at the beginning of a clue.
    
    Talk about tough cluing. This type of clue requires careful reading.
    
    When the crossword constructor and the editors are feeling
    particularly diabolical, you might see an innocent-looking clue like
    this for a three letter entry:
    
    **“Brave opponent”**
    
    Hey, someone is calling their adversary “brave.” That’s nice. On the
    surface, this clue looks like a compliment, doesn’t it? 
    
    Not this time. The answer to that clue is RED. Depending on the
    puzzle, it might also be MET.
    
    We know. That makes no sense at first glance, but don’t give up.
    There’s logic behind this, we promise.
    
    Let’s take a closer look at the clue: The word “Brave” has a capital
    B because it is at the beginning of the clue, but that is *not the
    only reason it’s capitalized*. It has a capital B because it *also*
    happens to be the name of a professional baseball player, an Atlanta
    Brave. The puzzle maker and the editors put it at the beginning of
    the clue to capitalize on (sorry), or take advantage of, the capital
    letter.
    
    And a three letter “Brave opponent,” or an opponent of an Atlanta
    Brave, could be a Cincinnati RED. It might also be a New York MET.
    
    As we said, there may be a lot of forehead slapping as you get into
    the late week puzzles, but hang in there. We promise you’ll start to
    enjoy the lengths to which the puzzle makers and editors go to twist
    your
    brain.

### Rebuses

<div class="media-copy">

  

**Tip:** When you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of
your expected answers fit, it probably has a rebus element.

Solvers either love rebuses or they hate them. 

A rebus element can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a
word, but in many crosswords, **the rebus will be a word or group of
letters that need to be written inside** **a single square***.* Many
solvers ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in a
puzzle, and the answer is no, that’s part of the fun of solving. It’s
also frustrating if you don’t figure out what’s going on. (That’s also
why rebuses are generally reserved for Thursday and Sunday puzzles, says
Joel Fagliano, the digital puzzles editor.)

Let’s say you see a clue that reads “Do-it-yourselfer's activity,” and
the allotted space you are given for the answer is eight squares. Maybe
you guessed right off the bat (or you used those crossings\!) that the
answer is HOME REPAIR. But HOME REPAIR would need 10 squares. 

So, start to consider the theme of the puzzle. If you tighten your belt
and squeeze multiple letters into a single square, you’ll end up with
the word “air” in one square. This puzzle maker made the word AIR a
rebus element in eight squares, where the rebus worked for both the
Across and Down clues.

<div class="media-asset-layout-top">

<div class="media-asset">

<div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="media-copy">

And what was the purpose of squeezing AIR into one square? To make
“compressed AIR,” of course. Now that’s a nice Thursday theme.

Part of the fun is determining where in the entry the rebus belongs.
You’ll really need to work the crossings to figure that out. If you
are solving in print, of course, filling in the rebus will simply be a
matter of writing small. 

If you are solving online or in one of our apps, however,

### Clues That Use Heteronyms

<div class="media-asset-layout-bottom">

<div class="media-copy">

  

**Tip:** We’ve saved the most confounding type of clue for last. Some
clues use heteronyms to misdirect you. (We swear this is fun.) 

Heteronyms are two or more words that are spelled identically but have
different pronunciations and meanings, like “minute” (*MIN-it*), which
is a unit of time, and “minute” (*my-NOOT*), which might mean tiny. 

Imagine how much that unique facet of language enthralls our puzzle
makers and editors. And they use it to their advantage.This might not
seem completely fair, but if you’ve been learning the tricks to
understanding the clues in the rest of this guide, it’s well within the
bounds of fairness. You just have to learn to think like a constructor.

How about a short quiz to help you figure this out? Here are some
particularly sneaky heteronym examples and the number of letters in
their answers. We’d like you to guess those answers. You might want to
spend some time staring at them until the heteronym reveals itself. 

Remember, question *everything*. Don’t allow any word to go unexamined.

**Heteronym Clues** 

1.  “Minute, to a tot” (4 letters)
2.  “Nice one” (3 letters)
3.  “Light shower” (5 letters)
4.  “Polish person” (5 letters)
5.  “Refuse work?” (4, 3 letters)
6.  “Kitchen drawer?” (5 letters)
7.  “Begin at the beginning?” (8 letters)
8.  “Knockout number?” (5 letters)
9.  “One of them does?” (4 letters)
10. “Moving supply” (5 letters)  *(This one is Will Shortz’s favorite.
    He says it fooled everyone\!)*

Are you getting the hang of this yet? These are not easy, but keep
staring, because that “Aha\!” moment is really worth it.

<div class="section 6419070417108992 text">

<div class="text-container">

<div>

Still stuck? Here are the answers with the reasoning behind them:

**Answers** 

1.  **ITTY**: In this case, as in the example above, the word “minute”
    (pronounced ‘MIN-it’) is not meant to be a unit of time. It is the
    “minute” (‘my-NOOT’) meant to mean “small,” and a tot might use
    the word ITTY.
2.  **UNE**: “Nice one” is a familiar phrase, but instead of the word
    “nice” meaning “good,” this “Nice” is capitalized because it is
    really the city in France. And the article “one” in French is the
    word UNE.
3.  **PRISM**:  Yes, we know. Bear with us. Typically, a “Light shower”
    would be a mild rainstorm. In this case, the word “shower” is not
    pronounced using the “ow” sound. It’s pronounced using the “oh”
    sound, as in something that shows light. And that would be a PRISM.
4.  **WAXER**: Not “Polish” as in someone from Poland.” “Polish” as in
    someone who buffs things.
5.  **JUNK ART**: To “Refuse work” *could* mean to turn down a job. Or,
    it could mean working with refuse or garbage, which means that one
    is creating JUNK ART.
6.  **AROMA**: Everyone knows what a “Kitchen drawer” is, right? It’s
    that thing you keep your utensils in. Except when it’s something
    that lures people — or draws them — into the kitchen. And that
    “drawer” would be an AROMA.
7.  **MENACHEM**: Remember when we talked about capitalized words at the
    beginnings of clues? “Begin at the beginning” is a common idiom, but
    in this clue the word “Begin” doesn’t mean to start; it refers to
    the former prime minister of Israel, MENACHEM Begin. “ … at the
    beginning” is an indicator that the clue is looking for what goes
    *before* “Begin.”
8.  **ETHER**: On the surface, a “Knockout number” might be a really
    dazzling song and dance number. But there are other ways of knocking
    someone out and there are other meanings to the word “number,” even
    if they are diabolical. In this case, we are knocking someone out
    and numbing them with the use of the gas ETHER.
9.  **DEER**: “One of them does?” sounds like a statement about
    compliance. But when pronounced with a long “O,” the word “does” in
    this clue is actually the word for female DEER.
10. **LITHE**: How long did you stare at the word “supply” before you
    got it? Not to worry, it took us a long time, too. A “Moving supply”
    (pronounced suh-PLY) could be a box, but we need a five letter word.
    What if we freed our minds up and thought about the word “supply” in
    a different way? Could it be ‘SUP-lee’ as in a “supple” move? Sure
    it could. To move supply is to be LITHE.

There is so much more to a crossword puzzle than just a list of clues
and space for you to write in the answers. We want you to be able to
wring every drop of enjoyment out of your puzzle. That’s one reason you
should know about crossword themes. A crossword theme is like bonus
content; it is an extra puzzle-within-the-puzzle for you to solve. 

Not all crosswords have themes, but for those that do, finding them will
help you be a better solver. That’s another good reason to know about
them.

<div class="section 6327735924293632 text">

### What Is a Theme?

<div class="text-container">

<div>

Some crosswords contain a set of entries that all have something in
common. Puzzle makers have a knack for spotting oddities in our
language, and when they can put enough of the same kind of oddity
together, they have developed a theme set. As the solver, you not only
get to do the crossword puzzle, you also get to piece together the
theme. 

The number of types of themes you might see in crosswords is nearly
infinite, so we can’t describe them here. But most commonly they involve
playing with words.

They can use puns, anagrams, hidden words, common elements, letters
added to familiar phrases to make new phrases, and much more. Some
puzzle themes have visual themes. Be on the lookout for these, because
they can be amazing.

### Why Is There a Theme?

<div class="text-container">

<div>

A theme is an extra bit of entertainment that can also be a solving
aid. 

Once you understand the theme and can guess what the other theme entries
might be, you will have a leg up on solving the rest of the puzzle.
Think of it as the frame of a house; **the crossword’s theme is the
basis on which the rest of the puzzle is built.**

### Where is There a Theme?

<div class="media-asset-layout-bottom">

<div class="media-copy">

Themes can be placed anywhere in the crossword grid, depending on the
creativity of the puzzle constructor. But most commonly it will be in
the longest Across and Down entries.

Let’s look at one type of easy theme you might see in a Monday puzzle.

</div>

<div class="media-asset">

</div>

</div>

<div class="row list-item list-item-text">

<div class="text-container">

<div>

The entries **BOULDER** DAM, **ROCK** LOBSTER, **PEBBLE** BEACH and
**DUST** JACKET all involve some sort of stone — and the size of the
stone **(BOULDER → ROCK → PEBBLE → DUST)** gets smaller as you go from
the top of the grid to the bottom. Below is how these answers were clued
in this puzzle. The theme clues are pretty straightforward — fittingly
for a Monday puzzle — although the clue for DUST JACKET is playing with
us. Even so, it’s not that hard, especially if you work the crossings. 

  - **BOULDER** DAM: “Colorado River landmark dedicated by F.D.R.”
  - **ROCK** LOBSTER: “Novelty B-52's song with the lyric ‘Watch out for
    that piranha”
  - **PEBBLE** BEACH: “California locale of several golf U.S. Opens”
  - **DUST** JACKET: “One covering a big story?”

Most solvers don’t fill in a theme entry without first solving some of
the crossings, so don’t worry if you don’t know them right off the bat.
But do notice that these particular entries cover a range of topics:
Topography, pop culture, sports and, well, a pun about book covers.
There’s something for nearly everyone.

<div class="section 5175207622868992 media">

<div class="media-copy">

Some themes change part of a familiar word or phrase to make a pun.
Here’s one that changes an ‘S’ to an ‘SH’ at the start of the second
word of a familiar phrase to turn it into something completely
different: At 17-Across, for example, BEST SELLER becomes BEST SHELLER.
Three more long Across answers work similarly.

In this puzzle, the theme entries were clued to make you think. They
describe the punny phrase, not the one it’s based on, so it’s up to you
to figure that out. Here’s how this puzzled was clued:

  - BEST **SHELLER**: “Winner of a pea-preparing contest?” (Original
    phrase: BEST SELLER)
  - PICK UP **SHTICKS**: “Lotharios' lines in a singles bar?” (Original
    phrase: PICK UP STICKS)
  - ALL DAY **SHUCKER**: “One preparing corn for long hours?” (Original
    phrase: ALL DAY SUCKER)
  - MARRY IN **SHAM**: “Phony wedding?” (Original phrase: MARRYIN’ SAM)

Now imagine opening your Sunday New York Times Magazine to the crossword
and seeing a museum come to life. Here’s a Sunday puzzle from 2009 that
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in
New York City:

</div>

<div class="row list-item list-item-text">

<div class="section 5144470253207552 text">

<div class="text-container">

<div>

In this puzzle, the black squares imitate the spiral shape of the halls
of the Guggenheim Museum, and works of art that hang in the museum can
be found throughout the puzzle by artist name, along with the name of
the museum and other bonus theme content.

The Times has even run puzzles where solvers had to write the theme
*outside* the grid. Talk about thinking outside the box\! If you’re
feeling daring, [<span class="underline">you can try one of those
here</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2006/04/01). 

There is so much wonderful variety in New York Times crossword themes.
These examples are just to get you started, but once you dive in and
start solving, prepare to be surprised by the incredible creativity of
the puzzle makers.
