By making a few simple changes to your devices and accounts, you can
maintain security against outside parties’ unwanted attempts to access
your data as well as protect your privacy from those you don’t consent
to sharing your information with. Getting started is easy. Here’s a
guide to the few simple changes you can make to protect yourself and
your information online.

### Secure your accounts

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** In the past decade, data breaches and password leaks have
struck companies such as
[<span class="underline">Equifax</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/your-money/equifax-data-breach-credit.html#first),
[<span class="underline">Facebook</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/technology/personaltech/facebook-passwords.html),
[<span class="underline">Home
Depot</span>](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/home-depot-confirms-that-it-was-hacked/),
[<span class="underline">Marriott</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/marriott-data-breach.html),
[<span class="underline">Target</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/business/a-sneaky-path-into-target-customers-wallets.html),
[<span class="underline">Yahoo</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html),
and countless others. If you have online accounts, hackers have likely
leaked data from at least one of them. Want to know which of your
accounts have been compromised? Search for your email address on
[<span class="underline">Have I Been
Pwned?</span>](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to cross-reference your
email address with hundreds of data breaches. 

**How:** Everyone should use a password manager to generate and remember
different, complex passwords for every account — this is the most
important thing people can do to protect their privacy and security
today. [<span class="underline">Wirecutter’s favorite password
managers</span>](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-password-managers/)
are [<span class="underline">LastPass</span>](https://www.lastpass.com/)
and [<span class="underline">1Password</span>](https://1password.com/).
Both can generate passwords, monitor accounts for security breaches,
suggest changing weak passwords, and sync your passwords between your
computer and phone. Password managers seem intimidating to set up, but
once you’ve installed one you just need to browse the Internet as usual.
As you log in to accounts, the password manager saves your passwords and
suggests changing weak or duplicate passwords. Over the course of a
couple of weeks, you end up with new passwords for most of your
accounts. Take this time to also change the default passwords for any
devices in your house — if your home router, smart light bulbs, or
security cameras are still using “password” or “1234” as the password,
change them.

Everyone should also use [<span class="underline">two-step
authentication</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/technology/personaltech/two-step-authentication.html)
whenever possible for their online accounts. Most banks and major social
networks provide this option. As the name suggests, two-step
authentication requires two steps: entering your password and entering a
number only you can access. For example, step one is logging in to
Facebook with your username and password. In step two, Facebook sends a
temporary code to you in a text message or, even better, through an app
like Google Authenticator, and you enter that code to log in.

### Protect your Web browsing

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** Companies and websites track everything you do online. Every
ad, social network button, and website collects information about your
location, browsing habits, and more. The data collected
[<span class="underline">reveals more about
you</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/technology/personaltech/stop-targeted-stalker-ads.html)
than you might expect. You might think yourself clever for never
tweeting your medical problems or sharing all your religious beliefs on
Facebook, for instance, but chances are good that the websites you visit
regularly provide all the data advertisers need to pinpoint the type of
person you are. This is part of how targeted ads remain one of the
Internet’s most unsettling innovations.

**How:** A browser extension like [<span class="underline">uBlock
Origin</span>](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) blocks ads and the
data they collect. The uBlock Origin extension also prevents malware
from running in your browser and gives you an easy way to
[<span class="underline">turn the ad blocking
off</span>](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/How-to-whitelist-a-web-site)
when you want to support sites you know are secure. Combine uBlock with
[<span class="underline">Privacy
Badger</span>](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), which blocks
trackers, and ads won’t follow you around as much. To slow down stalker
ads even more, disable interest-based ads from
[<span class="underline">Apple</span>](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074),
[<span class="underline">Facebook</span>](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217),
[<span class="underline">Google</span>](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en),
and
[<span class="underline">Twitter</span>](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/other-policy-requirements/interest-based-opt-out-policy.html).
A lot of websites offer means to opt out of data collection, but you
need to do so manually. [<span class="underline">Simple Opt
Out</span>](http://simpleoptout.com/) has direct links to opt-out
instructions for major sites like Netflix, Reddit, and more. Doing this
won’t eliminate the problem completely, but it will significantly cut
down the amount of data collected.

You should also install the [<span class="underline">HTTPS
Everywhere</span>](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq) extension.
HTTPS Everywhere automatically directs you to the secure version of a
site when the site supports that, making it difficult for an attacker —
especially if you’re on public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, airport, or hotel
— to digitally eavesdrop on what you’re doing.

Some people may want to use a virtual private network (VPN), but it’s
not necessary for everyone. If you frequently connect to public Wi-Fi, a
VPN is useful because it adds a layer of security to your browsing when
HTTPS isn’t available. It can also provide some privacy from your
Internet service provider and help minimize tracking based on your IP
address. But all your Internet activity still flows through the VPN
provider’s servers, so in using a VPN you’re choosing to trust that
company over your ISP not to store or sell your data. Make sure you
[<span class="underline">understand the pros and
cons</span>](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/what-is-a-vpn/) first,
but if you want a VPN, [<span class="underline">Wirecutter recommends
IVPN</span>](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/).

### Use antivirus software on your computer

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** Viruses might not seem as common as they were a decade ago, but
they still exist. Malicious software on your computer can wreak all
kinds of havoc, from annoying pop-ups to [<span class="underline">covert
bitcoin
mining</span>](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cryptocurrency-mining-malware-why-it-is-such-a-menace-and-where-its-going-next/)
to scanning for personal information. If you’re at risk for clicking
perilous links, or if you share a computer with multiple people in a
household, it’s worthwhile to set up antivirus software, especially on
Windows computers. 

**How:** If your computer runs Windows 10, you should use Microsoft’s
built-in software, [<span class="underline">Windows
Defender</span>](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-10-help-protect-my-device-with-windows-security).
Windows Defender offers plenty of security for most people, and it’s the
main antivirus option that [<span class="underline">Wirecutter
recommends</span>](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/best-antivirus/); we
reached that conclusion after speaking with several experts. If you run
an older version of Windows (even though we recommend updating to
Windows 10) or you use a shared computer, a second layer of protection
might be necessary. For this purpose,
[<span class="underline">Malwarebytes
Premium</span>](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) is your best bet.
Malwarebytes is unintrusive, it works well with Windows Defender, and it
doesn’t push out dozens of annoying notifications like most antivirus
utilities tend to do.

Mac users are typically okay with the protections included in macOS,
especially if you download software only from Apple’s App Store and
stick to well-known browser extensions. If you do want a second layer of
security, Malwarebytes Premium is also available for Mac. You should
avoid antivirus applications on your phone altogether and stick to
downloading trusted apps from official
stores.

### Update your software and devices

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** Phone and computer operating systems, Web browsers, popular
apps, and even smart-home devices receive frequent updates with new
features and security improvements. These security updates are typically
far better at thwarting hackers than antivirus software.

**How:** All three major operating systems can update automatically, but
you should take a moment to double-check that you have automatic updates
enabled for your OS of choice:
[<span class="underline">Windows</span>](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq),
[<span class="underline">macOS</span>](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-macos-updates-mchlpx1065/mac),
or [<span class="underline">Chrome
OS</span>](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3168106?hl=en).
Although it’s frustrating to turn your computer on and have to wait out
an update that [<span class="underline">might break the software you
use</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/technology/personaltech/automatic-update-headaches.html),
the [<span class="underline">security benefits are worth the
trouble</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/opinion/asus-malware-hack.html).
These updates include new versions of Microsoft’s Edge browser and
Apple’s Safari. Most third-party Web browsers, including Google’s
Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, also update automatically. If you tend to
leave your browser open all the time, remember to reboot it now and
again to get those updates. Your phone also has automatic-update
options. On Apple’s iPhone, enable automatic updates under *Settings \>
General \> Software Update*. On Google’s Android operating system,
security updates should happen automatically, but you can double-check
by opening up *Settings \> System \> Advanced \> System Update*.

For third-party software and apps, you may need to find and enable a
*Check for updates* option in the software’s settings. Smart-home
devices such as cameras, thermostats, and light bulbs can receive
updates to the app as well as to the hardware itself. Check the settings
using the device’s app to make sure these updates happen automatically;
if you don’t find an automatic-update option, you may have to manually
reboot the device on occasion (a monthly calendar reminder might help).

<div class="section 6321188485726208 text">

### Don’t install sketchy software

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** Every weird app you install on your phone and every browser
extension or piece of software you download from a sketchy website
represents another potential privacy and security hole. Countless mobile
apps track your [<span class="underline">location everywhere you
go</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html)
and [<span class="underline">harvest your
data</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/technology/phone-apps-stalking.html)
without asking consent, [<span class="underline">even in children’s
apps</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/technology/kids-apps-data-privacy-google-twitter.html). 

**How:** Stop downloading garbage software, and stick to downloading
programs and browser extensions directly from their makers and official
app stores. You don’t need half the apps on your phone, and
[<span class="underline">getting rid of what you don’t
need</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/smarter-living/wirecutter/declutter-speed-up-phone.html)
can make your phone feel faster. Once you clear out the apps you don’t
use, audit the privacy permissions of what’s left. If you have an
iPhone, open *Settings* and tap the *Privacy* option. On Android, head
to *Settings \> Apps*, and then tap the gear icon and select *App
Permissions*. Here, you can see which apps have
[<span class="underline">access to your
location</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/technology/prevent-location-data-sharing.html),
contacts, microphone, and other data. Disable permissions where they
don’t make sense—for example, Google Maps needs your location to
function, but your notes app doesn’t. In the future, think about app
permissions as you install new software; if an app is free, it’s
possibly collecting and selling your data.

The same rules go for your computer. If you’re not sure what to delete
from your Windows computer, [<span class="underline">Should I Remove
It?</span>](https://www.shouldiremoveit.com/) can help you choose. (Yes,
it’s more software, but you should delete it after you’re done using
it.) Mac users don’t have an equivalent, but all software resides in the
Applications folder, so it’s easy to sift through. If you find an app
you don’t remember installing, search for it on Google, and then drag it
to the trash to delete it if you don’t need it.

### Lock down your phone in case you lose it

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** You need to ensure nobody can get into your phone if you lose
it or someone steals it. Smartphones are encrypted by default, which is
great, but you still need to take a few steps to ensure your phone is
properly locked down if it disappears. 

**How:** You have two main defenses here. The first is to use a strong
passcode alongside your biometric (fingerprint or face) login. The
second is to set up your phone’s remote-tracking feature. If you haven’t
taken the first step, set up a PIN number or pattern, and enable the
biometric login on your phone. You can find these options on an iPhone
under *Settings \> Face ID & Passcode* or *Touch ID & Passcode*, and on
an Android phone under *Settings \> Security and location*.

Next, set up your phone’s remote-tracking feature. If you lose your
phone, you’ll be able to see where it is, and you can remotely delete
everything on the phone if you can’t recover it. On an iPhone, head to
*Settings*, tap your name, and then go to *iCloud \> Find My iPhone*. On
an Android phone, tap *Settings \> Security & location* and enable *Find
My Device*.

### Enable encryption on your laptop (it’s easier than it sounds)

<div class="text-container">

<div>

**Why:** If you lose your laptop or someone steals it, the thief gets
both a sweet new piece of hardware and access to your data. Even without
your password, a thief can usually still copy files off the laptop if
they know what they’re doing. If a stranger poked around your laptop,
they might get a look at all your photos, say, or your tax returns, or
maybe an unfinished bit of *Game of Thrones* fanfiction. 

**How:** When you encrypt the storage drive on your laptop, your
password and a security key protect your data; without your password or
the key, the data becomes nonsense. Although encryption might sound like
something from a high-tech spy movie, it’s simple and free to enable
with built-in software. Follow [<span class="underline">these directions
on how to set up
encryption</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/smarter-living/how-to-encrypt-your-computers-data.html)
on both Windows and Mac. 

Speaking of computer theft, if you store a lot of data on your computer,
it’s worth the effort to [<span class="underline">back it up
securely</span>](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/how-to-back-up-your-computer/).
For this purpose, [<span class="underline">Wirecutter

which [<span class="underline">encrypts all its
data</span>](https://www.backblaze.com/backup-encryption.html) in a way
that even the folks at Backblaze don’t have access to it.

### The Importance of Paranoia

<div class="text-container">

<div>

Ultimately, security and privacy are linked, so you need to get in the
habit of protecting both. It might seem like a time-consuming,
overwhelming headache, but once you follow these steps, all that’s left
is to cultivate your judgment and establish good online behaviors.

Be suspicious of links in emails and on social media. Make your accounts
private and don’t share anything you wouldn’t mind getting out anyway.
Keep your main email address and phone number relatively private. Use a
burner email account you don’t care about for shopping and other online
activities; that way, if an account is hacked, it’s not linked to an
important personal account, like that of your bank. Likewise, avoid
using your real name and number when you have to sign up for a service
you don’t care about, such as [<span class="underline">discount cards at
a grocery
store</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/technology/facebook-expands-targeted-advertising-through-outside-data-sources.html)
(your area code plus [<span class="underline">Jenny’s
number</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny) usually
gets you whatever club-card discount a retailer offers). Don’t link
together services, like Facebook and Spotify, or Twitter and Instagram,
unless you gain a useful feature from doing so. Don’t buy Internet of
Things devices unless you’re willing to give up a little privacy for
whatever convenience they provide. 

Once you settle into a low-key, distrustful paranoia about new apps and
services, you’re well on your way to avoiding many privacy-invading
practices.
