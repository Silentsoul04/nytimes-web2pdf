UPDATED Aug. 10, 2015

Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed on Aug. 9,
2014, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., a
suburb of St. Louis. The shooting prompted protests that roiled the area
for weeks. On Nov. 24, the St. Louis County prosecutor announced that a
grand jury decided not to indict Mr. Wilson. The announcement set off
another wave of protests. In March, the Justice Department called on
Ferguson to overhaul its criminal justice system, declaring that the
city had engaged in constitutional violations.
