<span class="summary-text">A violent and chaotic insurrection began
Friday night as two bridges in Istanbul were seized by military forces.
In the hours that followed, factions fought for control of government
buildings in the capital, Ankara, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
re-emerged in Istanbul. By the next day, hundreds were dead, and
thousands of military personnel were rounded up as the coup
faltered.</span> [Related

<span class="g-caption-text">Turkish soldiers blocked the Bosporus
Bridge in Istanbul around 9:30 p.m. on Friday. Seizing the bridges
immediately set social media afire, and rumors began swirling that
either the military was maneuvering to thwart a terrorist threat, or a
hijacked jetliner was in the sky. Some, though, mindful of Turkey’s
history of military interventions in politics, almost immediately began
wondering if a coup was starting.</span><span class="g-credit"> Gokhan

faction of the military had issued a statement saying it had seized
control of the country to protect
democracy.</span><span class="g-credit"> Bulent Kilic/Agence

war-torn cities in Iraq or Syria.</span><span class="g-credit"> Emrah

to be one thing that much of Turkish society could unite
behind.</span><span class="g-credit"> Associated Press
