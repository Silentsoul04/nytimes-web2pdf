<div class="g-item g-text">

On Nov. 6, 2017, at least 20 people trying to reach Europe from Libya
drowned in the Mediterranean, foundering next to a sinking raft.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Not far from the raft was a ship belonging to
[Sea-Watch](https://sea-watch.org/en/), a German humanitarian
organization. That ship had enough space on it for everyone who had been
aboard the raft. It could have brought them all to the safety of Europe,
where they might have had a chance at being granted asylum.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Instead, 20 people drowned and 47 more were captured by the Libyan Coast
Guard, which brought the migrants back to Libya, where they suffered
abuse — including rape and torture.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This confrontation at sea was not a simplistic case of Europe versus
Africa, with human rights and rescue on one side and chaos and danger on
the other. Rather it’s a case of Europe versus Europe: of volunteers
struggling to save lives being undercut by European Union policies that
outsource border control responsibilities to the Libyan Coast Guard —
with the aim of stemming arrivals on European shores.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

While funding, equipping and directing the Libyan Coast Guard, European
governments have stymied the activities of nongovernmental organizations
like Sea-Watch, criminalizing them or impounding their ships, or turning
away from ports ships carrying survivors.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

[More than 14,000
people](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean?migrant_route%5B%5D=1376)
have died or gone missing while trying to cross the central
Mediterranean since 2014. But unlike most of those deaths and drownings,
the incident on Nov. 6, 2017, was extensively documented.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Sea-Watch’s ship and rescue rafts were outfitted with nine cameras,
documenting the entire scene in video and audio. The Libyans, too,
filmed parts of the incident on their mobile phones.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The research groups Forensic Architecture and Forensic Oceanography of
Goldsmiths, University of London, of which three of us — Mr. Heller, Mr.
Pezzani and Mr. Weizman — are a part, combined these video sources with
radio recordings, vessel tracking data, witness testimonies and newly
obtained official sources to
produce[](https://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/sea-watch/)[a
minute-by-minute
reconstruction](https://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/sea-watch/)
of the facts. Opinion Video at The New York Times built on this work to
create the above short documentary, gathering further testimonials by
some of the survivors and rescuers who were there.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This investigation makes a few things clear: European governments are
avoiding their legal and moral responsibilities to protect the human
rights of people fleeing violence and economic desperation. More
worrying, the Libyan Coast Guard partners that Europe is collaborating
with are ready to blatantly violate those rights if it allows them to
prevent migrants from crossing the
sea.

## Stopping Migrants, Whatever the Cost

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

To understand the cynicism of Europe’s policies in the Mediterranean,
one must understand the legal context. According
to[](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/italy-historic-european-court-judgment-upholds-migrants-rights/)[a 2012
ruling](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/italy-historic-european-court-judgment-upholds-migrants-rights/)
by the European Court of Human Rights, migrants rescued by European
civilian or military vessels must be taken to a safe port. Because of
the chaotic political situation in Libya
and[](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/libya-shameful-eu-policies-fuel-surge-in-detention-of-migrants-and-refugees/)[well-documented
human rights
abuses](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/libya-shameful-eu-policies-fuel-surge-in-detention-of-migrants-and-refugees/)
in detention camps there, that means a European port, often in Italy or
Malta.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But when the Libyan Coast Guard intercepts migrants, even outside Libyan
territorial waters, as it did on Nov. 6, the Libyans take them back to
detention camps in Libya, which is not subject to European Court of
Human Rights jurisdiction.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

For Italy — and Europe — this is an ideal situation. Europe is able to
stop people from reaching its shores while washing its hands of any
responsibility for their safety.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This policy can be traced back to February 2017, when Italy and the
United Nations-supported Libyan Government of National Accord signed a
“[memorandum of
understanding](https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2017/02/02/news/migranti_accordo_italia-libia_ecco_cosa_contiene_in_memorandum-157464439/?refresh_ce)”
that provided a framework for collaboration on development, to fight
against “illegal immigration,” human trafficking and the smuggling of
contraband. This agreement defines clearly the aim, “to stem the illegal
migrants’ flows,” and committed Italy to provide “technical and
technological support to the Libyan institutions in charge of the fight
against illegal immigration.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Libyan Coast Guard members have been trained by the European Union, and
the Italian government donated or repaired several patrol boats and
supported the establishment of a Libyan search-and-rescue zone. Libyan
authorities have since attempted — in defiance of maritime law — to make
that zone off-limits to nongovernmental organizations’ rescue vessels.
Italian Navy ships, based in Tripoli, have coordinated Libyan Coast
Guard efforts.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Before these arrangements, Libyan actors were able to intercept and
return very few migrants leaving from Libyan shores. Now the Libyan
Coast Guard is an efficient partner, having intercepted some 20,000
people in 2017 alone.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Libyan Coast Guard is efficient when it comes to stopping migrants
from reaching Europe. It’s not as good, however, at saving their lives,
as the events of Nov. 6
show.

</div>

## A Deadly Policy in Action

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

That morning the migrant raft had encountered worsening conditions after
leaving Tripoli, Libya, over night. Someone onboard used a satellite
phone to call the Italian Coast Guard for help.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Because the Italians were required by law to alert nearby vessels of the
sinking raft, they alerted Sea-Watch to its approximate location. But
they also requested the intervention of their Libyan counterparts.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Libyan Coast Guard vessel that was sent to intervene on that
morning, the Ras Jadir, was one of several that had been repaired by
Italy and handed back to the Libyans in May of 2017. Eight of the 13
crew members onboard had received training from the European Union
anti-smuggling naval program known as Operation Sophia.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Even so, the Libyans brought the Ras Jadir next to the migrants’ raft,
rather than deploying a smaller rescue vessel, as professional rescuers
do. This offered no hope of rescuing those who had already fallen
overboard and only caused more chaos, during which at least five people
died.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

These deaths were not merely a result of a lack of professionalism. Some
of the migrants who had been brought aboard the Ras Jadir were so afraid
of their fate at the hands of the Libyans that they jumped back into the
water to try to reach the European rescuers. As can be seen in the
footage, members of the Libyan Coast Guard beat the remaining migrants.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Sea-Watch’s crew was also attacked by the Libyan Coast Guard, who
threatened them and threw hard objects at them to keep them away. This
eruption of violence was the result of a clash between the goals of
rescue and interception, with the migrants caught in the middle
desperately struggling for their lives.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Apart from those who died during this chaos, more than 15 people had
already drowned in the time spent waiting for any rescue vessel to
appear.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

There was, however, no shortage of potential rescuers in the area: A
Portuguese surveillance plane had located the migrants’ raft after its
distress call. An Italian Navy helicopter and a French frigate were
nearby and eventually offered some support during the rescue.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

It’s possible that this French ship, deployed as part of Operation
Sophia, could have reached the sinking vessel earlier, in time to save
more lives — despite our requests, this information has not been
disclosed to us. But it remained at a distance throughout the incident
and while offering some support, notably refrained from taking migrants
onboard who would then have had to have been disembarked on European
soil. It’s an example of a hands-off approach that seeks to make Libyan
intervention not only possible but also
inevitable.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-scoop-image">

the gap.</span> <span class="g-credit">Sea-Watch</span>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## A Legal Challenge

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

On the basis of the forensic reconstruction, the Global Legal Action
Network and the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration, with
the support of Yale Law School students, have filed a case against Italy
at the European Court of Human Rights representing 17 survivors of this
incident.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Those working on the suit, who include two of us — Mr. Mann and Ms.
Moreno-Lax — argue that even though Italian or European personnel did
not physically intercept the migrants and bring them back to Libya,
Italy exercised effective control over the Libyan Coast Guard through
mutual agreements, support and on-the-ground coordination. Italy has
entrusted the Libyans with a task that Rome knows full well would be
illegal if undertaken directly: preventing migrants from seeking
protection in Europe by impeding their flight and sending them back to a
country
where[](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR3089062018ENGLISH.pdf)[extreme
violence and exploitation
await](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR3089062018ENGLISH.pdf).

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

We hope this legal complaint will lead the European court to rule that
countries cannot subcontract their legal and humanitarian obligations to
dubious partners, and that if they do, they retain responsibility for
the resulting violations. Such a precedent would force the entire
European Union to make sure its cooperation with partners like Libya
does not end up denying refugees the right to seek asylum.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This case is especially important right now. In
Italy’s[](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/world/europe/italy-election.html)[elections
in
March](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/world/europe/italy-election.html),
the far-right Lega party, which campaigned on radical anti-immigrant
rhetoric, took nearly 20 percent of the vote. The party is now part of
the governing coalition, of which its leader, Matteo Salvini, is the
interior minister.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

His government has doubled down on animosity toward migrants. In June,
Italy took the drastic step
of[](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/europe/italy-migrant-boat-aquarius.html)[turning
away a humanitarian
vessel](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/europe/italy-migrant-boat-aquarius.html)
from the country’s ports and has been systematically blocking rescued
migrants from being disembarked since then, even when they had been
assisted by the Italian Coast Guard.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

[The Italian
crackdown](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR3089062018ENGLISH.pdf)
helps explain why seafarers off the Libyan coast have
[refrained](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/09/us-navy-ship-ignored-sinking-migrants-cries-for-help-say-survivors)
from assisting migrants in distress, leaving them to drift for days.
Under the new Italian government, a new batch of patrol boats has been
handed over to the Libyan Coast Guard, and the rate of migrants being
intercepted and brought back to Libya has increased. All this has made
the crossing even more dangerous than before.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Italy has been seeking to enact a practice that blatantly violates the
spirit of the Geneva Convention on refugees, which enshrines the right
to seek asylum and prohibits sending people back to countries in which
their lives are at risk. A judgment by the European Court sanctioning
Italy for this practice would help prevent the outsourcing of border
control and human rights violations that may prevent the world’s most
disempowered populations from seeking protection and dignity.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The European Court of Human Rights cannot stand alone as a guardian of
fundamental rights. Yet an insistence on its part to uphold the law
would both reflect and bolster the movements seeking solidarity with
migrants across Europe.
