Obituary writing is more about life than death: the last word, a
testament to a human contribution.

Yet who gets remembered — and how — inherently involves judgment. To
look back at the obituary archives can, therefore, be a stark lesson in
how society valued various achievements and achievers.

Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries: of
heads of state, opera singers, the
[inventor](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/23/us/ruth-m-siems-inventor-of-stuffing-dies-at-74.html)
of Stove Top stuffing and the
[namer](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/25james.html) of the
Slinky. The vast majority chronicled the lives of men, mostly white
ones.

[Charlotte
Brontë](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/obituaries/overlooked-charlotte-bronte.html)
wrote “Jane Eyre”; [Emily Warren
Roebling](https://www.nytimes.com "Emily Warren Roebling") oversaw
construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her husband fell ill;
[Madhubala](https://www.nytimes.com "Madhubala") transfixed Bollywood;
[Ida B. Wells](https://www.nytimes.com "Ida B. Wells") campaigned
against lynching. Yet all of their deaths went unremarked in our pages,
until now.

Below you’ll find obituaries for these and others who left indelible
marks but were nonetheless overlooked. We’ll be adding to this
collection each week, as Overlooked becomes a regular feature in the
[obituaries section](https://www.nytimes.com/section/obituaries), and
expanding our lens beyond women.

It was not all that unusual when, in 1892, a mob dragged Thomas Moss out
of a Memphis jail in his pajamas and shot him to death over a feud that
began with a game of marbles. But his lynching changed history because
of its effect on one of the nation’s most influential journalists, who
was also the godmother of his first child: Ida B. Wells.

“It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption
here exposed,” Wells wrote in 1892 in the introduction to “Southern
Horrors,” one of her seminal works about lynching, “Somebody must show
that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it
seems to have fallen upon me to do so.”

</div>

<div class="g-story-body">

With her passion for wine, swords and bomb making, Qiu Jin was unlike
most women born in late 19th-century China. As a girl, she wrote poetry
and studied Chinese martial heroines like Hua Mulan (yes, [*that*
Mulan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120762/)) fantasizing about one day
seeing her own name in the history books.

But her ambitions ran up against China’s deeply rooted patriarchal
society, which held that a woman’s place remained in the home.
Undeterred, Qiu rose to become an early and fierce advocate for the
liberation of Chinese women, defying prevailing Confucian gender and
class norms by unbinding her feet, cross-dressing and leaving her young
family to pursue an education abroad.

Mary Ewing Outerbridge didn’t have an easy time bringing tennis to

were these stringed things with long handles?

Diane Arbus was a daughter of privilege who spent much of her adult life

in 1971, her unblinking portraits have made her a seminal figure in
modern-day photography and an influence on three generations of
photographers, though she is perhaps just as famous for her
unconventional lifestyle and her suicide.

Marsha P. Johnson was an activist, a prostitute, a drag performer and,
for nearly three decades, a fixture of street life in Greenwich Village.
She was a central figure in a gay liberation movement energized by the
1969 police raid on the [Stonewall
Inn](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/nyregion/stonewall-inn-named-national-monument-a-first-for-gay-rights-movement.html).
She was a

for [Andy
Warhol](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/obituaries/andy-warhol-pop-artist-dies.html).
She battled severe mental illness. She was usually destitute and, for
much of her life, effectively homeless.

When she died at 46, [under murky
circumstances](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/movies/the-death-and-life-of-marsha-p-johnson-review.html),
in summer 1992, Johnson was mourned by her many friends, but her death
did not attract much notice in the mainstream press.

She made sure to spare the children, leaving milk and bread for the two
toddlers to find when they woke up. She stuffed the cracks of the doors
and windows with cloths and tea towels. Then she turned on the gas.

On the morning of Feb. 11, 1963, a Monday, a nurse found the poet Sylvia
Plath in her flat on Fitzroy Road in London, an address where W.B. Yeats
had once lived. She was “lying on the floor of the kitchen with her head
resting on the oven,” according to a local paper, the St. Pancras
Chronicle.

She was buried in an unmarked grave, but the trillions of those cells —

It was probably the first ghost story in Indian cinema. A bewildered
young man in a mansion chasing glimpses of an ethereal, veiled beauty.
The movie, “Mahal,” was a huge success, making the lead actress,
Madhubala, who was barely 16, a superstar overnight.

Nearly seven decades later, strains of the film’s signature song,
“[Aayega aane wala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03DXW_rV54U)” (He
will come), are instantly recognizable to most Indians, evoking the
suspenseful tale of lost love and reincarnation.

It was not customary for a woman to accompany a man to a construction
site in the late 19th century. Petticoats tended to get in the way of
physical work.

But when Washington A. Roebling, the chief engineer of the Brooklyn
Bridge, fell ill, it was his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who stepped in
— managing, liaising and politicking between city officials, workers,
and her husband’s bedside to see the world’s first steel-wire suspension
bridge to completion. She would become the first person to cross the
bridge, too — carrying a rooster with her, as the story has it, for good
luck.

When Nella Larsen died, in 1964, she left little behind: a ground-floor
apartment, two published novels, some short stories, a few letters. She
was childless, divorced and estranged from her half sister, who, in some
accounts, upon learning she was to inherit $35,000 of Larsen’s savings,
[denied knowing the writer
existed](https://books.google.com/books?id=yIdqlAFm_-cC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false).

It was a fitting end for a woman whose entire life had been a story of
swift erasure.

<div class="g-story-body">

A century before the dawn of the computer age, Ada Lovelace imagined the
modern-day, general-purpose computer. It could be programmed to follow
instructions, she wrote in 1843. It could not just calculate but also
create, as it “weaves algebraic patterns just as the [Jacquard
loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom) weaves flowers and
leaves.”

The computer she was writing about, the British inventor Charles
Babbage’s [Analytical
Engine](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/11/07/science/before-its-time-machine.html),
was never built. But her writings about computing have earned Lovelace —
who died of uterine cancer in 1852 at 36 — recognition as the first
computer programmer.

The first American woman to win an Olympic championship died without
ever knowing what she had achieved.

That woman, Margaret Abbott, won the ladies’ golf competition, as the
event was genteelly known, at the 1900 Games in Paris. She received a
gilded porcelain bowl, a smattering of coverage in the newspapers and
then nothing.
