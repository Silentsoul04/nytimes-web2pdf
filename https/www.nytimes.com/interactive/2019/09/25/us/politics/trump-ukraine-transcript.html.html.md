from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from
behind, somebody who wasn’t given much of a chance, and you ended up
winning easily. It’s a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">President
Zelenskyy</span>: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big
and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess
to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few
of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for
our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We
were in a unique situation that we were able to

CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a
verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records
the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and NSC
policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in

affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications
connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation, The word

achieve a unique success. I’m able to tell you the following; the first
time, you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential
election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won
the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can
call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">The
President</span>: \[laughter\] That’s a very good idea. I think your
country is very happy about that.

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">President
Zelenskyy</span>: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work
hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We
brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the
typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type
of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">The
President</span>: Well it’s very nice of you to say that. **I will say
that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of
time.**<sup>1</sup> Much more than the European countries are doing and
they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost
nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it’s something that you
should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she
talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European
countries are the same way so I think it’s something you want to look at
**but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t
say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that
are not good but the United States has been very very good to
Ukraine.**<sup>2</sup>

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">President
Zelenskyy</span>: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only. 100%, but
actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela
Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I
told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing
on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions.
They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns
out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest
partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than
the European Union and I’m very grateful to you for that because the
United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the
European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against
the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great
support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate
for the next steps. specifically we are almost ready to buy more
Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

    American aid, while not explicitly linking his request to unfreezing

    had appropriated to help that country fend off Russian aggression.

    statement — was to ask for

President</span>: **I would like you to do us a favor though because our
country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would
like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with
Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy
people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things
that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself
with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General
call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of
it.**<sup>3</sup> As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a
very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent
performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you
can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">President
Zelenskyy</span>: Yes it is very important for me and everything that
you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important
and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new
page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine.
For that. purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and
he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador
who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting
closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your
confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even
more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with
Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani
will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to
Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but
friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best
and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are
friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have, friends in our
country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to
surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation,
I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will
be done openly and candidly. That I can assure you.

<span class="g-strike">(S/NF)</span> <span class="underline">The
President</span>: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very
good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are
talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and
you had some very bad people involved. <span class="g-highlight">Mr.
Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a
great mayor, and I would like him to</span>

  - <span class="g-doc-annotation_number">3</span> Mr. Trump said
    Attorney General William P. Barr would call the Ukrainian president
    about another investigation. Mr. Trump appears to be referencing an
    unsubstantiated conspiracy theory pushed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
    president’s personal lawyer, that Ukraine had some involvement in
    the emails stolen from Democratic National Committee.  
      
    In testimony after the White House released this reconstructed
    transcript, an official on the call told impeachment investigators
    that the ellipses represented important words or phrases that were
    deliberately left out. Among the omissions was Mr. Trump raising the
    existence of recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden
    Jr., and Mr. Zelensky’s mentioning Burisma Holdings, the energy
    company whose board employed Mr. Biden's son
Hunter.
