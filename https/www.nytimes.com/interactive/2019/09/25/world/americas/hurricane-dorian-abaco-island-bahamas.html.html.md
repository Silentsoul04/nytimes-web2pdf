<span class="g-body-inner">Footage of Sand Banks was collected on Sept.
7 and 8, four days after Hurricane Dorian passed. The 3D model was
created with a process called photogrammetry, which used hundreds of
aerial photographs to reconstruct the community.</span>

<span class="g-body-inner">Derek Watkins, K.K. Rebecca Lai and Niko
Koppel reported from Sand Banks, the Bahamas, and Anjali Singhvi from
New York. The model was produced by Justin Blinder, Or Fleisher, Miles
