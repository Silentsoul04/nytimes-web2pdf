  - The Honorable Richard Burr  
    Chairman
    Select Committee on Intelligence
    United States Senate

<!-- end list -->

  - The Honorable Adam Schiff  
    Chairman
    Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
    United States House of Representatives

Dear Chairman Burr and Chairman Schiff:

I am reporting an “urgent concern” in accordance with the procedures
outlined in 50 U.S.C. §3033(k)(5)(A). This letter is UNCLASSIFIED when
separated from the attachment.

**In the course of my official duties, I have received information from
multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United
States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a
foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.** <sup>1</sup>This
interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country
to investigate one of the President’s main domestic political rivals.
The President’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central
figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as
well.

  - Over the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials
    have informed me of various facts related to this effort. The
    information provided herein was relayed to me in the course of
    official interagency business. It is routine for U.S. officials with
    responsibility for a particular regional or functional portfolio to
    share such information with one another in order to inform
    policymaking and analysis.
  - I was not a direct witness to most of the events described. However,
    I found my colleagues’ accounts of these events to be credible
    because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact
    patterns that were consistent with one another. In addition, a
    variety of information consistent with these private accounts has
    been reported publicly.

I am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute “a
serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive
Order” that “does not include differences of opinions concerning public
policy matters,” consistent with the definition of an “urgent concern”
in 50 U.S.C. §3033(k)(5)(G). I am therefore fulfilling my duty to report
this information, through proper legal channels, to the relevant
authorities.

  - I am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national
    security and undermine the U.S. Government’s efforts to deter and
    counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.

To the best of my knowledge, the entirety of this statement is
unclassified when separated from the classified enclosure. I have
endeavored to apply the classification standards outlined in Executive
Order (EO) 13526 and to separate out information that I know or have
reason to believe is classified for national security
purposes.<sup>1</sup>

  - If a classification marking is applied retroactively, I believe it
    is incumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why such a
    marking was applied, and to which specific information it pertains.

## I. The 25 July Presidential phone call

Early in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I do not know which side
initiated the call. This was the first publicly acknowledged call
between the two leaders since a brief congratulatory call after Mr.
Zelenskyy won the presidency on 21 April.

Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call
informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the
President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal
interests. Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take
actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid. According to the
White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the
President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia:

  - initiate or continue an investigation<sup>2</sup> into the
    activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter
    Biden;
  - assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian
    interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in
    Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate
    and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee
    (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm
    Crowdstrike,<sup>3</sup> which initially reported that Russian
    hackers had penetrated the DNC’s networks in 2016; and
  - meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his
    personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General
    Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.

<sup>1</sup> Apart from the information in the Enclosure, it is my
belief that none of the information contained herein meets the
definition of “classified information” outlined in EO 13526, Part 1,
Section 1.1. There is ample open-source information about the efforts I
describe below, including statements by the President and Mr. Giuliani.
In addition, based on my personal observations, there is discretion with
respect to the classification of private comments by or instructions
from the President, including his communications with foreign leaders;
information that is not related to U.S. foreign policy or national
security—such as the information contained in this document, when
separated from the Enclosure—is generally treated as unclassified. I
also believe that applying a classification marking to this information
would violate EO 13526, Part 1, Section 1.7, which states: “In no case
shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as
classified, or fail to be declassified in order to: (1) conceal
violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; \[or\] (2)
prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.”

<sup>2</sup> It is unclear whether such a Ukrainian investigation
exists. See Footnote \#7 for additional information.

<sup>3</sup> I do not know why the President associates these servers
with Ukraine. (See, for example, his comments to *Fox News* on 20 July:
“And Ukraine. Take a look at Ukraine. How come the FBI didn’t take
this server? Podesta told them to get out. He said, get out. So, how
come the FBI didn’t take the server from the DNC?”)

The President also praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy
Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his
position. (Note: Starting in March 2019, Mr. Lutsenko made a series of
public allegations—many of which he later walked back—about the Biden
family’s activities in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials’ purported
involvement in the 2016 U.S. election, and the activities of the U.S.
Embassy in Kyiv. See Part IV for additional context.)

**The White House officials who told me this information were deeply
disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.**<sup>2</sup> They
told me that there was already a “discussion ongoing” with White House
lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the
officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his
office for personal gain.

The Ukrainian side was the first to publicly acknowledge the phone call.
On the evening of 25 July, a readout was posted on the website of the
Ukrainian President that contained the following line (translation from
original Russian-language readout):

  - “Donald Trump expressed his conviction that the new Ukrainian
    government will be able to quickly improve Ukraine’s image and
    complete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back
    cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.”

Aside from the above-mentioned “cases” purportedly dealing with the
Biden family and the 2016 U.S. election, I was told by White House
officials that no other “cases” were discussed.

Based on my understanding, there were approximately a dozen White House
officials who listened to the call — a mixture of policy officials and
duty officers in the White House Situation Room, as is customary. The
officials I spoke with told me that participation in the call had not
been restricted in advance because everyone expected it would be a
“routine” call with a foreign leader. I do not know whether anyone was
physically present with the President during the call.

  - In addition to White House personnel, I was told that a State
    Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on
    the call.
  - I was not the only non-White House official to receive a readout of
    the call. Based on my understanding, multiple State Department and
    Intelligence Community officials were also briefed on the contents
    of the call as outlined above.

## II. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the call

**In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S.
officials that senior White House officials had intervened to “lock
down” all records of the phone call, especially the official
word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced—as is
customary—by the White House Situation Room.**<sup>3</sup> This set of
actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the
gravity of what had transpired in the call.

  - White House officials told me that they were “directed” by White
    House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer
    system in which such transcripts are typically stored for
    coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level
    officials.

    White House officials believed they had witnessed Trump abuse his

    writes that White House lawyers “directed” White House officials to
    remove records of the July 25 call from the system where such
    documents are normally stored and place it instead in a system for
    storing highly classified information, like files related to covert
    actions, even though it did not meet the criteria, in order to limit
    the number of officials who could see it.
