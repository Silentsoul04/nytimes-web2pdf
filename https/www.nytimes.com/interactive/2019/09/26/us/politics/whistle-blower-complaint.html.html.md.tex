August 12, 2019

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Honorable Richard Burr\\
  Chairman Select Committee on Intelligence United States Senate
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Honorable Adam Schiff\\
  Chairman Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence United States
  House of Representatives
\end{itemize}

Dear Chairman Burr and Chairman Schiff:

I am reporting an ``urgent concern'' in accordance with the procedures
outlined in 50 U.S.C. §3033(k)(5)(A). This letter is UNCLASSIFIED when
separated from the attachment.

\textbf{In the course of my official duties, I have received information
from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United
States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a
foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.} 1This interference includes,
among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of
the President's main domestic political rivals. The President's personal
lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort.
Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Over the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have
  informed me of various facts related to this effort. The information
  provided herein was relayed to me in the course of official
  interagency business. It is routine for U.S. officials with
  responsibility for a particular regional or functional portfolio to
  share such information with one another in order to inform
  policymaking and analysis.
\item
  I was not a direct witness to most of the events described. However, I
  found my colleagues' accounts of these events to be credible because,
  in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that
  were consistent with one another. In addition, a variety of
  information consistent with these private accounts has been reported
  publicly.
\end{itemize}

I am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute ``a
serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive
Order'' that ``does not include differences of opinions concerning
public policy matters,'' consistent with the definition of an ``urgent
concern'' in 50 U.S.C. §3033(k)(5)(G). I am therefore fulfilling my duty
to report this information, through proper legal channels, to the
relevant authorities.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national
  security and undermine the U.S. Government's efforts to deter and
  counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.
\end{itemize}

To the best of my knowledge, the entirety of this statement is
unclassified when separated from the classified enclosure. I have
endeavored to apply the classification standards outlined in Executive
Order (EO) 13526 and to separate out information that I know or have
reason to believe is classified for national security purposes.1

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If a classification marking is applied retroactively, I believe it is
  incumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why such a marking
  was applied, and to which specific information it pertains.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{i-the-25-july-presidential-phone-call}{%
\subsection{I. The 25 July Presidential phone
call}\label{i-the-25-july-presidential-phone-call}}

Early in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I do not know which side
initiated the call. This was the first publicly acknowledged call
between the two leaders since a brief congratulatory call after Mr.
Zelenskyy won the presidency on 21 April.

Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call
informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the
President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal
interests. Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take
actions to help the President's 2020 reelection bid. According to the
White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the
President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  initiate or continue an investigation2 into the activities of former
  Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden;
\item
  assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian
  interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in
  Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and
  turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and
  examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike,3 which initially
  reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the DNC's networks in
  2016; and
\item
  meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his
  personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General
  Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.
\end{itemize}

1 Apart from the information in the Enclosure, it is my belief that none
of the information contained herein meets the definition of ``classified
information'' outlined in EO 13526, Part 1, Section 1.1. There is ample
open-source information about the efforts I describe below, including
statements by the President and Mr. Giuliani. In addition, based on my
personal observations, there is discretion with respect to the
classification of private comments by or instructions from the
President, including his communications with foreign leaders;
information that is not related to U.S. foreign policy or national
security---such as the information contained in this document, when
separated from the Enclosure---is generally treated as unclassified. I
also believe that applying a classification marking to this information
would violate EO 13526, Part 1, Section 1.7, which states: ``In no case
shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as
classified, or fail to be declassified in order to: (1) conceal
violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; {[}or{]} (2)
prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.''

2 It is unclear whether such a Ukrainian investigation exists. See
Footnote \#7 for additional information.

3 I do not know why the President associates these servers with Ukraine.
(See, for example, his comments to \emph{Fox News} on 20 July: ``And
Ukraine. Take a look at Ukraine. How come the FBI didn't take this
server? Podesta told them to get out. He said, get out. So, how come the
FBI didn't take the server from the DNC?'')

The President also praised Ukraine's Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy
Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his
position. (Note: Starting in March 2019, Mr. Lutsenko made a series of
public allegations---many of which he later walked back---about the
Biden family's activities in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials' purported
involvement in the 2016 U.S. election, and the activities of the U.S.
Embassy in Kyiv. See Part IV for additional context.)

\textbf{The White House officials who told me this information were
deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.}2 They told
me that there was already a ``discussion ongoing'' with White House
lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the
officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his
office for personal gain.

The Ukrainian side was the first to publicly acknowledge the phone call.
On the evening of 25 July, a readout was posted on the website of the
Ukrainian President that contained the following line (translation from
original Russian-language readout):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Donald Trump expressed his conviction that the new Ukrainian
  government will be able to quickly improve Ukraine's image and
  complete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back
  cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.''
\end{itemize}

Aside from the above-mentioned ``cases'' purportedly dealing with the
Biden family and the 2016 U.S. election, I was told by White House
officials that no other ``cases'' were discussed.

Based on my understanding, there were approximately a dozen White House
officials who listened to the call --- a mixture of policy officials and
duty officers in the White House Situation Room, as is customary. The
officials I spoke with told me that participation in the call had not
been restricted in advance because everyone expected it would be a
``routine'' call with a foreign leader. I do not know whether anyone was
physically present with the President during the call.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In addition to White House personnel, I was told that a State
  Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the
  call.
\item
  I was not the only non-White House official to receive a readout of
  the call. Based on my understanding, multiple State Department and
  Intelligence Community officials were also briefed on the contents of
  the call as outlined above.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{II. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the
call}\label{ii-efforts-to-restrict-access-to-records-related-to-the-call}}

\textbf{In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple
U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to
``lock down'' all records of the phone call, especially the official
word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced---as is
customary---by the White House Situation Room.}3 This set of actions
underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of
what had transpired in the call.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  White House officials told me that they were ``directed'' by White
  House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer
  system in which such transcripts are typically stored for
  coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level
  officials.

  2 In a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Mr. Trump
  brought up American aid to that country --- without explicitly
  mentioning that he had just frozen a military aid package of hundreds
  of millions of dollars --- and then pressed the Ukrainian leader to
  investigate Mr. Biden. White House officials believed they had
  witnessed Trump abuse his power for personal political gain.
\item
  3 The whistle-blower writes that White House lawyers ``directed''
  White House officials to remove records of the July 25 call from the
  system where such documents are normally stored and place it instead
  in a system for storing highly classified information, like files
  related to covert actions, even though it did not meet the criteria,
  in order to limit the number of officials who could see it.

  4 A widely criticized Ukrainian prosecutor piqued Mr. Trump's and Mr.
  Giuliani's interest by floating allegations to The Hill --- but then
  backtracked. In the July 25 phone call, Mr. Trump was apparently
  referring to Mr. Lutsenko when he told the Ukrainian president that,
  ``I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down
  and that's really unfair.''

  5 The State Department saw Mr. Giuliani's rogue outreach to Ukraine
  for Trump as a threat to national security. The whistle-blower
  recounts the struggles by the senior United States diplomats to deal
  with the confusion created by the president dispatching his personal
  lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukrainian officials to
  develop dirt against the Bidens, both in the run-up to the July 25
  call and its aftermath.

  6 This passage, which comes from the letter by Michael Atkinson, the
  inspector general for the intelligence community, shows he withheld
  the identity of the whistle-blower when transmitting the complaint to
  Joseph Maguire, the director of national intelligence, with the
  expectation that Mr. Maguire would then send it to Congress under a
  whistle-blower law.
