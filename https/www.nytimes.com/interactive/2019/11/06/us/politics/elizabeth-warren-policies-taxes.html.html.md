Senator Elizabeth Warren’s policy plans would cost more than $30
trillion over a decade, an agenda of monumental scale that would
significantly increase federal government spending. She is counting on
far-reaching changes to the tax system that would collect more revenue
from the richest Americans and from businesses.

<div class="spending-key">

Each

<div class="spending-key-dot">

spending.

</div>

<div class="spending-total">

<span class="spending-total-number"></span> in
spending.

</div>

<div class="g-spending-graphic g-picture-book">

<div class="spending-bg g-picture-book__bg">

<div class="spending-labels">

</div>

</div>

<div class="spending-steps">

<div id="step-0" class="text-slide step-edu g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="edu">

Ms. Warren has proposed **universal child care, increased spending on
public schools, student debt cancellation and free college.** She plans
to pay for these proposals by creating a wealth tax on households worth
over $50 million. How much revenue that tax would generate is a matter
of
debate.

</div>

<div id="step-1" class="text-slide step-green g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="green">

Her climate change agenda includes plans on **clean energy technology
and reducing carbon emissions.** She would cover much of the cost by
creating a new tax on corporate profits and reversing tax cuts for
wealthy people and big corporations in the 2017 Republican tax
overhaul.

</div>

<div id="step-2" class="text-slide step-socsec g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="socsec">

Ms. Warren would increase **Social Security benefits** by $200 a month,
among other changes. To pay for her plan, she would raise investment and
payroll taxes on high
earners.

</div>

<div id="step-3" class="text-slide step-housing g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="housing">

She wants to **build more affordable housing.** She would cover most of
the cost by expanding the estate
tax.

</div>

<div id="step-4" class="text-slide step-misc g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="misc">

She has called for new spending in a **variety of other areas,** such as
rural broadband and apprenticeship programs. Her plans to address the
opioid crisis and election security and help minority-owned small
businesses would be largely financed by eliminating a tax benefit for
inherited
assets.

</div>

<div id="step-5" class="text-slide step-health g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health">

Last week, Ms. Warren laid out her most expensive plan yet: creating
**“Medicare for all,”** a government-run health insurance program. Her
price tag relies on aggressive assumptions and is lower than several
other estimates from
experts.

</div>

<div id="step-6" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_0 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_0">

Even still, that’s twice the estimated cost of her other proposals.
Let’s take a closer look at how she would pay for
it.

</div>

<div id="step-7" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_1 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_1">

First, Ms. Warren would impose a **new tax on employers** that is
similar to what they currently spend on their employees’ health
care.

</div>

<div id="step-8" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_2 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_2">

Some money would come from **added revenue from existing taxes.**
Workers would no longer pay for health insurance premiums, so their
take-home pay would rise, and they would pay taxes on that extra money.
Ms. Warren also wants to strengthen tax enforcement to collect more
taxes.

</div>

<div id="step-9" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_3 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_3">

A significant amount would come from **taxing the wealthy.** For the top
1 percent of households, she would tax capital gains annually instead of
when investments are sold, and raise the tax rate on those gains. She
would also steepen her wealth tax on
billionaires.

</div>

<div id="step-10" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_4 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_4">

Ms. Warren would **make changes to corporate taxation,** such as raising
taxes on companies that earn money in foreign countries. She would
create a tax on financial transactions like stock trades and impose a
new fee on big
banks.

</div>

<div id="step-11" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_5 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_5">

She is counting on passing an **overhaul of immigration laws,** which
would be a momentous political achievement if it were to happen. That
would generate revenue from additional taxes paid by
immigrants.

</div>

<div id="step-12" class="text-slide step-health_breakdown_6 g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health_breakdown_6">

Finally, she would **cut military
spending.**

</div>

<div id="step-13" class="text-slide step-health g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health">

The **total cost of Ms. Warren’s proposals** over 10 years is greater
than what the federal government is currently projected to spend on
Social Security and Medicare combined over that
time.

</div>

<div id="step-14" class="text-slide step-health g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="health">

On paper, the revenue sources she has laid out would cover the
approximate cost of her plans. But her math relies on assumptions that
are far from assured, such as the extent to which the richest Americans
would pay her wealth tax rather than dodge
it.

</div>

<div id="step-15" class="text-slide step-comparison_to_current g-picture-book__page" data-step-id="comparison_to_current">

The federal government is projected to spend about $58 trillion over the
next decade. Ms. Warren would need to persuade Congress to approve her
plans, a difficult feat for any one of her expansive proposals, let
alone her entire agenda. If she succeeded, she would increase federal
spending by **roughly 50 percent**.

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-asset g-methodology">

**Notes**

This analysis includes proposals released by Ms. Warren’s presidential
campaign that have clear price tags. Because the overall spending total
reflects only those proposals for which there are clear cost estimates,
it should be viewed as a partial estimate of how much her full agenda,
including ideas that do not have price tags, would cost. Projections for
what her plans would cost over a decade were used when those estimates
were available. The figures for Ms. Warren’s most expensive plan,
Medicare for all, are for 2020 to 2029. [Projected federal
spending](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-08/55551-CBO-outlook-update_0.pdf#page=11)
under current law is also for 2020 to 2029. Ms. Warren’s plan for
Medicare for all counts on $6.1 trillion from states and local
governments in addition to $20.5 trillion in new federal spending.
