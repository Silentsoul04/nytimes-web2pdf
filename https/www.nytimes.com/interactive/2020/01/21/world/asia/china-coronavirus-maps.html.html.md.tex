The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html}{Wuhan
coronavirus} has sickened more than 4,500 people in Asia, according to
statements from health officials. Many other cases are suspected but not
confirmed. As of Tuesday morning, at least 106 people have died, all in
China.

began} in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million
people in central China. But which animal is the source of the virus and
how many people are at risk remain unclear. The virus can spread from
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/world/asia/coronavirus-china-symptoms.html}{person
to person}, but it is not known how easily.

The Chinese authorities took the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/coronavirus-quarantines-history.html}{extraordinary
step} of closing off Wuhan, canceling planes and trains leaving the city
and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. By Friday, at least
12 other cities in Hubei Province had issued travel restrictions,
including Huanggang, home to seven million people, and Ezhou, a city of
about one million.

The restrictions on trains and other forms of public transportation come
just before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of
people travel around and out of the country.

The restrictions also began spreading beyond Hubei. On Saturday, the
Beijing city government announced that it would suspend all
inter-province buses, effectively limiting road travel into the capital.

Researchers at
\href{https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html}{Northeastern University}
and
\href{https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/}{Imperial
College London} estimate that the number of cases may be five or ten
times higher than what has been reported. Thousands of suspected cases
are yet to be confirmed with tests, and others with the virus may not
have sought medical attention.

On Monday, the Northeastern researchers estimated there may be around
25,000 cases. The estimates will change as more cases are reported and
more information about the virus becomes known.

\href{https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html}{Laboratory for the
Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems}. Estimates as of
Jan. 27.

These estimates are based on
\href{https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html}{an analysis} of the
population of Wuhan, the number of cases detected outside of China and
the number of people who travel from Wuhan to other areas. Public health
officials still do not know how the disease is transmitted, and experts
urged caution in interpreting the estimates.

``These are very early models that make several assumptions based on
what evidence is available,'' said David Heymann, an epidemiologist at
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ``They aren't truth
--- they're just one step in trying to better understand this
outbreak.''
