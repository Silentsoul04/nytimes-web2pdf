Note: Candidates are ordered by the total amount spent in the fourth
quarter. Amounts raised are from individual contributions and exclude
transfers from previous campaigns. Mr. Biden entered the race after the
first quarter. Candidates who are largely or entirely self-funding their
campaigns are not shown.

The best-funded Democratic presidential candidates spent prolifically in
the final quarter of 2019, pouring millions into advertising and payroll
as the first nominating contests approached, according to filings with
the Federal Election Commission on Friday. While the candidates competed
for support among Democratic voters, President Trump continued
stockpiling cash for his re-election bid.

Among the leading candidates in the Democratic primary race, Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} of Vermont led the way by spending \$50 million in the quarter.
That amount is by far the most that he has spent in a single quarter in
the 2020 race, and it exceeded what he spent in the fourth quarter of
2015 during his last presidential bid.

Former Mayor

Buttigieg} of South Bend, Ind., and Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html}{Elizabeth
Warren} of Massachusetts each spent about \$34 million, and former Vice
President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} spent \$23 million.

Two billionaires who are tapping into their fortunes each spent more
than Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden put together.
Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York spent a staggering \$188
million, while the former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer spent \$154
million.

Mr. Sanders's presidential bid is powered by a huge group of grass-roots
donors
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html}{around
the country}. He received
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-q4-campaign-fundraising.html}{more
than 1.8 million individual donations} in the quarter, according to his
campaign.

The leading candidates are hardly on a level playing field when it comes
to the resources they have available to fund their campaigns in the
coming weeks.

These figures are now a month out of date, but they show that Mr.
Sanders held a significant cash advantage heading into 2020. At the
start of January, he had twice as much cash as Mr. Biden.

Mr. Trump ended last year with more than twice as much cash on hand as
Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren put together. He had more
money on hand than President Barack Obama had at the same time during
his re-election campaign.

Note: The burn rate shown is a candidate's spending in the fourth
quarter relative to individual contributions he or she received.
Contribution refunds are excluded from the spending figures. The burn
rate is greater than 100 percent if a candidate spent more than he or
she raised. Candidates who are largely or entirely self-funding their

The Bloomberg campaign said it spent \$132 million on television
advertising, \$8.2 million on digital advertising and \$3.3 million on
polling. It also spent about \$650,000 on private plane travel. After
Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Steyer was the biggest spender in the Democratic
field.
