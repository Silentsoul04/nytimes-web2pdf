The most extensive travel restrictions to stop an outbreak in human
history haven't been enough. We analyzed the movements of hundreds of
millions of people to show why.

It seems simple: Stop travel, stop the virus from spreading around the
world.

Here's why that didn't work.

Many of the \textbf{first known cases} clustered around a seafood market
in Wuhan, China, a city of 11 million and a transportation hub.

Four cases grew to \textbf{dozens} by the end of December. Doctors knew
only that the sick people had viral pneumonia that did not respond to
the usual treatments.

The true size of the outbreak was much larger even then --- an invisible
network of \textbf{nearly 1,000 cases}, or perhaps several times more.

Estimates from Trevor Bedford, Hutchinson Center and University of
Washington, and Lauren Gardner, Johns Hopkins University

With each patient infecting two or three others on average, even a
perfect response may not have contained the spread.

But Chinese officials did not alert the public to the risks in December.
It wasn't until Dec. 31 that they alerted the World Health Organization
and released a statement --- and a reassurance.

``The disease is preventable and controllable,'' the government said.

The timing of the outbreak could not have been worse. \textbf{Hundreds
of millions of people} were about to travel back to their hometowns for
the Lunar New Year.

Here's how people moved around on Jan. 1, according to a Times analysis
of data published by Baidu and major telecoms, which tracked the
movements of millions of cell phones.

Travel volume on \textbf{Jan. 1}. **** Minor routes not shown.

At least \textbf{175,000 people} left Wuhan just on that day, we found.

Travel from Wuhan on \textbf{Jan. 1}

The \textbf{departures from Wuhan accelerated} over the next three
weeks. About **** 7 million people left in January, before travel was
restricted.

Travel from Wuhan on \textbf{Jan. 21}

Thousands of travelers \textbf{were infected}.

Red dots show proportion of infected travelers, based on estimates from
Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University.

By the time Chinese officials acknowledged the risk of human-to-human
transmission on Jan. 21, \textbf{local outbreaks} were already seeded in
Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities.

Travel on \textbf{Jan. 21}

Two days later, the authorities locked down Wuhan, and many cities
followed in the next few weeks. Travel across China nearly stopped.

Travel on \textbf{Feb. 4}

But \textbf{local outbreaks} were already growing quickly.

Travel on \textbf{Feb. 4}

As the outbreak moved across China in early January,
\textbf{international travel} continued as normal.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/02/04/coronavirus-spread/13c4a399ecc4372dadb658e53eb2dc3b6c85b005/flow-int-swatch.png}

Recent air travel, based on first quarter 2019 data from O.A.G.

\textbf{Thousands of people} flew out of Wuhan to cities around the
world.

Over 900 people went to \textbf{New York} every month on average, based
on recent trends \ldots{}

\ldots{} over 2,200 to \textbf{Sydney} \ldots{}

\ldots{} and over 15,000 people went to \textbf{Bangkok}, the most
popular destination.

That's where the first known overseas case appeared in mid-January,
\textbf{a 61-year-old woman} who traveled from Wuhan to Bangkok despite
having a fever, headache and a sore throat.

Other early cases turned up in Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul and Hong Kong.
The U.S. confirmed its first case near Seattle.

Cases as of \textbf{Jan. 23}

About 85 percent of infected travelers went undetected, researchers
believe. But they were still contagious.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/02/04/coronavirus-spread/13c4a399ecc4372dadb658e53eb2dc3b6c85b005/dot-swatch.png}

Infected people, based on estimates by Jeffrey Shaman

It was only at the end of January that Wuhan was placed under a lockdown
and airlines started canceling flights. By Jan. 31, when the United
States announced it would shut down entry from China for non-Americans,
\textbf{travel out of Wuhan had basically stopped}.

It was too late. Outbreaks were already growing \textbf{in over 30
cities across 26 countries}, most seeded by travelers from Wuhan.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/02/04/coronavirus-spread/13c4a399ecc4372dadb658e53eb2dc3b6c85b005/cases-swatch2.png}

Cases as of \textbf{Jan. 31}

The virus started \textbf{spreading locally}, moving easily in confined
spaces like churches and restaurants, and infecting people who had not
traveled to China --- the start of a pandemic.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/02/04/coronavirus-spread/13c4a399ecc4372dadb658e53eb2dc3b6c85b005/cases-swatch2.png}

Cases as of \textbf{Feb. 14}

By March 1, thousands of cases were reported in Italy, Iran and South
Korea. China was no longer the main driver of the outbreak.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/02/04/coronavirus-spread/13c4a399ecc4372dadb658e53eb2dc3b6c85b005/cases-swatch2.png}

Cases as of \textbf{March 1}

In fact, as China started systematically testing, tracing and isolating
patients, new cases there declined dramatically, showing that it was
possible to slow the virus. Similar measures slowed the spread in
Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea.

In the United States, where testing has lagged, President Trump
suspended most travel from Europe. ``The virus will not have a chance
against us,'' he said.

Cases as of \textbf{March 11}

But by then, the virus had a secure foothold. It continued to spread
locally throughout parts of Seattle, New York City and across the
country, once again outpacing efforts to stop it.
