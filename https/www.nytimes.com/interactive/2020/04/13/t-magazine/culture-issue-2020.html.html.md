In our 2020 Culture issue, out April 19, T celebrates various groups of
creative people who, whether united by outlook or identity, happenstance
or choice, built communities that have shaped the larger cultural
landscape. **Read more about the making of the issue.**

EVERY MAGAZINE IS by its nature retrospective, a time capsule from the
near past. A magazine such as this takes months to photograph, write,
edit and research, and a few weeks to print; this means that the things
that were true at its conception are sometimes no longer so when it’s
published. As I write this, two days before this issue ships to the
printers, it is March 19, 2020, nine months since we started working on
it, six days since The Times urged its employees to work from home, four
days since the mayor ordered the closure of New York’s restaurants and
bars and the first of what will likely be many days of our living in a
never-ending Samuel Beckett play. Yet while the world around us has
changed in ways that were — just a few weeks ago — once reserved for the
realm of fiction, the spirit and thesis of this issue has not.

One of the things that has defined our age has been the rise and
dominance of what we can colloquially call tribes, groups of people
bound not by blood or genetics or law, but by something more profound
and just as durable — call it an affinity, if you will. Sometimes that
affinity has its roots in race, or gender, or sexuality, but it’s just
as often based in something not innate, but developed: taste, say, or
sensibility, or experience, or history. These are assemblages of people
not born unto one another, but who *find* one another, and as a result,
their bond is more charged, more powerful, more intimate.

Of course, tribalism — the word is used most often by pundits, usually
despairingly — has been a scourge of our age as well, splintering the
romance of the national body. But we are not speaking here of those who
try to rally people with the idea of a shared history in order to
protect their own way of life *against* another’s ambitions and
strivings; we are instead celebrating groups that comprise creative
people, each of whom has changed or defined their respective artistic
mediums and, by extension, changed or defined the culture at large.

Admittedly, “‘tribe’ is a troublesome word, bearing the weight of
decades of anthropological study that privileged Western civilization
over all other traditions,” [writes Ligaya
Mishan](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/tribe-meaning.html)
in her lovely, wise essay about the etymology of the term. But, she
adds, “let us rescue it here, pare it down to its simplest meaning, as a
name for the first human communities that formed beyond the primal bonds
of kinship — the beginnings of the great experiment we call society,
which taught us to be
human.”

SO WHAT MAKES a 21st-century tribe? A shared adversity, for one. In many
cases, its members have spent their lives fighting for recognition and
respect, sometimes even from within their own families or communities,
among people who were supposed to protect them. This is why certain
places, certain industries, are more conducive to tribes than others.
New York is [one such
place](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/ninth-street-greenwich-village-neighbors.html);
fashion [is
another](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/maria-cornejo-olivier-rousteing-telfar-clemens-alessandro-michele.html).
Both are significantly populated by people who at one point (or many) in
their childhoods realized that they didn’t quite belong to the people to
whom they were assigned, who decided that they were someday going to
discover — or create — their own commune. Then there’s the kind of
adversity faced by people like the [renowned black
actresses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/black-actresses-bassett-berry-blige-henson-whitfield-elise.html)
we gathered; now middle-aged, most of them have been acting or
performing for decades, but due to entrenched systemic racism and
sexism, it has only been in the past few years that they’ve found
themselves considered commercial assets in addition to artistic ones. Or
there’s [the members of ACT
UP](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/act-up-aids.html),
the unapologetically impolite activist group co-founded by the writer
Larry Kramer in 1987, at the height of the AIDS crisis in America. Like
all significant activist groups in this country, it owes a debt to its
predecessors in the civil rights and feminism movements. It also
inspired the next generation of activists: As David France writes, its
influence — its members’ understanding of the media and the theater of
demonstration; their emphasis on self-education and skepticism about
authority — lives on in Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, the
Parkland student-led gun-control groups and many more. Its influence is
even and especially felt in this moment, as we stagger through the worst
plague since H.I.V. and AIDS (with an essential difference: this
disease, unlike its 20th-century counterpart, did not at its start
disproportionately affect a community denied their fundamental human
rights). The transparency that we now expect public health officials to
offer is a direct legacy of ACT UP’s necessary provocations.

BUT THE OTHER thing that binds many of these tribes is love. Notice I
didn’t say “like”: Not all of the people in these taxonomies necessarily
like one another. They hadn’t necessarily even met one another.

But they all *knew* one another, or of one another. One of the great
joys of working on this issue — one I experienced firsthand, as did the
various editors, writers, stylists and art directors who attended the 22
shoots that our indefatigable photo team oversaw in a five-month-long
process — was witnessing the astonishment, wonder and affection
expressed by so many of the subjects upon encountering one another.
“*You’re* here?” someone would ask. “I can’t believe *you’re* here\!”
It was the kind of pure delight that’s reserved for the most special of
meetings, the one in which you’re finally reunited with the long-lost
relative you had waited your whole life to see and be seen by. *Here you
are, one of my people. You belong with me: With you, I belong*.
Sometimes, in our recognizing them as a group, they saw themselves as
one, too. The result was a series of almost giddy reunions, sometimes
made giddier for being so unexpected. A [group of black
artists](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/black-art-galleries.html),
now elderly and among the most celebrated in the world, all of whom had
once showed at one or all of the three black-owned galleries that would
change contemporary art in the ’70s and ’80s, broke into an impromptu
version of “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours”; many of the [butch and
stud
lesbians](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/butch-stud-lesbian.html),
who had admired one another from afar, left together for a bar after an
eight-hour-long shoot; the reconvened casts of genre-altering
productions of
“[Hair](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/hair-musical-broadway.html)”
and “[Sweeney
Todd](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/sweeney-todd-revival.html)”
burst into spontaneous song.

As I said, the members of these groups didn’t necessarily all like one
another (though watching them, it was hard to believe otherwise). But
they all recognized one another. And isn’t that what love is? Having
someone see you as not only the person you are, but as someone who is
part of something larger, some community you yourself hadn’t seen?
Certainly that’s true for me. And though I don’t like to speak for other
people’s definition of love, I’m going to say — just because I saw it —
that it was true for them as well. — HANYA
YANAGIHARA

### <span>The Artists</span>

##### By M. H. Miller

For decades, the art world ignored artists of color — an institutional
neglect it’s now trying to correct. But in the 1960s and ’70s, in Los
Angeles and New York, three galleries led the way in showing the work of
black artists, many of whom are now among the most influential of our
time.

### <span>The Forerunners</span>

Every now and then, a piece of American performance is so memorable that
it both redefines its medium and reframes the culture at large. From a
controversial, youth-inflected 1967 musical that captured and encouraged
the popular (and political) consciousness to a 2005 Broadway revival
that brought a much-needed austerity and economy to the stage to a
seminal 1991 film that centered the black female experience and gaze,
here are appraisals of three such enduring — and heavily referenced —
works, alongside gatherings of the stars who not only made them but were
made by them,
too.

##### By Kerry Manders

Queer culture and the arts would be much poorer without the presence and

### <span>The Shadows</span>

##### By Megan O’Grady

These days, artists of all kinds are expected to be available for public
consumption. But a small and highly influential group of them has chosen
to disappear from society in favor of letting their work speak for
itself. What does it mean to be inaccessible in an age of
oversharing?

##### By Mitchell Kuga

Long a capital of nightlife, from ’70s discos to ’90s raves, New York
City is now home to a robust scene of roving parties where anyone — of
any race, gender or sexuality — is welcome. These are the people who
make the party
happen.

### <span>The Fashion Gangs</span>

##### Introduction by Alice Newell-Hanson

Clothing design is often perceived as the work of a solitary and
singular talent, of an outsider looking in. But as Balmain’s Olivier
Rousteing, Maria Cornejo, Gucci’s Alessandro Michele and Telfar Clemens
prove, making clothes is in fact the ultimate act of
collaboration.

### <span>The Journalists</span>

##### Introduction by Jane Perlez  
As told to Heather Corcoran, Tal McThenia and Mimi Vu

In this tumultuous period of American politics, there are perhaps more
foreign correspondents in Washington, D.C., than ever before, reporting
back to everywhere from Sweden to Singapore. What unites them is their
fight against the threat of misinformation and their struggle to
accurately inform their fellow citizens about what’s happening here —
and how it might affect
them.
