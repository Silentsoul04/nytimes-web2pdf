What's new:

There are now only three states where the number of deaths since March
looks like it does in a normal year.

The coronavirus pandemic has killed so many Americans that the patterns
of death in nearly every state look aberrant when compared to recent
history. A New York Times analysis of estimates from the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm}{Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention} shows just how many lives are being
lost in the pandemic, as some people die from the virus itself and
others from the upheaval it has brought.

\hypertarget{us-deaths-above-or-below-normal}{%
\subsubsection{U.S. Deaths Above or Below
Normal}\label{us-deaths-above-or-below-normal}}

Note: The chart shows the difference between measured deaths and
expected deaths each week. Deaths above the expected number are
considered to be ``excess deaths.''

Nationwide, 190,600 more people have died than usual from March 15 to
July 18, according to C.D.C. estimates, which adjust current death
records to account for typical reporting lags. That number is 50,000
higher than the official count of coronavirus deaths for that period.
Higher-than-normal death rates are now widespread across the country;
only Alaska, Hawaii and Maine show numbers that look similar to recent
years.

Our analysis examines deaths from all causes --- not just confirmed
cases of coronavirus --- beginning in mid-March when the virus took
hold. That allows comparisons that don't depend on the availability of
coronavirus tests in a given place or on the accuracy of cause-of-death
reporting. What it shows is that some places have seen
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/27/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-city.html}{staggering
death tolls}, while a few states have experienced fewer deaths, but
enough to clearly differentiate this year from a typical one.

New York City, an early epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has so far
experienced the most extreme increase in deaths, which surged to seven
times the usual number during the peak of its coronavirus outbreak. But
as the pandemic has spread across the country, New York is not the only
place where the death counts are far above normal levels.

Over time, the number of states with deaths at least 10 percent above
normal levels has grown, and includes states in not just the Northeast,
but also the South, West and Midwest.

\subsection{Where deaths are far above
normal}\label{where-deaths-are-far-above-normal}}

\hypertarget{deaths-above-or-below-normal-by-location}{%
\subsubsection{Deaths above or below normal, by
location}\label{deaths-above-or-below-normal-by-location}}

\hypertarget{deaths-in-these-places-are-at-least-10-percent-higher-than-the-normal-level}{%
\paragraph{Deaths in these places are at least 10 percent higher than
the normal
level.}\label{deaths-in-these-places-are-at-least-10-percent-higher-than-the-normal-level}}

Counting deaths takes time and many states are weeks or months behind in
reporting. These estimates from the C.D.C. are adjusted based on how
mortality data has lagged in previous years. Even with this adjustment,
it's possible they could be an underestimate of the complete death toll
if increased mortality is causing states to lag more than they have in
the past or if states have changed their reporting systems.
Pennsylvania's death counts, for example, have lagged behind the state's
usual rate of reporting all year, according to the C.D.C.

But comparing recent totals of deaths from all causes can provide a more
complete picture of the pandemic's impact than tracking only deaths of
people with confirmed diagnoses. Epidemiologists refer to fatalities in
the gap between the observed and normal numbers of deaths as ``excess
deaths.''

Through July 18, estimated excess deaths were about 36 percent higher
than the official coronavirus fatality count. If this pattern holds for
the rest of the country, it would put the current death toll at about
204,000 people.

Many epidemiologists believe measuring excess deaths is
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30933-8/fulltext}{the
best way} to assess the impact of the virus in real time. It shows how
the virus is altering normal patterns of mortality. The high numbers
from the coronavirus pandemic period undermine arguments that the virus
is merely killing vulnerable people who would have died anyway.

Our charts show weekly deaths above or below normal. They include weeks
in which the C.D.C. estimates the data to be at least 90 percent
complete or estimated deaths are above expected death numbers. Because
states vary somewhat in their speed in reporting deaths to the federal
government, these state charts show death trends for slightly different
time periods.

Recent totals were compared with a simple model of expected deaths based
on the number of deaths in the past three years, adjusted to account for
trends over time, like population changes.

Public health researchers use such methods to measure the impact of
catastrophic events when official measures of mortality are flawed.

Measuring excess deaths does not tell us precisely how each person died.
It is likely that most of the excess deaths in this period are because
of the coronavirus itself, given the dangerousness of the virus and the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html}{well-documented}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-testing-trump.html}{problems}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html}{with
testing}. But it is also possible that deaths from other causes have
risen too, as hospitals in some hot spots have become overwhelmed and
people have been scared to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html}{seek
care for ailments} that are typically survivable. Some causes of death
may be declining, as people stay inside more, drive less and limit their
contact with others.

Even in a normal year, it takes up to eight weeks for full death counts
to be reported by the C.D.C. But this is not a normal year, and it is
possible that because of the unusual number of recent deaths and the
stresses they are placing on medical examiners and public health
officials, the totals will take even longer than usual to become
complete. We will keep updating the numbers regularly as new data
becomes available.

\hypertarget{where-deaths-are-somewhat-above-normal}{%
\subsection{Where deaths are somewhat above
normal}\label{where-deaths-are-somewhat-above-normal}}

In another group of states, the increases in deaths were more modest but
still higher than normal.

reported so far

There are only four states that appear to have been largely spared from
an unusual number of deaths during this period and show death numbers
that look similar to those in a normal year. Two of those states ---
Alaska and Hawaii --- are outside the continental U.S.

\subsection{How excess deaths compare with the official coronavirus

In many states with excess deaths, the total number of them exceeded the
official number of measured Covid-19 deaths. Given the ongoing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html}{limitations
on coronavirus testing} in the United States, these gaps are not a big
surprise. Similar gaps have been found in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{other
countries} with high numbers of Covid-19 deaths.

Methodology

Total death numbers are estimates from the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm}{Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention}, based on death certificates counted
by the centers, adjusted to account for typical lags in the reporting of
deaths. Coronavirus death numbers are from the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{New
York Times database} of reports from state and local health agencies and
hospitals. Covid-19 deaths include both confirmed and probable deaths
from the virus.

We have not included weeks where reported deaths were less than 50
percent of the C.D.C. estimate.

Expected deaths were calculated with a simple model based on the weekly
number of all-cause deaths from 2017 to 2019 released by the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm}{Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention}, adjusted to account for trends, like
population changes, over time.

Excess death numbers are rounded.
