The current surge in coronavirus cases in the United States is being
driven by states that were among the first to reopen their economies,
decisions that epidemiologists warned could lead to a wave of
infections.

\hypertarget{percent-change-in-average-daily-cases-since-reopening}{%
\subsubsection{Percent change in average daily cases since
reopening}\label{percent-change-in-average-daily-cases-since-reopening}}

\hypertarget{based-on-a-7-day-rolling-average-in-states-with-at-least-2000-total-cases}{%
\paragraph{Based on a 7-day rolling average in states with at least
2,000 total
cases.}\label{based-on-a-7-day-rolling-average-in-states-with-at-least-2000-total-cases}}

Florida and South Carolina were among the first to open up and are now
among the states leading the current surge. In contrast, the states that
bore the brunt of cases in March and April but were slower to reopen
have seen significant decreases in reported cases since. Average daily
cases in New York are down 52 percent since it reopened in late May and
down 83 percent in Massachusetts.

The reopening dates shown here come from a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html}{New
York Times database} tracking when states lifted orders to stay at home
or allowed major sectors such as retail, restaurants and personal care
services to reopen either statewide or in most areas. (In the charts
above and below, states with fewer than 2,000 total cases are excluded.)

\paragraph{7-day rolling average of daily cases. Each state has its own
scale.}\label{7-day-rolling-average-of-daily-cases-each-state-has-its-own-scale}}

Note: South Dakota had not ordered closures but updated guidance for
businesses and residents on April 28.

\textbf{South Carolina} --- the first state to reopen retail stores ---
continues to set records for reported cases. On Wednesday, the average
daily case count was 1,570, up from 143 from when the state reopened.
State health officials estimate that they have identified just
\href{https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article244080492.html}{14
percent of cases}, since most go undiagnosed.

Cases in \textbf{Georgia} are up 245 percent since late April, prompting
some cities to require the use of face masks. These local mandates
\href{https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/growing-number-georgia-cities-require-masks-over-kemp-objection/rLK5RODzq1EVJiyebeIi2H/}{go
further} than a statewide order signed by Gov. Brian Kemp that
encourages, but doesn't require, masks.

\paragraph{7-day rolling average of daily cases. Each state has its own
scale.}\label{7-day-rolling-average-of-daily-cases-each-state-has-its-own-scale-1}}

\textbf{Florida} has seen a more than tenfold increase in average daily
cases since it began reopening in early May. Public health officials
said the return to bars, restaurants and house parties was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-florida-miami.html}{the
cause} for the spike. The state has since shut down on-site drinking at
bars. Florida is not alone --- more than a third of states are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html}{pausing
or reversing} plans to reopen.

\textbf{Arizona} --- on top of seeing a spike in cases --- has the
\href{https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/07/07/why-arizonas-percent-positive-tests-highest-country/5386600002/}{highest
rate of positive tests} in the country, with nearly 1 in 4 coming back
positive. The nationwide rate is
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html}{roughly
9 percent}.

\hypertarget{states-that-reopened-later}{%

\paragraph{7-day rolling average of daily cases. Each state has its own
scale.}\label{7-day-rolling-average-of-daily-cases-each-state-has-its-own-scale-2}}

Among the first states to be affected by the coronavirus,
\textbf{California} is now seeing a spike in cases. The state was once
seen as a model for how to contain the virus, but
\href{https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/6/21308351/california-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak}{experts
blame} the current surge on an inconsistent adoption of prevention
strategies and a haphazard reopening process that gave people a false
sense that they were
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html}{in
the clear}.

\textbf{New York}, once the epicenter of the virus, has seen average
daily case numbers plummet along with the rate of positive test results,
which sits at
\href{https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-DailyTracker?\%3Aembed=yes\&\%3Atoolbar=no\&\%3Atabs=n}{1
percent}. The state is still reopening, but a full return to normal is a
ways off, especially as hotspots emerge across the country. In an effort
to prevent a resurgence of the virus in the region, New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut issued a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-states-quarantine.html}{joint
travel advisory} requiring travelers from hotspots to quarantine for two
weeks. Violators would be fined, but an enforcement mechanism isn't
currently in place.

President Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007202247/trump-tulsa-rally.html}{has
blamed} the rapid growth in cases on an increase in tests, but testing
alone does not explain the surge. The United States is conducting nearly
three times as many tests as earlier in the outbreak, but the growth in
cases is outpacing the growth in testing in at least
\href{https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-testing-growth-62d6256b-33e2-491d-b94e-91110a74bc85.html}{half
of states}. Shortages of test kits remain
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html}{a
widespread problem}, with reports of some testing sites running out of
supplies just minutes after opening.

\hypertarget{percent-change-in-average-daily-cases-and-testing-since-reopening}{%
\subsubsection{Percent change in average daily cases and testing since
reopening}\label{percent-change-in-average-daily-cases-and-testing-since-reopening}}

\hypertarget{based-on-7-day-rolling-averages}{%
\paragraph{Based on 7-day rolling
averages.}\label{based-on-7-day-rolling-averages}}

Additionally, this wave of cases across the country differs from the
early outbreak --- while older people were primarily affected before,
younger people are now making up
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-cases-young-people.html}{a
much greater share} of new cases.

Because younger people are driving the spike in new cases, death tallies
are not rising as sharply. But experts warn that the United States may
be
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/health/coronavirus-mortality-testing.html}{on
the verge} of a wave of deaths. Earlier in the pandemic, when testing
was more limited, deaths lagged cases by a week or two. With the more
widespread testing being done now, that interval is now more like two to
four weeks.
