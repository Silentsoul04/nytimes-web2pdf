Two newlyweds leave their tiny rental for something affordable in Hell's
Kitchen --- maybe even a one-bedroom. Which of these options would you
choose?

About three years ago, Ilya Lachugin joined Alex Sato in his tiny Hell's
Kitchen apartment. The West 50s studio was on the top floor of a prewar
elevator building, with a rent of about \$2,000 a month for a little
more than 200 square feet. The kitchen was in an alcove.

``We had a stove, sink and refrigerator --- that's all,'' Mr. Lachugin
said. ``I cook, Alex cleans.''

Mr. Lachugin, 33, who is originally from Moscow, yearned to buy a home.
In a rental, he said, ``you never can relax. In my mind, you always have
to worry about the lease, and it is not a place for yourself.''

Mr. Sato, 46, who is from São Paulo, Brazil, felt no particular urgency
to buy, although it did seem financially prudent. ``I came to New York
for work and ended up staying,'' he said. ``In the back of my head, I
always thought it was going to be a temporary situation, that I would go
back to Brazil. With Ilya, now I have a family.'' The two were married
last year.

Mr. Lachugin constantly browsed online listings, and last winter the
couple decided to visit some open houses. They were hoping to find a
studio in a co-op building for around \$300,000, although they could pay
more if necessary.

And they wanted to stay in Hell's Kitchen, preferring a smaller place
there to a bigger place elsewhere in the city.

When he first moved to the neighborhood, Mr. Lachugin felt it was
crowded with people and traffic, but it had grown on him. The couple
often walked their French bulldog, Mamma, in Central Park. And both
enjoyed walking to their offices in Midtown, where Mr. Lachugin works as
a financial analyst and Mr. Sato works at a technology company.

One essential was a nice kitchen --- ``or at least the potential to make
it nice,'' Mr. Lachugin said. They also wanted a sublet policy that
would let them rent the home if they wished.

Among their options:

One-Bedroom in Need of Renovation

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/30/realestate/30Hunt-Sato-09/30Hunt-Sato-09-master315.jpg}

This corner one-bedroom in a 1903 Beaux-Arts doorman building,
originally a hotel, was about 700 square feet and faced the back,
receiving northern and western light. It was an estate sale, and a full
renovation would be required. The price was \$498,000, with monthly
maintenance of around \$1,100.

Studio in Walk-up Building

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/30/realestate/30Hunt-Sato-08/30Hunt-Sato-08-master315.jpg}

This studio, with about 300 square feet, was on the third floor of a
five-story walk-up, facing the back. It had exposed brick, beamed
ceilings, a decorative fireplace and a renovated bathroom. The price was
\$299,000, with maintenance of around \$800.

Studio in Elevator Building

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/30/realestate/30Hunt-Sato-07/30Hunt-Sato-07-master315.jpg}

This rectangular studio, with around 350 square feet, was in a nicely
maintained 1930 elevator building and faced west, with a glimpse of sky.
It had a small kitchen and a walk-in closet. The price was \$310,000,
with maintenance of just under \$900.
