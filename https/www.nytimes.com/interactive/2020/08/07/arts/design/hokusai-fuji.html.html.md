It’s not his most famous work, but this is my favorite woodblock print

Today Hokusai stands — for Western audiences, and in Asia too — at the
pinnacle of “Japanese art.” But if you told the grandees of 19th-century
Edo that Hokusai would become the most famous artist in the country’s
history, they’d never believe you.

Let’s start with the road. A serpentine passage cuts through an ordinary
little marsh, on a highway that connects Kyoto to Edo (now Tokyo). No

Look closely at its most compelling figure: a woman whose striped blue

Fuji is so modest, in this most famous of the “Thirty-Six Views,” that
some viewers confuse it for foam on the waves. And that, too, is a clue

The little Fuji, beneath the waves, sits at the composition’s vanishing
point: a hallmark of Renaissance image-making. Hokusai was among the
first Japanese artists to employ Western perspective, though he used it
playfully.

foreign goods could come in, via Nagasaki — such as the rich Prussian
blue ink used here.

Do you see, here, how the traveler in the back is so much smaller than
the woman who’s lost her papers? And how sharply the landscape slopes
up? Hokusai would have picked up this perspectival technique from Dutch
prints circulating in Edo . . .

even as elsewhere, in the same image, Hokusai employs a perspectival
technique common in Asian painting, with similarly sized figures
positioned along diagonal sightlines. That, too, was imported knowledge,
absorbed from Chinese examples into earlier Japanese painting.

opened up, would his own papers float beyond the archipelago.

industrialization, saw themselves in landscapes that were both ageless

And in that light they would also elevate Hokusai into the highest
exemplar of Japanese high art. A whole museum in Tokyo is devoted to his
work alone.

By the turn of the millennium, Hokusai was no longer an exotic import to
Western image-making, but a global master. In 1993, the photographer
Jeff Wall completed “A Sudden Gust of Wind (After Hokusai),” shot at a
cranberry farm in British Columbia.

It’s one of this great Canadian photographer’s most complex images, and
channels Hokusai in a totally different way to the Japonistes of modern
Paris.

The photograph does not capture a single moment. It’s a composition of
more than one hundred exposures, joined as cunningly as the woodblocks
in Hokusai’s printer’s studio.

Here we have a Canadian photographer nourished by French modern art,
which was nourished by Japanese printmaking, which was nourished by
Dutch book illustration and Chinese painting. The wind has blown from
the printing house to the darkroom, across the Pacific and the Atlantic.

Hokusai already knew, in 1830, how quickly and thoroughly an image’s
meaning can change. It’s already there in the picture of Ejiri.

The mountain rises against a largely empty sky. Against all the road’s
activity — the wind, the dashed marsh grass, the color — Fuji is just a
single, calligraphic stroke: swoop up, slash right, swoop down.

<div class="caption-wrapper">

<div class="caption" data-x1="0" data-y1="0" data-x2="0.55" data-y2="0.43">

An ordinary artist would picture Fuji as a vision of beauty, a symbol of
permanence. But Hokusai, the sharpest of ironists, does the opposite.

<div class="caption" data-x1="0.14" data-y1="0.14" data-x2="0.34" data-y2="0.34">

In this “view” of Fuji, the wind is so strong and sudden that it has
washed the mountain away. It’s as if Fuji, when these storm-struck
travelers can’t see it, recedes from our view as well.

<div class="caption-wrapper">

<div class="caption" data-x1="0.26" data-y1="0.30" data-x2="0.72" data-y2="0.73">

Here, in a crummy little marsh under Fuji, Hokusai gave us a vision of
culture in constant motion.

Because art’s meaning lies not only in what it looks like, but in how it
circulates. And if you can’t fully control circulation, you can’t fully
control meaning either. Least of all today, when digital images blow
every which way.

You hold on to what you can in this explosion of images. But the
mountain fades in the distance, and the papers end up in the air.
