The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges modern medicine
has ever faced. Doctors and scientists are scrambling to find treatments
and drugs that can save the lives of infected people and perhaps even
prevent infection.

Below is an updated list of **19 of the most-talked-about treatments for
the coronavirus**. While some are accumulating evidence that they’re
effective, most are still at early stages of research. We also included
a warning about a few that are just
bunk.

There is no cure yet for Covid-19. And even the most promising
treatments to date only help certain groups of patients, and await
validation from further trials. The F.D.A. has not fully licensed any
treatment specifically for the coronavirus, but it has granted
[emergency use
authorization](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization)
to a few.

## <span class="xg-balancer" data-id="14">What the Labels Mean</span>

<span class="g-wide">**WIDELY USED**</span>: These treatments have been
used widely by doctors and nurses to treat patients hospitalized for
diseases that affect the respiratory system, including Covid-19.

<span class="g-promising">**PROMISING EVIDENCE**</span>: Early evidence
from studies on patients suggests effectiveness, but more research is
needed. This category includes treatments that have shown improvements
in morbidity, mortality and recovery in at least one randomized
controlled trial, in which some people get a treatment and others get a
placebo.

<span class="g-mixed">**TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE**</span>: Some
treatments show promising results in cells or animals, which need to be
confirmed in people. Others have yielded encouraging results in
retrospective studies in humans, which look at existing datasets rather
than starting a new trial. Some treatments have produced different
results in different experiments, raising the need for larger, more
rigorously designed studies to clear up the confusion.

<span class="g-not">**NOT PROMISING**</span>: **** Early evidence
suggests that these treatments do not work.

<span class="g-fraud">**PSEUDOSCIENCE OR FRAUD**</span>: These are not
treatments that researchers have ever considered using for Covid-19.
Experts have warned against trying them, because they do not help
against the disease and can instead be dangerous. Some people have even
been arrested for their false promises of a Covid-19 cure.

<span class="g-tname">Remdesivir</span>  
[Remdesivir](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html),
made by Gilead Sciences, was the first drug to get emergency
authorization from the F.D.A. for use on Covid-19. It stops viruses from
replicating by inserting itself into new viral genes. Remdesivir was
originally tested as an antiviral against Ebola and Hepatitis C, only to
deliver lackluster results. But preliminary data from trials that began
this spring suggested the drug can reduce the recovery time of people
hospitalized with Covid-19 from [15 to 11
days](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764). (The study
defined recovery as “either discharge from the hospital or
hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.”) These early
results did not show any effect on mortality, though retrospective data
released in July hints that the drug might [reduce death
rates](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/7/gilead-presents-additional-data-on-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19)

<span id="favipiravir"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Favipiravir</span>  
Originally designed to beat back influenza, favipiravir blocks a virus’s
ability to copy its genetic material. A [small
study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920300631?via%3Dihub)
in March indicated the drug might help purge the coronavirus from the
airway, but results from larger, well-designed clinical trials are still
pending.

<span id="ace2"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>

To enter cells, the coronavirus must first [unlock

— a feat it accomplishes by latching onto a human protein called ACE-2.
Scientists have created artificial ACE-2 proteins which might be able to
act as decoys, luring the coronavirus away from vulnerable cells.
Recombinant ACE-2 proteins have shown promising
[results](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004) in experiments on

<span id="lopinavir"></span>

<span class="g-not">NOT PROMISING</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Lopinavir and ritonavir</span>  
Twenty years ago, the F.D.A. approved this combination of drugs to treat
H.I.V. Recently, researchers tried them out on the new coronavirus and
found that they stopped the virus from replicating. But clinical trials
in patients proved disappointing. In early July, the World Health
Organization
[suspended](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/04-07-2020-who-discontinues-hydroxychloroquine-and-lopinavir-ritonavir-treatment-arms-for-covid-19)
trials on patients hospitalized for Covid-19. But they didn’t rule out
studies to see if the drugs could help patients not sick enough to be
hospitalized, or to prevent people exposed to the new coronavirus from
falling ill. The drug could also still have a role to play in certain
[combination
treatments](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31042-4/fulltext).

<span id="hydroxychloroquine"></span>

<span class="g-not">NOT PROMISING</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine</span>  
German chemists synthesized chloroquine in the 1930s as a drug against
malaria. A less toxic version, called hydroxychloroquine, was [invented
in 1946](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0#:~:text=Hydroxychloroquine%20\(HCQ\)%20sulfate%2C%20a,than%20CQ%20in%20animals4.),
and later was approved for other diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers discovered
that both drugs could stop the coronavirus from replicating in cells.
Since then, they’ve had a tumultuous ride. A few small studies on
patients offered some hope that hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19.
The World Health Organization launched a randomized clinical trial in
March to see if it was indeed safe and effective for Covid-19, as did
Novartis and a number of universities.  
  
Meanwhile, President Trump repeatedly [promoted
hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-malaria-drug.html)
at press conferences, touting it as a “game changer,” and even [took it
himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-coronavirus.html).
The F.D.A. temporarily granted hydroxychloroquine emergency
authorization for use in Covid-19 patients — which a whistleblower later
[claimed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/fda-eua-hydroxychloroquine-chloroquine)
was the result of political pressure. In the wake of the drug’s newfound
publicity, [demand
spiked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-trump-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine.html),
resulting in
[shortages](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/07/01/annrheumdis-2020-218164)
for people who rely on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for other
diseases.  
  
But more detailed studies proved disappointing. A
[study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2558-4) on monkeys
found that hydroxychloroquine didn’t prevent the animals from getting
infected and didn’t clear the virus once they got sick. Randomized
clinical trials found that hydroxychloroquine [didn’t help people with
Covid-19 get
better](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19)
or [prevent healthy people from contracting the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html).
Another [randomized clinical
trial](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-4207) found that
giving hydroxychloroquine to people right after being diagnosed with
Covid-19 didn’t reduce the severity of their disease. (One large-scale
study that concluded the drug was harmful as well was later
[retracted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html?searchResultPosition=1).)
The [World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/04-07-2020-who-discontinues-hydroxychloroquine-and-lopinavir-ritonavir-treatment-arms-for-covid-19),
the National Institutes of Health and Novartis have since halted trials
investigating hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, and the
F.D.A. [revoked its emergency
approval](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html).
The F.D.A. now
[warns](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or)
that the drug can cause a host of serious side effects to the heart and
other organs when used to treat Covid-19.  
  
In July, researchers at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit published a
[study](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/08/a-flawed-covid-19-study-gets-the-white-houses-attention-and-the-fda-may-pay-the-price/)
finding that hydroxychloroquine reduced mortality in Covid-19 patients.
President Trump [praised the study on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280328830218051584),
but experts raised doubts about it because it was not a randomized
controlled trial. Still, the White House has initiated a push for the
F.D.A. to reauthorize hydroxychloroquine as an emergency Covid-19
treatment.  
  
Despite negative results, a number of hydroxychloroquine trials have
continued. A recent analysis by STAT and Applied XL found more than 180
[ongoing clinical
trials](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/06/data-show-panic-and-disorganization-dominate-the-study-of-covid-19-drugs/)
testing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, for treating or preventing
Covid-19. Although it’s clear the drugs are no panacea, it’s possible
they could work in combination with other treatments, or when given in
early stages of the disease.

<span id="plasma"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Convalescent plasma</span>  
A century ago, doctors filtered plasma from the blood of recovered flu
patients. So-called convalescent plasma, rich with antibodies, helped
people sick with flu fight their illness. Now researchers are trying out
this
[strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/smarter-living/coronavirus-convalescent-plasma-antibodies.html?searchResultPosition=1)
on Covid-19. Early trials with convalescent plasma have yielded
[promising, if preliminary,
results](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/health/coronarvirus-convalescent-serum.html?searchResultPosition=2),
and the F.D.A. has authorized its use on very sick patients infected by
the coronavirus.

<span id="monoclonal"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Monoclonal antibodies</span>  
Convalescent plasma contains a mix of different antibodies, some of
which can attack the coronavirus, and some of which can’t. Researchers
have been sifting through the slurry for the most potent antibodies
against Covid-19. Synthetic copies of these molecules, known as
[monoclonal
antibodies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/health/regeneron-monoclonal-antibodies.html),
can be manufactured in bulk and then injected into patients. Safety
trials for this treatment have [only just
begun](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-worlds-first-study-potential-covid-19-antibody),
with several more on the way.

<span id="interferon"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Interferons</span>  
Interferons are molecules our cells naturally produce in response to
viruses, rousing the immune system to attack. Injecting synthetic
interferons is now a standard treatment for a number of immune
disorders.
[Rebif](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Rebif),
for example, is prescribed for multiple sclerosis. Early studies,
including experiments in
[mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32511406/) and
[cells](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa350/5860074),
hint that injecting interferons may help against Covid-19. An open-label
study in China suggested that the molecules could [help prevent healthy
people from getting
infected](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061473v2).
On July 20, the British pharmaceutical company Synairgen
[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/world/covid-19-treatment-synairgen-interferon-beta.html)
that an inhaled form of interferon called SNG001 lowered the risk of
severe Covid-19 in infected patients in a small clinical trial. The full
data have not yet been released to the public, or published in a
scientific journal.

<span id="dexamethasone"></span>

<span class="g-promising">PROMISING EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Dexamethasone</span>  
This cheap and widely available steroid blunts many types of immune
responses. Doctors have long used it to treat allergies, asthma and
inflammation. In June, it became the first drug shown to [reduce
Covid-19
deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html?searchResultPosition=5).
That
[study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2021436?query=featured_home)
of more than 6,000 people, which in July was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine, found that dexamethasone reduced deaths by
one-third in patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth in patients on
oxygen. It may be [less likely to
help](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/health/coronavirus-dexamethasone.html?searchResultPosition=2)
— and may even harm — patients who are at an earlier stage of Covid-19
infections, however. In its Covid-19 treatment guidelines, the National
Institutes of Health
[recommends](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/dexamethasone/)
only using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who are on a
ventilator or are receiving supplemental oxygen.

<span id="cytokine"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Cytokine Inhibitors</span>  
The body produces signaling molecules called cytokines to fight off
diseases. But manufactured in excess, cytokines can trigger the immune
system to wildly overreact to infections, in a process sometimes called
a cytokine storm. Researchers have created a number of drugs to halt
cytokine storms, and they have proven effective against arthritis and
other inflammatory disorders. Some turn off the supply of molecules that
launch the production of the cytokines themselves. Others block the
receptors on immune cells to which cytokines would normally bind. A few
block the cellular messages they send.  
  
Against the coronavirus, several of these drugs, including tocilizumab,
sarilumab and
[anakinra](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41422), have
[offered modest
help](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20119149v2) in
some trials, but faltered in others. The drug company Regeneron recently
announced that a branded version of sarilumab, Kevzara,
[failed](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/02/us/02reuters-health-coronavirus-regeneron-pharms.html)

<span class="g-tname">Cytosorb</span>  
Cytosorb is a cartridge that [filters
cytokines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm.html)from
the blood in an attempt to cool cytokine storms. The machine can purify
a patient’s entire blood supply about 70 times in a 24-hour period. It
was [granted emergency use
authorization](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2020/novel-blood-filter-approved-fda-emergency-treatment-covid-19)
by the F.D.A. for Covid-19 based on a small study in March suggesting
that it had helped dozens of severely ill Covid-19 patients in Europe
and China. [Further
trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid-19&term=cytosorb&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=)
on patients with Covid-19 are now underway.

<span id="stemcells"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Stem cells</span>  
Certain kinds of stem cells can secrete anti-inflammatory molecules.
Over the years, researchers have tried to use them as a [treatment for
cytokine
storms](https://celltrials.org/news/role-msc-treat-coronavirus-pneumonia-and-ards-part-1-is-emperor-wearing-clothes),
and now dozens of clinical
[trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=stem+cell&cond=COVID-19&age_v=&gndr=&type=&rslt=&phase=0&phase=1&phase=2&phase=3&Search=Apply)
are under way to see if they can help patients with Covid-19. But these
stem cell treatments haven’t worked well in the past, and it’s not clear
yet if they’ll work against the coronavirus.

The maneuver has become commonplace in hospitals around the world since
the start of the pandemic. It might help some individuals avoid the need
for ventilators entirely. The treatment’s benefits continue to be tested
in a range of clinical trials.

<span id="ventilators"></span>

<span class="g-wide">WIDELY USED</span>
<span class="g-emergency">EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Ventilators and other respiratory support
devices</span>  
Devices that help people breathe are an essential tool in the fight
against deadly respiratory illnesses. Some patients do well if they get
an extra supply of oxygen through the nose or via a mask connected to an
oxygen machine. Patients in severe respiratory distress may need to have
a [ventilator breathe for
them](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-covid-lungs-ventilators.html)
until their lungs heal. Doctors are divided about how long to treat
patients with noninvasive oxygen before deciding whether or not they
need a ventilator. Not all Covid-19 patients who go on ventilators
survive, but the devices are thought to be [lifesaving in many
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/health/coronavirus-patient-ventilator.html).

<span id="anticoagulants"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Anticoagulants</span>  
The coronavirus can invade cells in the lining of blood vessels, leading
to tiny clots that can cause strokes and other serious harm.
Anticoagulants are commonly used for other conditions, such as heart
disease, to slow the formation of clots, and doctors sometimes use them
on patients with Covid-19 who have clots. Many clinical trials teasing
out this relationship are now underway. Some of these trials are looking
at whether giving anticoagulants before any sign of clotting is
beneficial.

Researchers have used UV light to sterilize surfaces, including killing
viruses, in carefully managed laboratories. But UV light would not be
able to purge the virus from within a sick persons’ body. This kind of

<span id="note"></span><span class="g-sync">Note: After additional
discussions with experts we have adjusted several labels on the tracker.
The “<span style="font-weight: 600;">Strong evidence</span>” label has
been removed until further research identifies treatments that
consistently benefit groups of patients infected by the coronavirus. In
its place, “<span style="font-weight: 600;">Promising evidence</span>”
will be used for drugs such as remdesivir and dexamethasone that have
shown promise in at least one randomized controlled trial, and
“<span style="font-weight: 600;">Widely used</span>” for treatments
such as proning and ventilators that are often used with severely ill
patients, including those with Covid-19. And we may reintroduce the
“<span style="font-weight: 600;">Ineffective</span>” label when
ongoing clinical trials repeatedly end with disappointing
results.</span>
