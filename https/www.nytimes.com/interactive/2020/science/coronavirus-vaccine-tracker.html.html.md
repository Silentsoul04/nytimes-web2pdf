Researchers around the world are developing [more than 165
vaccines](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines)
against the coronavirus, and **27 vaccines** are in human trials.
Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching
the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a [safe and effective
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html)
by next
year.

Work began in January with the deciphering of the [SARS-CoV-2
genome](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html).
The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, but the road
ahead remains uncertain. Some trials will fail, and others may end
without a clear result. But a few may succeed in stimulating the immune
system to produce effective antibodies against the virus.

Here is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in
humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested
in cells or animals.

<span class="g-phase0">PRECLINICAL TESTING</span>: Scientists give the
vaccine to **animals** such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an

<span class="g-phase1">PHASE I SAFETY TRIALS</span>: Scientists give the
vaccine to a **small number of people** to test safety and dosage as
well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system.

<span class="g-phase2">PHASE II EXPANDED TRIALS</span>: Scientists give
the vaccine to **hundreds of people** split into groups, such as
children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in
them. These trials further test the vaccine’s safety and ability to
stimulate the immune system.

<span class="g-phase3">PHASE III EFFICACY TRIALS</span>: Scientists give
the vaccine to **thousands of people** and wait to see how many become
infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials
can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June,
the F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to [protect at
least 50% of vaccinated

hundreds of people. (Note that our tracker would count a combined Phase
I/II trial as both Phase I and Phase II.)

Pharma** to develop their mRNA vaccine. In July, they posted preliminary
results from their Phase I/II trials in the [United

and
[Germany](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533v1).
They found that the volunteers produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,
as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. Some
volunteers experienced moderate side effects such as sleep disturbances
and sore arms. On July 27, they announced the
[launch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200727005800/en/Pfizer-BioNTech-Choose-Lead-mRNA-Vaccine-Candidate)

The Trump administration
[awarded](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
a $1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by

Japan made a

by the British-Swedish company **AstraZeneca** and the **University of

causing no severe side effects. It raised antibodies against the
coronavirus as well as other immune defenses. The vaccine is now in a
Phase II/III trial in England, as well as Phase III trials in Brazil and
South Africa. The project may deliver emergency vaccines by October.
AstraZeneca has said their total manufacturing capacity for the vaccine,
if approved, stands at two billion doses.

In collaboration with the **Indian Council of Medical Research** and the
**National Institute of Virology**, the Indian company **Bharat
Biotech** designed a vaccine called Covaxin based on an inactivated form
of the coronavirus. When the company launched Phase I/II trials in July,
[reports](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-india-bharat-biote/health-experts-cast-doubt-on-indias-timeline-for-covid-vaccine-idUKKBN2440XD)
circulated that the vaccine would be ready by August 15. But the C.E.O.
of Bharat
[told](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jul/03/interview--covaxin-by-2021-if-all-goes-well-bharat-biotech-chairman-2164708.html)
reporters it would be available no sooner than early 2021.

<span class="g-phase1">PHASE I ?</span>

On July 18, **North Korea**’s State Commission of Science and Technology
announced on their web site that they had started clinical trials on a
vaccine based on part of the coronavirus spike protein. It’s hard to
independently determine how much truth there is in the claim from the
isolated dictatorship. The commission claimed to have tested the vaccine
on animals, but provided no data. What’s more, it stated that
effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another country
“since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea.” That’s a claim
outside experts find [highly
doubtful](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html).

The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine was developed in the early 1900s as
a protection against tuberculosis. The **Murdoch Children’s Research
Institute** in Australia is [conducting a Phase III
trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/health/coronavirus-bcg-vaccine.html),
and several other trials are underway to see if the vaccine partly
protects against the coronavirus.

Note: Vaccines will be added to the tracker when they reach **Phase I**,
and tracked until they succeed or fail.
