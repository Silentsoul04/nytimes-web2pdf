# How The Virus Got In

<span class="grafs-wrap"> </span>

The China travel ban was a partial success**:** Only a handful of
infected travelers from China are estimated to have made it into the
country undetected before restrictions were imposed on Feb. 2.

But it wasn’t
enough.

<span class="grafs-wrap"> </span>

A vast wave of **infected travelers** — roughly 1,000, one model
suggests — came from other countries in Asia, Europe and the rest of the
world in February, each a dangerous spark that could set off a wider
outbreak.

# How the First Outbreaks Spread

<span class="grafs-wrap"> </span>

Top federal health experts concluded by late February that the virus was
likely to spread widely within the United States and that government
officials would soon need to urge the public to embrace social
distancing measures, such as avoiding crowds and staying home.

But Mr. Trump wanted to avoid disrupting the economy. So some of his
health advisers, at Mr. Trump’s urging, told Americans at the end of
February to continue to travel domestically and go on with their normal
lives.

Researchers with the Seattle Flu Study ignored C.D.C. testing
restrictions and uncovered a single case with no travel history in late
February. This was the first sign that the outbreak had spun badly out
of control.

Over the two weeks that followed, people made about **4.3 million
trips** from the Seattle
area.

Faced with an outbreak that had grown beyond their ability to test or

On March 16, weeks after health officials privately concluded a more
active response would be needed, President Trump asked Americans to
limit travel, avoid groups and stay home from work and school if they
felt sick. One by one, states issued stay-at-home orders and closed

But every day mattered to halt the virus in New York City, where
political leaders waited crucial days to close schools and impose a
stay-at-home order as the virus spun out of
control.

New cases slowed in San Francisco, Seattle and other places where
measures were taken relatively quickly. Hospital beds stayed open. The
worst was kept at bay.

But in New York City, the response was too late, said Lauren Ancel
Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin. Other
factors, such as the city’s density and its rate of international
travel, also may have played a role, Dr. Meyers
said.

**More than 22,000 deaths** in the New York City area could have been
avoided if the country had started social distancing just one week
earlier, Columbia University researchers
estimate.

Even now, America remains in the dark.

Most infected people are never tested. There is little capacity to trace
and isolate the contacts to those who do test positive. After the
lockdowns expired, new cases spiked once
again.

In recent weeks, new outbreaks flared across the South and the West.

These are only the cases we know about. No one can see where the virus
will go
next.

**Notes:**  
Our understanding of the early outbreak in the United States draws on
case reports, travel patterns, genetic sequencing and disease modeling
that simulates the course of the outbreak based on how it spread and
what is known about the virus. All models are estimates, and it is
impossible to know for certain the origin of each infection or the
number of infections that were not confirmed by testing.  
  
There are no comprehensive, official counts of cases, deaths or tests
throughout the United States. Known cases are from a [New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
based on information from federal, state and local officials. Cases are
shown by [core-based statistical
areas](https://www.census.gov/topics/housing/housing-patterns/about/core-based-statistical-areas.html),
or by county for cases outside of those areas. The first 15 cases are
labeled by statistical area. Those labels may not match the names of the
exact cities in which cases were seen.  
  
The travel patterns we show represent movement between core-based
statistical areas, based on aggregated, anonymous cellphone location
data collected by
[Cuebiq](https://www.cuebiq.com/visitation-insights-covid19/), a data
intelligence firm that tracks the locations of more than 15 million
cellphones in the United States. The data captures trips, not unique
travelers, and it includes commutes between statistical areas as well as
longer-distance travel. Some minor and short routes are not shown.
Reductions in movement due to social distancing are based measurements
by Cuebiq of the median range that people in each area travel each day.
The effects of social distancing are from Lauren Gardner, et al.,
“[Social Distancing Is Effective at Mitigating Covid-19 Transmission
in the United
States](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.20092353v1).”  
  
Estimates of the number of [undetected infections in 11 American
cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/coronavirus-early-outbreaks-cities.html)
are from modeling by Northeastern University, as are the estimates of
the number of undetected infected travelers who came into the United
States from other countries. See Matteo Chinazzi and Jessica T. Davis,
et al. "[The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019
novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
outbreak](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6489/395)"
Science.  
  
Estimates of the number of contagious people who left New York and
Seattle are from modeling by Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman at Columbia
University. Estimates of the number of deaths that [could have been
avoided](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-distancing-deaths.html)
with earlier social distancing are from Dr. Pei, et al., “[Differential
Effects of Intervention Timing on Covid-19 Spread in the United
States](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103655v2).”  
  
Genetic samples of the virus are from
[Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america). We show the
samples grouped by names that were assigned prior to May 1, 2020. The
connection of American outbreaks to [travel from New York
City](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
is based on a Times analysis of travel patterns and analysis of genetic
mutations by Trevor Bedford, associate professor, Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center and the University of Washington.  
  
Conclusions from federal health officials in February about the likely
spread of the virus are from [Times
reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html).
Mr. Trump said that cases would be close to zero within days at a
[Feb. 26 press
conference](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/).
Health advisers urged Americans to go on with their normal lives in a
[Feb. 29 press
conference](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference-2/).
Mr. de Blasio encouraged New Yorkers to do the same [in a tweet on
March 2](https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio/status/1234648718714036229).
Mr. Trump recommended that Americans avoid travel at [a press conference
on
March 16](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-3/).
