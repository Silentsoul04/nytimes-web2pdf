The number of daily coronavirus tests being conducted in the United
States is only \textbf{43 percent} of the level considered necessary to
mitigate the spread of the virus, as many states struggle to increase
testing and catch up to the recent surge in cases.

*Includes 8 states and Washington, D.C. States within 20 percent of the
testing target are considered ``near'' the target.

An average of \textbf{785,000 people per day} were tested over the past
week, according to data collected by
\href{https://covidtracking.com/}{the Covid Tracking Project}, far below
the current nationwide target of \textbf{1.8 million daily tests}. The
target, which is based on a methodology developed by researchers at the
Harvard Global Health Institute, is different for each state and varies
over time as infection rates change.

\hypertarget{how-each-states-current-testing-measures-up}{%
\subsubsection{How each state's current testing measures
up}\label{how-each-states-current-testing-measures-up}}

\hypertarget{average-daily-testing-and-hospitalizations-in-the-last-two-weeks}{%
\paragraph{Average daily testing and hospitalizations in the last two
weeks}\label{average-daily-testing-and-hospitalizations-in-the-last-two-weeks}}

Note: In many states, if a person is tested more than once, each test is
counted in data for total tests. Some states, including Nevada, Rhode
Island and Wyoming, report the actual number of people tested, which is
a more accurate way to measure the share of a population that has been
tested, but can result in a lower number of total tests. Positive test
rates and percentages of targets are calculated using cumulative figures
from the last 14 days. All other values are 14-day rolling averages.
Trendlines for daily tests and hospitalizations show averages for the
last two weeks.

Testing operations in the United States were delayed at the start of the
outbreak after tests developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention were found to be faulty. Since then, testing levels have
steadily increased across the country, but many states have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html}{struggled
to stay ahead of new outbreaks} as overwhelmed labs report processing
delays and shortages of crucial testing supplies. The resulting backlog
can leave sick people undiagnosed, with the potential to further spread
the virus as states reopen.

The Harvard researchers say that at minimum there should be enough daily
capacity to test anyone who has flu-like symptoms and an additional 10
people for any symptomatic person who tests positive for the virus. That
level of testing --- which, according to researchers, is the minimum
necessary to mitigate the disease --- would require more than double the
number of daily tests currently being performed. Their estimates for the
testing required to \emph{suppress} the spread of the virus are
\href{https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/}{much
higher}.

Aside from current testing levels, another important indicator of a
state's testing performance is its positive test rate, which is the
percent of tests that come back positive. Lower rates suggest that
testing is more widespread and that it is not limited to those with
severe symptoms. Positive rates should be at or below 5 percent for at
least 14 days before a state or country can safely reopen, according to
the World Health Organization. In the United States, the current
positive rate is \textbf{8 percent}.

levels}\label{where-testing-is-far-below-recommended-levels}}

Most states remain far from the minimum level of testing needed to
reduce the spread of the virus.

Note: Testing targets are calculated daily using the methodology
\href{https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/}{developed}
by the Harvard Global Health Institute (exact figures may differ because
of recent changes in underlying projections). Two-week rolling averages
are calculated using the most recent 14 days for which data is
available. Some states may include non-diagnostic tests, like antibody
tests, in the data they release, which can affect reported testing
rates. Some states don't consistently release data on current
hospitalizations (see more information about missing data
\href{https://covidtracking.com/data}{here}.) Case data is from the
Covid Tracking Project for consistency with daily testing data.
