The senator from Minnesota is campaigning as a Midwestern pragmatist who
gets things done.

Amy Klobuchar

out of the presidential race} on March 2, 2020. This page is no longer

Former Hennepin County attorney; elected to the Senate in 2006

issues}\label{klobuchars-signature-issues}}

Ms. Klobuchar, running as an experienced moderate, has emphasized
throughout her presidential campaign that a bipartisan approach is the
Democrats' best chance at winning the White House.

In May,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/us/politics/klobuchar-addiction-plan.html}{she
released a \$100 billion plan} to combat drug and alcohol addiction and
improve mental health care --- an issue deeply personal to her.

Several weeks later, she unveiled
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/klobuchar-president-plans.html}{a
list of more than 100 actions} she would take in her first 100 days as
president if elected. The list addressed issues such as voting rights,
prescription drugs and antitrust enforcement. She has also released
\href{https://medium.com/@AmyforAmerica/amys-plan-to-build-america-s-infrastructure-671b08a10751}{a
detailed infrastructure plan} and
\href{https://medium.com/@AmyforAmerica/senator-klobuchars-plan-for-seniors-efce83143761}{a
plan to help seniors}.

Ms. Klobuchar drew attention during
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings.html}{the
Senate confirmation hearing for Brett M. Kavanaugh}, President Trump's
second Supreme Court nominee.

Ms. Klobuchar asked him whether he had ever blacked out drinking.
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVtXJtl7lw}{``Have}\emph{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVtXJtl7lw}{you}}\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVtXJtl7lw}{?''
he shot back}, to which she calmly replied, ``I have no drinking
problem, Judge.''

Justice Kavanaugh later apologized to Ms. Klobuchar, whose father
struggled with alcoholism.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Does Ms. Klobuchar actually
get things
done?}}{2. Does Ms. Klobuchar actually get things done?}}\label{2-does-ms-klobuchar-actually-get-things-done}}

Ms. Klobuchar often focuses her attention on issues that can attract
bipartisan support, like many of the ones she addressed in her ``first
100 days'' plan. In general, she has staked out more moderate positions
than some of her Democratic competitors on broad issues like
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2019/democrats-climate-town-hall/amy-klobuchar-climate-change}{climate
change} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-campaign.html}{health
care}.

Her bipartisan approach to politics --- she takes pride in being able to
``disagree without being disagreeable'' --- has won her praise from
colleagues on both sides of the aisle and helped her
\href{https://medium.com/@AmyforAmerica/senator-amy-klobuchar-passed-over-100-bills-as-lead-democrat-29327297d2c}{pass
dozens of bills through Congress}.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. What do Minnesotans think of
her?}}{3. What do Minnesotans think of her?}}\label{3-what-do-minnesotans-think-of-her}}

She is hugely popular in Minnesota and coasted to victory last November
in a state that President Trump nearly won in 2016. She is betting that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-election.html}{her
brand of ``Minnesota nice'' politics} will make her a compelling
candidate, particularly to voters in Iowa and other key Midwestern swing
states.

Ms. Klobuchar also loves reminding voters that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html}{she
kicked off her presidential campaign amid a snowstorm in Minneapolis} in
front of supporters sporting snow pants and ski goggles who turned out
by the thousands.
