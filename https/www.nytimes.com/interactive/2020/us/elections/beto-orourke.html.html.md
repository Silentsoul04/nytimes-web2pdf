# Beto O’Rourke

The former Texas congressman is seeking to regain the momentum he
enjoyed during his 2018 run for Senate.

Beto O’Rourke [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-out.html)
on Nov. 1, 2019. This page is no longer being updated.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is Beto O’Rourke?

<div class="g-bullets">

47 years old

Born in El Paso; lives in his hometown

Former three-term congressman representing El Paso, first elected in
2012

Lost his bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz in 2018

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## O’Rourke’s signature issues

Following a mass shooting in El Paso in August, Mr. O’Rourke has sought
to [reset his
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/beto-orourke-2020-trump.html)
and train his focus on “taking the fight to Donald Trump” over issues
like immigration and gun violence. Rather than tethering himself to
early voting states as he did early in his campaign, he has now spent a
large share of his time in immigrant-rich communities.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Beto O’Rourke

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. So he’s the guy who lost to Ted Cruz?**

Yes, but narrowly.

As he barnstormed towns, live-streamed his travels and spoke with his
signature gusto, Mr. O’Rourke captured the imagination of Democrats in
deep-red Texas and across the nation. He
came[](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate)[within
three percentage points of pulling the
upset](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate), and talk
of a presidential campaign soon followed.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. What’s this about him being in a band?**

Mr. O’Rourke chose to go to Columbia University in part because he
looked up to his uncle, who had tapped into New York’s music scene. At
the time, he went by Robert — Beto was a nickname from El Paso — and he
played the guitar. He and a few of his friends formed a punk rock group.

After returning home to El Paso, Mr. O’Rourke [quickly transitioned from
musician to
businessman](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/us/politics/beto-o-rourke-el-paso-texas.html),
using a loan from his parents to create a web design company and an
online newsmagazine. His brief tenure as a publisher prompted his
interest in civic issues and he joined various local organizations. Mr.
O’Rourke was elected to the El Paso City Council in 2005; he won his
seat in Congress seven years later.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. How has his presidential campaign gone so far?**

He
raised[](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/beto-o-rourke-fundraising.html)[$6.1
million
online](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/beto-o-rourke-fundraising.html)
during his first 24 hours as a presidential candidate. But early on, he
also found himself on the defensive. He had to apologize for joking that
his wife, Amy, was home raising their children, “sometimes with my
help”;
for[](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/beto-orourke-wife-white-privilege/index.html)[writings](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/beto-orourke-wife-white-privilege/index.html)
dating back to his teen years;
and[](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/beto-orourke-wife-white-privilege/index.html)[for
benefiting from white
privilege](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/beto-orourke-wife-white-privilege/index.html).
He was accused of being entitled after appearing
in[](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story)[a
Vanity Fair cover
story](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story)
about the campaign and declaring that he was “just born to be in it.”

In August, a shooting at an El Paso Walmart that left 22 people dead
placed the national spotlight on Mr. O’Rourke, and when he rejoined the
campaign trail after going home to grieve, he made gun control a central
issue.
