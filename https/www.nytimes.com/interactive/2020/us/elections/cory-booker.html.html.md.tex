In a political climate dominated by divisiveness, Mr. Booker has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/cory-booker-2020.html}{pitched
himself as a healer}. Central to his campaign is combating inequality. A
champion of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/senate-criminal-justice-bill.html}{First
Step Act}, he has called for reversing mass incarceration with a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/booker-drugs-clemency.html?rref=collection\%2Fbyline\%2Fnick-corasaniti\&action=click\&contentCollection=undefined\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=9\&pgtype=collection}{sweeping
clemency initiative}, expanding affordable housing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/booker-renters-credit.html}{through
tax credits} and closing the racial wealth gap
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/us/politics/cory-booker-2020-baby-bonds.html}{with
his ``baby bonds'' proposal}.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. So, what are these ``baby
bonds''?}}{1. So, what are these ``baby bonds''?}}\label{1-so-what-are-these-baby-bonds}}

One of the earliest proposals Mr. Booker touted on the campaign trail,
the program would give every American child a \$1,000 savings account at
birth. The government would contribute additional money each year on a
tiered basis, depending on family income.

The account would be turned over to the child at age 18, but could only
be used for education, investing in a business or buying a home.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Is he the one who started
talking about gun
licenses?}}{2. Is he the one who started talking about gun licenses?}}\label{2-is-he-the-one-who-started-talking-about-gun-licenses}}

Yes. Following an
\href{https://www.concordmonitor.com/Bringing-the-fight-to-the-NRA-25466409}{early
pledge} to ``bring the fight to the N.R.A. like they've never seen
before,'' Mr. Booker introduced his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/cory-booker-gun-control.html}{gun
control plan} in May, which included a national gun-licensing program he
likens to a driver's license.

Mr. Booker often points to his personal experience with gun violence, as
a former mayor of Newark and as someone who still lives in a low-income
community, on the campaign trail.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. Is he really dating Rosario
Dawson?}}{3. Is he really dating Rosario Dawson?}}\label{3-is-he-really-dating-rosario-dawson}}

So, you've been doing some Googling? Yes, Mr. Booker, the only bachelor
in the Democratic field, has been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/us/politics/cory-booker-rosario-dawson.html}{dating
Ms. Dawson} since October 2018, and has largely kept their relationship
away from politics, though Ms. Dawson did join Mr. Booker for a campaign
swing through Nevada over the Fourth of July.
