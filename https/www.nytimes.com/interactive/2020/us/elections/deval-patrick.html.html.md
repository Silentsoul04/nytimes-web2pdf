# Deval Patrick

A late arriver to the White House race, the former Massachusetts
governor brings a moderate message and a rags-to-riches biography.

Deval Patrick [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/us/politics/deval-patrick-drops-out.html)
on Feb. 12, 2020. This page is no longer being updated.

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is Deval Patrick?

<div class="g-bullets">

63 years old

Born in Chicago; lives in Massachusetts

Until recently, managing director of an investment fund at Bain Capital

The first black governor of Massachusetts (2007–2015)

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Patrick’s signature issues

Deval Patrick entered the campaign in November and quickly staked out
[fairly moderate
positions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-bio.html).
Unlike his fellow New Englanders, Senators [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
and [Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html),
he opposes “Medicare for all.” He also distanced himself from a wealth
tax. During two terms as governor, Mr. Patrick focused on education
policies to close the gap separating students of different races and
socioeconomic backgrounds; pushed through a $13 billion transportation
infrastructure bill; and promoted casino gaming in the state.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Deval Patrick

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. What’s his appeal?**

Mr. Patrick’s biography is a classic rags-to-riches story that makes for
a compelling stump speech. Raised by a single mother on Chicago’s South
Side, he frequently slept on the floor because there were not enough
beds. With some lucky breaks — including a scholarship to a prestigious
boarding school — he eventually graduated from Harvard Law School. His
first public-sector role was assistant attorney general for civil rights
under the Clinton administration.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. What exactly did he do at Bain Capital?**

After leaving the governor’s office, Mr. Patrick joined the private
equity firm Bain Capital in 2015, heading up an investment fund that
focuses on socially responsible investments. The fund acquired interests
in fitness centers in the Midwest, a vegan fast-food chain and sushi
restaurants serving sustainable fish, among other businesses. With
private equity under attack by other Democrats, Mr. Patrick could face
questions about his Bain connection as well as other business ties,
including stints at Texaco and Coca-Cola and board memberships.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. Why did he get into the campaign so late?**

Mr. Patrick had considered joining the presidential race earlier, but
announced in December 2018 that he had decided against it, citing the
“[cruelty](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/us/politics/deval-patrick-president-2020.html)”
of the elections process. At the time, his wife had cancer, but she is
now healthy. With some Democrats expressing unease in recent months
about the party’s ability to defeat President Trump, Mr.
Patrick[](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020.html)[decided](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020.html)
in November to enter the race. While he is regarded as a potentially
formidable candidate, his 11th-hour decision puts him at a considerable
disadvantage in [funding and
organization](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/deval-patrick-campaign.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “Instead of spattering our civic square with mud, instead of fueling extremism and hate with a barrage of tweets and a 24/7 cycle of outrage, how about we try a little old-fashioned love of country?”

Mr. Patrick and Michael R. Bloomberg both entered the race in November.
We looked at [how they could reshape the Democratic
contest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/deval-patrick-michael-bloomberg-2020.html).

Mr. Patrick was an early supporter of gay marriage, and he explained why
in [this Washington Post
piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/deval-patrick-gay-marriage-and-the-right-to-be-ordinary/2013/05/16/f84633cc-bd88-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_story.html).
