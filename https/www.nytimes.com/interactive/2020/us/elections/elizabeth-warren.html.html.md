<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Warren’s signature issues

Senator Elizabeth Warren is running for president promising to bring
about “big, structural change,” with the goal of tilting power toward
working people and away from big corporations and the rich.

She has become known in the Democratic field for her long list of policy
plans, including [creating a wealth
tax](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/upshot/warren-wealth-tax.html),
[canceling student loan
debt](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt.html)
for most borrowers and [breaking up big technology
companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html).
She is also a proponent of “Medicare for all,” and has rolled out
proposals to [transition
to](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-100-days.html)
and [pay
for](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all.html)
such a system.

She has stood out from many of her opponents by [swearing off
fund-raisers with wealthy
donors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-donors-fundraising.html),
and she spends hours taking pictures with voters who wait in a [“selfie
line”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-selfies.html)
at the end of her town halls.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Elizabeth Warren

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. She has lots of big plans. How would she pay for them?**

Ms. Warren has laid out [numerous revenue sources for her various
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/06/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-policies-taxes.html),
but her marquee proposal is to create a wealth tax that would apply to
the super rich. She would impose a 2 percent annual tax on a household’s
net worth between $50 million and $1 billion, and a 6 percent tax on net
worth above $1 billion.

Ms. Warren says the revenue from that tax — estimated at $3.5 trillion
over a decade — would cover the cost of her plans for universal child
care, K-12 education, free public college and student debt cancellation.
It would also help pay for Medicare for all.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Has she always been a Democrat?**

No. Ms. Warren was registered as a Republican until 1996, when she was
in her 40s. Ms. Warren has said that her switch amounted to going [from
“not political” to
“political.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-republican-history.html)

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. What about the controversy over her ancestry?**

Ms. Warren has faced scrutiny over her claims of Native American
ancestry since she ran for Senate in 2012, and President Trump has
repeatedly used a slur to mock her over the subject. Ms. Warren has said
that she never used her ancestry claims to advance her career.

Before entering the presidential race, she [released the results of a
DNA
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-ancestry.html)
that provided evidence that she had a Native American ancestor. But the
DNA test [angered some Native
Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-test.html),
and she has since
[apologized](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-native-american.html)
for the DNA test and for identifying herself as Native American during
her career as a law
professor.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “When government works only for the wealthy and the well-connected, that is corruption, plain and simple, and we need to call it out.”
