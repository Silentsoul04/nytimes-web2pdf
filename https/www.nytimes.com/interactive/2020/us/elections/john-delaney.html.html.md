# John Delaney

Funding much of his campaign with his own money, Mr. Delaney is running
on a platform of bipartisanship and moderation.

John Delaney [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/john-delaney-drops-out.html)
on Jan. 31, 2020. This page is no longer being updated.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is John Delaney?

<div class="g-bullets">

56 years old

Born in Wood-Ridge, N.J.; lives in Potomac, Md.

Former three-term congressman from Maryland (did not run for re-election
in 2018); founded two financial companies

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Delaney’s signature issues

Some key points in his platform include health care (he has a hybrid
public-private proposal but opposes “Medicare for all”), national
service (he wants to make it mandatory) and infrastructure, but he
doesn’t have one defining issue. The hallmark of his campaign is,
rather, an appeal to bipartisanship: He has said that in his first 100
days as president, he would focus exclusively on bipartisan legislation.
He is more moderate than many other candidates and argues that Democrats
will lose in 2020 if they move too far to the left.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about John Delaney

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. Isn’t he the one who’s been running for president forever?**

Close to it, yeah — he announced his campaign in July 2017 and had hit
all 99 counties in Iowa before any of the front-runners even began. We
don’t know of any other non-incumbent candidate in modern American
history who has started earlier in an election cycle. He did it because,
[as he put it
in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/john-delaney-2020-iowa.html):
“I think I’m the right person for the job, but not enough people knew
who I was or still know who I am. The way to solve that problem, it
seems to me, is to get in early and just work harder than everyone
else.”

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. He’s criticized “Medicare for all” a lot. What is his health care plan?**

He wants to keep Medicare for people over 65 and create a new government
program for people under 65. Everyone under 65 would automatically be
enrolled in that program — which would cover all “essential health
benefits,” including pre-existing conditions — but people could choose
to forfeit the coverage and receive a credit to buy private insurance
instead. He argues that this would guarantee universal coverage without
forcing people to use a government health plan.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. And what’s this about making national service mandatory?**

Under his plan, all Americans would have to complete at least a year of
national service upon turning 18. The definition of national service
would be fairly wide, including not only military enlistment and
traditional community service programs like AmeriCorps, but also
infrastructure apprenticeships and a climate corps. Participants would
be paid and earn two years of free tuition at a public college or
university, and if they chose to serve longer than the minimum, they
would get a third year of free
tuition.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises. When we run on things that are workable, not fairy-tale economics.”
