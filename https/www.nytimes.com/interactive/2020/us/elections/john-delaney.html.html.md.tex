Funding much of his campaign with his own money, Mr. Delaney is running
on a platform of bipartisanship and moderation.

John Delaney
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/john-delaney-drops-out.html}{dropped
out of the presidential race} on Jan. 31, 2020. This page is no longer

\subsection{Who is John Delaney?}\label{who-is-john-delaney}}

56 years old

Born in Wood-Ridge, N.J.; lives in Potomac, Md.

Former three-term congressman from Maryland (did not run for re-election
in 2018); founded two financial companies

\hypertarget{delaneys-signature-issues}{%
\subsection{Delaney's signature
issues}\label{delaneys-signature-issues}}

Some key points in his platform include health care (he has a hybrid
public-private proposal but opposes ``Medicare for all''), national
service (he wants to make it mandatory) and infrastructure, but he
doesn't have one defining issue. The hallmark of his campaign is,
rather, an appeal to bipartisanship: He has said that in his first 100
days as president, he would focus exclusively on bipartisan legislation.
He is more moderate than many other candidates and argues that Democrats
will lose in 2020 if they move too far to the left.

Close to it, yeah --- he announced his campaign in July 2017 and had hit
all 99 counties in Iowa before any of the front-runners even began. We
don't know of any other non-incumbent candidate in modern American
history who has started earlier in an election cycle. He did it because,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/john-delaney-2020-iowa.html}{as
he put it in 2018}: ``I think I'm the right person for the job, but not
enough people knew who I was or still know who I am. The way to solve
that problem, it seems to me, is to get in early and just work harder
than everyone else.''

plan?}}{2. He's criticized ``Medicare for all'' a lot. What is his health care plan?}}\label{2-hes-criticized-medicare-for-all-a-lot-what-is-his-health-care-plan}}

He wants to keep Medicare for people over 65 and create a new government
program for people under 65. Everyone under 65 would automatically be
enrolled in that program --- which would cover all ``essential health
benefits,'' including pre-existing conditions --- but people could
choose to forfeit the coverage and receive a credit to buy private
insurance instead. He argues that this would guarantee universal
coverage without forcing people to use a government health plan.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. And what's this about making
national service
mandatory?}}{3. And what's this about making national service mandatory?}}\label{3-and-whats-this-about-making-national-service-mandatory}}

Under his plan, all Americans would have to complete at least a year of
national service upon turning 18. The definition of national service
would be fairly wide, including not only military enlistment and
traditional community service programs like AmeriCorps, but also
infrastructure apprenticeships and a climate corps. Participants would
be paid and earn two years of free tuition at a public college or
university, and if they chose to serve longer than the minimum, they
would get a third year of free tuition.
