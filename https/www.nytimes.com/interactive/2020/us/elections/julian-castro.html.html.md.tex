Mr. Castro, a former housing secretary, is emphasizing immigration and
education in his presidential campaign.

Julián Castro

out of the presidential race} on Jan. 2, 2020. This page is no longer

Former mayor of San Antonio; housing secretary under President Barack

\subsection{Castro's signature issues}\label{castros-signature-issues}}

Mr. Castro has focused his campaign
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/julian-castro-immigration.html}{largely
on immigration}, drawing on his family's background (his grandmother was
an immigrant from Mexico) and his political experience in a border
state. His immigration plan was one of the earliest and most detailed in
the Democratic field. As mayor of San Antonio, he also created a public
pre-K program, something he wants to replicate at the national level.

Castro}\label{three-questions-about-juliuxe1n-castro}}

\hypertarget{1-what-is-his-immigration-plan}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. What is his immigration
plan?}}{1. What is his immigration plan?}}\label{1-what-is-his-immigration-plan}}

Mr. Castro released a sweeping
\href{https://medium.com/@JulianCastro2020/putting-people-first-e0f765cee00c}{immigration
proposal} in April, going well beyond what other candidates had put
forward at the time. In addition to some things that are a matter of
Democratic consensus --- like stopping President Trump's family
separation policy and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented
immigrants --- he wants to decriminalize illegal border crossings.

\hypertarget{2-decriminalize-border-crossings-so-people-could-just-walk-in}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Decriminalize border
crossings? So people could just walk
in?}}{2. Decriminalize border crossings? So people could just walk in?}}\label{2-decriminalize-border-crossings-so-people-could-just-walk-in}}

No. Under Mr. Castro's plan, crossing the border illegally would no
longer be a criminal offense, but it would still be a civil offense.
This is how the United States handled unauthorized border crossings for
decades after Congress made such crossings illegal in 1929. It was not
until 2005, under President George W. Bush, that the government began
prosecuting these cases in the criminal system.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. What's the deal with his pre-K
program?}}{3. What's the deal with his pre-K program?}}\label{3-whats-the-deal-with-his-pre-k-program}}

One of Mr. Castro's biggest accomplishments as mayor of San Antonio, an
office he held from 2009 to 2014, was a program called Pre-K 4 SA.
Funded by a tax increase that San Antonio voters approved, the program
provides free prekindergarten for some children and low-cost pre-K for
others. Mr. Castro's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/us/politics/julian-castro-education-2020.html}{education
plan} proposes a similar program at the national level.
