Williamson?}\label{who-is-marianne-williamson}}

67 years old

Born in Houston; lives in Des Moines

Best-selling self-help author and New Age spiritual leader; founded
support centers for people with H.I.V. and other serious illnesses; no
prior elected office

issues}\label{williamsons-signature-issues}}

One of Ms. Williamson's biggest proposals --- unique among all the
Democratic candidates --- is establishing a
\href{https://www.marianne2020.com/posts/join-us-to-build-a-u-s-department-of-peace}{Department
of Peace}, which would oversee efforts ranging from combating white
supremacy to finding nonmilitary solutions to foreign conflicts. She is
also a vocal supporter of reparations for the American descendants of
enslaved Africans.

Williamson}\label{three-questions-about-marianne-williamson}}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. She talks about ``harnessing
love for political purposes.'' What does that
mean?}}{1. She talks about ``harnessing love for political purposes.'' What does that mean?}}\label{1-she-talks-about-harnessing-love-for-political-purposes-what-does-that-mean}}

Her proposed Department of Peace would work to combat hate, including
white supremacy and misogyny. She also wants the government to
profoundly change its priorities, devoting less money to the military
and more to peace-building and social programs. But in another sense,
she is talking about something more amorphous: In her book ``Tears to
Triumph,'' she suggested that people ``join love's revolution, taking
even the tiniest step to contribute energy to the transformational wave
of consciousness now rising up among us.''

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. What's her plan for
reparations?}}{2. What's her plan for reparations?}}\label{2-whats-her-plan-for-reparations}}

She is calling for \$200 billion to \$500 billion in reparations for
slavery, paid out over 20 years. In a standout moment
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/marianne-williamson-debate-quotes.html}{at
the second debate in July}, she challenged the description of
reparations as ``financial assistance'' as opposed to a repayment of
debt. ``We need to recognize, when it comes to the economic gap between
blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that
has never been dealt with,'' she said. ``That great injustice has had to
do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another
100 years of domestic terrorism.''

on mental
health?}}{3. What's the deal with her views on mental health?}}\label{3-whats-the-deal-with-her-views-on-mental-health}}

She believes that antidepressants are harmfully overprescribed and even
suggested at one point that clinical depression was a ``scam.'' In
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/marianne-williamson-mental-health.html}{an
interview over the summer}, she disavowed the ``scam'' description, said
she understood that antidepressants were sometimes necessary and
acknowledged that some of her past comments had lacked nuance. But she
stood by her assertion that antidepressants were often wrongly
prescribed for ``normal human despair,'' an argument that mental health
professionals say can increase stigma and discourage people from seeking
help.
