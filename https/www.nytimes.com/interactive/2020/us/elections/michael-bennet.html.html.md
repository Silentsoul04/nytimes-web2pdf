# Michael Bennet

The Colorado senator wants to usher in a new era of trust in government
and bipartisan compromise.

Michael Bennet [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/michael-bennet-drops-out.html)
on Feb. 11, 2020. This page is no longer being updated.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is Michael Bennet?

<div class="g-bullets">

55 years old

Born in New Delhi; lives in Denver

Senator from Colorado since 2009

Former superintendent of Denver Public Schools

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Bennet’s signature issues

Mr. Bennet has focused heavily on education, pledging to ensure equal
access to high-quality programs by 2028. His plan calls for all students
to be able to read by third grade, to be “proficient in math and
reading” by eighth grade, and to “graduate high school with the
ability to earn a living wage, not just the minimum wage.” He is also
known for his work on immigration reform in the Senate.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Michael Bennet

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. What’s this about his immigration work in the Senate?**

Back in 2013, Mr. Bennet was part of the so-called Gang of Eight: four
Democratic and four Republican senators who negotiated [a comprehensive
immigration
proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/michael-bennet-immigration.html)
that passed the Senate but not the House. It would have provided a path
to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expanded visa options,
while also funding a border fence and a stronger system for companies to
verify employees’ immigration status.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. How does he plan to make education equal in eight years?**

His [plan](https://michaelbennet.com/education/) centers on 500
“regional opportunity compacts,” supported by $10 billion a year for
five years, which he says would “connect the dots” between school
curriculums and the needs of local employers. He is also calling for
universal preschool and free community college, pay raises for teachers,
and incentives for school districts to extend the academic day and year.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. What’s his pitch to voters?**

Over the summer, Mr. Bennet made [a rather unusual
promise](https://twitter.com/MichaelBennet/status/1158806845953323008)
to voters: “If you elect me president, I promise you won’t have to think
about me for two weeks at a time.” That return to stability and
“normalcy” is, essentially, his pitch, along with an appeal to
electability. Like most of the moderates in the field, he argues that
voters are looking for a candidate who is willing to compromise, and
that progressive candidates like [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
and [Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html)
would lose a general
election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “Donald Trump is much more a symptom of our problems than he is the creator of our problems. He is an accelerant. He was sent here to blow this place up. That’s what people in my state who voted for him said. And guess what? They succeeded. But now we’ve got to pick up the pieces.”
