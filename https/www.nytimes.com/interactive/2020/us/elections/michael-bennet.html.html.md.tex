The Colorado senator wants to usher in a new era of trust in government
and bipartisan compromise.

Mr. Bennet has focused heavily on education, pledging to ensure equal
access to high-quality programs by 2028. His plan calls for all students
to be able to read by third grade, to be ``proficient in math and
reading'' by eighth grade, and to ``graduate high school with the
ability to earn a living wage, not just the minimum wage.'' He is also
known for his work on immigration reform in the Senate.

Bennet}\label{three-questions-about-michael-bennet}}

immigration work in the
Senate?}}{1. What's this about his immigration work in the Senate?}}\label{1-whats-this-about-his-immigration-work-in-the-senate}}

Back in 2013, Mr. Bennet was part of the so-called Gang of Eight: four
Democratic and four Republican senators who negotiated
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/michael-bennet-immigration.html}{a
comprehensive immigration proposal} that passed the Senate but not the
House. It would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented
immigrants and expanded visa options, while also funding a border fence
and a stronger system for companies to verify employees' immigration
status.

education equal in eight
years?}}{2. How does he plan to make education equal in eight years?}}\label{2-how-does-he-plan-to-make-education-equal-in-eight-years}}

His \href{https://michaelbennet.com/education/}{plan} centers on 500
``regional opportunity compacts,'' supported by \$10 billion a year for
five years, which he says would ``connect the dots'' between school
curriculums and the needs of local employers. He is also calling for
universal preschool and free community college, pay raises for teachers,
and incentives for school districts to extend the academic day and year.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. What's his pitch to

Over the summer, Mr. Bennet made
\href{https://twitter.com/MichaelBennet/status/1158806845953323008}{a
rather unusual promise} to voters: ``If you elect me president, I
promise you won't have to think about me for two weeks at a time.'' That
return to stability and ``normalcy'' is, essentially, his pitch, along
with an appeal to electability. Like most of the moderates in the field,
he argues that voters are looking for a candidate who is willing to
compromise, and that progressive candidates like
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html}{Elizabeth
Warren} would lose a general election.
