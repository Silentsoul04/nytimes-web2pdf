# Tom Steyer

A billionaire says he can help get money out of politics, decrying what
he calls the “corporate stranglehold on democracy.”

Tom Steyer [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/tom-steyer-drops-out.html)
on Feb. 29, 2020. This page is no longer being updated.

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is Tom Steyer?

<div class="g-bullets">

62 years old

Born in New York; lives in San Francisco

Started the hedge fund Farallon Capital; funded political groups
including Need to Impeach and NextGen America; no prior elected office

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Steyer’s signature issues

Mr. Steyer casts himself as a progressive outsider with a business
record, calling for term limits in Congress, decriminalizing illegal
border crossings and expanding the Supreme Court. He says his top
priorities are breaking the influence of corporations and [addressing
climate
change](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/us/politics/tom-steyer-hopes-nextgen-climate-gets-voters-to-consider-environment.html).  
  
Mr. Steyer has spent millions of dollars [pushing for the impeachment of
President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html),
airing television ads and building a grassroots online network. Now,
after considering runs for California governor and senator, he is
promising to spend $100 million or more of his own money on a
presidential bid.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Tom Steyer

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. How rich is Tom Steyer?**

Very rich. Mr. Steyer has released more than [a decade of tax
returns](https://www.tomsteyer.com/transparency/) that show more than $1
billion in earnings, including nearly $110 million in “taxable income”
in 2017. He has become one of the largest Democratic financiers in the
country, spending more than $300 million on politics between 2014 and
2017.

Mr. Steyer founded his investment firm, Farallon Capital, in the 1980s
and left in 2012. Some of its past investments could cause political
headaches for Mr. Steyer, including those in private prisons [and
coal](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/us/politics/prominent-environmentalist-helped-fund-coal-projects.html).

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Isn’t he the impeachment guy?**

Yes, Mr. Steyer founded the group Need to Impeach and has appeared [in
many television
ads](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html)
asking for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Some ran on Fox News in an effort
to get Mr. Trump’s attention. (The president responded on Twitter to one
ad, [calling Mr. Steyer a
“weirdo.”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html#the-letter-S))
In January 2019, Mr. Steyer announced [he would not run for
president](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-trump-2020.html)
to focus on the impeachment efforts. But in July, he reversed himself
and [declared himself a
candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-president.html).

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. Is Mr. Steyer a moderate or a progressive?**

Mr. Steyer is selling himself as a businessman who can challenge Mr.
Trump on economic matters. But he is not casting himself as a moderate.

He has embraced a “wealth tax” on the superrich, not unlike one proposed
by Senator Elizabeth Warren. He has suggested adding new justices to the
Supreme Court, a relatively radical idea pressed by some on the left. He
wants to take emergency action to address climate change. In many ways,
he is running as a populist outsider, much the way Mr. Trump did in
2016. He is just proposing a different set of
solutions.

### “I think Mr. Trump had a point. I think that’s why he got elected. Because the system is broken.”

We followed Mr. Steyer on his crusade to spend millions [to get money
out of
politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/tom-steyer-debate.html).

Here’s a dispatch from an event in San Francisco, when Mr. Steyer said
[he didn’t see himself as
rich](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/tom-steyer-2020-campaign.html).

[Becoming a presidential
candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-president.html)
was another reinvention for Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Steyer’s hedge fund has bankrolled [coal mines and coal-fired power
plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/us/politics/prominent-environmentalist-helped-fund-coal-projects.html).
