## Who is Tulsi Gabbard?

<div class="g-bullets">

38 years old

Born in American Samoa; lives in Kailua, Hawaii, and Washington

Four-term congresswoman representing Hawaii’s Second District, first
elected in 2012

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Gabbard’s signature issues

Ms. Gabbard was deployed to Iraq and currently serves as a major in the
Hawaii Army National Guard. She has leaned on her background as a
service member in making foreign policy her chief concern.

Specifically, she is [urging the United States to get out of foreign
wars](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html)
and focus on peacebuilding. She has also [warned that a nuclear arms
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-foreign-policy-war.html)
could be on the horizon.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Tulsi Gabbard

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. Where does Ms. Gabbard stand on foreign policy?**

Ms. Gabbard doesn’t fit neatly into any one established ideology or
school of thought. She generally does not endorse meddling with
dictators; she thinks the threat from Russia is severely exaggerated;
she wants to stop beating the drums of war with Iran; and she would
prefer to make nice with North Korea.

“We should be coming to other leaders in other countries with respect,
building a relationship based on cooperation rather than with, you know,
a police
baton,”[](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html)[she
told The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html).

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Wasn’t she the one who met with Bashar al-Assad?**

Ms. Gabbard visited Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus in
January 2017 — something other American officials had not done since
reports emerged of Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons against
civilians. She defended the move as a way to help broker peace. She
also[](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/121/text)[voted
against a House resolution condemning the dictator’s war
crimes](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/121/text),
and more recently, she said Mr. Assad was “[not the enemy of the United
States](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/rep-gabbard-assad-is-not-an-enemy-of-the-us-1438093891865).”

Critics have called her actions
un-American.[](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-prisoners-tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline)[After
Ms. Gabbard sharply criticized Senator Kamala
Harris](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-prisoners-tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline)
for her prosecutorial record during one of the Democratic debates, Ms.
Harris called Ms. Gabbard an “apologist for an individual, Assad, who
has murdered the people of his country like cockroaches.”

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. How did she vote on impeachment?**

She broke with most Democrats and voted “present” on the two articles of
impeachment charging President Trump with abuse of power and obstruction
of Congress. She was the only member of the House to cast such a
vote.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “I will end this insanity, because it doesn’t have to be this way. I will end these wasteful regime-change wars.”
