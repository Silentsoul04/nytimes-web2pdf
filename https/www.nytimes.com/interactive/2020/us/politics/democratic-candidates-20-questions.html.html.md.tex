The New York Times reached out to nine Democratic presidential
candidates to ask them the same set of questions on video. Seven
accepted the invitation.

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey was interviewed in December, but has
since
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/us/politics/cory-booker-drops-out.html}{dropped
out} of the race. Former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator
Bernie Sanders of Vermont declined to participate.

Most of the candidates visited the studio in our New York City office.
We traveled to Los Angeles for two interview sessions. The interviews
took place between Dec. 10 and Jan. 22. During the sessions, we asked
candidates for a terse, direct reply before explaining their views at
greater length.

The Times interviewed a larger pool of Democratic candidates last
spring.
