 Reopened Reopening Pausing Reversing

Click a state to see more detail

All 50 states had begun to reopen in some way after the coronavirus
thrust the country into lockdown starting in March. Now, a growing
number of states are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/texas-coronavirus-cases-reopening.html}{pausing
plans to reopen}, amid rising case counts. Several are reimposing
restrictions they had lifted earlier --- for example, on bars and
restaurant dining in many places.

There were already substantial variations in how states were deciding to
open up, with some forging far ahead of others. These maps show where
several major sectors have reopened.

Note: Local restrictions may be different. Restaurants are considered
open for indoor service.

The changes --- and backtracking --- reflect the immense pressure on the
nation's governors to respond to a crippled economy and an anxious
public, even as epidemiologists warn of a second wave of cases. Many
governors are mandating the wearing of masks in public places.

The New York Times is tracking when broad reopenings are allowed, as
well as when reopening plans are paused or reversed. States may shift
categories as conditions change, or to account for changes in the
national landscape. Even as governors lift orders and allow reopenings,
stricter local orders may remain in place.

Reversing

Some states have moved to close certain sectors statewide or in certain
counties after seeing a surge in cases.

Arizona

Reopened May 8.

After Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order expired May 15, Arizona saw
cases soar. In late June, Mr. Ducey, a Republican, announced that the
state would ``pause'' operations of bars, gyms, movie theaters,
waterparks and tubing rentals to contain the virus's spread.

Reopened May 25.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, emphasized caution as he allowed counties
to reopen sectors in May and June. As cases rose in June and July,
however, Mr. Newsom backtracked, ordering statewide closures of bars and
indoor activities in many sectors including dining and entertainment.
The state is also keeping a ``watch list'' of counties with upward virus
trends.

Gov. Jared Polis was one of the first Democratic governors to begin
reopening his state, letting Colorado's stay-at-home order expire on
April 26. Businesses reopened throughout May and June, but in response
to continuing outbreaks in neighboring states, in July, Mr. Polis
extended the state's ``Safer at Home'' phase and closed bars. He is
allowing some regions to reopen bars and loosen restrictions.

shutter bars again after a spike in cases.

remain in Phase 2 for several more weeks. As cases continued to climb,
Mr. Edwards ordered bars to close again and required the use of masks in
public.

before lifting Michigan's stay-at-home order on June 1. Ms. Whitmer has
since paused further reopenings, and on July 1, she ordered bars in most
of the state to close again for indoor service. She later mandated the
use of masks in most public settings. In late July, citing a resurgence
in cases connected to social gatherings, Ms. Whitmer limited indoor
gatherings to 10 people and ordered bars to close for indoor service
statewide.

Gov. Greg Abbott allowed his stay-at-home order to lapse on April 30, a

restaurants to reduce capacity, among the first reopening reversals in
the country. Starting July 3, he once again encouraged Texans to stay
home and required face covering in public places in counties with more
than 20 cases.

Several states have reopened some sectors, but paused or delayed plans
to reopen further after seeing a rise in coronavirus cases.

Alabama

Reopened April 30.

Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, ordered residents to stay home for much of
April and began reopening businesses starting in May. Ms. Ivey recently
extended the state's ``Safer at Home'' status and implemented a mask
requirement until the end of August.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, never implemented a statewide
stay-at-home order, instead opting to close high-contact businesses like
gyms and personal care services. The state began reopening many of these
in early May. Arkansas has seen one of the steepest increases in
coronavirus cases since reopening. In response, Mr. Hutchinson
implemented a mask mandate effective July 20.

postponed a third phase in response to rising cases in neighboring
states.

Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, began his state's four-stage reopening
process on May 1. Idaho moved through the first three stages of
reopening swiftly, but as cases surged, Mr. Little delayed a full

Wisconsin

Reopened May 13.

The state Supreme Court struck down Gov. Tony Evers's stay-at-home order
on May 13, effectively lifting statewide restrictions on businesses in
Wisconsin. Mr. Evers, a Democrat in a highly contested battleground
state, had already announced plans for a gradual reopening but warned
the ruling would cause ``chaos.'' Some counties have since placed their
own restrictions on businesses. Mr. Evers mandated the use of face
coverings in all public indoor places starting August 1.
