United Kingdom, according to the British

Britain has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe, surpassing
Italy and Spain in early May. New cases in Britain continue to drop,
with the nation now reporting around
\href{https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/}{1,000 new cases} each day, the
vast majority of which are in England.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html}{conditional
plan}'' to ease Britain out of its seven-week lockdown. In a televised
speech, he said those who cannot work from home may return to work, and
that people can freely exercise and spend time outdoors. In July, the
self-isolation period for people who test positive for the coronavirus
or develop symptoms
\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53588709}{increased} from seven days
to 10.

The
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/how-coronavirus-restrictions-will-differ-around-the-uk-england-scotland-wales-northern-ireland}{four
countries of Britain} are easing lockdown restrictions at different
speeds. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, movie theatres and
tourist spots
can\href{https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jul/04/england-eases-lockdown-how-pubs-hairdressers-and-restaurants-will-work}{}\href{https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jul/04/england-eases-lockdown-how-pubs-hairdressers-and-restaurants-will-work}{now
reopen}. And after much debate, the nation will make
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-masks-mandate.html}{facemasks}
required in stores. England has also lifted its fourteen-day quarantine
period for incoming travellers from
\href{https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors}{select
countries}.

In Scotland, the country has lifted
its\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53264720}{five-mile travel
limit}, and hairdressers, pubs, and places of worship
can\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53403280}{}\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53403280}{open}

local"} rule allowing people to travel freely. The country has taken a
more cautious approach to reopening than its neighbours: pubs,
restaurants and cafes can operate, but only
using\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53333939}{}\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53333939}{outdoor

In\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53007269}{}\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53007269}{Northern
Ireland}, up to thirty people can meet outdoors. At the beginning of
July, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, and tattoo parlours were greenlit
for operation. However, schools are not scheduled to open until late
August.

On April 29, the government's \href{https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk}{daily
death toll} included those who died of Covid-19 in hospitals as well as
nursing homes for the first time, causing a large spike in the number of
deaths reported that day. Here's how the number of new cases and deaths
are changing over time:

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

The
\href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases}{Office
of National Statistics} is also tracking Covid-related deaths in the
country as confirmed on death certificates, but its figures are delayed
around two weeks.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

The Times has found the following reporting anomalies for the data on
this page:

April 29: The government's daily death toll included those who died of
Covid-19 in hospitals as well as nursing homes for the first time,
causing a large spike in the number of deaths reported that day.

July 2: Health authorities changed their methodology to avoid
double-counting positive cases. This change, along with a historical
revision of data, resulted in a decrease of more than 30,000 cases in
the cumulative case total for the U.K.

Starting June 18, data for Scotland will include testing results from
the U.K. Government's Regional Testing Centres, in addition to data from
NHS Laboratories. Scotland did not update data between June 15-17 while
preparing this change.

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing.} It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&module=styln-coronavirus\&variant=showÂ®ion=TOP_BANNER\&context=storyline_menu\#link-56871453}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus primarily spreads when contaminated
hands touch our nose or mouth or eyes. Try to keep your hands away from
your face unless you have just recently washed them.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from any potential
infection from you. The more people who wear masks, the more we all stay
safer.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
