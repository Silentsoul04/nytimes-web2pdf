**Tesla** on Wednesday reported a profit of $104 million for the three
months ending in June.

The profit surprised analysts who were expecting the electric carmaker
to lose money because it was forced to halt production at its main plant
in Fremont, Calif., for nearly two months, from late March until the
middle of May. Sales also slowed as much of the economy shut down and as
millions of people lost their jobs and cut back on spending.

The profit was achieved “despite tremendous difficulties in the
quarter,” the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said in a
conference call with analysts. “We were able to achieve a fourth
consecutive profitable quarter. Although the auto industry was down
about 30 percent year-over-year, we managed to grow deliveries in the
first half of the year.”

In a statement, Tesla said [revenue in the second quarter fell 5
percent](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6),
to $6 billion. Total sales of automobiles declined 5 percent, to about
91,000 cars, an update to preliminary figures it released earlier this
month. Growing sales in China and Europe helped cushion the pandemic’s
negative impact on sales in the United States.

The company’s profit was also made possible by the sales of $428 million
in emissions credits to other automakers who need them to meet
regulatory standards. That’s nearly four times as many credits as it
sold in the same quarter a year earlier.

Tesla said it ended the quarter with $8.6 billion in cash, up $535
million from the end of March.

The company added that it now has the capacity to produce more than
500,000 cars a year. “While achieving this goal has become more
difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our
target,” Tesla said.

Tesla appears to be weathering the pandemic better than some other
automakers. In China, the world’s largest market for electric vehicles,
the company has benefited from a new factory near Shanghai that began
production late last year. The plant enables Tesla to avoid the tariffs
China imposes on imported vehicles and has made its cars more affordable
to Chinese consumers.

The company has also added to its lineup a fourth car, the Model Y
sport-utility vehicle, which is made in Fremont. Mr. Musk has said that
he expects the car to become its biggest seller.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of **Tesla**, could soon qualify for his
second giant payday of the year.

Mr. Musk’s compensation is driven largely by the performance of Tesla’s
stock. And as the carmaker’s share price has soared in recent weeks, he
stands to receive a stock award worth roughly $2 billion. The awards are
part of an unusual compensation package, [set up
in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html).
The [first
payout](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/elon-musk-tesla-bonus.html)
under that plan occurred [in
May](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459020027321/tsla-def14a_20200707.htm)
and now is also worth close to $2 billion.

Tesla’s stock has risen just over 275 percent this year, as investors
have become increasingly convinced that the company will have a
[dominant
foothold](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/tesla-electric-car-audi-polestar.html)
in the global market for electric vehicles. The rise in the stock has
bolstered Tesla’s stock market value to around $290 billion, or $100
billion more than Toyota’s market value.

Mr. Musk’s 2018 compensation package was designed to release shares in
12 installments as certain milestones are met. The first goal was for
Tesla’s market value to be at least $100 billion on average over two
different time periods — that was achieved in January. Tesla also had to
hit operational milestones. Over 12 months, the company has to have
brought in a certain amount of revenue or a measure of profits called
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In May,
Tesla said it had used the lowest revenue hurdle, $20 billion, to
release the first tranche of shares.

Tesla’s market value recently exceeded $150 billion on average over the
past six months and over the last 30 trading days, the threshold for the
release of the second batch of shares. Tesla has already hit the lowest
profit goal without considering the company’s second quarter results
released on Wednesday, in theory giving him the operational achievement
he needs to get the shares, though the board still has to release the
award. If Tesla’s share price stays close to current levels, Mr. Musk
might even qualify for the third tranche of his stock awards this year.

Critics of the 2018 compensation package questioned why it was
necessary. Before the award, Mr. Musk already owned a large chunk of
Tesla — shares that today are worth around $60 billion. That’s more than
twice the $25 billion worth of shares available to Mr. Musk through the
2018 package. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, another visionary chief executive,
has not needed multibillion compensation packages to motivate him as he
has led his company to become a dominant force in the American economy.

A surprise profit in the second quarter has set Tesla up for another
major milestone: potential inclusion in the S\&P 500 index. The index is
one the most widely followed measures of the performance American stock
market, with more than $11 trillion worth of mutual funds and other
investments measured against it.

The company said on Wednesday it earned $104 million in the three months
through June, in its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability.

It’s unusual for companies with market values as large as Tesla —
roughly $290 billion — not to be included in the S\&P 500. But the
company’s inability to consistently generate profits has made it
ineligible so far. (Criteria for inclusion require the sum of the
company’s fully audited profits in the four most recent quarters to be
positive.)

The lack of profits hasn’t bothered investors. Tesla’s share price has
logged an astounding gain of more than 275 percent this year. But if
Tesla were to be included in the index, it could trigger another upward
push by stimulating a surge in demand for the shares by institutional
investors.

Index-based funds — low cost investment vehicles designed to mirror the
performance of indexes like the S\&P 500, rather than trying to “beat
the market” — must buy any stock included in the index, creating a rush
for the shares of companies that are newly added.

“When a company goes in that means there’s a lot of buying there,” said
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S\&P Dow Jones Indices, the
company that publishes the S\&P 500.

Changes to the index can, and do, occur regularly. For instance, when a
company is removed from the S\&P 500 after a merger or bankruptcy,
requiring a new addition. The additions can occur at any time and are
kept especially close to the vest by S\&P, because of the money making
opportunity someone could have if they learned about an inclusion before
everybody else.

“Nobody is supposed to know. The company isn’t supposed to know
themselves,” Mr. Silverblatt said. “Nobody even calls them.”

**Tesla** has started work on its fourth car factory at a site near
Austin, Texas, the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk told analysts on
Wednesday.

The factory will produce a new electric pickup truck and a new semi
truck, along with the Model 3 and Model Y, which it already makes at a
factory in the San Francisco Bay Area. The new factory represents a
substantial investment for Tesla, which is already expanding a plant in
Shanghai and building another one near Berlin.

“We will be creating a massive
[Cybertruck](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/business/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck.html)
and semi factory in Texas,” Mr. Musk said, adding that the plant would
be open to the public and have a boardwalk, biking trails and bird
sanctuary.

Officials in Travis County, which includes Austin, this month approved a
tax break to recruit Tesla, which was also being courted by Oklahoma and
other states.

**American Airlines** and **Southwest Airlines** on Wednesday became the
first major airlines in the United States to broaden their mask
requirements to include passengers with a medical condition or
disability that would otherwise prevent them from wearing one.

“If a customer is unable to wear a face covering or mask for any reason,
Southwest regrets that we will be unable to transport the individual,”
the airline said in a statement, noting that the virus can be spread by
individuals who are unaware that they have been infected.

American followed suit, saying: “All customers must wear a face covering
from the time they enter their departure airport and not remove it until
they exit their arrival airport.”

The airlines said that children under the age of 2 will still be allowed
to fly without a mask, a policy in line with other major carriers.
**Delta Air Lines** still allows exceptions for individuals with a
disability or medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask,
and **United Airlines** says individuals seeking exemptions should reach
out to its staff.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [recommends against
masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-face-coverings.html)
for children under 2 years old and people with a medical condition or
disability. [A recent
study](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html)
indicated that children under 10 are less likely to transmit the virus
than adults and older children, though the risk is not zero.

Southwest’s policy goes into effect on Monday, while American’s will
start on July 29. Earlier in the day, United [said it would extend its
requirement](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/22/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/united-airlines-to-require-masks-in-airports-too)
for masks on planes to any area it operated in an airport. Southwest and
Delta already had such policies in place.

Southwest and American are also expected to release financial results
from the industry’s devastating second quarter on Thursday morning.
United said on Tuesday that its operating revenue [declined 88 percent
during the
quarter](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/21/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/united-earnings)
from a year earlier, leading to a $1.6 billion loss. Delta said last
week that its quarterly revenue had dropped 87 percent, resulting in a
$5.7 billion loss.

**Microsoft** on Wednesday said its revenue rose 13 percent in the last
quarter despite the slump in the economy. The company’s growth was led
by big gains in its cloud software offerings as more people work from
home.

The company is not immune to shocks from the pandemic. Technology
spending has fallen in industries like travel and retail. LinkedIn, the
hiring and professional networking site owned by Microsoft, said on
Tuesday that it was cutting 962 jobs, or 6 percent of its work force,
partly because hiring has fallen sharply. In June, Microsoft announced
it was shutting down its 83 retail stores, taking a $450 million charge
against earnings, or 5 cents a share.

But the weaknesses were more than offset by higher demand for its cloud
businesses including its cloud processing and storage services, known as
Azure, and its Office 365 productivity programs.

For the three months ended in June, its fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft
generated revenue of $38 billion. Its operating profit increased 8
percent to $13.4 billion, or $1.46 a share. Both the company’s sales and
earnings per share surpassed Wall Street estimates.

As Congress struggles to advance negotiations over a new round of
federal spending to help people and businesses endure the
pandemic-induced recession, new research suggests a previous round of
aid helped save millions of jobs — but at high cost.

The Paycheck Protection Program, which lawmakers created in March, saved
1.4 million to 3.2 million jobs in small businesses through the
beginning of June, according to research released on Wednesday by
economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Federal
Reserve and ADP Research Institute. That works out to a cost of $162,000
to $381,000 per job.

Some companies that accepted assistance through the program have emerged
in better financial condition and no longer need federal help. But many
companies have not seen the uptick in consumer demand that Republicans
were counting on reopening plans to deliver — and thus could be
vulnerable to closure and layoffs without more aid.

“It’s plausible that, when the money runs out, some of those firms would
downsize again,” said David Autor, an M.I.T. economist and a lead author
of the study.

“This was actually a very aggressive policy,” Mr. Autor said in an
interview. “It’s useful to know that when Congress sets out and spends a
half a trillion dollars, it can get something done.”

The new findings appear to run counter to another recent paper from a
team of prominent economists at Harvard and Brown, which concluded that
“the P.P.P. had little material impact on employment at small
businesses.”

That paper used similar methods to those employed by Mr. Autor and his
co-authors. But it used a different, much smaller set of data, from a
financial management application used primarily by low-wage workers. Mr.
Autor said it was possible that the federal loan program did not do much
to help those people, most of whom cannot work from home, even as it
succeeded in bringing back jobs elsewhere in the economy.

Trump administration officials had claimed in a news release earlier
this month that the program supported “over 51 million jobs.” Mr. Autor
said that the idea that a much larger number of jobs saved was “not
right,” because much of the money appears to have gone to help
businesses that would not likely have folded shop without aid.

For several weeks, real-time data has suggested that the U.S. economic
recovery could be stalling. Now there is evidence it could be going in
reverse.

[Data from the Census
Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp11.html) on
Wednesday showed that the number of employed people fell by more than
four million last week, the fourth-straight weekly decline. Taken
literally, the results indicate that the economy has given up all the
job gains since mid-May, before the recent surge in coronavirus cases.

Just under 52 percent of American adults were employed last week,
according the survey, down from 54 percent in
June.

<div style="max-width:100%;margin:0 auto">

<div class="css-17dprlf" data-id="100000007251173" data-slug="virus-employment" style="max-width:600px">

</div>

</div>

The data comes from the bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey, an
experimental effort to track the pandemic’s economic impact. The survey
has a brief track record, but a [good
one](https://twitter.com/ernietedeschi/status/1285940771892482050): It
correctly signaled the big increase in employment in the [jobs
report](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/economy/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus.html)
for June.

The latest data corresponds to the survey week for the July report,
which will be released in early August. If the results hold up again, it
suggests that report could show a loss of millions of jobs, just as
enhanced unemployment benefits from the federal government are [in
danger of
expiring](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/economy/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus.html).

If the $600 weekly federal supplement to unemployment benefits expires,
more than 20 million Americans could soon see their weekly income fall
by half. But it won’t just be individual recipients who will suffer,
[Ben Casselman
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html):

> The federal payments are injecting billions of dollars into the
> economy each week, money that flows to landlords, grocery stores,
> retailers and countless other businesses.
> 
> Ernie Tedeschi, a former Treasury Department official and an economist
> at Evercore ISI Research, has estimated that if the payments ceased,
> the United States gross domestic product would be 2 percent smaller at
> the end of 2020 and there would be 1.7 million fewer jobs nationwide.
> 
> Congress returned from recess this week to consider a new relief
> package, which[could include at least a partial
> extension](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-aid-package.html)
> of the extra unemployment benefits. Senate Republicans and the White
> House are considering a roughly $1 trillion package that would retain
> the program but scale it back. Democrats are pressing to continue
> paying the full $600 per week.
> 
> But Congress seems unlikely to act before benefits lapse.
> 
> “These unemployment benefit checks are really doing a large job in
> propping up spending by these unemployed households,” said Joseph
> Vavra, a University of Chicago economist. If they expire, he said,
> “there’s a good chance that what is now an unemployment problem
> becomes a foreclosure crisis and eviction
crisis.”

Stocks on Wall Street rose on Wednesday, but the gains were constrained
by rising tension between the United States and China.

After an early dip, the S\&P 500 rose more than half a percent. Shares
in Europe and Asia were mostly lower.

Relations between the United States and China, two giant trading
partners, have been worsening recent weeks, as the Trump administration
has tightened the reins on Chinese diplomats, journalists, scholars and
others in the United States. In the latest action, the [White House told
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)to
leave the its consulate in Houston by Friday. China warned that it might
retaliate.

News of the consulate’s closure had an immediate impact in financial
markets, with stock futures falling and trading in Treasury notes, gold
and oil also reflecting a jolt of nervousness.

But investors on Wall Street have shaken off a number of concerns
lately, including about the surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in the
United States. On Tuesday, [President Trump, in a shift from his usual
rosy forecasts, told
reporters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html)
that the outbreak would probably “get worse before it gets better.” And
a valuable economic lifeline for millions of Americans — $600 a week in
extra unemployment benefits — [is about to
expire](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html)if
Congress doesn’t extend it.

Recent gains have come as lawmakers in Washington haggle over another
economic aid package, and as some large businesses have reported better
than expected results, or signs of improvement.

On Wednesday, for example, shares of **Best Buy** jumped almost 8
percent after the electronics retailer [reported that sales were
rebounding as stores
reopened](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/21/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/best-buy-to-join-retailers-paying-a-15-minimum-wage).
Also sharply higher Wednesday was **Pfizer**, which rose more than 5
percent after the Trump administration said it would pay nearly [$2
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-gets-1-95-billion-to-produce-covid-19-vaccine-by-years-end.html)for
up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. Shares of **BioNTech,** a
German company that is developing the vaccine with Pfizer, were up
nearly 14 percent.

After **Walmart**, America’s largest retailer, announced on
[July 15](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/07/15/a-simple-step-to-help-keep-you-safe-walmart-and-sams-club-require-shoppers-to-wear-face-coverings)
that it would mandate in-store mask-wearing, a flurry of other
companies, including **Kroger, Target** and **Walgreens**, followed
suit. This means that customers will be required to wear face masks in
stores even in places without local mask ordinances.

The [National Retail
Federation](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-calls-retailers-set-nationwide-mask-policy)
has encouraged companies to set nationwide mask policies to protect
employees and shoppers.

Some chains, however, have moved in the opposite direction. After
putting in place a customer mask requirement nearly two weeks ago,
**Dollar Tree** and **Family Dollar** reversed course on July 20, saying
they would require masks only if mandated by state or local rules.

  - 💉 With profit bolstered by hundreds of millions of dollars in
    federal stimulus money, **HCA Healthcare**, the giant for-profit
    hospital chain, reported[much higher second-quarter
    earnings](https://investor.hcahealthcare.com/news/news-details/2020/HCA-Healthcare-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx)
    on Wednesday, even as its revenue fell when its huge network of
    hospitals treated fewer patients during the pandemic. The company
    reported $1.1 billion in net income for the three months that ended
    June 30, a 38 percent jump from the same period in 2019, on lower
    revenue of $11.1 billion. HCA, already [a major

    of hospital bailout money, said it had received a total of $1.7

    percent of last year’s haul if a vaccine does not become available.
    The airline expects passenger revenue in July, August and September
    to be down about 83 percent from the same period last year, a slight
    improvement over the nearly 94 percent decline the airline [reported
