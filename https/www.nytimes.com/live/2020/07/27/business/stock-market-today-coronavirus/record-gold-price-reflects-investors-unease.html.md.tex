Thanksgiving Day is being returned to the workers at major retail
chains, fueled by concerns for worker and customer safety amid the
coronavirus outbreak.

\textbf{Target}
\href{https://corporate.target.com/article/2020/07/early-holiday-plans}{said
Monday} that it would close its stores on Thanksgiving this year as part
of safety measures it has rolled out during the pandemic, following a
similar announcement from \textbf{Walmart}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/21/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\#walmart-will-close-on-thanksgiving-day}{last
week}, which cited appreciation for its staff.

``Let's face it: Historically, deal hunting and holiday shopping can
mean crowded events, and this isn't a year for crowds,'' Target, which
is based in Minneapolis, said in a statement. Target said that it would
start offering deals in October this year as well as after the holiday.

The pandemic has given retailers the chance to reverse the creep of
Black Friday sales into Thanksgiving, something that had
\href{https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sapna/five-years-for-retailers-to-conquer-thanksgiving}{increased
in popularity} over the past decade. The sales have received widespread
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-thanksgiving-protest/target-given-190000-black-friday-protest-signatures-idUSTRE7AK24S20111121\#GDqRY8xAbLObGsib.97}{criticism}
for forcing workers into stores on a holiday often spent with family,
and for promoting consumerism on what's meant to be a day of gratitude.
The criticism has deepened as more consumers shop online from their
couches instead of lining up at stores.

Last year, Target opened at 5 p.m. on Thursday and stayed open until 1
a.m. on Black Friday. (It reopened at 7 a.m. that day.) A spokeswoman
for Walmart said that the retailer had been open on Thanksgiving since
``the 1980s.''

John Furner, the head of Walmart's U.S. operations, said last week in a
memo to employees that after a trying year, ``We want you to enjoy the
day at home with your loved ones.''

Other retailers are likely to follow suit given the size of Walmart and
Target. \textbf{Dick's Sporting Goods} also
\href{http://investors.dicks.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404751770}{announced
Monday} that its retail locations and distribution centers would shut
for the holiday.

As coronavirus cases surge across the country, \textbf{MGM Resorts}
\textbf{International} said on Monday that it would not restart live
entertainment events before Aug. 31.

The company also expects to lay off the majority of employees working in
the entertainment division on that day, according to July 27 letter sent
to employees.

``We've pledged to be as transparent and supportive as possible with
employees and are working to reduce the impact and help them moving
forward,'' MGM said in a statement. ``We're continuing to coordinate
with public officials and look forward to the time when we can bring
back employees to support our entertainment offerings and relaunch
entertainment for our guests.''

Many MGM-owned resorts are now open to guests, including the MGM Grand,
the Bellagio and the ARIA, with most amenities available including
casinos, pools and dine-in restaurants.

Las Vegas's road to reopening has been rocky. Since Nevada casinos
opened on June 4, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the Las
Vegas Strip, many of them without masks. As Covid-19 cases increased
across the state, the governor of Nevada **** issued a statewide mask
order on
\href{http://gov.nv.gov/News/Press/2020/Gov__Sisolak_announces_mandatory_face_covering_policy_in_public/}{June
24} and forced bars that did not serve food to shut their doors at
midnight on July 10, for the second time since the pandemic hit. MGM
requires masks to be worn at all company-owned properties.

Judy Shelton, President Trump's unconventional nominee to the Federal
Reserve Board, has lost the support of a second Republican senator,
potentially imperiling her confirmation to the central bank.

Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said in a statement that she would
not vote for Ms. Shelton's confirmation, joining Mitt Romney, Republican
of Utah, who said last week that he would not support Mr. Trump's
choice.

``Ms. Shelton has openly called for the Federal Reserve to be less
independent of the political branches, and has even questioned the need
for a central bank,'' Ms. Collins said in her statement. ``This is not
the right signal to send, particularly in the midst of the pandemic.''

Ms. Shelton needs only a simple majority vote to clear the Senate.
Assuming no Democrats support her candidacy, she would need to avoid
losing another two Republicans to get the votes she needs for
confirmation.

Ms. Shelton's chances remain unclear. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaskan
Republican who was thought to be a possible ``no'' vote on the
nomination, told reporters last week that she was leaning yes.

Her candidacy has raised questions in part because of her close ties to
the White House. Ms. Shelton advised Mr. Trump's campaign and critics,
including Democratic senators, have suggested she would lack the
independence needed for the Fed board. Her views have also raised
eyebrows: Ms. Shelton has a long history of pushing for a gold standard,
or a similar system in which currency is backed by a common store of
value.

She is nominated alongside Christopher Waller, the research director at
the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a much more conventional pick.
It is unclear when the Senate will vote on the nominations.

If both are confirmed, Mr. Trump will have nominated six of the board's
seven members, who hold a constant vote on monetary policy and
regulatory oversight of the largest banks.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of \textbf{Google's} parent company
\textbf{Alphabet}, told employees Monday that they would not be expected
back in the office until mid-2021.

The company's work force, which has been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/technology/coronavirus-work-from-home.html}{working
remotely since March}, had previously been told to expect a return to
the office in January 2021.

A Google spokesman said: ``To give employees the ability to plan ahead,
we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June
30, 2021 for roles that don't need to be in the office.''

Technology companies moved quickly with work-from-home policies from the
beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, and have been reluctant to bring
workers back too early. In May,
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/coronavirus-stock-market-today.html}{Facebook}}
said it would allow many employees to work from home permanently.

The moves reflect the reality that no one can be sure how long
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&module=STYLN_coronahub\&variant=show\&region=header\&context=menu}{the
coronavirus pandemic} will last, as new outbreaks emerge across the
United States even as the spread of the virus has slowed in early hot
zones like New York City.

News of the decision was reported

  \textbf{Regal Cinemas}, the No. 2 movie theater chain in the United

  planned reopening until Aug. 21. Regal, owned by Cineworld of Britain,
  had previously said it would start relighting marquees on Friday. But

As the United States slowly, haltingly reopens, hotels are trying to
persuade Americans to make this the summer of the road trip.

Although some hotels have kept a trickle of guests coming through the
doors by catering to essential workers, people seeking a change in
scenery and willing to drive to a vacation spot are the industry's
lifeline for the foreseeable future. Most business travel and nearly all
group bookings have been postponed, and many travelers are reluctant to
take unnecessary plane trips.

``Everything that we've seen and read was pointing to the summer of the
drive market and drive destinations,'' said John Davies, vice president
of marketing at Benchmark Resorts \& Hotels.

So, hotel marketing campaigns are leaning into nostalgia, invoking the
familiar tropes of the family car ride to a beach, the mountains or a
national park.

Given that many pools, spas, gyms and restaurants remain closed or are
operating in only a limited capacity, hotels are promoting nearby parks,
scenery and vistas along with simple activities that are easy to do
while maintaining social distance. The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess has
held drive-in movie nights, playing family-friendly cartoons and
comedies in its parking lot, while Kimpton hotels in Winston Salem,
N.C., and Los Angeles created pop-up ``bodegas'' with premade snacks and
bottled cocktails for guests while their restaurants were shuttered.

The focus on regional and short-haul markets is changing how hotels
communicate with travelers and giving a much bigger role to social media
channels. ``The messages are getting a little bit more specific,'' said
Bjorn Hanson, a hotel industry consultant. ``This is a
property-by-property environment --- each really has to have its own
unique messaging.''

Is Labor Day our moment to return to the movie theaters? \textbf{Warner
Bros.} is betting on it.

On Monday, Warner said that it was scheduling the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/media/tenet-release-delayed.html}{oft-moving
``Tenet''} for a Sept. 4 release in the United States. First, though,
the film will open in over 70 countries, including Germany, Italy,
Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom, starting on Aug. 26.

Touted as a mind-bending thriller from the filmmaker Christopher Nolan,
``Tenet'' has become something of a marker in the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/media/tenet-release-delayed.html?searchResultPosition=3}{struggle
to open theaters} in the United States. Originally slated for July 17,
the film's release has been pushed back twice because of the coronavirus
pandemic.

The release of \textbf{Walt Disney's} ``Mulan'' has also been delayed,
as has ``Unhinged,'' a Russell Crowe thriller from \textbf{Solstice
Studios}. While those are likely to receive new release dates in the
late summer or early fall, other studios have given up on 2020.
\textbf{Paramount}, for example, has pushed its wide releases for films
like ``A Quiet Place 2'' and the ``Top Gun'' sequel into 2021.

Here's the latest news in the ongoing negotiations in Washington over a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html}{new
stimulus package}:

\begin{quote}
Republicans are seeking a \$400-per-week reduction in unemployment
benefits in their \$1 trillion proposal economic recovery package,
initially lowering the payments for tens of millions of jobless
Americans from \$600 to \$200, according to officials familiar with the
talks.

The proposal to slash the jobless aid by two thirds, part of a
Republican plan they intend to present later on Monday, is likely to be
among the most bitterly contested issues in bipartisan negotiations over
the next round of pandemic relief. Democrats support a \$3 trillion
package that includes extending the \$600-per-week unemployment
payments, which expire on Friday, through the end of the year.

Gold reached a record high on Monday, continuing its rise as nervous
investors sought a safe place to put their money.

The price for spot gold, which has been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus\#stocks-fall-and-gold-rallies-as-uncertainty-ripples-through-wall-street}{climbing
steadily} since March, reached a record high of \$1,944 per ounce on
Monday.

The price of gold usually rises amid financial uncertainty, and its
recent climb reflected a number of factors, including concern over
U.S.-China relations, the decline of the U.S. dollar amid the Federal
Reserve's stimulus efforts and rock-bottom interest rates. The last time
gold reached this level was following the 2008 financial crisis, another
time when the Fed flooded the economy with dollars to generate economic
activity.

Stock markets were mixed on Monday, with shares in the United States
slightly higher while those in Europe and Asia were mostly lower. The
S\&P 500 rose more than half a percent, as shares of large technology
companies like \textbf{Apple} and \textbf{Microsoft} rebounded from a
decline last week. Reflecting the rally in tech stocks, the Nasdaq
composite rose more than 1.5 percent.

Monday saw some encouraging news on the coronavirus vaccine front.
Shares of the biotech company \textbf{Moderna} rose more than 9 percent
after it said that it had received
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/27/us/27reuters-health-coronavirus-moderna.html}{another
\$472 million in funding} from the U.S. government. Moderna's
experimental vaccine will go
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/cornavirus-vaccine-moderna.html}{into
a Phase 3 test} on Monday involving 30,000 people.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/europe/Spain-quarantine-UK-travel.html}{British
government's abrupt decision} over the weekend to order travelers
arriving from Spain to self-isolate for 14 days, citing a spurt in
coronavirus cases in that country, added to uncertainty over travel
restrictions and caused shares of travel-related companies to dive. The
British low-cost airline \textbf{EasyJet} and the European travel
company \textbf{Tui} each fell sharply, as did \textbf{IAG}, the parent
company of \textbf{British Airways} and \textbf{Iberia}.

The pandemic has scrambled what fliers want.

Price and schedule flexibility used to be the most important factors in
choosing a flight, but now customers are more concerned about
cleanliness and social distancing throughout the airport and on the
plane, according to Bill Lentsch, a 30-year veteran of \textbf{Delta Air
Lines} who serves as its chief customer experience officer.

``The order of priorities is different,'' he said in an interview.

Delta is trying to stake a claim as one of the most cautious airlines in
the industry, as it and its peers fight over the few people who are
still flying. The airline has already promised to leave middle seats
empty through September, test all of its employees for the coronavirus
and clean each of its planes between flights.

Last month, Delta teamed up with the Mayo Clinic, and on Monday, it
announced a new partnership with the parent company of Lysol to improve
cleaning in flight, starting with airplane lavatories.

``It doesn't sound terribly glamorous, but it's incredibly important to
our people,'' Mr. Lentsch said.

The airline hopes those partnerships will yield dividends, helping to
improve its practices in unexpected ways.

``We're looking for a critical eye to help us fill any gaps and push the
boundaries,'' Mr. Lentsch said. ``It is my opinion that in three to six
months, there are going to be some products on our airplanes that I'm
not even contemplating right now.''
