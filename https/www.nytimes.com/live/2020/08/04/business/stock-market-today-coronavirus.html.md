**The Walt Disney Company** reported doomsday financial results on
Tuesday, with padlocked theme parks, idled cruise ships, postponed film
releases, darkened Broadway marquees, closed mall stores and the absence
of live sports on ESPN as a result of the coronavirus pandemic all
contributing to $4.72 billion in quarterly losses.

But Disney’s newest and, as far as many investors are concerned, most
important business —
[streaming](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers.html)
— experienced growth as people quarantined at home. Disney said it had
more than 100 million subscribers worldwide across its Disney+, Hulu and
ESPN+ streaming services. Disney+ has about 58 million by itself, an
astounding number for a platform that is less than nine months old.

Crossing the 100 million threshold was “a significant milestone and a
reaffirmation of our direct-to-consumer strategy, which we view as key
to the future growth of our company,” Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief
executive officer, said in a statement.

In total, revenue in the quarter that ended on June 27 added up to
$11.78 billion, falling from $20.26 billion and underscoring the
[extreme
difficulties](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/business/media/coronavirus-disney.html)
that the world’s largest entertainment company has faced during the
coronavirus pandemic. During the quarter, Disney furloughed an estimated
100,000 employees, slashed executive pay by up to 50 percent and took
out a $5 billion line of credit to bolster its liquidity, on top of
$8.25 billion secured in March.

Per-share losses in the quarter, the third in Disney’s fiscal year,
totaled $2.61 — a stark departure from the spectacular growth the
company delivered from 2006, when it bought Pixar, to last year, when it
swallowed the majority of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empire. In the
same period last year, Disney had a profit of 79 cents per share.

Excluding one-time items, Disney squeaked out per share profit for the
most recent quarter of eight cents, better than analysts were expecting.

Disney’s share price has been remarkably buoyant, however, because
investors have focused on comeback efforts — the return of some sporting
events and a retrofitted Walt Disney World that [reopened to a limited
number of
visitors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/business/florida-coronavirus-disney-world-reopening.html)
in mid-July — and the success of Disney’s streaming division. Hulu has
been on a roll because of new programming, including the FX-supplied
series “Mrs. America,” which received eight Emmy nominations. Disney+
created a cultural thunderclap in early July, when it released a live
capture of the original “Hamilton” stage production.

**Fox News** remains the profit king at Rupert Murdoch’s diminished
media empire. The cable news behemoth was the lone bright spot at its
parent company **Fox Corporation**, which reported a drop in quarterly
profit and revenue because of impacts from the coronavirus pandemic.

Profit plummeted 69 percent to $145 million in three months ending in
June because of a decrease in advertising and an increase in costs,
including a significant impairment charge related to exiting a rights
agreement with U.S. Golf Association.

Since Mr. Murdoch sold the majority of his business to **The Walt Disney
Company**, his Fox empire has slimmed down to focus on sports and news.
Fox News has benefited from people in lockdown, but the absence of major
sports programming has severely cut into the business.

Revenue was down 4 percent to $2.5 billion, slightly better than Wall
Street’s expectations of $2.3 billion. Fox News helped dampen the
downturn. The cable news channel saw an uptick in advertising despite a
recent [marketing
boycott](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/media/tucker-carlson-advertisers-ratings.html)
of the network’s biggest prime time star, Tucker Carlson.

Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive, characterized the performance as a
strong result in spite of the pandemic. “We entered the Covid-19 crisis
on sound operational and financial footing and we expect to emerge from
this pandemic more competitive, more focused and even more strongly
positioned to deliver value for our viewers, partners and shareholders
in the years ahead,” he said in a statement accompanying the results.

The division that houses Fox News saw a 12 percent jump in profit to
$674 million, accounting for 90 percent of the company’s total operating
profit. The company also benefited from contractual rate increases that
cable and satellite operators pay to carry Fox’s networks. In addition
to Fox News, the company also owns Fox broadcasting and the FS1 cable
sports channel.

As at other media networks, Fox saw an enormous defection in total ad
revenue, which dropped 22 percent to $712 million. Carriage fees rose
7.7 percent to $1.5 billion.

On the earnings call after the report, Mr. Murdoch underscored how
sports had started to return, including Major League Baseball, despite
flare-ups in coronavirus cases among some teams. He sounded an
optimistic note about the return of football by September, saying “we
fully expect college football and N.F.L. to come back.”

A surge in shares of **Eastman Kodak** before a deal was announced with
the Trump administration to produce critical components for the
pharmaceutical industry has come under scrutiny after a senator called
for a federal investigation and news reports suggested that one was
already underway.

On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, called
on [U.S. securities
regulators](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.08.03%20Letter%20to%20SEC%20re%20Kodak%20stock%20trades.pdf)to
investigate trading in shares of Eastman Kodak before the company
disclosed that it would receive [a $765 million federal
loan](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-united-states-will-lend-kodak-765-million-to-make-drug-components)
to produce ingredients to make critical drugs in the United States.

Then on Tuesday, [The Wall Street Journal
reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-loan-disclosure-and-stock-surge-under-sec-investigation-11596559126)
that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun a preliminary
inquiry. Ms. Warren applauded the news in a [post on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1290697801882632193) that
linked to The Journal article.

Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., said in a statement it “intends to
fully cooperate with any potential inquiries.” Arielle Patrick, a
spokeswoman for the company, said Kodak never intended for news about
the loan to run in a local publication before the [Trump
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#the-united-states-will-lend-kodak-765-million-to-make-drug-components)
announced on July 28 that the company had been tapped to work on a
potential treatment for Covid-19 and other ailments.

An official with the S.E.C. declined to comment. Kodak had not received
any notification from the commission as of Tuesday, said a person
familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
matter was not public.

The timing of the loan to Kodak, best known for its camera and film
processing business, raised controversy because the official
announcement [came a day after the
company](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/kodak-ceo-stock-options.html)had
awarded Jim Continenza, the company’s chairman and chief executive, 1.75
million in stock options.

Kodak awarded those stock options to Mr. Continenza at the same time it
was alerting local media in Rochester about the impending loan deal. At
least one news outlet in Rochester jumped the gun on that news — one
potential reason behind the 25 percent surge in Kodak shares on July 27.
The stock closed at $2.62 that day and rose more than 1,000 percent over
the next two days on news of the Trump deal.

Within 48 hours of the options being granted to Mr. Continenza, they
were worth about $50 million. For now, though, any gains in the value of
those options are just theoretical as Mr. Continenza has yet to exercise
them to buy shares.

In her letter, Ms. Warren said there were “questions about how Kodak
handled what appears to be ‘non-intentional disclosure of material
nonpublic information.’’’ She said the company might have violated a
securities rule intended to handle such inadvertent disclosures.

**NBCUniversal**, the media giant that includes Universal Pictures, the
NBC broadcast network and several cable channels, started layoffs this
week because of the affects of the coronavirus pandemic, according to
two people familiar with the matter.

The company plans to eliminate about 10 percent of its full time work
force of 35,000.

The pandemic has cut into sports broadcasts, closed movie theaters and
shut down theme parks. A large portion of the staff cuts will happen at
NBCUniversal’s theme parks group, which took a $399 million loss in the
second quarter, the only unit to lose money in the period.

The company recently reopened its locations in Florida and Japan after
closing for several months. Its California location remains closed.

Total sales for NBCUniversal, owned by **Comcast**, fell 25 percent to
$6.1 billion in the second quarter, as the virus continued to wipe out
spending. Sales at the Universal Studios division declined nearly a
fifth to $1.2 billion as the country waited for theaters to more fully
open.

The ad giant **Publicis Groupe** cut ties on Tuesday with an executive
over his Twitter posts about the coronavirus pandemic.

Tom Goodwin, who became the company’s head of futures and insight in
January,
[posted](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1289981216335073280?s=20)
over the weekend that he found “the total obsession with Covid deaths
over all other deaths entirely gruesome. 7,500 Americans die every day
but only the ones with this precise new Virus matter.”

The post, like [several
others](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1251848439035502592?s=20)
about [the
crisis](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1236483014277894144?s=20)
in recent months, incited outrage from many in the advertising industry.
On Sunday, Tom Morton, the U.S. chief strategy officer of R/GA, urged
Mr. Goodwin [to stop
posting](https://twitter.com/tommorton/status/1289992807038332928?s=20):
“Please no more clickbait contrarianism. You’re better than this.” Mr.
Goodwin hit back with a [expletive-laced
response](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1289995369313497090?s=20),
telling Mr. Morton to “[get off your lofty
perch](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1289994688275988481?s=20)”
and mocking his “sourdough baking home-schooling.”

Publicis “parted ways” with Mr. Goodwin because his actions on social
media “do not meet the standard of conduct we expect of our company’s
employees and were not aligned with our values,” the advertising firm
said in a statement first reported by the trade publication
[AdWeek](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/after-coronavirus-tweets-tom-goodwin-is-out-at-publicis-groupe/).

Mr. Goodwin did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but
seemed to address the uproar by [posting on
Monday](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1290340999672332291) that
“in the free thinking world of 2020 we are only ‘allowed’ to have
perfectly aligned “genuine concerns,” while adding that it was “time to
repeat that I’m [not a voice of
Publicis](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/1290325449529274370?s=20).”

The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has driven [interest rates to
rock-bottom
levels](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html),
meaning there has hardly been a better time to borrow. But with tens of
million of people out of work and coronavirus infections surging in many
parts of the country, [qualifying for a
loan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/your-money/mortgage-loans-credit-cards-coronavirus.html)
— from mortgages to auto loans — has become more trying, even for
well-positioned borrowers.

Lenders that have [set aside billion of
dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/big-banks-quarterly-results.html)
for future defaults have also tightened their standards, often requiring
higher credit scores, heftier down payments and more documentation.
Some, such as **Wells Fargo** and **Chase**, have temporarily eliminated
home equity lines of credit, while Wells Fargo also stopped cash-out
refinancing.

It’s not unusual for lenders to tighten the credit reins during a
downturn, but the current situation has made it especially challenging
for them to get an accurate read on consumers’ financial health.
Borrowers have been able to pause mortgages, halt student loan payments
and delay paying their tax bills, while millions of households have
received an extra $600 weekly in unemployment benefits. Those forms of
government support could be masking an underlying condition.

“It makes it hard for a lender to understand what the consumer’s true
state of credit quality is and their ability to pay back a loan,” said
Peter Maynard, senior vice president of global data and analytics at the
**Equifax** credit bureau.

Black-owned businesses have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic
and the resulting economic crisis, a new [study by the Federal
Reserve](https://www.newyorkfed.org/smallbusiness/small-business-credit-survey-2020)
found, underlining how minority communities have borne a
disproportionate cost of the virus.

The analysis, from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, shows that
[Black-owned
businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-black-owned-small-business.html)
are heavily concentrated in areas that were hard-hit by the outbreak.
And those businesses were already vulnerable before the crisis began,
according to the briefing, written by Claire Kramer Mills and Jessica
Battisto.

“Counties with the highest concentration of COVID-19 are also the areas
with the highest concentration of Black businesses and networks,” the
authors wrote, noting that “weaker cash positions, weaker bank
relationships, and pre-existing funding gaps left Black firms with
little cushion entering the crisis.”

Black-owned businesses now appear to be closing at a faster rate than
those owned by other minority groups.

While the overall number of active business owners fell 22 percent
between February and April, the number of active Black business owners
dropped by 41 percent. Other minority groups also saw a major cost: The
number of Latino business owners fell by 32 percent, and Asian business
owners dropped by 26 percent. Those figures are based on a University of
California Santa Cruz analysis of census data.

Even as minority communities shouldered heavier burdens amid the
[coronavirus
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html),
they have sometimes failed to access federal help amid what the authors
call “stark” coverage gaps.

In counties with the densest Black-owned business activity, Paycheck
Protection Program loan coverage rates were typically lower than 20
percent, the report found. That was “not too different” from the
national coverage rate of 17.7 percent, according to the authors, but
there was big variation across counties.

For instance, only 7 percent of businesses in the Bronx, 11.3 percent in
Queens, and 11.6 percent in the Michigan county that is home to Detroit
received the forgivable loans.

Probably at play: Black communities often lack access to banks in the
best of times. Black-owned businesses are far less likely than
white-owned businesses to have stable banking relationships.

Lack of credit access in communities of color raises “questions that
have heightened significance when banks are relied on to administer
federal, taxpayer-supported relief programs, as is the case with PPP,”
the brief said.

Stocks rose on Tuesday, extending a rally that has lifted technology
shares to new highs as lawmakers in Washington continued to try to pin
down a coronavirus relief package.

Investors have one eye on corporate earnings reports, and the other on
lawmakers who are discussing the latest aid bill to help people and
businesses hit by the economic crisis. Negotiations reconvened on
Tuesday to try to reach an agreement on how to extend aid to tens of
millions of Americans who lost crucial [unemployment
benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/unemployment-payments-change.html)
at the end of July. Economists have warned that permanent damage could
be wrought on the economy without action.

Trading on Tuesday was unsteady, with the S\&P 500 falling back into
negative territory at several points throughout the day. But sentiment
was also lifted by a report showing an uptick in factory orders in June,
another indication of rebounding economic activity. By the end of the
day, the S\&P 500 climbed about 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite
rose to another record.

On the earnings front, the [London-based oil
giant](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/04/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/bp-to-step-up-renewable-investment-as-it-reports-a-huge-loss)**[BP](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/04/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/bp-to-step-up-renewable-investment-as-it-reports-a-huge-loss)**
reported a $16.8 billion quarterly loss, and cut its dividend in half
for the first time in a decade. The company also said it would increase
its investments in low-carbon energy, like solar and wind power, by
tenfold in a decade, while cutting its oil and gas production by 40
percent. Its shares rose despite the huge loss.

The gain on Tuesday adds to a steady climb for stocks that has lifted
the S\&P 500 to within 3 percent of its record. That has been fueled by
government spending, the efforts of the Federal Reserve to backstop the
economy and a surge in shares of technology stocks like **Apple**,
**Amazon** and **Microsoft** — which have reported higher profits as
more people work and shop from home.

  - **Uber** said it extended its timetable for employees to work from
    home, saying that they will not be asked to go back to the office
    until June 2021. Previously, Uber told employees that they could
    expect to return by the end of September. But as coronavirus cases
    continued to rise in the United States, the goal of returning safely
    in the fall became less realistic. In Europe, some of Uber’s offices
    have already reopened. If the pandemic subsides enough for U.S.
    offices to reopen before June, employees would have the option to
    return early, a spokesman said.

  - **Wynn Resorts** said on Tuesday that [its operating revenue
    plunged 94.8
    percent](https://wynnresortslimited.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wynn-resorts-limited-reports-second-quarter-2020-results?field_nir_news_date_value%5Bmin%5D=)
    to $85.7 million for the second quarter, compared with $1.66 billion
    in the same period last year. The company, based in Las Vegas,
    reported a net loss of $637.6 million for the April-to-June period.
    Like other casinos, Wynn Resorts’ operations closed in the spring
    and reopened in June but with limited capacity because of health
    restrictions, including a limited number of seats per table and
    slots machines spaced farther apart to accommodate social
    distancing.

  - **[Booking.com](http://booking.com/)** plans to reduce its global
    work force of more than 17,500 employees by up to 25 percent as the
    coronavirus pandemic continues to take a devastating toll on the
    travel industry. **Booking Holdings**, the parent company of
    [Booking.com](http://booking.com/), will make announcements to
    employees beginning in September on a country by country basis,
    [according to a securities
    filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553120000042/bkng-20200804.htm).
    Booking Holdings, which owns other travel websites including
    **Kayak** and **[Priceline.com](http://priceline.com/),** reported a
    51 percent drop in gross travel bookings in the first quarter of
    2020 compared to the same period last year.
