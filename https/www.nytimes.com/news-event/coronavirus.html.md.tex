\subsection{Frequently Asked
Questions}\label{frequently-asked-questions}}

I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html}{stimulus
bills enacted in March} offer help for the millions of American small
businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit
organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole
proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger
companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes
the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan
program. But lots of folks have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html}{not
yet seen payouts.} Even those who have received help are confused: The
rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html}{money
they don't know how to use.} Many small-business owners are getting less
than they expected or
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html}{not
hearing anything at all.}

What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?

Employers have to provide
\href{https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html}{a safe
workplace} with policies that protect everyone equally.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html}{And
if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
C.D.C.} has said that
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html}{employers
should tell their employees} -\/- without giving you the sick employee's
name -\/- that they may have been exposed to the virus.

Should I refinance my mortgage?

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html}{It
could be a good idea,} because mortgage rates have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html}{never
been lower.} Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to
some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be
aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

What is school going to look like in September?

It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this
fall, requiring the grind of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html}{online
learning},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html}{makeshift
child care} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html}{stunted
workdays} to continue. California's two largest public school districts
--- Los Angeles and San Diego --- said on July 13, that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html}{instruction
will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students
and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students.
They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For
other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach.
\href{https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/}{Many
systems}, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html}{hybrid
plans} that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your
municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your
community.

Is the coronavirus airborne?

The coronavirus
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html}{can
stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air}, infecting people
as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is
highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help
explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches
and restaurants.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html}{It's
unclear how often the virus is spread} via these tiny droplets, or
aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick
person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with
contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia
Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales,
talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
who
\href{https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798}{have
outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health
Organization}.

    The country's capacity to make testing efficient, affordable and

    wave, it's testing anyone returning from a ``hot zone'' on entry.

  Debido a la pandemia, algunos estudiantes tomaban clases en línea y
  otros no. Así que el gobierno eliminó el año escolar para todos, que
  deberán repetir el curso en 2021. La medida, que pretendía atender la
  brecha de acceso a la educación, puede empeorar la desigualdad .
