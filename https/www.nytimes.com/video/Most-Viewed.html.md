## What’s Happening in Kashmir? Our Cameras Contradict India’s Official Story

#### Indian authorities say life is returning to normal in Kashmir. But thousands of people have been detained, and the military still patrols the streets, firing pellet guns and tear gas to quell protests.

</div>

  -   
    It’s Friday on the streets of Kashmir’s largest city. It’s the day
    Muslims normally gather to pray. But in recent weeks, it’s also
    become a day of protest. Indian authorities are working hard to keep
    a lid on displays like this. But they can’t change how people feel.
    As protests break out across Kashmir, Indian officials repeat what
    has become a well-worn soundbite. “There have been no major law and
    order situations reported from across the Valley. Life is slowly
    returning to normal.” “And the situation is returning back slowly to
    the normal.” But things here don’t seem normal. Kashmir has been a
    conflict zone for decades. But when India moved to strip the region
    of its autonomy on Aug. 5, the situation came to this: thousands
    more troops and a curfew bringing daily life to a standstill. Phone
    lines and internet access were shut down, cutting off around eight
    million Kashmiris from the outside world. So, we came to see what’s
    actually happening here. We visit a neighborhood known for frequent
    clashes between protesters and Indian security forces. People, here,
    are in mourning. Fahmida Shagoo was at home with her children and
    her in-laws on Aug. 9. Police started firing tear gas at protesters
    outside. Fahmida’s husband, Rafiq, helped rush her to the hospital.
    But doctors could not revive her. A sudden death and no one to hold
    accountable. In addition to tear gas, for years, Indian forces have
    used pellet guns to quell unrest in Kashmir. These shotguns fire
    cartridges full of lead pellets that lodge themselves in the flesh.
    They are supposedly non-lethal, but can cause life-changing
    disabilities. Parvez Sofi says he was at home when he heard a
    commotion outside. When he opened the door to see what was
    happening, he became a target. In the name of maintaining law and
    order, Indian forces have license to shoot with near impunity in
    Kashmir. There is no official number for the injured. But in just
    one hospital here, sources told us over 60 people had been admitted
    with pellet wounds since the lockdown began. Still, this doesn’t
    stop some people. And lives here have been upended in other ways,
    too. This woman’s 22-year-old son, Mehraj Ud-Din, was arrested. She
    doesn’t know why he was taken. Since then, authorities have been
    giving her conflicting information. This is not an isolated case.
    Since early August, thousands have been arrested without being
    charged. And there’s no indication when or if they’ll be released.
    Although some landlines have been reconnected, Kashmir is still
    largely cut off from the rest of the world. That helps authorities
    keep stories like these quiet. But as the days pass, they’re getting
    louder.
