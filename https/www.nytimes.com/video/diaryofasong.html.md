## How to Convince Phoebe Bridgers to Write a Rock Song

#### The 25-year-old singer and songwriter shows us how “Kyoto” transformed from a ballad into a rock song over months, combining a stray lyric, a bare-bones voice memo from tour and shared memories of childhood.

</div>

  -   
    “Hey.” “Hey. Can you hear me?” “Yeah. I had the ‘I’m going to kill
    you’ line already, I think from a song I was trying to write about
    fentanyl. And then I was like, actually that kind of works. And it
    started as a ballad.” Singing: “I’m going to kill you if you don’t
    beat me to it. Born under Scorpio skies.” “The first thing that I
    notice when I listen to Phoebe’s music is the writing itself.”
    Singing: “Day off in Kyoto. Got bored at the temple. Looked around
    at the 7-Eleven.” “She’ll literally write two lines, and then she’ll
    wait months just for the perfect next line.” Singing: “You called me
    from a pay phone — they still got pay phones, it cost $1 a minute —
    to tell me you’re getting sober and you wrote me a letter, but I
    don’t have to read it.” “Phoebe’s like magical power. It’s just
    like these incredibly somber and gorgeous songs that are also
    hilarious.” “You write a lot of very slow —” Singing: “Can the
    killer in me —” “— very rip your heart out and stomp on it ballads.”
    Singing: “Jesus Christ, I’m so blue all the time.” “It’s easy for me
    to do. I think that’s just the way that they sound when I play them
    solo.” “Where did the idea for ‘Kyoto’ start?” “I think it’s like a
    collage chopped up into one experience. Like, I literally got home
    from tour. And then Marshall and I were talking about our dads and
    their similarities.” “Our dads both had beers in their laps and were
    like, ‘You want to learn how to drive?’ Like that kind of thing. And
    we were both laughing about that. We’re like, ‘What the hell is
    wrong with these guys?’” Singing: “He said you called on his
    birthday. You were off by like 10 days, but you get a few points for
    trying.” “It’s just about that complex relationship that you can
    never kind of get rid of. Wanted to see the world through your eyes,
    and then it happened. And I changed my mind.” “She just found this
    way to sing heartbreaking stuff in an alluring way. And that’s
    really been kind of the story of her career, I think.” “I had been
    playing since I was a teenager once or twice a month. And then when
    I graduated high school, it was just constant. And I thought that’s
    what it was.” “I signed Beck 25 years ago. This was the first time
    since that, that I heard one song and said, ‘OK, I’m in.’” “I’d met
    a lot of producers that were like, I’m going to put a trap beat over
    your voice. And Tony was the first producer I met — I think he’s the
    reason that my music sounds the way it does.” “The first album was
    mostly me, Ethan and Phoebe. “‘Stranger in the Alps’ was the first
    record I got to be a real producer on.” Singing: “You, you must’ve
    been looking for me.” “We became the Trilemma, as we call
    ourselves.” “I had no idea what my music sounded like before I
    started the first album. And then by the time I finished, I was
    like, ‘Oh.’ And that’s how we started this record.” “We had started
    maybe tracking four or five songs at this point in the record.” “But
    there was a problem, and that was Phoebe is very drawn to slow tempo
    stuff.” “All of us were like, we do need to have some tempo. And
    Phoebe was like, I have a new song.” Singing: “Day off in Kyoto. Got
    bored at the temple. Looked around at the 7-Eleven. So slow.”
    “Sounds like a Phoebe Bridgers song.” “Totally.” “I said, ‘Look,
    this song is great, and the lyrics are incredible.’ But I said,
    ‘Look, let’s speed this up. Let’s let it rock.’” “‘Motion
    Sickness’ was, I think, one of the more beloved songs off of that
    first record.” Singing: “I have emotional motion —” “This song, I
    think, we wanted to do a similar thing: Give it some tempo, give it
    some energy.” “And I was like, ‘Let’s go. Let’s do it.’” Singing:
    “Day off in Kyoto. Got bored at the temple. Looked around at the
    7-Eleven.” “I think we were all like — smiling at each other,
    realizing it was working and just like —” “There are definitely
    times where you take slower, sadder ones, and you start playing
    them, and they lose, like the chorus all of a sudden feels flat.
    This one seemed to really like being a rocker.” “Ethan on pocket
    piano, which is the thing that plays the — Singing: “Doo, doo, doo,
    doo, doo.” “I was almost thinking in my head, which is often the
    case, I’m probably playing something that I need to make cooler,
    like it’s probably lame. And Phoebe and Chris were like, ‘That’s
    really cool.’” “That’s classic Ethan \[expletive\].” “And then the
    trumpet idea — Phoebe was like, ‘I want horns.’” “It’s kind of at
    odds with a rock band to me, but when it’s done right, it’s
    incredible.” “I thought, this is the last time I’m ever going to
    play trumpet.” “Oh, no.” “I had been dealing with this tooth
    problem. We started doing takes of ‘Kyoto.’” “He didn’t tell anybody
    in the studio that he had chipped his front tooth. So playing was
    excruciating.” “Where were you on the smiley face pain chart?”
    “Somewhere between 8 and 1/2 and 9.” “We made him do it a million
    times.” “And you had no idea.” “We had no — I feel so bad.” “There
    was a lot of trumpet to record.” \[trumpet playing\] “I felt like it
    really felt like a song when I recorded the backing vocals. I’m
    going to — I thought that was so fun.” “In the tradition of people
    like John Lennon, who could write a profoundly sad lyric and play it
    as an up-tempo song, she did that with that song. And it was, I
    think, really effective because you’re very seduced by its tempo, by
    its rollicking nature. And then you start singing the song. You find
    yourself going, ‘Oh no, this is terrible.’ And it’s great. That’s a
    device she employs, and she employs it effectively.” “And only a few
    times per album.” “But when it happens, man, pow\!” Singing: “I
    wanted to see the world. Then I flew over the ocean, and I changed
    my mind. Whew.” “I don’t think about all my songs as ballads
    anymore. I feel like they’re not even really fully written until
    I’ve shown them to those guys. And they’re like, ‘This stays a
    ballad,’ or ‘This is a rock song.’” “It’s going to be an important
    song for the record.” “And I changed my mind. That’s very Tony, too,
    to throw this in there.” \[strums guitar\] “How about when she
    screams at the end of ‘I Know.’ I’ll send you a video of her doing
    it.” “I wanted to be able to hit a really raspy Conor Oberst or
    Haley Dahl scream, because I love it in music.” “Did you have to
    teach yourself how to scream?” “I thought I did. And I asked Conor
    to come to the studio the day that I was screaming. And he was like,
    ‘What? You just have to scream.’” \[screaming\] \[screaming\]
    \[screaming\] \[humming\] “I just had this idea that I wanted it to
    bounce.” Singing: “I got the horses in the back.” - \[humming\]
    \[snapping fingers\] Singing “Man, what’s the deal? Man, I’m coming
    through. It’s your girl, Lizzo.
\[laughs\]”
