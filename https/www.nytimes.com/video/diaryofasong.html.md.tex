  ``Hey.'' ``Hey. Can you hear me?'' ``Yeah. I had the `I'm going to
  kill you' line already, I think from a song I was trying to write
  about fentanyl. And then I was like, actually that kind of works. And
  it started as a ballad.'' Singing: ``I'm going to kill you if you
  don't beat me to it. Born under Scorpio skies.'' ``The first thing
  that I notice when I listen to Phoebe's music is the writing itself.''
  Singing: ``Day off in Kyoto. Got bored at the temple. Looked around at
  the 7-Eleven.'' ``She'll literally write two lines, and then she'll
  wait months just for the perfect next line.'' Singing: ``You called me
  from a pay phone --- they still got pay phones, it cost \$1 a minute
  --- to tell me you're getting sober and you wrote me a letter, but I
  don't have to read it.'' ``Phoebe's like magical power. It's just like
  these incredibly somber and gorgeous songs that are also hilarious.''
  ``You write a lot of very slow ---'' Singing: ``Can the killer in me
  ---'' ``--- very rip your heart out and stomp on it ballads.''
  Singing: ``Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time.'' ``It's easy for
  me to do. I think that's just the way that they sound when I play them
  solo.'' ``Where did the idea for `Kyoto' start?'' ``I think it's like
  a collage chopped up into one experience. Like, I literally got home
  from tour. And then Marshall and I were talking about our dads and
  their similarities.'' ``Our dads both had beers in their laps and were
  like, `You want to learn how to drive?' Like that kind of thing. And
  we were both laughing about that. We're like, `What the hell is wrong
  with these guys?''' Singing: ``He said you called on his birthday. You
  were off by like 10 days, but you get a few points for trying.''
  ``It's just about that complex relationship that you can never kind of
  get rid of. Wanted to see the world through your eyes, and then it
  happened. And I changed my mind.'' ``She just found this way to sing
  heartbreaking stuff in an alluring way. And that's really been kind of
  the story of her career, I think.'' ``I had been playing since I was a
  teenager once or twice a month. And then when I graduated high school,
  it was just constant. And I thought that's what it was.'' ``I signed
  Beck 25 years ago. This was the first time since that, that I heard
  one song and said, `OK, I'm in.''' ``I'd met a lot of producers that
  were like, I'm going to put a trap beat over your voice. And Tony was
  the first producer I met --- I think he's the reason that my music
  sounds the way it does.'' ``The first album was mostly me, Ethan and
  Phoebe. ```Stranger in the Alps' was the first record I got to be a
  real producer on.'' Singing: ``You, you must've been looking for me.''
  ``We became the Trilemma, as we call ourselves.'' ``I had no idea what
  my music sounded like before I started the first album. And then by
  the time I finished, I was like, `Oh.' And that's how we started this
  record.'' ``We had started maybe tracking four or five songs at this
  point in the record.'' ``But there was a problem, and that was Phoebe
  is very drawn to slow tempo stuff.'' ``All of us were like, we do need
  to have some tempo. And Phoebe was like, I have a new song.'' Singing:
  ``Day off in Kyoto. Got bored at the temple. Looked around at the
  7-Eleven. So slow.'' ``Sounds like a Phoebe Bridgers song.''
  ``Totally.'' ``I said, `Look, this song is great, and the lyrics are
  incredible.' But I said, `Look, let's speed this up. Let's let it
  rock.''' ```Motion Sickness' was, I think, one of the more beloved
  songs off of that first record.'' Singing: ``I have emotional motion
  ---'' ``This song, I think, we wanted to do a similar thing: Give it
  some tempo, give it some energy.'' ``And I was like, `Let's go. Let's
  do it.''' Singing: ``Day off in Kyoto. Got bored at the temple. Looked
  around at the 7-Eleven.'' ``I think we were all like --- smiling at
  each other, realizing it was working and just like ---'' ``There are
  definitely times where you take slower, sadder ones, and you start
  playing them, and they lose, like the chorus all of a sudden feels
  flat. This one seemed to really like being a rocker.'' ``Ethan on
  pocket piano, which is the thing that plays the --- Singing: ``Doo,
  doo, doo, doo, doo.'' ``I was almost thinking in my head, which is
  often the case, I'm probably playing something that I need to make
  cooler, like it's probably lame. And Phoebe and Chris were like,
  `That's really cool.''' ``That's classic Ethan {[}expletive{]}.''
  ``And then the trumpet idea --- Phoebe was like, `I want horns.'''
  ``It's kind of at odds with a rock band to me, but when it's done
  right, it's incredible.'' ``I thought, this is the last time I'm ever
  going to play trumpet.'' ``Oh, no.'' ``I had been dealing with this
  tooth problem. We started doing takes of `Kyoto.''' ``He didn't tell
  anybody in the studio that he had chipped his front tooth. So playing
  was excruciating.'' ``Where were you on the smiley face pain chart?''
  ``Somewhere between 8 and 1/2 and 9.'' ``We made him do it a million
  times.'' ``And you had no idea.'' ``We had no --- I feel so bad.''
  ``There was a lot of trumpet to record.'' {[}trumpet playing{]} ``I
  felt like it really felt like a song when I recorded the backing
  vocals. I'm going to --- I thought that was so fun.'' ``In the
  tradition of people like John Lennon, who could write a profoundly sad
  lyric and play it as an up-tempo song, she did that with that song.
  And it was, I think, really effective because you're very seduced by
  its tempo, by its rollicking nature. And then you start singing the
  song. You find yourself going, `Oh no, this is terrible.' And it's
  great. That's a device she employs, and she employs it effectively.''
  ``And only a few times per album.'' ``But when it happens, man, pow!''
  Singing: ``I wanted to see the world. Then I flew over the ocean, and
  I changed my mind. Whew.'' ``I don't think about all my songs as
  ballads anymore. I feel like they're not even really fully written
  until I've shown them to those guys. And they're like, `This stays a
  ballad,' or `This is a rock song.''' ``It's going to be an important
  song for the record.'' ``And I changed my mind. That's very Tony, too,
  to throw this in there.'' {[}strums guitar{]} ``How about when she
  screams at the end of `I Know.' I'll send you a video of her doing
  it.'' ``I wanted to be able to hit a really raspy Conor Oberst or
  Haley Dahl scream, because I love it in music.'' ``Did you have to
  teach yourself how to scream?'' ``I thought I did. And I asked Conor
  to come to the studio the day that I was screaming. And he was like,
  `What? You just have to scream.''' {[}screaming{]} {[}screaming{]}
  {[}screaming{]} {[}humming{]} ``I just had this idea that I wanted it
  to bounce.'' Singing: ``I got the horses in the back.'' -

  Man, I'm coming through. It's your girl, Lizzo. {[}laughs{]}''
