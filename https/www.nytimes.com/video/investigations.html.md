## Killing Khashoggi: How a Brutal Saudi Hit Job Unfolded

#### An autopsy expert. A lookalike. A black van. Our video investigation follows the movements of the 15-man Saudi hit team that killed and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

</div>

  -   
    There were 15 of them. Most arrived in the dead of night, laid their
    trap and waited for the target to arrive. That target was Jamal
    Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic of his country’s government and
    its young crown prince. Since his killing in Istanbul, Turkish media
    has released a steady drip feed of evidence implicating Saudi
    officials. Weeks of investigation by The Times builds on that
    evidence and reconstructs what unfolded, hour-by-hour. Our timeline
    shows the ruthless efficiency of a hit team of experts that seemed
    specially chosen from Saudi government ministries. Some had links to
    the crown prince himself. After a series of shifting explanations,
    Saudi Arabia now denies that this brazen hit job was premeditated.
    But this reconstruction of the killing, and the botched cover-up,
    calls their story into serious question. It’s Friday morning, Sept.
    28. Khashoggi and his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, are at the local
    marriage office in Istanbul. In order to marry, he’s told that he
    needs Saudi paperwork and goes straight to the consulate to arrange
    it. They tell him to return in a week. It all seems routine, but
    it’s not. Inside there’s a Saudi spy, Ahmed al-Muzaini, who’s
    working under diplomatic cover. That very day, he flies off to
    Riyadh and helps concoct a plan to intercept Khashoggi when he
    returns to the consulate. Fast-forward to Monday night into Tuesday
    morning. Saudi agents converge in Istanbul aboard separate flights.
    Muzaini, the spy, flies back from Riyadh. A commercial flight
    carries a three-man team that we believe flew from Cairo. Two of the
    men are security officers and they’ve previously traveled with the
    crown prince. A private jet flying from Riyadh lands around 3:30
    a.m. That plane is often used by the Saudi government, and it’s
    carrying nine Saudi officials, some who played key roles in
    Khashoggi’s death. We’ll get to Team 3 later on, and for now focus
    on these men from Team 2. This is Salah al-Tubaigy, a high-ranking
    forensics and autopsy expert in the Saudi interior ministry. Turkish
    officials will later say his role was to dismember Khashoggi’s body.
    Another is Mustafa al-Madani, a 57-year-old engineer. As we’ll see,
    it’s no accident that he looks like Khashoggi. And this is Maher
    Mutreb, the leader of the operation. Our investigation into his past
    reveals a direct link between Mutreb and the Saudi crown prince.
    When bin Salman toured a Houston neighborhood earlier this year, we
    discovered that Mutreb was with him, a glowering figure in the
    background. We found him again in Boston, at a U.N. meeting in New
    York, in Madrid and Paris, too. This global tour was all part of a
    charm offensive by the prince to paint himself as a moderate
    reformer. Back then, Mutreb was in the royal guard. Now, he would
    orchestrate Khashoggi’s killing. And his close ties to the crown
    prince beg the question, just how high up the Saudi chain of command
    did the plot to kill go? Early Tuesday morning, Khashoggi flies back
    from a weekend trip to London. He and the Saudis nearly cross paths
    at the airport. The Saudi teams check into two hotels, which give
    quick access to the consulate. Khashoggi heads home with his
    fiancée. He’d just bought an apartment for their new life together.
    By mid-morning, the Saudis are on the move. Mutreb leaves his hotel
    three hours before Khashoggi is due at the consulate. The rest of
    the team isn’t far behind. The building is only a few minutes away
    on foot, and soon, they’re spotted at this entrance. Mutreb arrives
    first. Next, we see al-Tubaigy, the autopsy expert. And now
    al-Madani, the lookalike. The stage is almost set. A diplomatic car
    pulls out of the consulate driveway and switches places with a van,
    which backs in. Turkish officials say this van would eventually
    carry away Khashoggi’s remains. From above, we can see the driveway
    is covered, hiding any activity around the van from public view.
    Meanwhile, Khashoggi and his fiancée set out for the consulate,
    walking hand-in-hand. In their final hour together, they chat about
    dinner plans and new furniture for their home. At 1:13 p.m., they
    arrive at the consulate. Khashoggi gives her his cellphones before
    he enters. He walks into the consulate. It’s the last time we see
    him. Inside, Khashoggi is brought to the consul general’s office on
    the second floor. The hit team is waiting in a nearby room. Sources
    briefed on the evidence, told us Khashoggi quickly comes under
    attack. He’s dragged to another room and is killed within minutes.
    Then al-Tubaigy, the autopsy expert, dismembers his body while
    listening to music. Maher Mutreb makes a phone call to a superior.
    He says, “Tell your boss,” and “The deed was done.” Outside, the van
    reportedly carrying Khashoggi’s body pulls out of the side entrance
    and drives away. At the same time, the Saudis begin trying to cover
    their tracks. While Khashoggi’s fiancée waits here where she left
    him, two figures leave from the opposite side. One of them is
    wearing his clothes. Later, the Saudis would claim that this was
    Khashoggi. But it’s al-Madani, the engineer, now a body double
    pretending that the missing journalist left the consulate alive. Yet
    there’s one glaring flaw: The clothes are the same, but he’s wearing
    his own sneakers, the ones he walked in with. Meanwhile, the van
    that’s allegedly carrying Khashoggi’s body makes the two-minute
    drive from the consulate to the Saudi consul’s residence. There’s
    several minutes of deliberations but the van eventually pulls into
    the building’s driveway. Again, it’s hidden from public view. It’s
    now three hours since Khashoggi was last seen. The body double hails
    this taxi and continues weaving a false trail through the city. He
    heads to a popular tourist area and then changes back into his own
    clothes. Later, we see him joking around in surveillance footage.
    Over at the airport, more Saudi officials arrive on another flight
    from Riyadh. They spend just five hours in Istanbul, but we’re not
    sure where they go. Now we pick up Maher Mutreb again, exiting from
    the consul’s house. It’s time for them to go. Mutreb and others
    check out of their hotel and move through airport security.
    Al-Muzaini, the spy, heads to the airport too. But as they’re
    leaving Istanbul, Khashoggi’s fiancée is still outside the
    consulate, pacing in circles. She’ll soon raise the alarm that
    Khashoggi is missing and she’ll wait for him until midnight. The
    alarm spreads around the world. Nine days later, the Saudis send
    another team to Istanbul. They say it’s to investigate what
    happened. But among them are a toxicologist and a chemist, who also
    has ties to the hit team. He and Tubaigy attended a forensics
    graduation days before Khashoggi was killed. Turkish officials later
    say that this team’s mission was not to investigate, but to cover up
    the killing. Now the Saudi story has changed, and prosecutors are
    seeking the death penalty for several suspects in Khashoggi’s
    killing. But that doesn’t include Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
    who many Western government officials are convinced authorized the
    killing. Khashoggi’s remains still haven’t been
found.
