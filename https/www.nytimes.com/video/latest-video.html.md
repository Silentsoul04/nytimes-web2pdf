## He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.

#### Most historians just study the past. But Allan Lichtman has successfully predicted the future.

</div>

  -   
    This is professor Allan Lichtman. He’s taught history at American
    University for almost 50 years. He’s a former steeplechase champion.
    “It’s a race designed for horses but run by people.”
    “Tic-Tac-Dough.” And a former quiz show winner. “I had a 16-show
    winning streak. Won four cars.” But we’re not here to talk about any
    of that. We’re here because “Allan Lichtman” “Allan Lichtman” “Allan
    Lichtman” is the Nostradamus of presidential elections. He’s
    accurately predicted them for four decades. Yes, even that one.
    “Donald Trump sent me a note. Congrats professor. Good call. In
    his big Sharpie letters.” Now Allan’s ready to tell us who will win
    in 2020. But we’ll come back to that. Allan Lichtman is certain
    we’ve been thinking about elections all wrong. “The pollsters and
    the pundits cover elections as though they were horse races. But
    history tells us voters are not fooled by the tricks of the
    campaign. Voters vote pragmatically according to how well the party
    holding the White House has governed the country.” So polls are
    worthless? “They are snapshots in time. None of this in the end has
    any impact whatsoever on the outcome of a presidential election.” So
    Allan Lichtman designed a better system to predict presidential
    winners. He calls it “The Keys to the White House.” And like some
    other politics these days, there’s a Russian involved. “In 1981, I
    met Vladimir Keilis-Borok. Vladimir turned to me and said, we are
    going to collaborate.” By the way, Vladimir wasn’t a historian or a
    politician. He was a leading expert in predicting earthquakes. “This
    point, I thought the guy was either nuts or KGB.” He wasn’t. “We
    recast American presidential elections as stability, the party
    holding the White House keeps the White House. And earthquake, the
    White House party is turned out of power.” So they got to work. “We
    looked at every presidential election from 1860 to 1980.” What they
    found were 13 keys. Only two of which have anything to do with the
    traits of the candidates. Allan has used the keys to accurately
    predict every election. First in 1984, calling it two years early
    before anyone even knew who Reagan’s contender would be. In 1988,
    calling it in spring when Bush was trailing Dukakis. Again in ‘92,
    ‘96 and in 2000, when he called it for Al Gore? Hey, Allan. “No,
    no, I wasn’t wrong. I correctly predicted that Al Gore would win the
    popular vote. When I first developed the system in ‘81, you had to
    go all the way back to 1888 to find a divergence between the popular
    vote and the Electoral College vote.” So Allan eventually started
    calling the winner, not just the popular vote, which was useful 16
    years later when, well, you know. “I’m a Democrat. And the toughest
    thing in being a forecaster is to keep your own politics out of it.”
    But that’s enough history, professor. Let’s get to it. What do
    Allan’s 13 keys predict for 2020? “And remember, an answer of
    ‘true’ always favors the re-election of the White House party. If
    six or more of the keys are false, you get a political earthquake.”
    OK, No. 1: The White House party gained House seats between midterm
    elections. “Republicans lost the U.S. House midterms in 2018. So
    false.” No. 2: There is no primary contest for the White House
    party. “No Republicans challenged Trump for his renomination. So
    true.” No. 3: The incumbent seeking. The sitting president is
    running for re-election. “Doesn’t look like he’s stepping down, so
    true.” Four: There is no third-party challenger. “Despite claims by
    Kanye West to be running, this is a two-party race.” This is looking
    pretty good for Trump so far. No. 5: The short-term economy is
    strong. “The pandemic has pushed the economy into recession. False.”
    Six: Long-term economic growth during this presidential term has
    been as good as the past two terms. “The pandemic has caused such
    negative G.D.P. growth in 2020 that the key has turned false.” No.
    7: The White House has made major changes to national policy.
    “Through his big tax cut, but mostly through his executive orders,
    Trump has fundamentally changed the policies of the Obama era. So
    true.” No. 8: There is no social unrest during the term. “There has
    been considerable social unrest on the streets, with enough violence
    to threaten the social order. So false.” No. 9: The White House is
    untainted by scandal. “My favorite key. As I predicted, Trump was
    impeached. Plus he has plenty of other scandals. So false.” No. 10:
    The White House has no major foreign or military failures abroad.
    “We’ve had some very difficult moments with Donald Trump. But so
    far, true.” 11: The White House has a major success abroad. “While
    Trump hasn’t had any big splashy failures, he hasn’t had any major
    successes either. So false.” 12: The incumbent-party candidate is
    charismatic. “Donald Trump is a great showman. But he only appeals
    to a narrow slice of the American people. And as a result, false.”
    13: The challenger is uncharismatic. “Biden is a decent empathetic
    person, but he’s not inspirational or charismatic. So true.” That
    means — “The keys predict that Trump will lose the White House.”
    That’s Allan Lichtman’s prediction. And Allan Lichtman is always
    right. “Don’t just take my word for it. There are forces at play
    outside the keys — voter suppression, Russian meddling. It’s up to
    you the voters to decide the future of our democracy. So get out and
    vote. Vote in person. Vote by mail. As Abraham Lincoln said, the
    best way to predict the future is to choose it.” \[MUSIC
