  On the outskirts of Mexico City, an 84-year-old man struggles to
  breathe. Paramedics hoist him into a capsule for safe transport. This
  neighborhood is a hotspot for coronavirus. At the hospital, the
  patient's wife is forced to wait outside. Just the day before, she
  says she lost a son to Covid-19. Like most Covid deaths, his body was
  supposed to go straight to a crematorium. Only, there's a wait.
  Crematoriums are backed up, sometimes for days. The government has
  consistently underestimated the death toll here. But handlers of the
  dead offer evidence that the region is becoming an epicenter for the
  pandemic. And it's getting worse. This is Nezahualcóyotl, one of
  Mexico City's most densely populated suburbs. During the months of
  lockdown, many people here couldn't afford to stay home and not work,
  or just didn't want to. And the virus is hitting hard. The wait for
  cremation is so long some families rent temporary interments, like
  these. Funeral services barely keep up with demand. Uriel Bizuet
  maintains death records of all his clients. These death records can
  tell us a lot about the virus's spread, and suggest Covid-19 has been
  more deadly than the government admits. For instance, this death on
  March 5 by acute lung failure, a hallmark symptom of coronavirus,
  occurred 13 days before Mexico announced the country's first Covid
  death. Bizuet wonders if the epidemic arrived earlier than the
  government said. In March, the cause of death could have been
  influenza --- without a test, it's impossible to know. To date, there
  are more than 11,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Mexico. But the
  true toll is likely much higher. Mario Romero Zavala is a data analyst
  and software engineer in Mexico City. He recently analyzed death
  certificates for the city, and found the excess mortality --- that is
  the number of deaths above the historical average --- showed 8,000
  additional deaths in April and May. ``Given our study, we can't say
  that all the excess mortality is directly attributed to Covid. But
  there's a huge difference --- we're seeing like a four times
  difference between what's the official data for confirmed Covid cases
  of deceased persons in Mexico City versus the excess mortality in
  Mexico City. The people are given the message that somehow we're past
  the epidemic, and this is not true. This is absolutely not true, and
  it's a very concerning message to be given out.'' Publicly, health
  authorities keep saying, `We've made it through the worst.' This was
  Mexico's deputy health minister a month ago. Now medical experts
  believe that the worst may be just beginning. Health analysts at the
  University of Washington project the epidemic could kill as many as
  45,000 people in Mexico by the end of summer. This week Mexico's
  president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, began easing restrictions to
  get the country back to work. Amid these mixed messages, conspiracy
  theories have caught fire. Doctors told Miguel Angel Gil his father
  died of Covid-19, but he refuses to believe it. There's no evidence to
  support such rumors, and they complicate efforts to fight the
  epidemic. Gil says he slipped money to a funeral worker for a
  visitation with his father's body. Government protocols for handling
  Covid cases prohibit that kind of contact, and advise that all corpses
  be immediately cremated. But many families find ways around them as
  they aren't enforceable. Juana Parada Flores, an indigenous Mazahua,
  says she's following the rules, and hires a funeral service to
  transport her father's body from the morgue to a crematorium, or so
  she claims. Ms. Parada asks us not to follow her. But I learned later
  that she did not cremate the body after all. Like the family who paid
  extra for a funeral, she instead drove her father's coffin two hours
  outside the city and held a traditional burial service for the
  community. A Reuters videographer captured dozens of people attending.
  This is the sort of potential super-spreader event that health
  authorities want to avoid. As Mexico reopens, the president's message
  is that even if danger still exists, the worst has passed. But the
  effect may be the opposite: that the worst is yet to come.
