## Meet the KGB Spies Who Invented Fake News

#### We reveal how one of the biggest fake news stories ever concocted — the 1984 AIDS-is-a-biological-weapon hoax — went viral in the pre-Internet era. Meet the KGB cons who invented it, and the “truth squad” that quashed it. For a bit.

</div>

  -   
    \[music\] This is a story about a guy and a term he likes to think
    he invented. “Really, the word — I think one of the greatest of all
    terms I’ve come up with is ‘fake.’ I guess other people use it,
    perhaps, over the years. But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been
    around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are.
    Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just
    that, once, it went by a very different name. \[ding\] \[non-English
    speech\] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus
    created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically
    destroy its enemies — \[water sloshing\] — from the inside. But it’s
    not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances
    are, you’ve already been infected. \[music\] If you don’t know who
    to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel
    that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And
    if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we
    really need to talk. Ready? \[music\] O.K., so to start, let’s go
    back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This
    is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The
    Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S.
    government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay
    people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where
    the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy
    allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But
    fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The
    story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even
    published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS
    is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months
    at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. \[drums
    beating\] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that
    causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting
    experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake
    news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But
    don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever
    carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it
    was pulled off. \[music\] But first, let me introduce you to a few
    authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found
    interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman.
    This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all
    worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S.
    And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s
    most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and
    manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a
    slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active
    measures, \[speaking Russian\] in the language of the KGB.” So
    “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not
    just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you
    could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the
    perception of reality of every American to such an extent that,
    despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to
    sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their
    families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a
    department that specializes in planting false stories and forged
    documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of
    the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000
    people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union,
    are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You
    heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff
    at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors
    who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked
    down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name
    was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87
    years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin.
    And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a
    girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello\!” “Hello, hello. I am still
    busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most
    legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it
    comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was
    an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to
    catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even
    planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake.
    “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German
    sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of
    bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means
    deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the
    communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.”
    \[dinging\] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here
    quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at
    the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically
    any kind of covert operations against another country short of
    starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But
    disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might
    be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not.
    Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation
    is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it.
    Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a
    loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless.
    Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, \[dinging\] let’s get
    back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB
    agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with
    ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents
    had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many
    proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve
    gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence,
    didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good
    were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the
    story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II,
    and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America
    to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear
    around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con
    yet. \[clicking\] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re
    going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story
    started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly
    mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to
    be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and
    dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s
    time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a
    U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in
    the ’80s. \[ding\] “This is just the perfect example of a very
    effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are
    some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like
    Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu.
    “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably
    was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the
    Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as
    an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was
    a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we
    found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a
    third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India,
    Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed.
    “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching
    about the origin.” \[music\] The KGB let this story go quiet for a
    couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary
    headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow
    newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. \[ding\]
    It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed
    their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So
    we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie.
    So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could
    back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they
    found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two
    authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli.
    Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have
    evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific
    gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand
    it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB
    made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa.
    And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. \[ding\]
    It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily
    Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the
    KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication \[echoing\]
    claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB
    code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I
    would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that
    the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is
    complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime
    ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that
    they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I
    knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it
    angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me
    up. I was pissed.” \[music\] Operation Infection, one of the most
    audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for
    America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually
    believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent.
    For them to think that damages their view of the United States not
    only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the
    back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now
    with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response
    to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of
    disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.”
    Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active
    Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that
    tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was
    working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We
    all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could
    volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face
    of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had
    some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see
    that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I
    see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or
    the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could,
    responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie
    at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day.
    I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But
    repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article
    corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation
    Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the
    hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State
    George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re
    spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing
    it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And
    there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the
    unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald
    Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we
    in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having
    read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t
    deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was
    the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And
    then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed.
    Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon
    in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the
    Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for
    Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable
    Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has
    manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many
    large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function,
    for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet
    sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time
    creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency
    during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who
    enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater
    things.
