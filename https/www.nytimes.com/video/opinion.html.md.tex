  {[}music{]} This is a story about a guy and a term he likes to think
  he invented. ``Really, the word --- I think one of the greatest of all
  terms I've come up with is `fake.' I guess other people use it,
  perhaps, over the years. But I've never noticed it.'' It's only been
  around for a few years. But you're probably as sick of it as we are.
  Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It's just that,
  once, it went by a very different name. {[}ding{]} {[}non-English
  speech{]} Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created
  decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its
  enemies --- {[}water sloshing{]} --- from the inside. But it's not a
  biological virus. It's more like a political one. And chances are,
  you've already been infected. {[}music{]} If you don't know who to
  trust anymore, this might be the thing that's making you feel that
  way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if
  you're sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really
  need to talk. Ready? {[}music{]} O.K., so to start, let's go back to
  July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a
  remarkable story appears in a newspaper called ``The Patriot.'' It
  claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government
  scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It
  even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was
  supposed to have been concocted. It's a crazy allegation printed in a
  small newspaper --- no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple
  of years, and look what's happening. The story is spreading all over
  Africa. The scientific report's even published by two East German
  biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these
  articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then,
  somehow, it ends up here. {[}drums beating{]} ``A Soviet military
  publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army
  laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.'' That's Dan
  Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on
  national TV. But don't be too hard on Dan. This was one of the
  greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we're going to
  show you how it was pulled off. {[}music{]} But first, let me
  introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old
  videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy,
  Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri
  Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before
  defecting to the U.S. And it's thanks to them that we know so much
  about one of the KGB's most secretive departments. ``Only about 15\%
  of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other
  85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological
  subversion or active measures, {[}speaking Russian{]} in the language
  of the KGB.'' So ``active measures,'' it's a euphemism for, well,
  bullshit --- but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful,
  toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. ``To
  change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent
  that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to
  come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves,
  their families, their community, and their country.'' ``Within the KGB
  is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged
  documents.'' We know it was run from Department A right at the top of
  the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. ``At least 15,000
  people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are
  involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.'' You
  heard that right --- 15,000 people. That's more than the entire staff
  at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who
  are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down
  one to a small town in Massachusetts. ``Well, my original name was
  Ladislav Bittman.'' These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He's 87 years
  old. ``It's a collage --- `` He likes to paint. `` --- with Putin. And
  he was boasting about his riches.'' And of course, he has a girlfriend
  down in Florida. ``Hello!'' ``Hello, hello. I am still busy.'' But
  back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active
  measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit,
  Larry's done it all. His first ever con --- ``It was an operation to
  establish a whorehouse in Germany.'' That was to catch politicians in
  compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of
  Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. ``Now original Nazi documents.''
  That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry's expertise, though,
  was a special kind of bullshit, something called --- ``Disinformation.
  Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is
  secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and
  manipulate.'' {[}dinging{]} All right. Just to avoid any confusion,
  let's pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of
  bullshit. Now at the top, you've got your active measures, right?
  These are basically any kind of covert operations against another
  country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even
  kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the
  KGB. You might be thinking, that's just a fancy word for propaganda.
  But it's not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something.
  Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into
  believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that's become
  such a loaded term --- no thanks to this guy --- that it's basically
  useless. Anyway, we'll get on to him later. All right, {[}dinging{]}
  let's get back to it. Disinformation --- it was such a big deal that
  every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming
  up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review --- yes, KGB
  agents had year-end reviews, too --- every agent was evaluated on ---
  ``How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.''
  ``You've gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech
  intelligence, didn't you?'' ``Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.''
  Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot
  J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John
  Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin
  America to harvest their organs --- but as the first cases of AIDS
  spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their
  biggest con yet. {[}clicking{]} All right, so let's go back to 1983.
  And we're going to show you what really happened here. So remember
  this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? ```AIDS,
  the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is
  believed to be the result of the Pentagon's experiments to develop new
  and dangerous biological weapons.' There's the crux of the crap.''
  It's time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part
  of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back
  in the '80s. {[}ding{]} ``This is just the perfect example of a very
  effective disinformation campaign.'' Well, almost perfect. There are
  some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like
  Kathleen. Like, in English we'd say flu virus, not the virus flu. ``So
  it's written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was
  written by a Russian-language speaker.'' ``They said, oh, the Indian
  newspaper, The Patriot --- which we knew the KGB used this as an
  English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.'' This was a
  classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found.
  He told us, they'd always try and place the story --- `` --- in a
  third-world country --- '' --- somewhere like --- `` --- say, in
  India, Thailand --- '' --- where journalists could be easily tricked
  or bribed. ``So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was
  searching about the origin.'' {[}music{]} The KGB let this story go
  quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making
  scary headlines in '85, they revived it, this time in a prominent
  Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it.
  {[}ding{]} It's brilliant, really. They've repeated the story but
  concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started.
  So we're now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie.
  So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could
  back up the lie with data. And no joke --- this is the dude they
  found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two
  authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It's his wife, Lilli.
  Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have
  evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. ``This scientific
  gobbledygook --- and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand
  it? But it purports to be proof.'' The thing is, it worked. The KGB
  made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa.
  And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. {[}ding{]}
  It's appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express
  in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits
  the jackpot. ``A Soviet military publication {[}echoing{]} claims the
  virus that causes AIDS leaked.'' This campaign had a KGB code name.
  They called it, Operation Infection. ``Good afternoon. I would like to
  begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image
  abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by
  disinformation. Wow. Huh. That's a half a lifetime ago. This was
  handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the
  United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective
  that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply.
  And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.''
  {[}music{]} Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and
  successful fake news stories ever created --- and for America, the
  impact was toxic. ``Foreign governments actually believed that the
  U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think
  that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture,
  but it taints all of our policies. It's in the back of their minds
  every time they discuss anything with us.'' Now with so much at stake,
  you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well,
  you're watching it. ``The primary origin of disinformation about the
  United States abroad is the Soviet Union.'' Kathleen and Todd were
  both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group.
  Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose
  Soviet disinformation. ``Everybody was working part time on the
  issue.'' ``It was not funded lavishly.'' ``We all sat around a table
  once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to
  come in did.'' Yup, that's right. In the face of thousands of KGB
  agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time
  workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. ``I see that it wasn't
  very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it
  did have an impact.'' They didn't have the budget or the time. But
  they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to
  the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. ``So
  they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were
  kept busy just knocking these things down.'' But repeated exposure
  didn't just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen's report
  exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the
  top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
  himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby
  read it. ``And you're spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the
  United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good,
  heated exchange. And there's nothing wrong with that.'' And days
  later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized
  to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake
  AIDS story. ``When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about
  Gorbachev having read the reports --- that's cool. That is really
  cool. He couldn't deny what we put in the report. And he didn't deny
  it.'' ``Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from
  succeeding.'' ``And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist
  regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue
  using this weapon in future.'' ``Our government's view was, problem
  solved.'' As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final
  report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. ``The
  formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which
  has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many
  large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for
  the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.''
  Don't forget. KGB agents spent 25\% of their time creating
  disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold
  War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the
  KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. {[}music{]}
