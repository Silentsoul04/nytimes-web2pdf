  {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]} One of the most touching artworks, to me, is a
  self-portrait by Rembrandt. It was painted around 1628. Rembrandt
  painted many--- maybe hundreds, even--- of self-portraits. He looked
  at himself without interpretation. It's a picture of a smartass. I
  first saw it at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In fact, that's the only
  place I ever saw it. I saw it first in the early `70s on a trip to
  Amsterdam. Later on, I lived in Amsterdam. And I visited the painting
  at least once a week, sometimes more. On the way home from grocery
  shopping, I would go to the museum and look at that painting. I lived
  across the canal from Rembrandt's house, so I could see the light that
  he saw, especially in the winter, when the streetlights were imitating
  candlelit streets. If you think of the light in his paintings
  particularly of all the paintings from the Golden Age, his paintings
  particularly had that Amsterdam light. It always seemed to me he was
  painting in the dark, or the half-dark. If you look at the light in
  that portrait, he doesn't really paint the face too much. He paints
  the nose and eyes and mouth. It, in itself, is very abstract. It's
  very hard to paint a self-portrait without being sentimental. I did a
  book called Who? And I did self-portraits after many artists, but more
  after Rembrandt than the others. I used the composition and the light
  that he had. I tried to draw like Rembrandt, though that was not
  actually possible, but I tried. {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]}
