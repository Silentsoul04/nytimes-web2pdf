## Why Trump’s Tulsa Rally Put the City’s Black Residents on Edge

#### President Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Okla., the site of one of the country’s worst episodes of racial violence in 1921, angered the city’s black residents. In this news analysis, we explain what this moment could mean for Mr. Trump’s re-election bid.

</div>

  -   
    This weekend in Tulsa, the president held his first campaign rally
    since March, after the coronavirus pandemic suspended the campaign
    trail. “So we begin, Oklahoma we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma\!” It
    was also the weekend of Juneteenth. For many black Americans,
    Juneteenth is a celebration of the end of slavery in this country.
    This was a moment that resulted in scenes like this. “You are a
    sellout\!” ”Black people die \[inaudible\]” \[shouting\] The timing
    of the president’s rally, on the weekend of Juneteenth, also comes
    at a time where there have been weeks of nationwide protests against
    racism and police brutality. “Hands up\! Don’t shoot\!” It is
    particularly poignant in the South, and in Tulsa, because of the
    history of racial oppression here. Rather than a president that
    showed deference to the racial history of this city or to try to
    further the efforts of racial reconciliation, we saw him upend them.
    “About the first grade, we came to Tulsa. We moved to Tulsa. So, I
    kind of grew up on Greenwood. When I entered college and took black
    history, and my professor, he said, ‘Do you all know about the race
    massacre?’ And we were all like, ‘No. We had a riot here?’ You know.
    And he was just like, ‘OK, so everybody sit down and listen to this
    story.’” In the early 1900s, the Greenwood area of Tulsa was a
    thriving black neighborhood. “African-Americans, two generations out
    of slavery, pursued and exhibited black excellence.” “We had our own
    banks and hospitals and theaters and restaurants.” But that success
    didn’t sit well with the white community. And in 1921, after a black
    man was accused of disrespecting a white woman, things escalated. A
    white mob burned and looted Black Wall Street. “The violence lasted
    roughly 16 hours.” “They shot. They looted. They bombed.” “They
    threw bodies in the river. They threw them in mass graves.” “When
    the dust settled, some 100 to 300 people were killed. At least 1,250
    homes were destroyed in the black community. Schools, churches and
    business were destroyed as well.” “Total devastation, like a war
    zone. What happened here was a momentous tragic event.” “That was
    the worst horrific story that I ever heard in my life.” “This
    church, we were building in 1921, our sanctuary — they destroyed
    that. And our basement miraculously survived. The damage on this
    pillar comes from when concrete burned. In this room, also we have
    soil collections from the different sites where people were killed.”
    After years of ignoring the massacre, many in Tulsa want to make it
    front and center of the community’s conversation. They set up this
    bipartisan commission to do a number of initiatives to bring forward
    the issue of racial reconciliation and commemorate the centennial
    anniversary of the massacre. And some institutions have apologized.
    “I’m sorry that the police department did not protect its citizens
    during the tragic days of 1921.” The hard part has been what to do
    next. “We demand reparations in honor of all those Americans that
    were killed\! We demand reparations now\!” “Saying ‘I’m sorry’ is
    not repentance. You know, saying ‘I’m sorry’ just recognizes what
    you did is wrong. Repentance is turning away from what you did that
    makes you sorry. Before you can even get to atonement, we have to
    have a society that admits that white supremacy is wrong. We’ve got
    to have a society that admits that black lives matter.” The
    president has tried to present himself as a unifying figure, as
    someone who can bring the country together, particularly in times of
    these dual crises: the coronavirus pandemic and the national unrest
    around race and racial inequality. But this weekend shows his
    challenges on that front and the inability of this administration
    to, frankly, get out of its own way. Juneteenth is, for many black
    Americans, a celebration of the emancipation of slavery. The
    president initially announced a rally on Juneteenth. When you talk
    to people, they say there was a moment of disbelief that the
    president was coming to Tulsa. “My first reaction was, ‘How
    disrespectful.’ I felt like it was a slap in the face.” And after
    pleas, even from Republican senators in the state, he moved the
    rally to the next day.” “Beep beep. Beep beep. It’s important to me
    because it’s history, it’s freedom. Girl, you’re looking good. It’s
    good to see you, long time. It’s education.” “You want to make
    America great again? You have to make Black Wall Street great
    again.” “And it’s important this year because people get to see
    that, hey, they’re still fighting for a cause, but they’re
    celebrating our freedom.” “To come on the weekend of Juneteenth
    shows that he has still not that much respect for our sacred day.”
    Ultimately, the president’s rally wasn’t as big as his campaign had
    hoped. But the significance of this weekend is seen in scenes like
    this. “I see you back there shaking your head. Yes, sir, black lives
    matter.” And one of the takeaways around this moment, around race in
    this country, has been the shifting public opinion about questions
    of systemic racism and persistent inequality. “No justice\!” “No
    peace\!” “No justice\!” “No peace\!” That lack of acknowledgement
    puts him at odds with even some members of his own party. The
    president’s strategy on race and on other issues has just narrowed
    his path to re-election. He has not shown a willingness to try to
    expand his base, leaving him fairly reliant on a similar group of
    voters that got him elected in 2016 to do so again in
2020.
