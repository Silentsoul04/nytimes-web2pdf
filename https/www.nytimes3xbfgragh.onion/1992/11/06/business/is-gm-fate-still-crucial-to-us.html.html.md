"What is good for the country is good for General Motors, and what's
good for General Motors is good for the country," Charles E. Wilson, the
G.M. president who was to become President Eisenhower's Secretary of
Defense, is said to have told the Senate Armed Forces Committee. The
pronouncement by Engine Charlie Wilson instantly became a symbol of
corporate arrogance for a nation that simultaneously loathed and
worshiped big business, for there was rough truth in his words.

America was the world's largest consumer of cars, and G.M. was the
world's largest producer, a mighty engine of prosperity for G.M.
stockholders and the families and communities of workers.

Four decades later, with G.M. hemorrhaging jobs and cash, its love-hate
affair with America may be ending. Although almost everyone wishes its
new managers well, few economists think there is cause for great alarm
if they fail to restore the company's profitability or market share.
Moving On

"A unique strength of this economy is its capacity to acknowledge
failure and move on," said Alfred E. Kahn, a specialist in industrial
organization at Cornell University.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, added,
"Even in bankruptcy, G.M. would not disappear." One way or another, its
productive plants and accumulated expertise in engineering and marketing
would be recycled.

But isn't the decline of the corporation that symbolized America's
postwar industrial dominance a prospect that should be viewed with
exceptional anxiety? After all, at the end of 1991 some 370,000 people
were on G.M.'s $12 billion North American payroll, while the livelihoods
of hundreds of thousands more were indirectly linked to the company.
More pointedly, if G.M. reaches the brink, should Uncle Sugar step in to
save it, as it saved Chrysler in 1980?

F. M. Scherer, an economist at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, cautiously offers a rationale for treating G.M. as a special
case. While the company's jobs are widely distributed across the
continent, he notes that big cutbacks would still be "a very severe blow
to the already badly damaged city of Detroit." Moreover, the timing of
the job implosion, in the midst of a long recession, could hardly be
worse. Mr. Scherer also expects some jobs lost at G.M. to go overseas.
And he worries that a failure by the company in the car business may
mean a permanent loss of the sorts of highly skilled, highly paid jobs
that Americans need to remain prosperous. But many other economists are
unpersuaded. Mr. Stelzer says the focus on the fortunes of the corporate
entity misses the mark. G.M. is certain to shed payrolls and plants, he
notes, whether or not the new managers succeed. And presumably, some of
those losses would be gains for workers at other American companies
making more popular models.

Paradoxically, an unsuccessful salvage effort -- one in which G.M. fails
to cut its payroll and capacity fast enough, and slowly bleeds its way
into bankruptcy -- might be least traumatic for most of the workers and
communities. They would, at least, have longer to make the transition.

Since there is excess production capacity in the American car industry
-- and, for that matter, in the world's car industry -- the number of
employees in the business is almost sure to continue to slip. But many
analysts think the location of the highly-paid white collar jobs, the
jobs that Mr. Scherer worries about most, is no longer tightly linked to
the location of manufacturing operations.

What apparently counts most in the good jobs equation is the quality of
education and other amenities -- safe streets, clean air, good
transportation -- that attract what Robert B. Reich of Harvard calls
"knowledge workers." Seen in this light, it should be no surprise that
Toyota and Mazda are designing cars in the United States for production
worldwide.

Of course, many of the good jobs at risk at G.M. and in the rest of the
auto industry are semiskilled, where high pay is a matter of inertia and
strong unions -- much as it is in the steel, rubber and heavy machinery
industries. Last year, G.M. spent $34.60 an hour for labor, including
benefits, roughly twice the average total compensation for the economy
as a whole. But Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution argues that
high pay in autos and steel has always been a mixed blessing, since it
translates into higher prices for consumers. Indeed, Mr. Crandall
contends that the high pay-high price trade-off has been a rotten deal
for the economy. He estimates that the effort in the 1980's to protect
blue-collar jobs with import quotas cost car buyers tens of billions of
dollars, with much of the money lining the pockets of foreign
manufacturers who imported higher-priced, more profitable models.

A common theme running through much of the nascent debate about the
public's stake in G.M.'s future is the tension between allowing
competitive markets to discipline business, and sparing the innocent the
consequences of corporate incompetence. Many economists, including many
conservatives, would gladly strengthen the safety net for the
underskilled and unemployed.

By the same token, most economists are deeply skeptical about the
impulse to reverse the sometimes-harsh judgment of free markets, even
when the potential victims are icons of America's industrial might.

The economist Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize winner, concluded, "If you
get into the game of too-big-to-fail, you get into real trouble."
