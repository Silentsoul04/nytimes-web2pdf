What do New Yorkers want in their restaurants? The proprietors of Gotham
Bar and Grill have spent 11 years studying the question and they seem to
have the answer down pat.

To begin, there's the look of the restaurant, a vast comfortable space
with a lively bar along one side. The high-ceilinged room stretches out,
as open as a large theater. And yet, through some trick of design, each
table offers intimacy: seated, you have the sense of watching without
being watched.

Then there is the unthreatening ambiance that invites people to come as
they are. You could walk in wearing blue jeans or a tuxedo and feel
entirely comfortable. Starched men in suits mingle with rumpled guys in
blue jeans and nobody looks out of place. It is a very appealing
quality.

The service is a big part of this equation. The people who work at
Gotham Bar and Grill have figured out how to make Americans feel at ease
in the presence of fancy food. This is harder than it sounds; there are
no rules and different people have different expectations. At Gotham,
the waiters take their cues from the customer, tuning in to almost
imperceptible vibrations. Give the waiter the slightest hint that you
are interested and he will describe the food in loving detail. Indicate
that you are not and your order will be taken without a word. The
waiters are similarly sensitive to your wishes about wine; they know the
list but don't press their information. I've had fast meals when I was
in a hurry, slow ones when I was not. The result is that each meal has
left me feeling remarkably well cared for.

Finally, there's the food. The chef, Alfred Portale, became famous for
his vertical dishes. The presentation is stunning, but to focus on that
is to miss the point. Mr. Portale is working with an architecture of
flavor, composing his dishes so that each element contributes something
vital. The vegetables are not an afterthought but an integral part of
each offering. His food may seem modern but it is almost classic in its
balance.

Mr. Portale's signature dish is his seafood salad, a spiral of scallops,
squid, octopus, lobster and avocado that swirls onto the plate like a
mini-tornado. Dressed only in lemon and olive oil, it depends on the
flavors of the seafood itself; the textures are underlined by the smooth
avocado, crisp leaves of lettuce and crunchy bits of flying-fish roe.
His octopus salad has a similar look, but the swirl is composed of
chickpeas, new potatoes, charred tomatoes and leeks, so the intensity of
the textures and flavors is heightened.

Mr. Portale makes a fine foie gras and guinea hen terrine, the flavors
piqued by a green lentil salad. His tuna tartar is lively with lime,
scallions and ginger. He clearly has fun with the pastas, which change
daily. One day it was a perfect bowl of linguine with clams in a great
white wine sauce dotted with diced tomatoes. Another night the pasta was
wide, buttery ribbons painted with bright green parsley sauce and coiled
into a tower in the center of the plate. On top was a dollop of caviar,
on the side two large sea scallops. Knocking it down and mixing it up
made me feel like a child playing with my food.

Mr. Portale also does interesting things with less popular fish, pairing
skate with eggplant and white beans in a mint and olive oil dressing.
Mackerel comes with potatoes no larger than marbles, more eggplant and
just enough rosemary to cut through the richness of the fish.

The prettiest appetizer is veal carpaccio, translucent circles of meat
with thin red lines running through them like paint. These turn out to
be slivers of bresaola (air-dried beef). Bits of basil are scattered
across the top like confetti, joining leaves of baby arugula and fat
curls of Parmesan cheese. It tastes as good as it looks.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The main courses are more straightforward than the appetizers, each dish
composed around a central element. Rosy slices of duck breast are set
off by a single caramelized endive, peeled back like a flower in the
center of the plate. The bitterness of the vegetable plays against a
sweet potato puree, each vegetable bringing forth a different quality of
the duck.

Squab is topped with foie gras, which brings out the peculiarly livery
taste of the bird. Meanwhile the vegetables on the plate -- sweet corn,
polenta and cranberry beans -- all emphasize the tender richness of the
squab. Pheasant is normally a dull bird, but Mr. Portale plunks it onto
a fabulous pile of sauerkraut, alive with the taste of juniper berries,
a puree of potatoes and a single poached crab apple. In this company, an
old shoe would taste terrific.

Wonderful rack of lamb comes with chard and garlic mashed potatoes. The
steak, however, is served without potatoes; there are deep fried
shallots on the side and a silky little custard whose delicacy brings
out the hearty quality of the meat.

Each fish is also paired with something to bring out its most important
qualities. Tuna, so red it is almost blue, comes with a swirl of
pappardelle and a mush of eggplant. Sturdy salmon is served with
mushrooms, peas and potatoes. Halibut, whether steamed or sauteed, is
served with lots of vegetables, emphasizing the clean delicacy of the
fish.

Desserts are intense and very American, from a vertical banana split
with caramel, macadamia nuts and hot fudge to a warm apple tart with
vanilla ice cream and a cranberry compote. There are a fine creme brulee
served with a poached pear compote and a warm chocoalte cake of great
complexity. There is also a fabulous chocolate bread pudding served with
vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce that tastes like what My-T-Fine
wishes it could be when it grows up.

"Everything was wonderful," a man murmured one night as he was leaving.
"But it wasn't very romantic." He has a point. With its bright lights
and loud music, Gotham has everything but romance. I suspect the owners
are onto something there, too; after all, romantic meals are rare
special events but Gotham is good for every ordinary occasion.
