DID you hear the one about the rutabaga? No, probably not. Vegetables
don’t tend to inspire great jokes. On the contrary, they conjure their
very own brand of humorlessness, the tight-lipped officiousness of grim
nutritionists that is captured in the phrase “Eat your vegetables.”

Since opening Dirt Candy in the East Village almost four years ago, the
chef [Amanda
Cohen](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/08/16/q-a-amanda-cohen-of-dirt-candy/)
has been waging war on the “eat your vegetables” mind-set, using humor
as one of her weapons. Here she is on her restaurant’s Web site on the
subject of cabbage: “It’s the wino of the vegetable world: smelly,
unloved and looking at it makes you feel sad. A cabbage salad sounds
even worse. Cabbage that’s ... raw? It sounds like a plated suicide
note.”

Humor is so integral to Ms. Cohen’s work that she may be the only chef
in America who could publish her first
[cookbook](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1u7GfLGNG3s)
in comic-book form and make the decision seem not just sensible but
inevitable. Drawn by Ryan Dunlavey with facial expressions that range
from mild exasperation to howling rage, Ms. Cohen’s cartoon character
delivers bitingly funny monologues about appearing on “Iron Chef” and
rolling out pasta dough. Along the way, she and her staff beat the
daylights out of a wizard and a fairy who are idiotic enough to suggest
that pickles are made by magic.

But Ms. Cohen’s chief weapon in the battle against vegetable scolds is
the food she serves at Dirt Candy, a vegetarian restaurant that is
thrillingly free of high-minded ideals. Ms. Cohen isn’t necessarily out
to save a small planet or prevent heart disease. Her goals are possibly
more subversive, and she achieves them with vegetable cookery that is
original, clever, visually arresting and, above all, a lot of fun to
eat.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Take the dish called
[Cauliflower\!](http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/?p=2950) The punctuation is
the restaurant’s, but I’ll go along with the emotion. Ms. Cohen gives
cauliflower florets a long bath in maple smoke, dips them in cornflakes,
fries them to a golden crisp and serves them on waffles. She’s making a
visual pun on the chicken-leg shape of the florets and stems. But these
smoky and crunchy nuggets also invite you to see vegetables as an
indulgence, a pleasure that is not quite guilty but not entirely
innocent, either.

Eating at Dirt Candy can be like going to a child’s birthday party in a
country where all the children love vegetables. [Eggplant
tiramisù](http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/?p=4268), with layers of rosemary
lady fingers sandwiching a sweet mascarpone whipped with grilled
eggplant, sounds like a dare: daring you to try it, daring you to like
it. While you consider your options, a server brings the final element
of the dish, a white frizz of cotton candy with a startlingly pure and
piney taste of rosemary. It lifts up the eggplant, the dessert and the
party.

One way of cooking vegetables is to go deep, to concentrate flavors
until you have the world’s most carroty carrot, and leave it at that.
Ms. Cohen builds layers of flavor from the outside in. During the fall,
she constructs a [savory tart](http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/?p=4914)
using tomatoes in every way imaginable, to intensify the effect. There
are dried tomatoes in a pink, biscuit-like crust; there are peeled and
marinated cherry tomatoes on top of that crust, with a creamy layer of
smoked feta; there is a ribbon of sweet and chewy tomato leather around
the tart; finally, off to the side, there is a salad of fresh and
dehydrated cherry tomatoes. The whole was more than the sum of its
parts, but all the parts were good to begin with.

The same isn’t true yet of a new dish (Onions\!) built around small
Chinese-derived cakes of smoked scallions and chives. One night they
were overwhelmingly smoky; on another night the smoke was more reticent
but the cakes themselves tasted flat. Both nights, a salad of grilled
scallions, red onions and herbs could have used a livelier, more
decisive dressing. But it’s very difficult to criticize a dish that
includes the world’s tiniest onion rings, each just big enough to fit on
the tip of a chopstick.

These elaborate plates, each of which holds about a half-dozen
components and can be made in vegan form upon request, emerge from a
visibly cramped kitchen. This may seem like a marvel, but it pales next
to the logistical feat Ms. Cohen and her staff pulled off early this
month. Like hundreds of restaurants downtown, Dirt Candy lost power for
four days after Hurricane Sandy. Every perishable, including stocks,
jams and pickles, had to be tossed onto the sidewalk in trash bags.
Almost all of it was replenished in just two days, which meant
scheduling times and temperatures for the single oven down to the
minute. It must have been like re-enacting the invasion of Normandy in a
kiddie pool.

It also involved the same kind of spatial planning that allows Dirt
Candy to fit 18 seats into a spare, modernist dining room where even one
more might be too much. Wineglasses are stored on a sea-green glass
ledge above the tables, and customers waiting for a table are stored
outside on Ninth Street.

Vegetarian cooks in the United States have not always found much
nourishment in American cuisine. Some looked to health food and
ideology, while others have looked abroad.

Ms. Cohen dabbles in overseas influences.
[Cabbage](http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/?p=4607)\!, a lonesome hobo no
more, is reimagined as the star of a marvelous Asian noodle salad, with
kohlrabi threads standing in for noodles, fried walnuts carrying a spicy
blast of Sichuan peppercorn, and purple fried won tons getting their
color and flavor from juiced cabbage. A new item on the menu, Beans\!,
surrounds haricots verts and crisp tofu with a deeply intriguing sauce
in which saffron, ginger, cilantro, coriander seed, cumin and Urfa biber
pepper offer echoes of Morocco.

But there is no mistaking a Dirt Candy dish for one that you would find
in another country. Ms. Cohen is not adapting the vegetarian cuisine of
some other culture. She is inventing her own.
