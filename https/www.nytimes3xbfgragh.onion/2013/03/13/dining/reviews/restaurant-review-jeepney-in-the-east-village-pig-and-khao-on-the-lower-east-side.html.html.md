The cry goes up around the restaurant.

“Ba-luuuut\!”

The word volleys from Jeepney’s kitchen to its dining room as a server
carries the hard-boiled duck egg to a man at the
bar.

[“Ba-luuuuuuuuuuut\!”](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/2013/03/11/multimedia/100000002110714/filipino-egg.html#media/vid1)

Grabbing the customer’s hand, she whacks the flesh between his thumb and
forefinger with a tablespoon to demonstrate the force needed to crack
the balut’s shell. Then she prepares him for what he’ll find inside.

Right on top, she says, is “a really smoky chicken broth.” Under that is
the white, hard-boiled, and the yolk. “And down at the bottom, there’s
E.T.”

The extraterrestrial is a two- or three-week-old duckling that will
never hatch, a ball of spindly legs and tucked wings and fine threads of
feathers. The unabashed embrace of a delicacy with major freakout
potential is typical of the deep-end approach of
[Jeepney](http://www.jeepneynyc.com/), a self-described “Filipino gastro
pub” in the East Village.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another approach is on display about a mile south at [Pig and
Khao](http://pigandkhao.com/), which has a strong Filipino imprint, too.
The two places have many things in common. Open since last fall, they
are small, casual, fun and often loud — Jeepney with American and
Filipino party rock, Pig and Khao with slow-rolling Southern hip-hop.
Neither stocks hard liquor, but each still manages to shake up very
entertaining cocktails. Recently, I’m glad to report, both dropped their
no-reservations policies.

In their styles of presenting Asian cuisine, though, they go their own
ways. Before opening Pig and Khao, Leah Cohen, the chef, spent a year
eating and cooking in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and the
Philippines, where her mother was raised. Eating at her restaurant, I
felt as if I were poring over an album of carefully edited postcards
from her travels. Dinner at Jeepney, on the other hand, felt more like
parachuting into Manila myself. I didn’t know all the vocabulary and
didn’t always know what I was putting in my mouth, but I knew I had left
home.

I’ve grown fond of both places, but I would take different sets of
friends to each.

For Pig and Khao, I’d round up the ones who love Asian flavors, don’t
have significant hearing loss yet, think it’s fun to get endless refills
of beer from a keg in the back garden and won’t be heartbroken to learn
that fertilized duck embryos are not an option.

They’d be pork lovers who would go for the sugary chunks of Chinese
sausage in a bowl of mussels first before dipping the so-so shellfish in
a redeemingly aromatic, basil-scented broth of dashi, butter and yuzu.

They would be delighted by a salad of watermelon cubes with strips of
grilled pork jowl and golden puffs of fried pork rind. Like nearly every
dish on the menu, it has enough crunch, salt and acidity to satisfy the
most curmudgeonly judge on “Top Chef,” where Ms. Cohen came to national
attention while she was cooking at [Centro
Vinoteca](http://events.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/10/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html?pagewanted=all)
before taking over the kitchen
there.

Then they’d see nothing wrong with moving on to another part of the
pig’s face with sizzling sisig, a modern Filipino classic. They’d
devour the chopped bits of pork — some crisp, some gelatinous, some
meaty — seasoned with soy and slicked with the yolk of an egg cracked
over the platter at the last minute.

They wouldn’t be fanatics about the authenticity of a menu that leans
repeatedly on “crispy” over less familiar words. When “crispy red curry
rice salad” turned out to be a less-spicy Thai pork larb tricked out
with fragments of curried rice cooked into a crust, they’d nod their
heads over Ms. Cohen’s talent for bright, clear flavors instead of
quibbling. And when the adobo in “crispy quail adobo” was not a stewing
liquid, as it might be in the Philippines, but a rich soy and garlic
sauce tossed with deep-fried quail, they wouldn’t care.

I didn’t care, either.

The friends I’d take to Jeepney would be the explorers, the ones who see
every meal as a chance to learn something.

They wouldn’t fume if it took three tries to bolt the restroom door.
They wouldn’t clutch their pearls at the sight of nipples on the back
room’s photomurals, one set belonging to the first Filipina to appear in
Playboy, the other to the first in German Playboy. (When children show
up, the staff applies discreet bands of tape.)

The menu nonchalantly tosses out ingredients like sawsawan and bagoong
as if they were peas and carrots, and these friends would listen as the
high-spirited servers explained it all.

They’d pay $7 more for an extra marrow bone to supplement the impressive
one that rides on top of a short-rib and vegetable soup called bulalo.
They would mash the marrow with a fork into a lump of jasmine rice, then
drink the deeply restorative broth from their bowls and ladle some into
mine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If they came on a Thursday, when Jeepney puts away the utensils and
plates and serves dinner on banana leaves, they’d wash their hands and
get right down to business.

They’d mold jasmine rice around bits of longanisa sausage; strips of
tocino, pork that the chef, Miguel Trinidad, cures in 7Up; and cubes of
pork stewed in a fascinating chocolate-colored sauce of beef blood, bay
leaves and vinegar. Facing fried crabs sautéed with garlic, they would
crack open the shells and excavate the meat with their fingers.

Would they eat balut? Maybe.

Would I? I did. The liquid on top tasted, yes, like chicken broth; the
yolk was chalky; parts of the white were confusingly hard. As for the
little embryo, it gave way to the spoon as easily as custard and tasted
something like duck liver mixed with duck breast. If you didn’t grow up
eating balut, it probably helps to stop thinking about the feathers.

Jeepney’s batting average could be higher. A dish called the Defeated
Chicken, with nondescript roasted chicken in adobo sauce, defeated me,
too, and the slow-roasted pork shoulder in one called Bicol Express had
been cut across the grain into short, dry strands.

But the people I’d take there know that discoveries require both trial
and error. If they prefer the reliable rewards of skillful cooking
edited for New Yorkers, I’ve got a restaurant for that, too.
