Hearst Magazines, the publisher of such venerable titles as Esquire and
Cosmopolitan, said on Wednesday that it was creating a new position,
president of digital media.

The job will go to Troy Young, 45, who will be responsible for content,
revenue production and development strategies for Hearst Magazines' 26
online properties, which include Cosmopolitan.com, Elle.com and
RealBeauty.com.~The job's purview extends only to magazines' online
brands, not to their print editions.

Mr. Young has not been employed in traditional media since the 1990s,
when he worked for Canadian television. He has spent the last 20 years
of his career in what is known as the ``pure play'' digital-only space.

Mr. Young comes most recently from Say Media, an integrated digital
media company that builds its own online brands around themes (like
ReadWrite, a technology Web site) or charismatic editors (like xoJane,
edited by Jane Pratt, the founding editor of Sassy magazine) and then
helps advertisers build branded content for those properties.

Before his time at Say, Mr. Young was chief experience officer of the
Omnicom digital agency Organic, with clients such as American Express,
Virgin Mobile and Chrysler.

David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines, said he chose Mr. Young
because ``Pure plays are increasingly the companies to watch in terms of
how quickly they produce product, the orthodoxies they set aside and how
they assemble their talent.''

``We want the pulse of a pure play,'' he added.

Mr. Young said he had always worked ``at the intersection of~strategy
and content,'' which was particularly useful for what he described as a
coming era where advertiser content would blend ``seamlessly'' with
editorial content.

``We are seeing an integration of the advertisers and the content in
native advertising,'' he said, ``and this is not going away.''
