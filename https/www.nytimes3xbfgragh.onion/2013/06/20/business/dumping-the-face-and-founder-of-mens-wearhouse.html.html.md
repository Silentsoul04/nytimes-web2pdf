It seems that George A. Zimmer is no longer suited for Men’s Wearhouse.

The clothing retailer announced on Wednesday that it had fired Mr.
Zimmer, who started the company in 1973, as executive chairman. For
three decades, he had starred in its commercials, telling customers,
“You’re going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.”

A disagreement between Mr. Zimmer and the board appeared to be the
reason for the sudden dismissal, though it was not immediately clear
what that disagreement was. Some analysts suggested that the conflict
might be over the company’s efforts to appeal to younger customers,
which could have been hampered by Mr. Zimmer’s continued presence in
ads.

“Over the past several months I have expressed my concerns to the board
about the direction the company is currently heading,” Mr. Zimmer said
in a [statement provided to
CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100828607 "A video on CNBC."). “Instead of
fostering the kind of dialogue in the board room that has in part
contributed to our success, the board has inappropriately chosen to
silence my concerns through termination as an executive officer.”

The company gave no reason for Mr. Zimmer’s dismissal in its
[statement](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=109554&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=1831249&highlight= "A news release.").
A spokesman for the company declined to
comment.

Showing just how abrupt the decision was, Mr. Zimmer’s firing was
announced the same day as a scheduled shareholders’ meeting, which has
been postponed “to renominate the existing slate of directors without
Mr. Zimmer,” the company said Wednesday. The board released a statement
Wednesday saying it “fully supports C.E.O. Doug Ewert and his management
team.”

The company has more than 1,100 stores nationally, under the flagship
Men’s Wearhouse brand along with Moores and K\&G. The stores primarily
sell suits and rent tuxedos.

Financially, it has been performing solidly, with sales increasing 5.1
percent in the quarter ended May 4 to $616.5 million. Sales for 2012
were $2.5 billion, up 4.4 percent, with profits rising to $2.55 a share
from $2.30 a share.

Mr. Zimmer, 64, had been easing out of a leadership role at the company
recently.

“He had been managing a transition, I thought, very effectively the last
two years,” said Richard Jaffe, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. In
2011, Men’s Wearhouse promoted Mr. Ewert to succeed Mr. Zimmer as chief
executive, and recently hired the designer Joseph Abboud as creative
director along with a new chief financial officer. Perhaps Mr. Zimmer
“was reluctant to give up the reins,” he said.

Mr. Jaffe suggested that advertising might have split Mr. Zimmer and the
board. The company has been trying to appeal to millennials, and has
been evaluating whether Mr. Zimmer’s appearance in the advertisements
resonates with younger shoppers, Mr. Jaffe said.

“They continually rework it, adjusting how much presence do we have on
George. Does he stand? Does he sit? But it’s always all about George
Zimmer — his voice, his physical presence,” he said. “An old guy with a
gray beard may not provide credibility to the product in the eyes of a
22- or 24-year-old.”

Jerome Reisman, a partner with Reisman Peirez Reisman & Capobianco in
Garden City, N.Y., said it was irresponsible of the company to be so
vague about the reasons for Mr. Zimmer’s departure.

“When you are a public company, when you have shareholders, when you
report to the media, you have a duty to disclose the cause of any major
material termination,” he said. “Zimmer, at all times, was the poster
boy for this company — what Frank Perdue was to Perdue Chickens, what
Tom Carvel was to the Carvel Ice Cream Company.”

The lack of details spawns speculation, Mr. Reisman said: “Is there more
behind all of this? Is there a reason for shareholders to have fear? And
the last thing you want from public shareholders is fear and the
unknown.”

In its statement, the company said the board expected “to discuss with
Mr. Zimmer the extent, if any, and terms of his ongoing relationship
with the company.”

Mr. Jaffe said he did not expect Mr. Zimmer’s departure to affect the
company, given the succession plan Mr. Zimmer had already put in place.
The company maintains the legal right to his image and 500 hours of film
of Mr. Zimmer, Mr. Jaffe said in a note to clients.

Men’s Wearhouse stock was down 1.2 percent, to $37, at the close of
trading.
