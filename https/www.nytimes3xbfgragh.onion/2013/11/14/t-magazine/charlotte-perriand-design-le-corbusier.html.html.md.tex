It's hard to think of a modern woman more modern than Charlotte
Perriand. Creative, intelligent, well traveled and athletic, the native
Parisian was a pioneer of design at a time when women's options in the
field were limited mainly to ceramics and textiles. In the 1920s,
Perriand transformed a room in her apartment into a glass and metal bar
for entertaining, and she saw the potential of tubular steel as a
material for furniture. And it was largely thanks to her vision that the
architect Le Corbusier became famous for the 1928 steel and cowhide
chaise longue, and other iconic pieces, on which he collaborated with
Perriand and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. (This was not long after Le
Corbusier dismissed a job-hunting Perriand with the now infamous words
``We don't embroider cushions here,'' and even after he admitted his
mistake, it took decades for Perriand to get equal credit for their
designs.)

Perriand went on to create other furnishings, as well as interiors and
buildings, but the first house she designed on her own, a 1934
second-place entry in a magazine competition for an affordable beach
house, remained unbuilt --- until now. Louis Vuitton, which took
Perriand as the muse for its spring/summer 2014 women's Icônes
collection, worked with the Charlotte Perriand Archive to construct La
Maison au Bord de l'Eau (the House on the Waterfront), which will be
displayed at Design Miami (Dec. 4 to Dec. 8) and then put up for sale.
The house --- a compact structure of four rooms flanking an open-air
living space --- is elegant in its economy, and looks as if it could
have been designed today, a spirit that appealed to Julie de Libran, the
creative director of Louis Vuitton women's collection. She admires
Perriand's ``refined'' color sense, but also the fact that ``she was so
intelligent and pragmatic,'' adding that ``functionality was her way of
thinking.'' (Perriand once traveled to Asia with a compact wardrobe of
interchangeable ``modules,'' a philosophy that is reflected in the
Icônes collection's colorful, adaptable pieces.)

Pernette Perriand, Charlotte's daughter, and Pernette's husband, Jacques
Barsac, who run the archive, said that not only was the project one of
Perriand's favorites, but that it was also a very early example of
prefab design, another aspect of Perriand's ahead-of-the-curve
sensibility that appealed to Louis Vuitton. With its debut in Miami
Beach, the house can now inspire a future generation of design pioneers.
