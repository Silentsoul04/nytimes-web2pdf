The outside makes no grand statements. A glass wall stares out at a
not-yet-trendy block of Orchard Street. It’s blank except for the small
menu posted by the door, offering five courses for the relatively modest
sum of $55. Hanging on one inside wall, more art than ad, and almost
invisible unless you are walking southbound very close to the window, is
the restaurant’s name in red neon script:
[Contra](http://contranyc.com/).

At work in a compact kitchen at the far end of the earnest and narrow
dining room are two chefs whose ambitions for Contra are anything but
small. They want to create a style of cooking that New York can call its
own.

“This is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of
identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another
place, another time,” Jeremiah Stone, a former sous-chef of [Rino in
Paris](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/10/31/travel/31rino-paris-bites.html)
who helped open
[Isa](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/11/23/dining/reviews/isa-nyc-restaurant-review.html)
in New York, told
[Eater](http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/08/contra_interview.php)
shortly before the restaurant opened in October. “They want to do modern
Thai, Roman, creative French.”

His partner in the kitchen, Fabian von Hauske, who worked in the pastry
kitchen of Jean Georges and, briefly, at
[Faviken](http://www.phaidon.com/store/food-cook/faviken-9780714864709/)
in Sweden, pursued the idea. “I don’t think there’s that much of a style
here,” he said. “You go to San Francisco and there is definitely a style
there when you go to places like
[Coi](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/03/05/dining/05seven.html?ref=dining&action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults%230&version=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2Fcoi%2Bwells%2F)
or [Commis](http://www.commisrestaurant.com/). I think there should be
more of an identity here, something that’s contemporary that you can’t
find anywhere else.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In most other cities, hatchets would be out for a pair of 20-something
chefs who rode into town promising to show everybody how it’s done. But
not New York. Here we just say, All right, kids, let’s see what you’ve
got.

What Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have is a personal, understated,
modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the
desserts and the bread, which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the
supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest, but their styles
are compatible. I’m not enthusiastic about what strikes me as a Northern
European phobia of spices, but I came to admire their restraint with
salt and added fat. You can see this approach catching on among other
young chefs, some of whose food gets lumped in with [the New Nordic
movement](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/02/19/dining/a-nordic-quest-in-new-york.html?action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults%230&version=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FNew%2BNordic%2Bmovement%2F).
A more accurate name for their quiet, naturalistic, drama-averse
approach may be mumblecore cuisine. Contra, at the moment, pulls it off
with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth
following.

The monkfish that appeared one recent night was cooked with faultless
timing, roasted slowly, with the kind of tender pink center you’d find
inside a seared scallop. It shared its chunky earthenware plate with
leaves of charred kale, a marmalade of caramelized onions and a
fish-sauce foam, but if you are thinking Vietnamese-molecular fusion,
forget it. The fish sauce was a complex and milky froth made of monkfish
bones and smoked trout, and it was very, very good.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This was truly expressive cooking, exploring shades of flavor more
watercolor than acrylic. The dish is either changed or gone by now, no
doubt, but the impression lasted.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And I won’t forget Contra’s pairing of chicken breast with pickled
daikon, toasted sesame seeds and blood sausage. The sausage had been
transformed into a swipe of soft, tangy, beet-red paste, dotted with
marjoram leaves and tart nubs of dried raspberries. It all came together
in a way so unexpected and right that I had to shake my head.

New dishes roll onto the tasting menu every few days, and old ones are
subject to restless tinkering. (Old, at Contra, means anything that was
invented before today.) The first time I ate monkfish there, a mash of
raw walnuts and garlic in miso was trying out for the role that was
later played, with more depth, by the onion jam. And I liked watching
the evolution of a raw scallop dish outfitted with noodle-like ribbons
of raw kohlrabi. As wide as seatbelts the first time, they had slimmed
down and looked more like fettuccine the next. On the other hand, the
dried raspberries had gone from the blood-sausage swoosh the second time
I saw the monkfish. I missed them a little.

You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting
menus, but the format suits Contra’s food unusually well. The flavors
are subtle, and on first encounter it’s a bit like walking out of the
daylight and into a candlelit room: you need to adjust. Five courses is
enough time to open your eyes (you may get more time than you need on
nights when the pace drags).

Another advantage of the tasting menu becomes clear when you are served
dessert, followed by a second dessert. As you may have guessed, Mr. von
Hauske is judicious with sugar and quite comfortable with vegetables. I
liked a beets-and-yogurt number more than I did a creamed gianduja
studded with tough sunchoke chips that put up more of a fight than I
could face at the end of the night.

But at least I knew everybody else would be crunching along with me, and
I’d already smiled my way through a less-antagonistic dessert, a kind of
rebuilt apple crisp, with an oat crumble and whipped oat-infused custard
around a cider-like apple granita. This dessert was pure fun and charm,
like Mr. von Hauske’s partnering of tangerine granita with a smooth
popcorn-infused mousse and smashed bits of caramel popcorn.

Linda Milagros Violago, who stocked the cellars at
[Mugaritz](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/16/dining/for-them-a-great-meal-tops-good-intentions.html?action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults%230&version=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DDining%2520%2526%2520Wine%26region%3DTopBar%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26pgtype%3Darticle%23%2FMugaritz)
in Spain and Geranium in Denmark, has put together a list of bottles
from the kind of small winemakers who think of themselves as farmers and
avoid modern tricks. The results aren’t always what you’d predict; a
French cider, she said, had a note of blue cheese, and it did. The list
almost forces you to try something unfamiliar, which feels just right
for this restaurant.

I hope Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske achieve all their goals except the
one about creating a shared New York style. The crazy riot of voices
chattering in hundreds of accents is the whole point of this crazy,
riotous city they have adopted. We don’t need other chefs imitating
Contra’s style. We’ve got the original now.
