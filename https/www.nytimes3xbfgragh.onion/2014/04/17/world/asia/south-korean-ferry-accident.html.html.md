JINDO, South Korea — The parents waited in dread through the night,
huddled under blankets in this South Korean port town, staring out to
sea for a sign that rescuers had found any of the 281 people, many of
them high school students, still missing after a ferry sank on
Wednesday.

They refused to sleep in a tent set up for them, preferring to scan the
horizon for helicopters returning from the rescue effort 11 miles off
the country’s southwest coast. As the hours passed with little news of
what may be one of South Korea’s worst peacetime disasters, they
demanded information from officials who said that fierce tides were
keeping divers from entering the ship, which had mostly slipped beneath
the waves long before.

“Why are you not going in to save them?” one woman screamed. Another,
Chung Hae-sook, the mother of a missing 16-year-old boy, echoed her
rage: “There is no tomorrow for this,” she said. “My heart is turning to
ashes.”

By Thursday morning, the Ministry of Security and Public Administration,
which is coordinating the rescue efforts, reported that 175 passengers
and crew members had been rescued. Nine people were confirmed dead,
including four students, two teachers and a member of the ferry’s crew.
But fears of a much higher death toll were stoked as survivors said they
believed that many people had been trapped below deck. According to some
who spoke to the local news media, passengers had been told to remain in
their seats and may have stayed there until it was too late.

“People were shouting, ‘Break the windows,’ but the water came up too
quickly and many could not come outside,” Kim Seong-muk, a rescued
passenger, told the television station YTN.

Survivors reported hearing a loud noise and feeling a jolt before the
ship, the Sewol, began to list and sink.

Of the 462 people aboard, 325 were students from Danwon High School in
Ansan, about 20 miles south of Seoul. By midnight, about 75 of the
students had been rescued. They had been on an overnight voyage to Jeju,
a popular resort island, where they were scheduled for a four-day field
trip and sightseeing.

The students, in their second year of high school, were taking the trip
as a break before their last year, when they must take difficult college
entrance exams.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the students who made it out, Kim Tae-young, said he had seen
people in the ferry’s cafeteria and in a game room on a level below him
before the ship started listing.

“The water rushed in, up to my neck, and it was difficult to climb to
the top of the boat because it was badly tilted,” he told News Y, a
cable channel. “I saw shipping containers tossed off the ship’s deck and
floating in the water. I also saw a vending machine toppled and two
girls trapped under
it.”

The cause of the accident was not immediately clear. By nightfall, no
South Korean official or analyst had raised the possibility of foul play
by North Korea, which was accused of [sinking a South Korean Navy
ship](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/03/27/world/asia/27korea.html "Times article")
with a torpedo in 2010, a charge the North denied.

During a brief news conference on Wednesday, Kim Young-bung, an
executive at the Cheonghaejin Marine Company, which operated the ship,
offered the company’s “deepest apology” but few details about what had
happened.

The maritime police said they were questioning the ship’s captain, Lee
Jun-seok, 69, and other surviving crew members while arranging for
cranes to be sent to the scene, in the Yellow Sea, to try to lift the
vessel.

The 6,825-ton ferry had been sailing from Incheon, a port west of Seoul,
to Jeju, roughly 60 miles off the southern coast of South Korea, when it
sent a distress signal on Wednesday morning. Video showed rescuers
scaling the side of the listing ship, pulling out survivors and placing
them in baskets lowered by helicopters.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

YTN quoted surviving students describing a chaotic scene in which
passengers tripped and bumped into one another and luggage was tossed
about as the ship leaned precariously. People jumped into the water in
life jackets and swam to fishing boats that had arrived near the sinking
ship, they said. The passengers were wrapped in blankets and taken to
shelters and hospitals in nearby ports.

In a text message shown on the station’s broadcast, a student had
written, “Dad, I can’t walk out because the ship is tilted too much, and
I don’t see anyone in the corridor.” It was unclear if the student
survived.

On Wednesday, President Park Geun-hye declared, “We must not give up.”

Speaking at the headquarters of the Ministry of Security and Public
Administration, she said, “We must do our best to rescue even one of
those passengers and students who may not have escaped from the ship.”

Lee Gyeong-og, vice minister of security and public administration, said
that 160 navy and coast guard divers were working at the scene, but that
their operations were being hampered by rapid currents and poor
underwater visibility.

Around 4 a.m. on Thursday, a Coast Guard official in Jindo told parents
that divers had conducted five searches so far but were waiting for
better conditions before heading back down. The sea off western South
Korea has strong tides.

South Korea has not had a major ferry accident in two decades. The last
was in 1994, when a tourist ferry caught fire on a lake, killing 30
people. A year earlier, 292 people died when an overloaded ferry,
sailing despite warnings of bad weather, [sank off the country’s west
coast](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1993/10/11/world/100-feared-dead-off-south-korea.html "Times article").

On Wednesday, Mr. Lee of the security ministry declined to comment on
the likelihood of finding more survivors. The ship sank in waters 104
feet deep, and the water temperature in the area was about 54 degrees
Fahrenheit, cold enough to cause hypothermia after about two hours,
officials said.

The ship’s departure from Incheon on Tuesday evening was delayed by two
hours because of heavy fog, officials said. It was also carrying 150
cars and trucks, below its capacity of 180.

Mrs. Chung — the woman who was waiting in Jindo for news of her
16-year-old son, Park Sung-ho — said he had sent her a text message on
Tuesday saying the ferry might not leave the dock, but later messaged
her that it was departing and that he would return safely.

“I feel like the parents, including myself, are here waiting for our
children to die,” she said.

Kim Dong-soo, a truck driver who was on the Sewol and said he frequently
took the ferry to Jeju, told News Y that the ship had begun leaning
sharply after it made a sharp turn to the right. It was also sailing
much closer to the coast than it usually does, he
said.

“I wonder why the rescuers who first got to the ship didn’t do anything
about those 100 or 200 I think were trapped inside the ship,” he said.
“They were just picking up those already on the top of the ship.”

The ferry, built in Japan in 1994 and operated by Cheonghaejin Marine
since late 2012, could hold 920 passengers.

For the parents waiting in the morning chill in Jindo, the day had been
a roller-coaster ride of emotions. Soon after the accident, the ministry
had given a much lower estimate of the number of missing, an error it
attributed to confusing reports from the scene.

Mrs. Chung said the school had also sent a message saying the students
were all being rescued.

Her younger brother, who was keeping vigil with her, said he was
“ashamed” of the government for not doing more.

“How can we trust them?” he said. “It feels like the divers are not
going into the water lest they die. How can we trust the authorities if
a war breaks out?”

Another relative of a missing child sounded resigned. “I don’t have much
hope at this point,” said Choi Dae-gwang, whose son Choi Su-bin, 17, was
missing. But “they should at least pretend to rescue people.”
