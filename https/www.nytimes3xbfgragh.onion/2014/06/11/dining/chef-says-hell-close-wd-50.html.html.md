**Updated | June 11, 2014**

In the end, a prophet of change was pushed out by change itself.

WD-50, a Lower East Side landmark for modernist cooking and one of the
most influential restaurants in the world, will close at the end of
November. [Wylie
Dufresne](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/02/dining/at-wd-50-wylie-dufresne-is-shaking-up-the-entire-menu.html),
the chef whose imaginative vision has propelled the restaurant for 11
years, announced Tuesday evening on Twitter that Nov. 30 “will be our
final night of service” at the [50 Clinton Street](http://wd-50.com)
spot. “Come celebrate with us for the next 173 days.”

In a phone interview Wednesday morning, [Mr.
Dufresne](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/01/wylie-wonkas-food-factory/?ref=dining),
who turned 44 last week, explained that the pioneering restaurant had
succumbed to a classic New York City story: A developer, [Icon Realty
Management](http://www.iconrealtymgmt.com/), is planning to put up a new
building on the site. “It’s a real estate thing,” the chef said. The
developer declined to comment for this article.

So far, Mr. Dufresne hasn’t peeked at plans for that building. “I
haven’t been particularly eager to look at what my headstone’s going
to look like,” he said with a rueful laugh.

For a while, the chef and his team thought there might be a way to stay
put while the structure came together around them, but that began to
feel untenable. “The more I ruminated on that, the more it just didn’t
sit well,” he said. “We weren’t going to be able to give the diners the
same experience we’d been giving them.” He added that having the
restaurant exist in a construction site, with all the attendant dust and
noise and inconvenience, seemed wrong for an enterprise where every dish
comes across as an edible thought experiment.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Dufresne said he planned to eventually move his vision to a
different location in the city, although he had no specific spots in
mind. “I have a great love of fine dining and I hope to continue that,”
he said. “We don’t quite know yet where we’re going. It’s like they say,
‘You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.'”

In food-obsessed circles, the shuttering of the WD-50 space — like [the
closing of El
Bulli](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/06/15/dining/el-bulli-is-closing-but-spain-looks-forward.html?pagewanted=all)
in Spain in 2011 — represents the loss of a history-making culinary
laboratory.

Mr. Dufresne is also the gastronomic conceptualist behind
[Alder](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/07/10/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-alder-in-the-east-village.html),
an East Village tavern that offers [a playfully cubist
version](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/02/06/dining/wylie-dufresne-prepares-you-for-a-cubist-spin-on-pub-grub.html)
of pub grub, but the chef made his mark on the global food scene with
WD-50, an atelier of appetite where diners might find foie gras that had
been turned into delectable aerated puffs and eggs Benedict broken down
into a Lego-like tableau of flavor. At WD-50, Mr. Dufresne and his team
weren’t content to spread mayonnaise; instead, [they fried
it](http://www.esquire.com/features/food-drink/ESQ0305EATSCHEF_142).

On Tuesday night, testaments to the restaurant’s enduring influence were
popping up all over Twitter. Pete Wells, the restaurant critic for The
New York Times, wrote: “In the future we’re going to realize WD-50 was
the CBGB of this era, with way nicer bathrooms.”

“I’m sad about it,” [René
Redzepi](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/07/07/dining/07chef.html?pagewanted=all),
the chef behind Noma, a restaurant in Copenhagen that has been called
the best in the world, said in an email. “I’m a frequent visitor in New
York, and WD-50 has always been the place to go and see the edgy side of
cooking. It was the place to have your preconceptions challenged.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Redzepi mused that Mr. Dufresne’s approach to cooking — “wild,
totally unafraid, setting new standards and constantly exploring new
territories” — had for a while turned WD-50 into “perhaps the most
influential restaurant in the world.”

“There was definitely a time, if you were a young cook and you wanted to
be in the know, that you’d be checking out WD-50’s website all the
time,” he said. (In April, Mr. Redzepi and a legion of top-ranked
chefs from around the world [gathered in New
York](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/04/operation-surprise-wylie.html)
for a surprise party in honor of Mr. Dufresne.) Mr. Redzepi added, “I’ve
never understood why New York hasn’t given him the ‘key to the city,’
like they have, rightly, to some of his peers who do a nice pasta or a
new burger.”

David Chang, the chef and entrepreneur behind the expanding Momofuku
empire, expressed his disappointment at hearing the WD-50 news in blunt
language, adding, “I don’t know how else to describe it.” For years, Mr.
Chang went on, Mr. Dufresne “was doing stuff that no one else was doing.
He was so ahead of the curve that people took it for granted.”

Although clearly wistful and emotional about the closing, Mr. Dufresne
said he would not snuff out WD-50’s experimental spirit in the last few
months of its existence. “We are going to continue to push and continue
to do new stuff,” he said. “We’re still actively working on new ideas.”
The restaurant may also opt for a dash of crowdsourcing, using social
media to ask diners which famous dishes from the early years they’d like
to see resurrected for the final stretch.

And although there won’t be another New Year’s Eve party at WD-50,
“maybe we’ll do New Year’s Eve in October,” Mr. Dufresne said. “We
want this to be fun. We want this to be a celebration.”

Beyond his scientific bent in the kitchen, Mr. Dufresne is known for
having an eye for young talent. Many veterans of the restaurant’s
kitchen and bar, such as Christina Tosi, Mario Carbone, Alex Stupak and
Paul Carmichael, have become forces in cooking around New York City.

Mr. Dufresne is viewed as a pioneer, too, when it comes to bringing
[three-star
dining](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/03/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html?pagewanted=all)
to a somewhat dingy patch of downtown Manhattan. “Wylie helped change
the Lower East Side completely,” Mr. Chang said. “If any other
restaurant is there now, it’s because Wylie was there first.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In fact, it could be argued that WD-50’s presence in that part of town
helped usher in the gentrification that is now forcing it out. “This is
unfortunately what’s probably going to happen to almost everybody,
unless you can buy the building,” Mr. Chang said.

Mr. Dufresne appeared to be approaching the shift with equanimity.
“That’s the story of New York,” he said. “Neighborhoods change. In
some ways it’s part of the beauty of New York City. It’s in a constant
state of flux.”
