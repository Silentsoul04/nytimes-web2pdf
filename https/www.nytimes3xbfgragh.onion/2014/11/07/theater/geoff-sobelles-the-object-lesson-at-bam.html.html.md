In their later years, my parents used to tease each other with the
threat that whoever lived longer would be forced to deal with (ominous
organ chords) the Attic. It was a fearsome prospect, for within the
cramped upper level of their otherwise manageable house lurked the
flotsam and jetsam of at least four generations of their family’s lives.

To enter the Attic was to admit a flood of more accumulated memories
than a single mind should ever have to deal with. After my parents died,
I practically drowned in that Attic, since neither of them made good on
their promise to tackle it. Now, to my great consternation, the Attic
has been reassembled in Brooklyn.

This very personal chamber of horrors — and it will probably feel just
as personal to you — is the work of [Geoff
Sobelle](https://twitter.com/rainpan), whose charming and sobering
performance piece “The Object Lesson” opened at [the Brooklyn Academy of
Music](http://www.bam.org/theater/2014/the-object-lesson) on Wednesday
night. Mr. Sobelle is very fully occupying the Fishman Space there,
which has been converted into a towering city of cardboard boxes.

These boxes are mostly labeled with words that appear to have been
printed in haste by felt tips. They include cryptic designations like
“dark journals” and “acorn collection,” as well as the more expected
references to bedding and dishes. Then there’s the card catalog, the
size of a small school library’s, with alphabetically organized drawers,
bearing labels like “bedside table,” “moss to mystic,” “Paris” and “red
things.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Moss to mystic”? What could that mean? You can find out. The audience
is encouraged to roam this palace of clutter and to open drawers and
boxes at will.

That drawer turns out to have real moss inside, and it exhales the odor
of incense. See that disconnected phone? Pick up its receiver. It will
speak to you, in the voices of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in (I
think) [“The Big Sleep.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjJlBnfyiI4)
You’ll be hearing many other voices before the evening ends. In Mr.
Sobelle’s world, stuff talks, to the point that you can’t shut it up.

That most of us maintain — and effectively are — our own museums is the
premise of “The Object Lesson,” which runs only through Saturday and was
sold out before it opened. The show picked up [the top prize at the
Edinburgh Festival

## Fall Arts Preview - Times 100

How to wade through the crush of culture coming your way this season?
Here’s a guide to 100 events that have us especially excited, in order
of appearance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Directed by David Neumann, with the spectacular scenic installation
designed by Steven Dufala, this cunning show finds universal common
ground in one man’s field of detritus. It’s a ruefully, comically
sentimental piece that plucks a fleeting connective poetry in the
seeming randomness of what we hoard.

Participating in the prologue to “The Object Lesson,” in which the
audience wanders through the installation and tries to decipher it, is
essential. That’s what our host will be doing once we’re seated (each on
a cardboard box, marked “seat”). Mr. Sobelle climbs, wrestles with and
disappears into packing crates like a dancing Dumpster diver.

He emerges with treasures: the props and furniture out of which he
fashions provisional rooms, illuminated by rickety lamps. With the
uncanny aid of a couple of gimcrack tape recorders, he holds
conversations with these objects, or, if you prefer, with himself. And
with us, too, of course, in scenes that include an audience
participation sequence that reveals people as walking warehouses.

Items like polystyrene peanuts, wine bottles, a Victrola, telephones and
a traffic light come into play in vignettes that recall the wars waged
by silent clowns like
[Chaplin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNseEVlaCl4) and Keaton
against all things inanimate. Sometimes, briefly, Mr. Sobelle masters
his objects with aplomb. Who knew, for example, that ice skates could be
so useful in creating a salad for a romantic dinner? These scenes
sometimes veer into preciousness. But whimsical detours are forgivable,
especially when you remember that the objects — and not their owner —
are the predetermined victors here.

In a bravura finale, Mr. Sobelle unpacks a whole cradle-to-grave
lifetime from a bottomless box that just keeps on giving, until he gives
up. The room is plunged into darkness. He disappears. The boxes and
their contents live on, whispering of lost time to whoever next stumbles
upon them.
