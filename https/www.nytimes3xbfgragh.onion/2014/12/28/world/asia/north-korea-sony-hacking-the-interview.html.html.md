SEOUL, South Korea — [North
Korea](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/northkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo "More news and information about North Korea.")
lashed out at the United States on Saturday, blaming it for disruptions
that cut off the nation’s already limited connections to the Internet,
while once again rejecting American accusations that it was behind the
hacking of Sony Pictures.

The statement, carried by the North’s state-run Korean Central News
Agency, also called [President
Obama](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per "More articles about Barack Obama")
a “monkey” for urging the film studio to release “The Interview,” a
comedy depicting the assassination of the North Korean leader, [Kim
Jong-un](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/kim_jongun/index.html?inline=nyt-per "More articles about Kim Jong-un.").
Sony had canceled the movie’s release after online threats of attacks on
theaters, but then reversed itself after Mr. Obama criticized it for
capitulating to North Korean pressure.

The statement by the National Defense Commission, which is led by Mr.
Kim and is the country’s most powerful governing body, is the North’s
first response to the intermittent disruptions that have crippled its
tenuous connection to cyberspace since Monday. The connectivity
problems, which at one point appeared to sever North Korea completely
from the Internet, started days after Mr. Obama vowed to retaliate for
the damaging attack on the Sony film studio.

Speaking last week, Mr. Obama said he held the North responsible for the
hacking of Sony, which took place just before the studio was to release
“The Interview.” The attackers stole confidential emails, salary
information and unreleased movies, which they then posted online.

The United States has denied playing a role in the disruptions, which
struck many of North Korea’s few websites. Internet experts have said
the failures could have been caused by anything from technical
malfunctions to a hacking attack. However, in its statement on Saturday,
the North made clear that it viewed the disruptions as the work of an
American attack in retaliation for the Sony hacking.

While North Korea did not say if it would retaliate for the disruptions,
it did accuse the United States of acting like a schoolyard bully.

“The United States, with its large physical size and oblivious to the
shame of playing hide and seek as children with runny noses would, has
begun disrupting the Internet operations of the main media outlets of
our republic,” said the statement. In the past few days, the websites of
the state-run news agency and the newspaper Rodong Sinmun, two of the
North’s main outlets to the world, were among those that went dead for
several hours.

The North also blamed Mr. Obama for the release of the movie, which it
said undermined “the dignity of the supreme leadership.”

“Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a
tropical forest,” the statement said.

This is not the first time the North, which is fond of bombastic
language, has used racist or otherwise crude insults against the leaders
of the United States and its allies. Earlier this year, it also likened
Mr. Obama to a monkey, and also called President Park Geun-hye of South
Korea a prostitute.

The statement on Saturday also repeated earlier denials that North Korea
was behind the attack on Sony Pictures, and demanded that the United
States back up its accusation with proof.

“Obama had better thrust himself to cleaning up all the evil doings”
that the United States has perpetrated against the North, the statement
said.

The vaguely threatening tone echoed threats of violence against movie
theaters that planned to screen “The Interview.” Those threats were a
factor in Sony’s decision to cancel its release, but the studio
eventually reversed its decision, making the movie available to a
limited number of theaters and also online for downloads.
