“Go to Upland” is my current answer to anybody who asks for a good new
place to eat in Manhattan. It will probably remain my answer for some
time. The recommendation is the same for fetishists who unwind by
reconstructing recipes from the court of Catherine de Medici as for
parishioners in the Church of St. Rachael. It holds for drinkers who are
on the lookout for unexplored grapes and for those who call all white
wine chardonnay. The only diners I would not send to Upland are the ones
who categorically refuse to take any meals along Park Avenue South.
Their loss.

Upland’s owner and impresario in chief, [Stephen
Starr](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/06/12/dining/a-philadelphian-restaurateur-flourishes-in-new-york.html),
has opened jostling, thumping, nightclub-slash-restaurants such as
[Morimoto](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/03/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html)
and
[Buddakan](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/05/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html%20),
as well as intimate stages for chefs like
[Serpico](http://www.serpicoonsouth.com/) in Philadelphia. Upland
occupies the middle ground, a big restaurant where the set dressing
feels like an event but doesn’t compete with the food.

For the kitchen, Mr. Starr recruited Justin Smillie, whose intensely
flavorful spins on Italian cuisine at [Il Buco Alimentari e
Vineria](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/02/15/dining/reviews/il-buco-alimentari-e-vineria-nyc-restaurant-review.html)
won him national notice. Upland’s 88-seat dining room and vast menu
would make some of his peers, serenely accustomed to arranging brassica
specimens at tasting counters the size of egg cartons, collapse in a
swoon. Lucky for us, Mr. Smillie is made of sturdier stuff.

His menu splashes around in the gentle, sun-dappled river of classic
California cuisine, with special attention to its junctions with the
[Jonathan
Waxman](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/03/23/dining/23waxman.html?_r=0)
and [Jeremiah
Tower](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/11/05/dining/tavern-on-the-green-hires-jeremiah-tower-as-head-chef.html)
tributaries. (Upland is the name of the town in San Bernardino County
where Mr. Smillie was raised; Mr. Waxman was a mentor.) Mr. Smillie’s
pizzas, built on a tender crust with puffy lips, are freewheeling, like
the very good one with pears, arugula and soft stracciatella cheese
underscored by aged balsamic and a pesto that crunches with chopped
pecans. His pastas can be tried and true, like the firm and
well-peppered bucatini slick with tangy pecorino or the long,
star-shaped tubes called estrella tossed with a just-right sauté of
chicken livers with rosemary and sage. Or they may surprise you, like
the spicy spaghettini that get their potent oceanic flavor from
invisible baby sardines. Either way, they’re further confirmation that
Mr. Smillie is one of the city’s pasta savants.

As he showed in his last kitchen, he’s something of a vegetable sage,
too. Celery root never struck me as a showstopper, exactly, until I
tasted the one at Upland, slowly roasted into an intense and creamy
globe and brushed with black truffle butter. Everybody at my table
always wanted to try his deep-fried hen-of-the-woods mushroom, and
everybody was always happy swiping it in herbed Cloumage, a charming
cousin of ricotta brought down from southern Massachusetts. And a main
course of Tasmanian sea trout was made memorable by its vegetable side,
a section of sweet, ivory-colored cone cabbage permeated by smoke.

The burrata purist at my table was dubious about the heaps of trout roe
and frizz of fried leeks Mr. Smillie piled on top of the near-liquid
cheese, but the rest of us spooned it up, wishing we had a toasted
everything bagel to complete the picture. When it was gone, we weren’t
sure we would have the energy for the plate of duck wings, like confit
with a bone handle. But the sparks of heat and citrus in the yuzu kosho
vinaigrette on the skin kept us going until we began to think that
Upland deserves a place in the annals of poultry wing cookery alongside
the [Anchor Bar in
Buffalo](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1981/08/30/magazine/food-winging-it-in-buffalo.html).

Among the main courses, the grilled branzino with a scallion-heavy salsa
verde was solid if unsurprising. The pork chop, though, half-moons of
sweet persimmon and hot red peppers on top, was a sensation. I thought
about Mr. Smillie’s gift for building flavor upon flavor as I chewed on
the tiny squares of crackling that wrapped around the bone.

His menu rambles a bit, and it’s no surprise that not all of the 30 or
so dishes glide with swanlike grace. Chilled and decidedly al dente
farro spaghetti seemed like an odd choice for a cold sea urchin sauce,
and the whole notion is unlikely to melt anyone’s heart in the dead of
winter. Wads of spicy grated radish smothered the sweetness of
just-shucked raw scallops. And the short rib with walnuts and unruly
curls of shaved celery that was roasted on a rotisserie at Il Buco
Alimentari hasn’t fully acclimated to being cooked in an oven on East
26th Street; there seems to be less of the deeply caramelized meat
around the edges, and it’s less satisfying to chew on, while the bite of
the peppercorns is more bullying than I remember. And I wondered about
the size of the dining room when two out of three pastas showed up
lukewarm one night.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After some early critical grumbling about the desserts, a new pastry
chef from Thomas Keller’s fleet, Sébastien Rouxel, was installed shortly
before Christmas. I hope he sets the whisks and rolling pins in order
quickly because I’ve yet to meet a dessert at Upland that I’d come back
for, let alone one that suggests the easy rapport Mr. Smillie has with
his ingredients.

For now, there is more excitement to be had in slaloming around
Chantelle Pabros’s wine cellar. She has assembled one of the most
accessible, least dogmatic lists in town, with dozens of bottles under
$50, as if that were the way all wine lists worked. (It isn’t, but it
should be.) New Yorkers can challenge their parochial disdain for
California wines with classics like Chateau Montelena and leaders of the
modern style like Cathy Corison. Or they can dip into one of several
affordable Bordeaux, so unfashionable, so delicious. There is more than
a token sampling of reds from Portugal, and three Canadian Chardonnays,
patiently waiting for America to notice.

The interior is lined by shelf after shelf of preserved lemons in jars,
each one illuminated by three tiny LEDs until they become something like
citrus lamps. When their marmalade glow hits the copper trim around the
dining room, it gives off a light warmer than anything I’ve seen in a
restaurant before. The tables in the dining room are generously large,
the seats the kind you want to stay in all night. Not so in the bar,
where two of my guests, arriving early, were deposited on hard-backed
wood benches near the after-work mob. When I appeared, there was a
whispered conference by the coat room. “I’m sorry,” a host finally said
to my guests, “I forgot to ask if you’d like to sit in the dining room.”

If she forgets to ask you, too, tell her I said the dining room is the
place to be.
