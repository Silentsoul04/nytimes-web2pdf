Matthew Lightner, the well-traveled chef whose tasting menu at the tiny
TriBeCa restaurant \href{http://www.ateranyc.com/}{Atera} has won huge
acclaim, will leave there after March 28 to embark on a new project.

``It was time to pursue this opportunity, something I have been wanting
to do,'' he said in an interview on Friday, offering few details. ``The
concept is coming together.'' He said that he intended to remain in New
York and that he was hoping to create a high-end restaurant along with
``something casual and fun, comfort food'' that would reflect his
upbringing in Nebraska. He added that he had not lined up a location.

Over its three years in business, Atera, which consists mostly of a
dining counter where elaborate avant-garde tasting menus are served, has
received two Michelin stars and
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/07/18/dining/reviews/atera-in-tribeca.html}{a
three-star review} from Pete Wells in The New York Times.

Jodi Richard, the restaurant's owner, has hired Ronny Emborg, a lauded
Danish chef, to be the new executive chef. Mr. Emborg, 32, worked at El
Bulli and Mugaritz in Spain, was the personal chef for Queen Margrethe
II of Denmark, and has most recently been at the
\href{http://marchal.dk/en/}{Restaurant Marchal} in the Hotel
d'Angleterre in Copenhagen. He is known for food that engages all the
senses. In 2013 he published ``The Wizard's Cookbook,'' with a price of
\$150. It sold out.

Ms. Richard plans to close Atera for a few weeks in April to make some
cosmetic changes to the lounge areas and to let Mr. Emborg get up to
speed.

Mr. Lightner opened Atera in March 2012 after cooking at Castagna in
Portland, Ore.; at Noma in Denmark; and at Mugaritz in the Basque
country. He said he knew Mr. Emborg, and thinks he will be ``a good
fit'' for Atera, which he called one of his ``greatest experiences.''
