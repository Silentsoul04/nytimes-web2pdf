SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has executed 15 high-ranking government
officials this year, as its leader, Kim Jong-un, continues to struggle
to establish his monolithic authority more than three years after
assuming power, the South Korean intelligence agency told lawmakers on
Wednesday.

Since the death of his father, [Kim
Jong-il](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/12/19/world/asia/Kim-Jong-il-Dictator-Who-Turned-North-Korea-Into-a-Nuclear-State-Dies.html "Times obituary"),
in late 2011, Mr. Kim has engineered a series of executions, purges and
frequent reshuffles in the governing clique he inherited. South Korean
officials said that Mr. Kim, who is believed to be in his early 30s, was
resorting to a mix of terror and rewards to thwart any challenge to his
inexperienced leadership.

During a closed briefing Wednesday for members of Parliament in Seoul,
officials from the National Intelligence Service, the main South Korean
spy agency, said Mr. Kim was believed to have ordered the execution of
68 senior officials, some by machine gun, between 2012 and last year,
according to two lawmakers who attended the session.

Among the 15 officials killed this year was a North Korean vice
minister, who was executed in January after complaining about Mr. Kim’s
policy on forestation, the lawmakers said. In February, another vice
minister in charge of economic planning was killed for objecting to Mr.
Kim’s decision to change the roof design of a building under
construction in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. In March, four
members of the Unhasu Orchestra, where Mr. Kim’s wife, [Ri
Sol-ju](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/07/26/world/asia/north-korean-leader-marries-reports-say.html "Times article"),
once performed as a singer, were executed by firing squad on espionage
charges, the lawmakers said. They did not elaborate.

”Kim Jong-un is demonstrating a leadership style that brooked no excuses
for not following through with his orders,” Shin Kyoung-min, a South
Korean lawmaker, told reporters, citing reports by intelligence
officials. ”Those who second-guessed him are considered challenging his
authority and executed to set an example for the rest,” he said.

Mr. Shin was one of two lawmakers designated by the Parliament’s
intelligence committee to talk to the news media about the briefing. The
National Intelligence Service declined to confirm what the two lawmakers
told reporters.

Mr. Kim’s “reign of terror” included the execution in 2013 of his uncle,
[Jang
Song-thaek](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/24/world/asia/north-korea-purge.html "Times article")
— long considered the second-most powerful man in North Korea — who was
accused of stealing state funds and plotting to overthrow Mr. Kim.

Since eliminating his No. 2, Mr. Kim has frequently shifted jobs among
his closest aides, and top generals have often been demoted and others
promoted.

South Korean officials said that when Mr. Kim ordered his country to
close its borders to foreign tourists last October for fear of the Ebola
virus, his instruction was so strictly followed that top government
officials returning from overseas trips were required to go through a
21-day quarantine, and North Korean diplomats abroad were banned from
home visits. North Korea lifted the Ebola ban in early March.

Mr. Kim has spent his early years in power struggling to solidify his
authority, as his country’s economy has continued to flounder amid
stricter international sanctions. He has made frequent visits to catfish
farms, textile factories and military barracks to build his image as a
caring leader and legitimate successor in his family’s dynasty.

His tactics of inspiring fear of purges and stoking competition for his
favor, South Korean officials said, have fostered strong resentment
among North Korea’s elite.
