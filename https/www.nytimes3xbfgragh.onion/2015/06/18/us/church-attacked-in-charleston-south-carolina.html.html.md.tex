CHARLESTON, S.C. --- A white gunman opened fire Wednesday night at a
historic black church in downtown Charleston, S.C., killing nine people
before fleeing and setting off an overnight manhunt, the police said.

At a news conference with Charleston's mayor early Thursday, the police
chief, Greg Mullen, called the shooting a hate crime.

``It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a
church while they are having a prayer meeting and take their lives,'' he
said.

The police said the gunman walked into the historic Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church around 9 p.m. and began shooting.

Eight people died at the scene, Chief Mullen said. Two people were taken
to the Medical University of South Carolina, and one of them died on the
way.

``Obviously, this is the worst night of my career,'' Chief Mullen said.
``This is clearly a tragedy in the city of Charleston.''

City officials did not release information about the victims and did not
say how many people were in the church during the shooting. Hospital
officials declined to comment.

Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city was offering a reward for
information leading to the arrest of the gunman, whom the police
described as a clean-shaven white man about 21 years old who was wearing
a gray sweatshirt, bluejeans and Timberland boots. Chief Mullen
described him as ``extremely dangerous.''

``To walk into a church and shoot someone, is out of pure hatred,'' the
mayor said as he walked away after the news conference.

Law enforcement officers from the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the South Carolina Law Enforcement
Division; and other agencies were assisting. Chief Mullen said the
police were tracking the gunman with police dogs.

Around 10:45 p.m., police officers escorted a man in handcuffs who
appeared to match the attacker's description. But officials said later
that they were still searching for the gunman.

In the first hours after the shooting, the police blocked reporters and
passers-by from approaching the church, opposite a Marriott Courtyard
hotel, because of a bomb threat. Many among the cluster of media workers
were political reporters in town to cover campaign events of Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush.

Helicopters with searchlights circled overhead, and a group of pastors
knelt and prayed across the street.

``The question is, `Why God?','' a man wearing a shirt bearing the name
of the Empowerment Missionary Baptist Church said during the prayer.

Later, a group of church leaders gathered at the corner of Calhoun and
King Streets, a few blocks from where the shooting occurred, and held an
impromptu news conference. Tory Fields, a member of the Charleston
County Ministers Conference, said he believed the suspect had targeted
the victims because of their race.

``It's obvious that it's race,'' he said. ``What else could it be?
You've got a white guy going into an African-American church. That's
choice. He chose to go into that church and harm those people. That's
choice.''

The church is one of the nation's oldest black churches. The pastor, the
Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, is a state senator. It was not clear whether
he was at the church at the time of the shooting.

The Gothic Revival church was built in 1891 and is considered a
historically significant building, according to the National Park
Service.

The congregation was formed by black members of Charleston's Methodist
Episcopal Church who broke away ``over disputed burial ground,''
according to the website of the National Park Service.

In 1822, one of the church's co-founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to foment
a slave rebellion in Charleston, the church's website says. The plot was
foiled by the authorities and 35 people were executed, including Mr.
Vesey.

The church houses the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, the
Park Service said.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley said in a statement that she and her family were
praying for the victims.

``While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we'll
never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of
worship and take the life of another,'' the governor said. ``Please join
us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and
prayers.''

Late Wednesday, the campaign staff of Mr. Bush, the former governor of
Florida who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, said he
was canceling appearances planned for Thursday in Charleston because of
the shooting. Mrs. Clinton was in Charleston on Wednesday, but an aide
said she had left the city before the shooting.
