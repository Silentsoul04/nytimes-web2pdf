If you get stuck in a crowd in China — it’s not hard to do in a country
of nearly 1.4 billion — you may hear someone mutter, “*Ren tai duo*\!”:
“Too many people\!” It’s a common but misleading complaint. The real
demographic crisis that prompted the Chinese government’s decision last
week to [end its one-child
policy](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/30/world/asia/china-end-one-child-policy.html "Times article.")
is more palpable on the quiet Shanghai lane where I live with my family:
There is a dearth of young people.

Our neighbors consist mainly of aging pensioners and young Chinese
families with a single child, or no children at all. After 35 years of
one of the world’s most radical experiments in social engineering,
Shanghai’s fertility rates have plunged to perilously low levels: just
0.7 children per couple, less than half the national average and a third
of the 2.1 replacement rate. (The United States’ replacement rate is
about 1.9.)

When we go out together on the streets of Shanghai, our two sons draw
double takes (along with the inevitable question: “They’re twins,
right?”). The confusion provoked by the sight of two boys in a single
family may soon dissipate, even if the social complications triggered by
the one-child policy will continue to shape China for decades to come.
By promising to allow families to have two children — but no more — the
government hopes to avert a demographic time bomb that is the precise
opposite of the one it faced 35 years ago. Back then, in the aftermath
of Mao Zedong’s patriotic campaign to produce more children to “make the
nation stronger,” Deng Xiaoping instituted the one-child policy to
reduce the number of mouths to feed, stimulating economic growth and
prosperity.

The debate over whether the one-child policy has been essential to
China’s rise, or whether that would have been achieved naturally
without such an intrusive campaign, will rage for years to come. But
even the government has come to recognize, belatedly, its dangerous
social and economic consequences.

Chinese officials still seem impervious to the needless human suffering
the policy has inflicted: the forced abortions and sterilizations, the
undocumented children born and raised in the shadows, the persecution
and even imprisonment of those (like the blind lawyer [Chen
Guancheng](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/20/world/asia/china-dissident-chen-guangcheng-united-states.html "Times article."))
who tried to expose its abuses. But Beijing’s reversal is an attempt to
mitigate the massive social imbalances that will most likely reverberate
for generations: the shrinking work force that is hurting China’s
competitiveness; a rapidly aging population with too few young people to
shoulder the burden; and a sex ratio so skewed that there is now a
bubble of 25 million extra males of marrying age, “bare branches” on the
family tree with few prospects of ever finding a wife.

The gender gap can be seen in every corner of China, from our Shanghai
lane to the tiny village of Yihe in the mountains of Hebei province.
When I visited Yihe a couple years ago, I met a father who had recently
sold his flock of sheep — his life savings — to pay for the foundation
of his son’s so-called “wife-attracting house” in a town nearby. His
26-year-old son, Liu Wushu, had returned from a stint in the Army to
find that he and his male cousins were the only young adults left in
Yihe. The rest were old people. The young women Liu knew had all married
men of higher social status and moved out. Left behind, the bachelors
were now begging families for loans so they could build houses as part
of a “bride price” to lure a wife. In a region where the sex ratio is
even higher than the national average of 116 boys for every 100 girls,
Liu admitted: “This might be my only chance.”

The emergence of “bachelor villages” like Yihe was not unforeseen. A
cultural preference for boys as family heirs meant that many parents
tried to avoid having a daughter through selective abortion, adoption,
even infanticide. One architect of the original one-child policy, Tian
Xueyuan, [told
Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/22/us-china-population-idUSBRE90K0UV20130122 "Reuters article.")
he warned top officials years ago that “a substantial portion of China’s
men will not be able to find a match … and that will be a major factor
of social instability.”

With an estimated 30 million to 35 million unmarried men by 2020 — a
huge mass of unchanneled testosterone — critics worry that China could
face rising crime rates, social protests or a larger, more aggressive
military. Already, the shortage of brides has fueled an [underground
wife-smuggling
trade](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/814283.shtml "Global Times article.")
from the poorest Chinese provinces and neighboring countries like
Vietnam and Myanmar. Two weeks ago, the Chinese economist Xie Zuoshi
[sparked
outrage](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34612919 "BBC News article.")
with a modest proposal for poor bachelors: wife-sharing. (Polyandry is
practiced in a few pockets of rural China. I have spent time with two
brothers who share a wife — and, confusingly, a single child — in a
Tibetan part of Yunnan province.) Despite a barrage of criticism, Xie
insisted he was only being practical. If China were to let “30 million
bachelors have no women and no hope, they will hate society,” he said.
“We would have a serious social problem.”

When I returned to Yihe recently, Liu’s house was nearly finished. A
matchmaker had introduced him to a few women from other villages, but
none had worked out. Over a bowl of noodles, Liu confessed something he
hadn’t yet told his father: He was giving up. In a few days, he would be
leaving Yihe to join some of his Army buddies working in the oil fields.
What about the house for which his father had sold his last sheep? “That
was my father’s dream, not mine,” he said, tears pooling in his eyes.
The thought of spending his life in this desolate valley, unmarried, was
too much. “I can’t live my father’s life,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That afternoon, Liu’s father gave me a tour of the new house, eagerly
showing off its smooth concrete floors, indoor bathroom and electrical
outlets, so different from the dirt-floor home he shares with his wife.
“What girl wouldn’t want this?” he said. Liu didn’t say a word. When
his plan to leave finally came up, his father couldn’t look at him. “And
where would he go?” he asked me, before retreating to another room to
stew in silence. Liu left a few days later, leaving the new house empty
and abandoned. It stands as a symbol of two implacable legacies of the
one-child policy: a “bare branch” unable to find a wife and an aging
father unable to keep his only son close to take of him and his wife in
their old age.

Last week, back in Shanghai, I looked out my window and saw a young
girl, one of the single children living on our lane, being carried home
in the arms of her father as her mother and grandparents looked on. It
was a happy scene, but it still made me reflect on the all-pervasive
influence of the one-child policy’s social engineering. China has gone
through periods of historic suffering (the Cultural Revolution, the
Great Leap Forward) that have been all but erased from the collective
memory. But the one-child policy may endure far longer, for it is a
policy that has been written in the lives — and absences — of nearly
every Chinese family.
