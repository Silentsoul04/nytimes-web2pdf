\emph{For his bookshop installation,}
\href{http://onegrandbooks.com/}{\emph{One Grand}}\emph{, the editor
Aaron Hicklin asked people to name the 10 books they'd take with them if
they were marooned on a desert island. The next in the series is the
cult film director and writer John Waters. He shares his list
exclusively with T.}

\textbf{``Narrow Rooms,'' James Purdy}

A salaciously satisfying novel that's a great read, especially if you're
having a sexual nervous breakdown.

\textbf{``Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare,'' Philip Short}

Incredibly detailed biography of the real ``filthiest person alive'':
the Cambodian leader who executed intellectuals for being in love or
even laughing in public.

\textbf{``Genet: A Biography,'' Edmund White}

The definitive life story of my hero, Jean Genet.

\textbf{``The Ghastly One: The Sex-Gore Netherworld of Filmmaker Andy
Milligan,'' Jimmy McDonough}

The astonishing career of Andy Milligan, the most pitifully damaged and
insane film director whose personal life made Ed Wood's look like a walk
in the park.

\textbf{``My Prizes: An Accounting,'' Thomas Bernhard}

Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth! The Austrian intellectual
sourpuss hilariously rejects every literary award he was ever given.
Refusal as an art form.

\textbf{``The Sluts,'' Dennis Cooper}

The novelist Dennis Cooper has always made other gay writers nervous.
He's a leader, a radical and his sexual horror stories are smart as
hell.

\textbf{``Still Holding,'' Bruce Wagner}

This West Coast sage does it best --- malicious, spiritually confused
and sardonic storytelling like no other.

\textbf{``Serious Pleasures: The Life of Stephen Tennant,'' Philip
Hoare}

Aubrey Beardsley, Ronald Firbank, Denton Welch --- believe me, this
ultimate British eccentric made them all seem butch. It's a crime this
book has gone out of print.

\textbf{``The Beard,'' Michael McClure}

Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid meet up and have sex in this absurdist,
Pop Art play that used to get busted for obscenity. Isn't now the
perfect time to bring it back and turn it into a Broadway musical?

\textbf{``Good Morning, Midnight,'' Jean Rhys}

To hell with Charles Bukoswki, Jean Rhys is the best alcoholic writer of
them all.
