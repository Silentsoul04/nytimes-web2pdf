Friday is the start of North Korea’s most important political meeting in
36 years: the seventh congress of the ruling Workers’ Party. Thousands
of delegates from around the country are in Pyongyang, the capital,
whose residents have been mobilized to welcome them. But beyond the
choreographed pageantry and fervor, there are reasons to watch the
proceedings closely.

## What is the congress?

In theory, the Workers’ Party rules North Korea, and the congress is
where its most important decisions are made. Delegates will elect the
party’s central committee, which will choose the Politburo and the
party’s top boss, the first secretary. (Kim Jong-un is, to say the
least, highly likely to retain that post.) The congress also reviews
past policies and adopts new party lines.

That’s the theory. In reality, all decision-making power is concentrated
in one supreme leader, Mr. Kim, and [all political
events](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/05/world/asia/north-korea-congress-kim-jong-un.html)
are dedicated to ensuring what the country calls his “monolithic
leadership.” The charter of the Workers’ Party commits it to upholding
Mr. Kim as its “center” while abiding by “the Kim Il-sung/Kim Jong-il
ideology as its only leadership philosophy” (referring to North Korea’s
two previous supreme leaders, Mr. Kim’s grandfather and his father).

## Why is this happening now?

It is not entirely clear. According to its charter, the Workers’ Party
is supposed to hold its congress every five years. But this is [only the
seventh](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/28/world/asia/north-korea-party-congress.html)
in the party’s 70-year history; the last one was held in 1980, before
Mr. Kim was even born. Kim Il-sung was in charge then.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By the time Kim Jong-il inherited power in the mid-1990s, the North’s
economy had collapsed after decades of mismanagement, the disintegration
of the Soviet bloc and a series of droughts and floods. Famine is
believed to have killed more than two million citizens during the 1990s.
Kim Jong-il’s response to the crisis was to rely on a military of 1.1
million to ensure internal security, and the army replaced the Workers’
Party as the main governing body. Kim Jong-il retained his party titles
as well as military ones, but he never convened a party congress, which
spared him from having to address the subject of the famine.

Though conditions in the North are far less dire now, Kim Jong-un has
done little to improve living standards since taking power a few years
ago. Nevertheless, he [announced in
October](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/31/world/asia/north-korea-to-hold-convention-for-workers-party.html)
that a party congress would be held this month. He has been billing
himself as a leader who can protect the country’s “independence and
dignity” with nuclear weapons, and [three recent (failed)
attempts](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/29/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html)
to launch midrange ballistic missiles were seen as efforts to bolster
his image before the
congress.

## Why does the congress matter?

“With this party congress, Kim Jong-un is restoring the party as the
main governing agency,” said Lim Eul-chul, an analyst at the Institute
for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, South Korea. Under Mr. Kim, the
Workers’ Party has regained powers and perks that it ceded to the army
under his father’s rule, including the lucrative right to export coal.
The new party leadership he puts together — approved by delegates who,
though technically chosen in local elections, are actually handpicked
loyalists — will make the party truly his own. That is why some analysts
have likened the congress to Mr. Kim’s coronation and called it the
official start of the Kim Jong-un era.

## What should we watch for?

In [his New Year’s
speech](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/02/world/asia/kim-jong-un-new-year-speech-north-korea.html)
in January, Mr. Kim said that he would present “an ambitious blueprint”
for the country during the congress, and he vowed to treat improving the
people’s living conditions “as the most important of the numerous state
affairs.” Analysts are watching to see if he introduces economic
reforms.

Mr. Kim has shown some tolerance for private enterprise, giving rise to
a new moneyed class that has thrived on smuggling goods from China. He
has made improvements to his showpiece capital, opening water parks and
building high-rise apartments along the Taedong River, but most of the
country lives in misery, without enough food or electricity. In 2013,
Mr. Kim adopted his so-called byungjin policy, calling for rebuilding
the economy while expanding [a nuclear
arsenal](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-bomb-test.html).
The idea is that nuclear weapons will provide security that allows the
country to focus on economic recovery.

Now that North Korea [claims to be a nuclear
power](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/07/magazine/kim-jong-uns-generational-ambitions.html),
some analysts expect Mr. Kim to shift more attention to the economy. The
United States and South Korea say the byungjin policy will not work, and
they have vowed to deepen [the North’s
isolation](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/06/10/world/asia/north-korea-photos-video.html)
until it abandons its nuclear weapons. But few expect that to happen any
time soon. Indeed, the party may amend its charter to define the North
as a nuclear power, South Korean analysts say. (The North’s Constitution
was amended to that effect in
2012.)

## What else might happen?

It’s hard to say. Kim Il-sung [used past
congresses](https://www.nknews.org/2016/05/what-happens-at-a-north-korean-party-conference-or-congress/)
to help remove rival factions and tighten his family’s grip on power. At
the sixth congress in 1980, Kim Jong-il grabbed crucial party posts that
cemented his status as his father’s heir. (During that meeting, North
Korea presented a vision for a reunified Korean Peninsula: a “Democratic
Confederal Republic of Koryo,” in which the South and North would exist
in peace as autonomous regions respecting each other’s political
systems.)

At that congress, North Korea also mobilized a million people in
Pyongyang for a rally. Nearly 120 countries sent delegates to the
capital that year, including senior officials from the Chinese and
Soviet Communist Parties. This time, as the North’s circle of friendly
nations has shrunk considerably, the congress will be a domestic affair,
though some foreign journalists have been invited to cover it.
