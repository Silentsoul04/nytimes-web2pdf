Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes
after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual
harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who
described inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ailes, two people briefed on
the inquiry said Wednesday.

One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while
unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little
choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailes’s reign as chairman and chief
executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to
the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture.

The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailes’s
exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that
would recognize Mr. Ailes’s service to the company as the founder and
leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a
major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also
include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant.

But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation
was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday
night.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the
discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law
firm [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison](http://www.paulweiss.com/). Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not
respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than
a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly
supported him.

The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for
attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed
that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and
not the broader climate at the network.

But Mr. Ailes’s departure will have much wider implications.

Given Fox News’s place as a central hub for conservative opinion — not
to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president,
Donald J. Trump — the shape of its post-Ailes operation goes beyond
corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for
the national political dialogue.

In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit
against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has
made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in
keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct,
and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The question in the post-Ailes environment is to what extent the
Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailes’s current management team.
That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the
network, which is the outlet of choice for conservative-leaning viewers
seeking an alternative to the mainstream media.

Speculation about who Mr. Ailes’s successor would be transfixed the
media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News
president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years;
one of Mr. Ailes’s current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael
Clemente; the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from
conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief
executive of Newsmax Media Inc.

At least for the day, fears that some of Fox News’s prime-time stars,
like Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise
contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailes’s loss of his chairmanship,
appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn
Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network.
She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr.
Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the
inquiry said Tuesday.

Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr.
Ailes’s chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to
discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with
reporters on condition that they not be named.

In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said
inappropriate comments about a woman’s appearance and her sex life were
frequent in the newsroom.

The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her
suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but
nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said.

As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from
21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events
that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The swift pace of events at Fox News — only two weeks passed between Ms.
Carlson’s filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailes’s
leadership — were especially surprising for a network that has made its
name by embracing “politically incorrect” themes, something in keeping
with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox
patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind
translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a
network trademark.

To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change
the network. And 21st Century Fox’s leadership will have to be mindful
of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has
so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and
ratings success of the network.

Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close
consultation — and perhaps even some deference — to the two sons he is
grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at
least, is known to have different politics from his father.

So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the
network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes.
