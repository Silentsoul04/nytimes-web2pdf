Andrea Tantaros, a former Fox News host, charged in a lawsuit filed
Monday that top executives at the network, including the man who
replaced Roger Ailes, punished her for complaining about sexual
harassment by Mr. Ailes.

The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in
late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract
by writing a book without receiving network approval.

“Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but
behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like
cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,” Ms. Tantaros’s
suit says.

Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation.

Mr. Ailes, the network’s founding chairman and guiding force for two
decades, resigned last month after a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson,
said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. Mr.
Ailes has denied all allegations of
harassment.

In April, the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms. Tantaros had
concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract
dispute; her lawyer, Judd Burstein, said the book dispute was a pretext
that Fox was using to silence her.

During arbitration, Mr. Burstein said, Fox News offered to pay her a sum
“in the seven figures” if she renounced claims against Mr. Ailes and
others at the network, including the host Bill O’Reilly. According to
the lawsuit, Ms. Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome
advances from Mr. O’Reilly, whom she had regarded as a friend and
adviser.

“Ailes did not act alone,” the lawsuit states. “He may have been the
primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior
lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by
threats, humiliation and retaliation.”

Ms. Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of
humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as “sock
puppets” that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity
department.

Ms. Tantaros [joined Fox as a
contributor](http://www.foxnews.com/person/t/andrea-tantaros.html) in
2010, and a year later was named co-host of “The Five,” which aired at 5
p.m. She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives
that she could not wear pants on the air because “Roger wants to see
your
legs.”

The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug. 12, 2014, Mr. Ailes called her
into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have
children. “Ailes then started complaining about marriage in general, and
also made off-color jokes about being married,” the lawsuit states. It
describes Mr. Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences
of 10 Fox News personalities.

He asked Ms. Tantaros to turn around “so I can get a good look at you,”
the lawsuit charges, adding that Ms. Tantaros refused. Soon after, she
was moved from “The Five” to a lower-rated show, “Outnumbered,” that
aired at midday.

Mr. Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and
February 2015, the lawsuit charges, and when she continued to rebuff
him, she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department.
In the February meeting, she said, Mr. Ailes talked about how she would
look in a bikini, and accused her of ending a long-term relationship
because she had been merely using the man. The episode brought her to
tears, the lawsuit states. She said the sole interview arranged by the
publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog
controlled by Fox, who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult
to work with.

In April 2015, the lawsuit states, Ms. Tantaros met with [Bill
Shine](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/16/business/media/bill-shine-steps-out-from-behind-the-scenes-to-lead-fox-news.html?_r=0),
then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr. Ailes. She said that
she told him about the meetings with Mr. Ailes and asked if he had told
the head of publicity for Fox News, Irena Briganti, to go after her. The
lawsuit claims that Mr. Shine “told Tantaros that Briganti is like a
rabid dog on a chain that we can’t control. Sometimes that dog gets off
the chain.” Then, pointing to a picture of Mr. Ailes on a magazine
cover, the lawsuit charges, Mr. Shine told her that “this powerful man
has faith in Irena Briganti” and that Ms. Tantaros “needs to let this
one go.”

Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, has said that Ms. Tantaros never
approached him about Mr. Ailes harassing her.

Mr. Shine was named co-president of Fox News after Mr. Ailes departed.
