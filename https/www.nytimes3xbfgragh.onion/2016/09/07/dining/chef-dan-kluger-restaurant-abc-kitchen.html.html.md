On a muggy summer afternoon at his home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., Dan
Kluger stood watch as stalks of broccoli soaked up smoke on a backyard
grill. Stout of frame and sweaty of brow, he looked more like a workaday
suburban dad, which he is, than a celebrity chef, which he has never
exactly pretended to be.

When the broccoli had acquired stripes of char, Mr. Kluger dressed it
with the uninhibited flavor-layering that was his specialty during his
years at [ABC
Kitchen](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/06/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html)
and [ABC
Cocina](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/07/31/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-abc-cocina-in-manhattan.html).
He built up a dish with torn leaves of basil and mint, curls of citrus
zest, an undercurrent of jalapeño and a bed of mayonnaise infused with
mustard and miso and orange
juice.

## The 2016 Fall Restaurant Preview

A look at the new restaurants, bars and markets opening in New York this
season.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Somehow, Mr. Kluger got all those ingredients to play nice with one
another. The dish, an adapted version of which may appear this fall on
the menu of his forthcoming (and still nameless) restaurant on West
Eighth Street, just north of Washington Square Park, embodied “what I
call the peaks and valleys,” Mr. Kluger said. “One bite is different
than the next.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kluger, 43, has experienced plenty of peaks and valleys since the
moment two summers ago when he decided to break away from the
consistently packed ABC restaurants, where the chef Jean-Georges
Vongerichten had handpicked him to run the kitchens. He wanted to set
out on his own. “I just felt it was time,” Mr. Kluger said, although the
gods seemed determined to make him wait a little longer.

On vacation with his wife in Italy, he got a call from New York with bad
news: Negotiations for a lease on a restaurant space had collapsed at
the last minute. Two years of delays followed. Another space was found,
and construction commenced, but structural problems set progress back
for months. “I don’t ever want to see a contractor again for a long
time,” the chef said.

</div>

For Mr. Kluger, a father of two who had left the security of the
Vongerichten empire for the tingly risk of sink-or-swim independence,
there were moments of waking at 3 a.m. in a panic. “There’s certainly a
discomfort,” he said. “Every screw, nut and bolt at this place I helped
choose, in one way or another. If you don’t like it, it’s essentially my
fault.”

If Mr. Kluger’s history is any guide, the risk should be minimal. His
résumé includes substantial stretches of cooking at Union Square Cafe,
Tabla and the Core Club in Midtown. Over the years, he has picked up
lessons in flavor and hospitality from the likes of Floyd Cardoz, Tom
Colicchio and Danny Meyer. “I’ve worked with some of the best chefs in
the country, and I’ve taken something from all of them,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Vongerichten said Mr. Kluger lives and breathes the farm-to-table
philosophy; the two originally met at the Union Square Greenmarket, when
Mr. Kluger was cooking at the Core Club and Mr. Vongerichten took note
of his dogged devotion to hunting down the choicest ingredients. Mr.
Vongerichten said he understood Mr. Kluger’s itch to run his own show:
“I said: ‘You have to do it. I’ll be very sad to see you leave, but
this is the cycle of life.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Mr. Kluger, the challenge ahead hinges, in part, on whether the ABC
crowd will seek out his cooking a few blocks south — and whether his
approach to flavor will continue to stand out in a city that’s always
chasing the flavor of the month. “I just want to cook good food,” he
said. “I want to cook food that I like. But I feel this pressure of
keeping up with the Joneses.”

This is where the tireless-suburban-dad part could help. On a recent day
during a heat wave, he decided to save a little money by painting the
walls at West Eighth Street — with some help from the general manager
and two chefs, but without air-conditioning. “I was there till 9
o’clock,” he said. “I looked like I’d just come out of a steam room.”

**Dan Kluger restaurant** 21 West Eighth Street (Fifth Avenue), October.
