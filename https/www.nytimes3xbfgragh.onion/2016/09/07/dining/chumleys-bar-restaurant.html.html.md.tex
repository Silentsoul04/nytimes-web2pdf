I was never a beer-drinking regular at Chumley's. But back when I was in
college (and New York's drinking age was a tender 18), I would
occasionally visit that hallowed West Village tavern with a date,
sipping a martini or two before dinner somewhere else downtown (Blue
Mill? Monte's?).

Preview}\label{the-2016-fall-restaurant-preview}}

A look at the new restaurants, bars and markets opening in New York this
season.

I suppose one could have had a burger or a plate of pasta at Chumley's,
but we never bothered, though on one occasion, I wish we had. The result
of too many martinis and no food led me to renounce gin for 30 years.

Now I look forward to returning because the bar, which opened as a
speakeasy in 1922 and remained somewhat hidden --- no sign --- even
after Prohibition, will be serving serious food by a talented chef.
Victoria Blamey, who has cooked at Atera, Corton and Upland, plans a
menu with twists like a burger topped with bone marrow. She's
fine-tuning her upscale fried chicken, beef tartare, and vanilla ice
cream modernized with parsnip purée.

``We know about food,'' said Alessandro Borgognone, who owns the highly
rated

Nakazawa} nearby and is the managing partner at Chumley's, also owned by
Jim Miller. ``That's what we do best.''

The premises
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/08/nyregion/chumleys-is-set-to-come-back-and-it-still-wont-be-easy-to-find.html}{have
recently been rebuilt} after a chimney collapse in 2007 threatened the
building. Mr. Borgognone saw to the redecoration, unfurling yards and
yards of Venetian wallpaper and reinstalling the bar's collection of
vintage photographs. There is still no sign. Tables will be bare, but
waiters will be fitted with white jackets. There will be 16 taps for
beer, wine and cocktails, both classic and creative.

``In the old days, the drinks were very simple,'' Mr. Borgognone said.
``Today they have to be more elaborate.''

\textbf{Chumley's} 86 Bedford Street (Barrow Street), September.
