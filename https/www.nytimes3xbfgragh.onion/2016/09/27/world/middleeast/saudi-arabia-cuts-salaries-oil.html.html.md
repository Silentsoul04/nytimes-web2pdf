RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — [Saudi
Arabia](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/destination/saudi-arabia?8qa)on
Monday announced sudden, drastic cuts to salaries and perks for
government employees as part of the kingdom’s struggle to slash spending
at a time of low oil prices.

The cuts, unveiled in a series of royal decrees and cabinet statements
read aloud on state television, reduced ministers’ salaries by 20
percent, slashed perquisites for members of the consultative assembly
and limited overtime pay and vacation for civil servants.

The drop in world petroleum prices since 2014 has caused major financial
problems for the Saudi government, which gets most of its income from
oil and ran a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion last year.

The new measures came as a shock to many in the country’s bloated public
sector, which for decades has served as a vehicle for the royal family
to distribute its oil wealth in the form of well-paid jobs that often
require little work.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than two-thirds of employed Saudis work for the government.

The government this year started a major project, known as Vision 2030,
aimed at overhauling the economy, reducing the dependence on oil and
creating a more productive native work force.

Yet few of the plan’s measures have been put in place. The government
has raised fuel and water prices and frozen large construction
contracts, leaving some companies unable to pay their workers.

But Monday’s cuts were the first to reduce Saudi paychecks.

Royal decrees cut ministers’ pay by 20 percent and forced them to pay
their own telephone bills for personal lines. They also cut by 15
percent stipends for housing, cars and other perks for members of the
country’s consultative Shura Council, who are appointed by the king.

In a statement, the cabinet limited the bonus that civil servants can
earn for working overtime and capped annual leave at 30 days. It also
put a freeze on new hires for government jobs through the end of the
year.

Saudi troops currently involved in the country’s war in Yemen were
exempted, the statement added.

Besides its budget difficulties, the Saudi economy also faces a
demographic challenge, with an estimated 300,000 new job seekers
entering the market every year. With the government no longer able to
absorb them, many economists doubt that the private sector can either,
threatening to raise unemployment rates.

The kingdom’s current economic woes show how much the situation has
changed for the Saudi monarch, King Salman, since [he ascended to the
throne](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/23/world/middleeast/salman-ascends-throne-to-become-saudi-king.html)
in January of last year. Soon after, he decreed a [cash bonus worth

salary](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/20/world/middleeast/saudi-king-unleashes-a-torrent-as-bonuses-flow-to-the-masses.html)
to all government employees — at an estimated cost of $32 billion.

Some Saudis took to social media on Monday to post photos of his
predecessor, [King
Abdullah](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/23/world/middleeast/king-abdullah-who-nudged-saudi-arabia-forward-dies-at-90.html?action=click&contentCollection=Middle%20East&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article),
and to recall his era of easy wealth.
