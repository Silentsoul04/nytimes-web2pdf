SEOUL, South Korea — The head of the South Korean retail giant Lotte,
one of the country’s largest family-controlled conglomerates, was
indicted on Wednesday on tax evasion, embezzlement and other criminal
charges, the latest high-profile corruption scandal to hit big
businesses here.

Several relatives of the Lotte chairman, Shin Dong-bin, 61, were also
indicted, with the family accused of evading $76 million in taxes over
all and costing the company $165 million through embezzlement and breach
of trust, South Korean prosecutors said in a news release.

Although corruption scandals have regularly rocked family-controlled
conglomerates, or chaebols, in South Korea, it is rare for the entire
chaebol family to be indicted together.

In a typical chaebol conglomerate, the chairman’s family owns a small
portion of the corporate empire but controls it through loyal executives
at subsidiaries that are also interlocked through circular holdings.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the decades, the chaebols have spearheaded South Korea’s
export-driven economy. But their imperious chairmen have in several
instances been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, though seldom
kicked out of management.

Mr. Shin is the most prominent head of a chaebol conglomerate to face
corruption charges since [Lee
Jay-hyun](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/07/03/business/global/south-korean-executives-arrest-seen-as-move-to-tame-conglomerates.html),
chairman of the food and entertainment group CJ, was arrested in 2013.
Mr. Lee was convicted on charges of tax evasion and embezzlement the
next year, but he was released from prison in an annual presidential
pardon in August.

Indicted with Mr. Shin on Wednesday were his brother, Shin Dong-joo, 62;
their 94-year-old father, the Lotte founder, Shin Kyuk-ho; and the
senior Mr. Shin’s common-law wife and a former winner of the Miss Lotte
beauty pageant, Seo Mi-kyung, 57. None of them was arrested.

In July, Mr. Shin’s sister, [Shin Young-ja, 73, was
arrested](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-06/lotte-heiress-arrested-in-south-korea-amid-bribery-investigation)
on charges of collecting $3.1 million through embezzlement and bribery.
And weeks later, as investigators looked into the company, the group’s
vice chairman was [found
dead](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/27/business/international/south-korea-lotte-lee-in-won.html)
hours before he was due to appear before prosecutors. The authorities
considered the death to be a suicide.

Mr. Shin was accused of arranging for his father and other relatives to
receive fat salaries from Lotte subsidiaries although they did not work
there, prosecutors said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He was also accused of arranging for Lotte subsidiaries to buy stocks of
another affiliate at illegally high prices, and giving lucrative
contracts — like running cafeterias in a chain of Lotte movie theaters —
to a company owned by his family members without conducting competitive
bidding.

South Korea has placed restrictions on such deals because chaebol
chairmen were often accused of using them to help their children
accumulate a fortune.

A household name in South Korea, Lotte operates department stores,
duty-free shops, shopping malls, hotels, amusement parks, multiplexes,
burger joints and coffee shops.

It has recently become a symbol of family greed as Mr. Shin and his
elder brother, Dong-joo, accused each other of corruption in a [bitter
public
feud](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/23/business/international/south-korean-chaebol-drama-lotte.html)
over the control of the empire built by their father. The sibling
dispute helped uncover a trove of dirty laundry for prosecutors.
