It rained the first night I went to [Sushi on
Jones](http://sushionjones.com), a tiny open-air sushi bar on a NoHo lot
once home to an auto repair shop. Someone had rigged two umbrellas and a
tarp over the four-seat counter. The rain rustled on either side, like
curtains.

Sushi on Jones is one of five kiosks in the [Bowery Market food
court](http://www.thebowerymarket.com/), which opened in July. Since
that rainy night, an awning has been installed, and David Bouhadana, an
owner and the head chef, promises to put in a heater when blizzards
come.

Still, don’t expect to linger. Sushi on Jones is modeled after the
no-frills sushi counters found in subway stations in Japan. “We allow 30
minutes of dining,” I was informed via text before my arrival. “Clock
starts at reservation time.”

Once there, I spotted a timer, ticking inexorably. Later, I overheard
the host warn two dawdling guests, “The bell has rung.” (They were given
a grace period to finish their last pieces.)

The deadline may seem ruthless. But even customers at the celebrated
[Sukiyabashi Jiro](http://www.sushi-jiro.jp/dining-at-jiro/) in Tokyo
are allotted only a half-hour to down 20 pieces of sushi, a privilege
for which they pay 30,000 yen, around $290.

At Sushi on Jones, the price is $50 for 12 pieces, which gives you two
and a half minutes to contemplate and devour each, a more leisurely pace
than Jiro’s. If the sushi is not quite as transcendent, it may be the
best ever made in the equivalent of a tollbooth.

Mr. Bouhadana uses only seafood that’s fresh year-round, so the menu
reads like a classic-rock playlist. First up is hamachi, reliably
blushing and so buttery it’s almost louche. (It made me miss kanpachi,
its leaner cousin, brighter and springier in texture.)

A few pieces (snow crab, botan shrimp) feel like placeholders. But there
are always two representatives of the salmon family — king and arctic
char, gradations of creaminess — and two types of tuna, perhaps meaty
albacore followed by bluefin cut from along the spine, or toro, sweet
and unresisting, from the
belly.

All are presented with neither theatrics nor reverence. Reggae lilts
from the speakers. One night, I was served tea in a 7-Eleven cup with a
Sushi on Jones sticker slapped over it, showing a fish playing the
saxophone.

The rotating chefs — Kenny Jiang, Weiqi Lin and Tim Lin (not related) —
keep the ratio of fish to rice at the midpoint between jewel-like and
unwieldy. Anointments are mostly familiar and restrained: daub of yuzu,
gloss of ponzu, pulped daikon, hyphen of ginger. A surprise is scallop
with black salt, the hue from activated charcoal, with its distant
tremor of smoke.

The climax of the meal is washugyu, a crossbreed of wagyu and Black
Angus from the Japanese butcher shop across the street, a long tongue of
it torched, with glimmers of truffle salt. Then comes uni, from Santa
Barbara, Calif., when Mr. Bouhadana can get it, tasting like the ocean
distilled into ice cream, and, in a crazed finale, uni over wagyu —
layers of cool and warm, brine and earth.

It’s a pity that the omakase ends with unagi in a sauce as cloying and
perfunctory as at any middling sushi bar across America. Better to add
an optional $12 hand roll, which furls wagyu and uni into a tighter
embrace.

Mr. Bouhadana, 30, was born in France to a Moroccan Jewish father and a
French Catholic mother who eventually settled in Florida, lured by the
vision of “Miami Vice.” He started training at 18 at a sushi bar in Boca
Raton, plying customers with sake bombs; apprenticed in Japan; put in
time at Morimoto, Hatsuhana and 15 East; and briefly ran the kitchens at
Sushi Uo and Sushi Dojo.

This winter, he and a partner, Derek Feldman, plan to open Sushi
Bouhadana on the Lower East Side. It will have a roof.

Sushi on Jones is not the only place in town to find a reasonably priced
sushi omakase. Elsewhere, for maybe $15 more, you get such perks as a
moment to breathe and shelter from the storm.

But the precariousness is part of the charm. Once, a customer, tilting
on her stool, dropped a piece of uni on the sidewalk. The sushi chef,
unbidden, silently handed her a replacement.

Another night, three diners sat squeezed together at the smaller window
facing Great Jones Street. “I can see the sunset,” one said. To the west
hung a few red wisps, the sky starting to burn itself down.
