MEXICO CITY — For Mexico, [the
nightmare](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/23/world/americas/donald-trump-mexico.html "Times article.")
came true.

Perhaps no country aside from the United States itself had as much at
stake in the American presidential election as Mexico did.

Then, early on Wednesday, it watched as Donald J. Trump became the next
American president: a man whose [central campaign
promises](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html)
included building a wall between the two countries, upending decades-old
trade deals and deporting millions of Mexican immigrants.

The peso suffered its largest drop in nearly 20 years, and for many, the
election set back years of carefully cultivated [efforts to improve the
cross-border
relationship](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/01/world/americas/trump-mexico-pena-nieto-reaction.html),
one that has been historically fraught. The outcome promises a turbulent
financial future for Mexico, which relies on America as an economic
lifeline, both in terms of trade and remittances.

“It’s an unmitigated disaster,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign
minister of Mexico and a professor of politics and Latin American
studies at New York University. “There are very few tools to fix the
relationship.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For months, Mexico watched the campaign with a [mix of fear and
bemusement](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html),
forced to stare down a raw undercurrent of American vitriol unleashed by
Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Now, the election seems a harbinger of hard days
to come for the country, its economy, migration and even its state of
mind.

“This election reminded us of the bad image Mexico has in the U.S.,”
said Jesús Silva-Herzog, a columnist and professor at the Monterrey
Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Mexico. “It has also
served as a mirror in which we have painfully seen our reflection.”

“We will not have to wait for the presidential baton to be passed to
feel the devastating effects, not only in economic terms, but also the
existential crisis it will cause,” he added.

Mr. Trump’s vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement
could greatly affect Canada, too. As a result of the pact, much of
Canada’s industry produces for export.

“We’re going to get sideswiped by some of this stuff,” said Mark Warner,
a trade lawyer in Toronto. In particular, he said, he expects Mr. Trump
to promote “Buy America” clauses in government infrastructure projects
that would shut out Canadian companies — a violation of Nafta.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But for Canada and Mexico, the election was a study in contrasts.
Canadians reacted to Mr. Trump’s election with concern, even anxiety,
but also a whiff of pride.

Move-to-Canada memes started spreading as Mr. Trump looked increasingly
likely to win Florida: “Election Night Starter Kit,” read a post on
Instagram, above photos of United States passports and an Air Canada
plane. Another post depicted a machine-gun-toting man riding a moose,
with the words “Canadian Border Patrol Watching for Illegal Americans.”

Later on Tuesday night, [the website](http://www.cic.gc.ca/) of Canada’s
immigration department crashed, fueling speculation that it had been
overloaded by Americans [looking for a new
country](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/10/us/-canada-immigration.html?src=twr)
to call home. Lisa Filipps, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and
Immigration Canada, said the site had failed “as a result of a
significant increase in the volume of traffic.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Mexico City, the vote felt like something else entirely: a validation
of Mr. Trump’s hostile remarks about Mexican immigrants, and a broad
statement of disrespect.

“Imagine what the U.S. will look like from now,” said Angelina González,
who sells cosmetics in Mexico City. “A big wave of discrimination is
coming.”

Among journalists from [Horizontal](http://horizontal.mx/), a cultural
and political online magazine in Mexico City, spirits were low, and
confusion reigned. Antonio Martínez Velázquez, a co-founder, reflected
on the outcome with shock and a deep sense of uncertainty.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This moment forces the world, including Mexico, to rethink its
relationship with the U.S.,” he said. “This moment, which really is the
end of an era, the end of the U.S. hegemony, is also the beginning of a
new chapter for us in Mexico.”

Mr. Trump has been among the most powerful forces at play in Mexico this
year, infuriating citizens of all stripes and even government officials
with his anti-Mexican campaign. Anger surged when the Mexican president,
Enrique Peña Nieto, [invited Mr. Trump to visit
Mexico](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/01/world/americas/trump-mexico-pena-nieto-reaction.html),
an offer the candidate accepted.

Weeks of [vitriol and betrayal
ensued](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/08/world/americas/mexico-finance-minister-luis-videgaray-resigns.html),
with many Mexicans denouncing Mr. Peña Nieto’s invitation as a needless
capitulation from the leader of an insulted nation.

Now, it turns out Mr. Peña Nieto was right: Mr. Trump was not simply a
candidate who could be ignored.

In a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday morning, Mr. Peña Nieto
congratulated “the people of the United States for their electoral
process” and reiterated his willingness to work with Mr. Trump “in favor
of the bilateral relationship.”

“Mexico and the U.S.A. are friends, partners and allies, who must
continue collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North
America,” he wrote. “I trust that Mexico and the United States will
continue to strengthen their bonds of cooperation and mutual respect.”

Mr. Trump has promised to build a wall between the two countries and
make Mexico pay for it. But Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu
rejected that notion in a television interview on Wednesday morning.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Paying for a wall is out of our vision,” she said. “The vision that we
have is a vision of integration, of how Mexico and the United States
working together are more competitive.”

In practical terms, most experts suspect, the election will reverberate
most profoundly through the economy.

The United States and Mexico are deeply integrated in matters of
economics, demographics, culture and security, stitched together by the
movement of people, goods and money across a 2,000-mile border.

As one goes, so goes the other. Mexico is America’s third-largest
trading partner, after Canada and China, with about $531 billion in
two-way trade in
2015.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The countries are interdependent, with American goods and parts shipped
to Mexican factories whose products are shipped back into the United
States, and vice versa. Millions of American jobs are directly tied to
trade with Mexico.

Mr. Trump argued that Mexico was the outsize beneficiary of Nafta, while
American workers suffered job losses and stagnant wages, an argument
that played well with segments of the American electorate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While Mexico is the second-largest destination for American goods,
giving it some leverage in responding to actions taken by Mr. Trump, the
countries have “a very asymmetrical relationship,” Mr. Castañeda said,
meaning that in the end, there is little Mexico can do to apply
pressure.

Many Mexicans may lose their jobs. All will suffer from a rapid
depreciation of the peso. But an economic crisis could also turn into a
migration crisis — exactly what Mr. Trump has campaigned for months to
halt.

About 35 million Mexican citizens and Mexican-Americans live in the
United States, and the vast majority are either American citizens or
legal residents.

Illegal immigration from Mexico has fallen, and the Pew Research Center
estimates that more Mexicans are returning to Mexico than are migrating
to the United States. But a sudden economic shock could send Mexicans
once more to the United States to seek work.

“You generate an economic crisis in Mexico, and all of those gains we
have seen in terms of zero migration go down the tubes,” said Agustín
Barrios Gómez, a former congressman in Mexico.

Not everyone felt entirely dour about the election results. If there was
a silver lining, some said it was that the threat from the outside would
force Mexicans to come together.

“I believe having a strong, negative factor right across the border will
bring the Mexicans together to work harder, which will be a positive
effect,” said Arturo Delgado, the retired director of a technical
school.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some were confident that Mr. Trump’s hostile talk as a candidate would
ebb when he took office.

“I don’t see a problem with trade or immigration,” said Raymundo Riva
Palacio, a political analyst and columnist.

On trade, Mr. Riva Palacio argued that business groups and governors who
supported Mr. Trump, including Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, would impress
upon him the importance of remaining in Nafta.

As for the wall Mr. Trump has vowed to build, “it will be very difficult
for Donald Trump to obtain the budget,” he said.

He argued that, ultimately, economics would temper Mr. Trump’s policies
toward Mexico. But he added that with the House of Representatives and
the Senate [remaining under Republican
control](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/09/us/politics/republican-senate.html?action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=64523551&pgtype=article),
Mr. Trump’s victory signaled an ideological realignment that had not
occurred in the United States since the election of President Ronald
Reagan.

“The problem isn’t for Mexico,” Mr. Riva Palacio said. “It’s for the
United States.”
