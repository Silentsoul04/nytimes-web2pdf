SEOUL, South Korea — President Park Geun-hye acted as a criminal
accomplice for her longtime friend in extorting tens of millions of
dollars from businesses, prosecutors said on Sunday, dealing another
blow to the South Korean leader, who faced a nationwide call to step
down.

Under the country’s Constitution, prosecutors cannot indict the
president on criminal charges until after she leaves office. But their
findings further weakened Ms. Park’s authority, and prompted opposition
leaders, as well as some members of Ms. Park’s governing party, to
demand on Sunday that Parliament start a legal process to impeach her.
On Saturday, huge crowds protested in Seoul and other major cities for
the fourth straight weekend, demanding that she resign or face
impeachment.

Prosecutors identified Ms. Park as an accomplice and a “criminal
suspect” on Sunday while indicting her friend, Choi Soon-sil, on
criminal charges including extortion and abuse of official power.

A former presidential aide to Ms. Park was also indicted on Sunday, on
the same charges, as prosecutors accused him of helping Ms. Choi with
the extortion. Another former presidential aide was indicted on charges
of leaking confidential government documents to Ms. Choi. Although she
had no experience in government or policy making, Ms. Choi was accused
of meddling in a wide range of state affairs, like editing Ms. Park’s
speeches and helping her appoint key officials.

“We have determined that President Park was an accomplice in many of the
criminal acts” of Ms. Choi and the two former aides, Lee Yeong-ryeol, a
senior prosecutor, said during a nationally televised news briefing.

Mr. Lee said prosecutors had based their determination partly on
information they collected from the two former aides’ notebooks, diaries
and cellphones, which contained instructions from Ms. Park.

Ms. Park is the first sitting president of South Korea to be accused by
prosecutors of a criminal conspiracy.

Later Sunday, her office accused prosecutors of losing their political
neutrality.

“The investigators’ announcement today was completely untrue,” said Jung
Youn-kok, Ms. Park’s spokesman. “It was nothing but a house of cards
that ignored objective evidence.”

Ms. Choi, the president’s friend, was accused of forcing Samsung,
Hyundai and 51 other major businesses to donate a total of $65 million
to two foundations she controlled. The businesses feared tax inquiries
and other governmental retaliation if they did not donate, Mr. Lee said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Choi was also accused of forcing businesses to give contracts
amounting to $12 million to companies controlled by her or her
associates. They also tried in vain to wrest control of a lucrative
public relations agency through blackmailing, Mr. Lee said. And they
forced Lotte, a South Korean conglomerate, to donate $5.9 million for
sports facilities under Ms. Choi’s control, he said. (The money was
later returned.)

Ms. Choi is a daughter of a religious figure who befriended Ms. Park in
the 1970s, when Ms. Park’s father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee,
was in power. Ms. Choi’s father, Choi Tae-min, was accused of using his
influence with Ms. Park to collect bribes from businesses.

South Koreans have expressed outrage that Ms. Park has maintained
questionable links to the Choi family for 40 years.

A key question that was not addressed by prosecutors on Sunday was
whether Ms. Park and her office had tried to cover up the scandal.
Officials who tried to raise alarms have been demoted, fired and even
imprisoned.

According to recent opinion polls, Ms. Park has become the least popular
leader since South Korea moved toward democracy in the late 1980s. All
the major South Korean daily newspapers, as well as all opposition
parties and even some members of Ms. Park’s party, have called on her to
resign.

But Ms. Park has refused to do so. Instead, she has reasserted her
presidential role in the past week by appointing new ambassadors and
senior government officials. She also instructed her Justice Ministry to
investigate a separate corruption scandal involving a real estate
developer.

Ms. Park has refused to face questioning by prosecutors, although they
repeatedly said they needed to interrogate her in person. Her lawyer,
Yoo Yeong-ha, has said Ms. Park needs more time to prepare. She also
preferred to be questioned in writing, he said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Sunday, Ms. Park’s lawyer said that she would not allow prosecutors
to question her. Ms. Park’s office also indicated that she would rather
wait to see if the National Assembly impeached her.

The embattled loyalists of Ms. Park have begun fighting back in the past
week, accusing the protesters of trying her in a “people’s court.” A
former prime minister for Ms. Park accused her enemies of a “witch
hunt.” On Saturday, conservatives held a rally in support of Ms. Park,
although it was much smaller than the antigovernment protests.

Ms. Park’s attitude sets the stage for a prolonged political drama.

Her five-year term is scheduled to end in February 2018. But impeaching
Ms. Park could be a political risk for the opposition parties. They need
approval from two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly to pass an
impeachment bill. Ms. Park’s party controls 129 seats, enough to block
the bill, although some of its members said they would support her
impeachment. By law, the parliamentary impeachment must also be approved
by two-thirds of the nine-judge Constitutional Court.

The process would take months and could prove divisive.

Prosecutors said they would continue to investigate the scandal. The
National Assembly has passed a bill to begin a separate investigation
this month by an independent counsel. Ms. Park’s office said she would
cooperate with the counsel.
