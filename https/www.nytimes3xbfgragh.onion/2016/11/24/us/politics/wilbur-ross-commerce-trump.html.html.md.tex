WASHINGTON --- President-elect Donald J. Trump is expected to select as
commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor who became known
as the ``king of bankruptcy'' for buying, restructuring and selling off
steel makers and other fading industrial companies, officials on the
transition team said on Thursday.

After choosing national security hard-liners for some of his earliest
appointments, Mr. Trump is now turning to a group of ultrawealthy
conservatives to help steer administration policy.

In addition to Mr. Ross, a generous contributor to his campaign, Mr.
Trump is likely to choose Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor who is
an owner of the Chicago Cubs and whose father founded TD Ameritrade, to
be the deputy commerce secretary, the officials said. And on Wednesday,
Mr. Trump said he would name

DeVos}, a school choice activist and Republican fund-raiser, as his
education secretary.

\subsection{Donald Trump's Cabinet Is Complete. Here's the Full
List.}\label{donald-trumps-cabinet-is-complete-heres-the-full-list}}

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

Mr. Ross, 78, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump's campaign whose fortune
is estimated by Forbes to be \$2.9 billion, is aligned with Mr. Trump on
trade. He says the United States must free itself from the ``bondage''
of ``bad trade agreements,'' and he has advocated threats of steep
tariffs on Chinese goods. Mr. Ross, the chairman of the private equity
firm WL Ross \& Company, has also pressed for cutting the corporate tax
rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and reducing taxes and regulations
on energy companies.

During the general election, he hosted at least one fund-raiser for Mr.
Trump at his home in the Hamptons. There, Mr. Trump, who at the time was
pondering his choice for a running mate, turned his deliberations into a
party game, soliciting opinions from the donors in attendance.

Mr. Ross also owns a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, Fla., down the
road from
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/23/us/politics/trumps-palm-beach-neighbors-shrug-and-say-theyve-seen-it-before.html}{Mar-a-Lago},
Mr. Trump's club, which is expected to be his White House getaway, and
where the president-elect was spending Thanksgiving with his family.

If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Ross would succeed another wealthy
campaign donor at the helm of an agency charged with promoting American
commercial interests and trade around the world.
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/09/business/penny-pritzker-tackles-tough-assignments-as-commerce-secretary.html}{Penny
Pritzker}, President Obama's commerce secretary, is a billionaire
entrepreneur who was an early financial backer of Mr. Obama and is an
heiress to the Hyatt Hotels fortune.

Unlike Mr. Trump and Mr. Ross, Ms. Pritzker has been a leading proponent
of forging new free-trade agreements. One of her top priorities was the
completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping 12-nation accord
that Mr. Trump has promised to scrap.
