SEOUL, South Korea — Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans filled
central Seoul on Saturday to demand President Park Geun-hye’s
resignation, in what appeared to be the largest turnout yet in a series
of weekly protests against the embattled leader.

Despite cold weather and the first snow of the season, a crowd that
organizers estimated at 1.5 million gathered to denounce Ms. Park, who
has been accused by prosecutors of helping a friend commit extortion and
is facing the possibility of impeachment within weeks.

The police estimate of the turnout was much lower, at 260,000, but the
crowd seemed larger than at an [enormous rally in the
capital](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/13/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html)
two weeks earlier. It was the fifth consecutive Saturday marked by a
large protest against the president.

The demonstrations have been peaceful and almost festive. Street vendors
sold candles, mattresses and hot snacks on Saturday, and a few roadside
shops gave protesters free coffee. Buddhist monks beat wooden gongs as
they marched. Mothers showed up with children, or with pet dogs wrapped
in padded vests, and young couples bundled in winter coats sang along as
loudspeakers blared catchy tunes calling for Ms. Park’s ouster.

One such song quoted from South Korea’s Constitution:[“The Republic of
Korea shall be a democratic
republic.”](http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_117333.pdf "Link")

Prosecutors have [identified Ms. Park as a criminal
accomplice](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/20/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea-extortion-accomplice-prosecutors.html)
in the case of Choi Soon-sil, an old friend who has been charged with
using her influence to coerce businesses into donating large sums to
foundations that Ms. Choi controls. In news reports, Ms. Park has also
been accused of letting Ms. Choi [wield undue influence in state
affairs](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/28/world/asia/south-korea-choi-soon-sil.html).

Ms. Park, who cannot be prosecuted while in office, has
[apologized](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/04/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-investigation.html)
twice to the public over the scandal but has refused to resign as
opposition lawmakers, major newspapers and some members of her own party
have demanded.

Opposition parties hope to impeach her with the support of some
lawmakers from her party. The National Assembly is expected to vote on
an impeachment bill by Dec. 9.

No South Korean president has ever been removed from office through
impeachment.

On Saturday, some protesters chanted, “Imprison Park Geun-hye\!” as they
marched toward the presidential Blue House. “Come out and surrender\!”
they shouted.

Hundreds of buses and thousands of police officers had been deployed to
form barriers around the complex. One group of demonstrators was stopped
just 200 yards from the presidential compound.

Protesters holding candles marched through central Seoul late into the
night. Rock musicians performed on the main thoroughfare, replacing the
lyrics of popular songs with phrases that criticized and ridiculed Ms.
Park. Some people carried doctored images of Ms. Park in a prison
uniform and handcuffed.

On smaller streets, citizens spoke to the crowd from the back of trucks.
One teenage girl railed tearfully against Ms. Park for failing to
respond effectively to the [Sewol ferry disaster in
2014](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/04/12/world/asia/12ferry-timeline.html?_r=0#/#time367_10822 "Times article"),
which left more than 300 people dead, most of them teenagers.

She also criticized the government-written history textbooks that Ms.
Park’s administration has said it plans to issue for use in all middle
and high schools starting next year.

Protesters accused Ms. Park of trying to take South Korea back to the
time when it was ruled by military dictators, including her father, Park
Chung-hee, and the practice of shaking down businesses was commonplace.

At one point, at the suggestion of organizers, the protesters all blew
out their candles to symbolize the darkness into which, they said, Ms.
Park has led the country.

Many protesters said they wanted Ms. Park to be impeached, providing a
dramatic end to her tenure.

“What we have seen happening at the Blue House is just like a soap
opera,” said Kim Yong-jin, a high school senior. “We just hope that it
ends like a soap opera — with poetic justice.”
