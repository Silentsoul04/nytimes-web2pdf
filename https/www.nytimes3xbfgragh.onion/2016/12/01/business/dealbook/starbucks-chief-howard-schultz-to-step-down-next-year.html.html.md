SEATTLE — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, said on
Thursday he would step down as chief executive next year, handing over
to his personally selected successor the management of the company he
built into the world’s largest coffee business, with over 25,000 stores
in 75 countries.

Mr. Schultz, one of the most visible chief executives in the country,
has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues
like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and
student debt. The succession will take place on April 3, and he will
remain at the company as executive chairman, focusing on the company’s
involvement in social causes and on growing Starbucks Reserve, the
company’s new superpremium brand and chain of high-end stores.

Mr. Schultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson,
the company’s current president and a longtime Starbucks board member.

“This is a big day for me,” Mr. Schultz said in an interview. “I love
the company as much as I love my family.” But he said it was the right
time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being “better
equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Mr.
Johnson’s operational talents, and saying that he wanted to “relinquish
the role and responsibility to the right person.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Schultz, who could be considered the Steve Jobs of coffee, grew up
poor in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. He had a coffee epiphany while
paying a client call on a coffee bean store in Seattle in 1981, and then
went to work at the company the next year. In 1983, he visited Italy and
was impressed not only by the ubiquity of coffee bars, but also their
central role as community gathering spots — a role he refers to as “the
third place” in society.

Today, Starbucks is adding about 2,000 new stores a year worldwide. And
its legacy under Mr. Schultz’s leadership includes many pioneering
social and philanthropic programs: In 1988, the company introduced full
health benefits for full- and part-time employees and their domestic
partners; in 1991 it was the first privately owned American company to
include part-time workers in its stock-option program; and so on, with
efforts that have included the “ethical sourcing” of ingredients, a
college degree program for baristas, and cups that use recycled
materials.

“I wanted to build the company my father never got to work for,” he
said.

At an all-hands employee meeting at the company’s headquarters on
Thursday, Mr. Schultz was greeted with tears and a standing ovation.
“For me, perhaps there are other things that are part of my destiny,”
he told them.

The move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Mr.
Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter
politics. An outspoken Democrat, Mr. Schultz has spent an increasing
amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the
need to fix the “dysfunction in Washington.” He has a close relationship
with President Obama and had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton.

The company’s political positions have sometimes created a backlash.
During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump and his supporters
waged war against Starbucks: In 2015, after the company redesigned its
holiday cups to remove Christmas imagery, Mr. Trump suggested a boycott.
This year, his supporters staged a [protest called
\#TrumpCup](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/11/21/a-starbucks-barista-refused-to-write-trump-on-a-cup-how-his-supporters-are-striking-back/?utm_term=.a361e7a20659)
in which they went to Starbucks and ordered drinks under the name Trump
to get the baristas to call the name out loud.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, Mr. Schultz said he intends for Starbucks to “maintain our moral
courage.” And he defended efforts like the company’s “Race Together”
campaign to spur a conversation about race relations, saying that it
“was not a failure. I’d do it again.” He said such campaigns are
deeply embedded in the company’s brand of “challenging the status quo
about the role of a public company.” He is excited by the question,
“Since we have stores in every community in America, how can we use
our scale for good?”

Although the change may come as a surprise to the public and to some
Starbucks employees, the company has been sending signals to Wall Street
for the last year about its intentions to carry out a succession plan,
announcing a reorganization in the summer that gave Mr. Johnson
oversight of the day-to-day operations.

Mr. Johnson, 56, spent his career in technology as a lieutenant of
Steven A. Ballmer, former chief of Microsoft, and later as chief
executive of Juniper Networks, before being recruited out of retirement
by Mr. Schultz in 2015 to become president and chief operating officer
of Starbucks.

Mr. Johnson, a soft-spoken operator known for his focus on building
Starbucks’ mobile payments systems and executing the company’s global
strategy, has been on a listening tour with employees over the last
year. Conversations with store managers who told intimate stories about
their passion and relationship with the company have been known to bring
Mr. Johnson to tears.

The succession plan is the second time Mr. Schultz has sought to step
back from overseeing the company. He became the company’s chairman in
2000 but returned as chief executive in 2008 after firing the installed
chief, James Donald, as sales faltered. Upon returning to Starbucks as
chief executive, Mr. Schultz increased the company’s market value to $84
billion from $15 billion.

In an interview on Thursday in a tasting room at Starbucks flagship
Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, a Willy Wonka-like
15,000-square-foot premium coffee emporium that the company hopes to
open in large cities around the world, Mr. Schultz was animated and
emotional about his decision.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Referring to his previous effort to step back, Mr. Schultz said: “I was
not as emotionally prepared for the moment as I am now. I don’t think I
had the conviction — I was still meddling.”

“I got succession wrong the first time,” he added. Of Mr. Johnson, he
said, “I’m not going to be hovering and shadowing him.”

Still, Mr. Schultz says he intends to remain a visible and active
presence at the company — his office is connected to Mr. Johnson’s — as
he works to introduce the company’s premium coffee brand with a small
team that he described as the equivalent of a start-up.

The project calls for the opening of several large emporium stores — one
is being built in Manhattan and another in Shanghai — each year for the
next several years, as well more than 1,000 smaller premium stores and
premium “bars” in thousands of current Starbucks stores. “Building a new
brand is not unlike what Ralph Lauren did with Purple label,” Mr.
Schultz said.

Asked about speculation that he might be laying the groundwork to run
for president, Mr. Schultz said, “I’m all in on all things Starbucks and
have no plans to run for public office.” Might he change his mind in the
future? “That’s the way I feel today,” he said.

Mr. Johnson said that his decision to work at Starbucks came after he
had rethought his career, disclosing for the first time that he had a
brush with skin cancer that had led him to retire from Juniper. “It made
me think,” he said. “I only want to spend time on things on which I am
able to give something to people I love.” He called his job at Starbucks
a “gift” and acknowledged that he was somewhat nervous about his new
role.

“Can I do this?” he said he asked himself. “I’m not going to try to be
Howard. We are two different people.”
