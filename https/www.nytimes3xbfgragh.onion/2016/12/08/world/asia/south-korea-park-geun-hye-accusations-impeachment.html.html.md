SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s National Assembly voted Friday on a
motion to
[impeach](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
President Park Geun-hye, whose government has been [consumed by a
corruption
scandal](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea-april.html).
The motion accuses her of “extensive and serious violations of the
Constitution and the law.” Prosecutors have also accused her of crimes
in connection with the scandal, though as president she cannot be
indicted.

Here are the accusations against Ms. Park, which she has dismissed,
through her spokesman and her lawyer, as a “house of cards”:

**Extortion and abuse of power**

In their indictment of Ms. Park’s [longtime friend Choi
Soon-sil](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/01/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-choi-soon-sil.html),
which named Ms. Park as an accomplice, prosecutors made the following
accusations:

**•** In 2014, Ms. Park told an aide, Ahn Chong-bum, to help a company
run by one of Ms. Choi’s associates secure a contract with Hyundai
Motor. Mr. Ahn relayed the request to Hyundai, and the company won an
$860,000 contract. Ms. Choi received kickbacks worth $44,000, including
a Chanel handbag, from her associate.

**•** In a series of meetings in July 2015, Ms. Park asked the chairmen
of eight large companies to contribute to two new foundations, meant to
promote South Korean culture and sports. Ms. Park asked Ms. Choi to
build and run them. With the help of presidential aides, Ms. Choi
pressured the companies into donating the equivalent of $69 million to
the foundations.

**•** In January of this year, Ms. Choi started a sports management
company called the Blue K. With the backing of Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn, she
coerced the conglomerate Lotte into donating $6 million for a sports
complex that the company hoped to build and manage. In February, Ms.
Park asked the steel maker Posco to help Ms. Choi’s company; under
pressure from Mr. Ahn, Posco agreed to create a fencing team so that the
Blue K could manage it.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**•** In February, again under Ms. Park’s orders, Mr. Ahn asked Hyundai
and KT, a telecommunications firm, to hire Ms. Choi’s advertising
agency. Both complied, and the agency made $1.2 million from the
contracts.

Prosecutors say these companies feared tax investigations or other forms
of official retaliation if they refused the requests. At a recent
hearing in the National Assembly, the companies’ chairmen confirmed that
the requests had come directly from Ms. Park or her aides and said it
would have been difficult to say no.

Ms. Park acknowledges that she met with the tycoons but denies that
coercion occurred. She has said that she helped create the foundations
for the public good and that she never personally profited from them.
Ms. Choi has also denied the accusations against her.

**Leaking confidential government documents**

Prosecutors say Ms. Park told another aide, Chung Ho-sung, to give 180
sets of government documents, 47 of them classified, to Ms. Choi between
January 2013 and April of this year. They contained, among other things,
information about who would be appointed to senior government jobs,
including national intelligence director. Ms. Choi held no official post
and had no security clearance.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Violating the Constitution**

In their motion to impeach Ms. Park, opposition parties cite the
accusations listed above, calling them violations of her constitutional
obligations to defend democracy and the market economy. In addition,
they say she violated the Constitution in the following ways:

**•** By conspiring to install associates of Ms. Choi in her government,
then letting Ms. Choi use those people to wield influence and win
lucrative contracts. The opposition also says Ms. Park caused people in
the government to be demoted or fired for trying to draw attention to
Ms. Choi’s activities.

**•** By forcing a newspaper to fire its president in 2014 after it
published articles about Ms. Choi’s purported influence. That undermined
the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, the opposition
says.

**•** By failing to provide a full account of her activities on April
16, 2014, the day more than [300 people were killed when a ferry
sank](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/12/world/asia/legacy-of-south-korea-sewol-ferry-sinking.html)
in South Korean waters. Ms. Park did not emerge from her residence for
several hours that day, and the opposition says the public has a
constitutional right to know what she was doing. This accusation has
little if anything to do with the others, but Ms. Park’s critics have
long held her government responsible for the sinking, one of the
country’s worst peacetime disasters.

**Bribery**

The impeachment motion also accuses Ms. Park of soliciting bribes,
arguing that the donations to Ms. Choi’s foundations were made with the
expectation of favors from the government. The companies’ chairmen have
denied this.
