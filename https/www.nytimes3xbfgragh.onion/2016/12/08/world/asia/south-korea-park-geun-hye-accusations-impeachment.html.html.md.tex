SEOUL, South Korea --- South Korea's National Assembly voted Friday on a
motion to
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html}{impeach}
President Park Geun-hye, whose government has been
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea-april.html}{consumed
by a corruption scandal}. The motion accuses her of ``extensive and
serious violations of the Constitution and the law.'' Prosecutors have
also accused her of crimes in connection with the scandal, though as
president she cannot be indicted.

Here are the accusations against Ms. Park, which she has dismissed,
through her spokesman and her lawyer, as a ``house of cards'':

\textbf{Extortion and abuse of power}

In their indictment of Ms. Park's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/01/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-choi-soon-sil.html}{longtime
friend Choi Soon-sil}, which named Ms. Park as an accomplice,
prosecutors made the following accusations:

\textbf{•} In 2014, Ms. Park told an aide, Ahn Chong-bum, to help a
company run by one of Ms. Choi's associates secure a contract with
Hyundai Motor. Mr. Ahn relayed the request to Hyundai, and the company
won an \$860,000 contract. Ms. Choi received kickbacks worth \$44,000,
including a Chanel handbag, from her associate.

\textbf{•} In a series of meetings in July 2015, Ms. Park asked the
chairmen of eight large companies to contribute to two new foundations,
meant to promote South Korean culture and sports. Ms. Park asked Ms.
Choi to build and run them. With the help of presidential aides, Ms.
Choi pressured the companies into donating the equivalent of \$69
million to the foundations.

\textbf{•} In January of this year, Ms. Choi started a sports management
company called the Blue K. With the backing of Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn, she
coerced the conglomerate Lotte into donating \$6 million for a sports
complex that the company hoped to build and manage. In February, Ms.
Park asked the steel maker Posco to help Ms. Choi's company; under
pressure from Mr. Ahn, Posco agreed to create a fencing team so that the
Blue K could manage it.

\textbf{•} In February, again under Ms. Park's orders, Mr. Ahn asked
Hyundai and KT, a telecommunications firm, to hire Ms. Choi's
advertising agency. Both complied, and the agency made \$1.2 million
from the contracts.

Prosecutors say these companies feared tax investigations or other forms
of official retaliation if they refused the requests. At a recent
hearing in the National Assembly, the companies' chairmen confirmed that
the requests had come directly from Ms. Park or her aides and said it
would have been difficult to say no.

Ms. Park acknowledges that she met with the tycoons but denies that
coercion occurred. She has said that she helped create the foundations
for the public good and that she never personally profited from them.
Ms. Choi has also denied the accusations against her.

\textbf{Leaking confidential government documents}

Prosecutors say Ms. Park told another aide, Chung Ho-sung, to give 180
sets of government documents, 47 of them classified, to Ms. Choi between
January 2013 and April of this year. They contained, among other things,
information about who would be appointed to senior government jobs,
including national intelligence director. Ms. Choi held no official post
and had no security clearance.

\textbf{Violating the Constitution}

In their motion to impeach Ms. Park, opposition parties cite the
accusations listed above, calling them violations of her constitutional
obligations to defend democracy and the market economy. In addition,
they say she violated the Constitution in the following ways:

\textbf{•} By conspiring to install associates of Ms. Choi in her
government, then letting Ms. Choi use those people to wield influence
and win lucrative contracts. The opposition also says Ms. Park caused
people in the government to be demoted or fired for trying to draw
attention to Ms. Choi's activities.

\textbf{•} By forcing a newspaper to fire its president in 2014 after it
published articles about Ms. Choi's purported influence. That undermined
the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, the opposition
says.

\textbf{•} By failing to provide a full account of her activities on
April 16, 2014, the day more than
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/12/world/asia/legacy-of-south-korea-sewol-ferry-sinking.html}{300
people were killed when a ferry sank} in South Korean waters. Ms. Park
did not emerge from her residence for several hours that day, and the
opposition says the public has a constitutional right to know what she
was doing. This accusation has little if anything to do with the others,
but Ms. Park's critics have long held her government responsible for the
sinking, one of the country's worst peacetime disasters.

\textbf{Bribery}

The impeachment motion also accuses Ms. Park of soliciting bribes,
arguing that the donations to Ms. Choi's foundations were made with the
expectation of favors from the government. The companies' chairmen have
denied this.
