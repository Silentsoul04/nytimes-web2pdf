BEIRUT, Lebanon — Hundreds of Syrian men who escaped [rebel-held areas
of eastern
Aleppo](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/08/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-russia-lavrov-assad.html?ref=world)
to reach government-controlled parts of the city are missing, United
Nations officials said on Friday, adding that they had received reports
of government reprisals, including numerous arrests and several cases of
summary killings of suspected supporters of the opposition.

At the same time, the officials said, some rebel groups have prevented
civilians from leaving and even killed or kidnapped those who demanded
that insurgents leave their
neighborhoods.

The United Nations reports largely reflect what residents of East Aleppo
have told The New York Times in recent days as Syrian government forces
retook control of most of the city. [Several have said family members
were detained, arrested or
conscripted](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo.html)
after crossing into government-held areas, and one resident recounted
how rebels in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood stopped people from
leaving.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other residents, however, said rebels had helped them cross the front
lines or warned them not to go at certain times or in certain places
because of the danger. Rebel groups inside east Aleppo are fragmented
and do not always act in concert.

As government forces continued to advance on Friday, panic was growing
among those still trapped inside, who either could not make their way
out or were afraid to enter government territory.

Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner
for human rights, said family members had reported that they had lost
contact with men aged 30 to 50, echoing several interviews The Times
conducted in which Aleppo residents said their males relatives were
arrested or forced to join the army.

“Given the terrible record of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced
disappearances by the Syrian government, we are of course deeply
concerned about the fate of these individuals,” Mr. Colville said.

He also said that two members of the pro-government forces that took
over Aleppo’s al-Halk neighborhood were reported to have summarily shot
four men in front of their families on Sunday because they were
suspected of working with the opposition.

The last two weeks have seen the fiercest bombardments yet of rebel-held
districts. Those still inside describe chaos and intense crowding in
some areas as people scramble for shelter. They said wounded people and
bodies were left in the streets with no one to help them.

Here, what is believed to be the charred body of a rebel fighter can be
seen in retaken Bab
al-Hadid.

Mr. Colville said the agency had heard reports that two armed opposition
groups had abducted and killed an unknown number of civilians who asked
them to leave their neighborhoods. He added that residents trying to
leave the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood may have come under fire from
armed opposition groups, something that could amount to the war crime of
hostage-taking.

“Civilians are caught between warring parties that appear to be

The government has retaken most of the medieval Old City, a Unesco World
Heritage site severely damaged by years of fighting. At its center is
the citadel, which the government has held and used as a fortress
throughout the
conflict.

The government’s offensive over the last week has left rebels in east
Aleppo facing near-certain defeat. On Friday, Russian officials said
that 93 percent of Aleppo had been captured by the Syrian Army.

There has been some talk of at least a temporary cease-fire to allow for
evacuation of the city, but on Friday, the Russian foreign minister,
Sergey V. Lavrov, said that military operations “will go on until
bandits leave eastern
Aleppo.”

Mr. Lavrov said he still had hope of reaching a final resolution for the

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the United Nations on Friday, Russia suffered a sharp diplomatic blow
when a large majority of members voted for a mildly worded, legally
nonbinding General Assembly resolution calling for a pause in fighting
and access to humanitarian aid in Syria.

In practice, the resolution means little, with no specifics and no force
of law. So Syria and Russia, which lobbied vigorously against the
resolution, can continue their military operations, including those on
the rebel-held parts of Aleppo.

The resolution, advanced by Canada, received 122 votes in favor and 13
against. Thirty-six members abstained.

The no votes included Syria, its chief allies Iran and Russia, along
with China, Cuba and Venezuela.

It comes days after Russia, along with China, defeated a resolution in
the Security Council that would have imposed a seven-day cessation of
hostilities to allow aid into besieged parts of Aleppo and allow
residents to get out.
