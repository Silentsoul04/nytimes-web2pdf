TEHRAN --- Iran and Boeing signed a deal for the sale of 80 airplanes on
Sunday, five weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald J.
Trump, whose Republican supporters in Congress have tried to block any
aircraft sales to Iran.

Iran's national airline, Iran Air, said that it had signed an agreement
with Boeing, an American manufacturer, to purchase the aircraft, at a
total cost of \$16.6 billion.

In September, the Treasury Department
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/22/world/middleeast/iran-airbus-boeing-aircraft.html?_r=0}{gave
approval} for Boeing and its European competitor, Airbus, to sell planes
to Iran.

Boeing confirmed the deal, saying that the contract was reached within
the terms of the government license that the department had issued.

The sale includes 50 twin-jet, narrow-body 737 planes and 30 long-range,
wide-body 777 aircraft. The first airplanes are scheduled for delivery
in 2018, with the entire order being fulfilled over 10 years.

In a statement, Boeing said the deal would support tens of thousands of
American jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the
airplanes, and nearly 100,000 jobs in the broader aerospace industry in
the United States.

For nearly four decades, no American companies could engage in
significant business with Iran, which officially considers the United
States an archenemy. But with the deal, the country is not only buying
aircraft from an American supplier; it also means there will be
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/23/world/middleeast/with-boeing-deal-americans-are-coming-to-iran.html?_r=0}{long-term
interaction} between Boeing trainers and employees of Iran Air.

The likelihood of the agreement being carried out, however, has
decreased with the election of Mr. Trump.

His Republican supporters in Congress introduced a bill that attempts to
stop sales by Boeing to Iran, obliging the Treasury Department to refuse
the licenses needed by American banks to finance such an agreement. The
bill passed the House of Representatives in November, but President
Obama has vowed to veto the legislation should it also gain Senate
approval.

Mr. Trump has had different stances on the sales of Boeing aircraft to
Iran. In June, his campaign gave out a statement on the negotiations
between Iran and Boeing, saying, ``The world's largest state sponsor of
terror would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with
Boeing without Clinton's disastrous Iran nuclear deal.''

But in January,
\href{https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/688743019479171072?lang=en}{he
complained in a post on Twitter} that after the nuclear agreement, which
was enacted that month, the Iranians were going to spend their money in
Europe rather than in the United States.

``Iran is going to buy 116 jetliners with a small part of the \$150
billion we are giving them \ldots{} but they won't buy from U.S., rather
Airbus,'' he wrote.

With American banks possibly being blocked from financing and maybe even
transferring money involved in the deal, it is unclear how Iran would
pay for the aircraft. The Iranian state news agency, IRNA, in a report
on the deal, made no mention who would finance the purchases. It did say
that the agreement was not yet fully finalized.

Abbas Akhoundi, Iran's minister of roads and urban development, told
state television that the contract was a clear message to the world.
``In spite of all the warmongering,'' he said, ``businessmen and
financiers gave a signal to the world that we are supporters of
calmness, security and the development of relations.''
