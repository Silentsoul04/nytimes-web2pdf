BEIRUT, Lebanon — Russia declared on Tuesday that the four-year battle
over
[Aleppo](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/14/world/middleeast/aleppo-syria-evacuation-deal.html),
Syria’s largest city, was over, as the last remaining rebel fighters
agreed to turn over their territory to the Syrian government. While
pro-government forces were moving in, United Nations officials said they
were receiving multiple reports of execution-style killings.

The deal was announced just as civilians inside the rebel enclave said
[they had lost
hope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/10/world/middleeast/we-are-dead-either-way-agonizing-choices-for-syrians-in-aleppo.html?action=click&contentCollection=Middle%20East&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article).
They had spent days huddled in abandoned apartments under heavy
shelling, as those with a record of opposing the government said they
were bracing for arrest, conscription or death.

Under the deal, evacuations were set to begin at 5 a.m. Wednesday,
although the departures were delayed and there were reports of renewed
shelling. Earlier on Tuesday, fears had mounted as the United Nations
said it had received reports that Syrian troops or allied Iraqi militias
were gunning down families in apartments and on the streets, with the
toll reaching 82 civilians.

Several residents said they had lost contact with relatives in those
same areas, and a monitoring group, the [Syrian Observatory for Human
Rights](http://www.syriahr.com/en/), said the number of men forced to
join the army upon fleeing to government areas had reached 6,000. And
with no way to treat the wounded, bodies were piling up on the streets
of the shrinking rebel territory.  

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But then came the deal, and the shelling quieted down. Russia, Turkey
and Syrian rebel groups announced that they had agreed to evacuate all
of the remaining fighters to rebel-held territory, with civilians free
to join them or move to government-held areas, leaving the whole city of
Aleppo in government hands.

If the deal is carried out, and all rebel fighters leave as agreed, it
would mark [a major turning
point](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-united-nations.html?action=click&contentCollection=Middle%20East&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article)
in Syria’s nearly six-year war. It would put all of the major cities
along the country’s more populous western spine back under government
control, though Kurdish militias and the so-called caliphate of the
Islamic State continue to hold large areas to the
east.

A full evacuation from Aleppo would be the largest success of the
government’s starve-or-surrender strategy, bombing and besieging areas
out of its control until fighters and residents agree to surrender. It
would leave the armed opposition to the Syrian president, Bashar
al-Assad, in control of just one provincial capital, Idlib — where rebel
fighters from Aleppo will be bused — as well as stretches of rural
territory in northern and southern Syria and several other isolated
patches.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the victory leaves Mr. Assad more dependent than ever on Iran and
Russia, and so despised by his opponents, including many of Syria’s
majority Sunnis, that they might never again accept him as a legitimate
ruler. The territory he has reconquered has been won at a devastating
cost, and much of the country remains in the hands of his enemies.

The battle over Aleppo has been a particularly painful chapter of the
war, dividing and largely destroying one of the world’s oldest and most
beautiful cities, a World Heritage site, amid mounting human suffering.
The eastern, rebel-held half of Aleppo had become unlivable, with rebels
unable to stop the government’s indiscriminate bombing, which destroyed
entire neighborhoods, let alone deliver a better life. The
government-held districts were far less damaged, and daily life there
was more normal, but residents there suffered too, from indiscriminate
rebel
shelling.

Tens of thousands of residents — Russia says at least 100,000, the
United Nations puts the number at 37,000 — left the rebel-held districts
as pro-government forces moved in. Thousands more fled to rebel- or
Kurdish-held areas. The government said rebels were keeping most people
inside by force; some residents said in interviews that fighters had
stopped them from leaving, others said they had guided them out.

When the agreement was announced on Tuesday, the remaining residents —
who just hours before had been sending what they thought were their last
farewells — suddenly had to reckon with their mixed feelings about a
bittersweet and uncertain escape.

Now, it seemed, they would survive, and avoid arrest in a country where
dissent can be punished by torture. Yet now they would have to leave
their city, perhaps
forever.

“I don’t know whether to laugh or cry,” Bassem Ayoub, a longtime
antigovernment activist, posted on Facebook. “My soul is leaving my
body. Aleppo, my life, my life.”

Hours earlier, he and his family made an excruciating decision. His wife
and children, he said, went in search of a route to government-held
territory, hoping to fade into crowds of the displaced and not be
discovered as the relatives of a man the government considers a
terrorist. He stayed behind, unsure when he would see them again, but
certain that if he tried to flee, he would be arrested.

“Some are crying from happiness, others are sad they will no longer be
able to kneel to pray in Aleppo,” said Malek, an activist who hopes to
join his pregnant wife in northern Aleppo Province. “I’m sad, as well —
I paid blood for Aleppo, but I can never again set foot here. Tyranny
has
won.”

Others expressed their bitterness about a revolt that started with
protests for political reform but curdled as the government bombarded
rebel-held neighborhoods and Islamist extremists rose to power within
the insurgency. “The Islamists and love of power screwed up the
revolution,” Zaher al-Zaher, another activist, wrote in a text message.
“I lost my house, and my family are away from me. My heart is
burning.”

As preparations began for the departures from eastern Aleppo, government
supporters celebrated in the streets.

Rebels, activists and aid workers in eastern Aleppo said they had been
told that civilians and fighters could all leave and travel to
rebel-held areas. That satisfied a key demand that both groups have an
option to avoid going to government-controlled areas, where dissidents
and medical and humanitarian workers working in rebel-held areas have
been punished as
terrorists.

But there were still doubts and fears about whether the way out would be
smooth or safe. In previous agreements, like one in Homs in 2014,
pro-government militias, angry that fighters they saw as terrorists were
allowed to leave alive, have fired on evacuees.

Signs of friction emerged early Wednesday in Aleppo. About 1 a.m., four
hours before the 5 a.m. departures set out under the agreement, a convoy
of vans carrying 70 wounded people, mostly fighters and their families,
were filmed pulling out of the enclave. But a short time afterward,
residents reported the convoy had been turned back by pro-government
Shiite militiamen and told it could depart after 6 a.m.

There were concerns that cracks were already emerging in the deal,
perhaps over tensions between Mr. Assad’s two main allies, Russia and
Iran, which trains and backs pro-government Shiite militias from Iraq
and
elsewhere.

The deal was struck after widespread concern about the fate of
civilians, with the United Nations warning of “a complete meltdown of
humanity” and protests breaking out at United Nations headquarters in
New York and Russian embassies in several cities, including London,
Stockholm and Istanbul.

Hundreds of civilians have died in the offensive; the full toll is not
known because the humanitarian groups that rescued and treated civilians
and tracked casualties largely collapsed under fire in recent days.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The United Nations said the 82 summary killings were reported in four
neighborhoods — Bustan al-Qasr, al-Fardous, al-Kallaseh and al-Saleheen
— and included at least 11 women and 13 children, some shot in the
streets as they tried to escape, said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Mr. Colville
cited reports that the world body had received from reliable contacts
inside and outside the city.

Later on Tuesday, the United Nations Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura,
revealed new details of what officials knew of the reported killings:
The dead had been shot with handguns, but it was not clear who had
killed them.

Russia categorically denied what the United Nations secretary general,
Ban Ki-moon, said were “credible reports” of atrocities, including
executions. Mr. Ban said the United Nations had been unable to verify
the reports because the Syrian government had repeatedly denied
permission to United Nations staff to monitor the evacuations and aid
civilians stuck on the battlefield.

Asked if there was concern that Idlib Province, where surrendering
rebels and civilians from other cities have been taken, could be “the
next Aleppo,” Mr. de Mistura acknowledged that grim possibility, adding,
“We are working on that.”
