BEIRUT, Lebanon — Families, medical workers, insurgent fighters and
wounded people were packed and ready Wednesday morning to vacate the
ravaged rebel-held neighborhoods of the Syrian city of Aleppo under a
deal between Russia and Turkey. Then the resumed booms of incoming
artillery shells from pro-government forces sent them into hiding or
running for their lives.

It was the latest life-or-death whiplash for the thousands trapped in
the ruins of a once-vibrant northern metropolis, which has come to
symbolize the atrocities unfolding in the nearly six-year-old war.

Under the [supposed
deal](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/13/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-civilians.html)
for a cease-fire and evacuation — announced on Tuesday by Turkey, Russia
and Syrian rebels — the remaining fighters were to leave Aleppo for
rebel-held territory farther north and civilians were free to join them
or move to government-held areas.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That outcome would leave the whole city in the hands of forces loyal to
the Syrian president, Bashar
al-Assad.

## One Man’s View Into the Last Days in Rebel-Held Aleppo

Messages posted to a WhatsApp group by an English teacher in Aleppo
describe what he saw in the shrinking rebel-held territory, as Syrian
forces and their allies waged an assault to retake the city.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad
al-Hussein, denounced the resumed shelling, calling it a probable war
crime.

“The way this deal was dangled in front of this battered and beleaguered
population — causing them to hope they might indeed live to see another
day — and then snatched away just half a day later is also outrageously
cruel,” Mr. al-Hussein said in a statement.

“The Syrian government has a clear responsibility to ensure its people
are safe, and is palpably failing to take this opportunity to do so,” he
said.

As each side blamed the other for the deal’s collapse, civilians inside
the city issued anguished, angry pleas for international pressure to
reinstate it. The Assad government and Iran, Syria’s other main ally
besides Russia, appeared not to have been fully consulted on the deal,
according to international officials and others briefed on the talks,
and were insisting on new conditions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rebel groups outside the city resumed shelling government-held districts
in Aleppo. Civilians in other rebel-held areas to the north protested
against their leaders and ransacked posts of hard-line rebel groups,
demanding they help those in Aleppo.

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Shelling resumed Wednesday in

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Close to midnight Wednesday, rebel groups announced a new deal for
another evacuation attempt on Thursday. Trapped civilians expressed
disbelief, and the Syrian military denied that another deal had been
reached.

But by early Thursday the shelling had tapered off, residents reported,
hoping the pause would hold.

As the shelling escalated Wednesday morning, a radiology nurse in
Aleppo, Mohamed al-Ahmad, said he hoped the world would hear “our final
scream,” adding that the wounded, with rescue and medical services in
disarray, were bleeding to death in the streets.

Yasser, an accountant volunteering in a makeshift medical clinic, posted
a photograph via WhatsApp of an injured girl lying on a hallway floor.
She was 10, he said, with broken bones, and was crying and shouting:
“Get me out of Aleppo. I am afraid, I am cold. My back is hurting me.
Where is the doctor?”

Yasser, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of
being arrested for contacting journalists, said in frustration, “Let us
leave — what is happening?”

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The civilians of opposition-held

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Problems with the deal had been evident from the start. Soon after it
was announced Tuesday night, Syrian officials said they had no knowledge
of it, and there was no word from Iran.

Then, around 1 a.m. Wednesday, a convoy of vans carrying dozens of
wounded people, including fighters and their families, began making its
way out of Aleppo.

But the vans returned soon after, witnesses said, after Iranian-backed
militiamen blocked the way and said they did not have Syrian government
permission.

The militiamen said they would not allow anyone out until rebel groups
had ended their siege of Fouaa and Kfarya, two encircled Shiite enclaves
in Idlib Province. Residents said they were told they could leave at 6
a.m., but as buses idled, the shelling resumed.

Opposition leaders and civilians inside Aleppo said they believed that
Iran had balked at a deal brokered by Russia. Osama Abu Zayd, a legal
adviser to Syrian opposition factions, told The Associated Press that
Iran’s field commander in Syria was resisting it.

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Residents of Aleppo, Syria, told

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The interests of Mr. Assad’s two main backers, Russia and Iran, do not
always dovetail. Iran has a stake in retaining the influence it gained
by entering the conflict on behalf of Mr. Assad two years before Russia.

Iran has trained, backed and financed the pro-government militias that
have bolstered Syrian ground forces, with recruits from Iraq,
Afghanistan and other countries, as well as Hezbollah, the Lebanese
Shiite militant group.

Yasser, the accountant, said civilians in Aleppo did not approve of
rebel shelling of civilians in Fouaa and Kfarya. “We are humans,” he
said. “They are not our enemies. They are civilians like us.”

The Russian Defense Ministry blamed the rebels for the impasse, saying
on Wednesday that they had “resumed the hostilities” at dawn, trying to
break through Syrian government positions to the northwest. Residents
questioned why rebels inside eastern Aleppo would start shooting again
when they were about to escape.

Later, negotiators said the Syrian government was asking for the release
of prisoners and the bodies of dead soldiers, and for rebels to hand
over fighters from the Qaeda-linked Levant Conquest
Front.

## What I Saw in Syria

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Government opponents also said they suspected Mr. Assad of stalling. His
government has often skillfully played its backers against one another.
The wrangling could provide cover to finish off Aleppo’s last rebel
enclave with force. As one Syrian military officer told Reuters in
Aleppo recently, rebels must “surrender or die.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Troubles carrying out the accord were not surprising, as there was no
international monitoring — United Nations officials said the Syrian
government had refused their repeated pleas to observe — and no
enforcement provision. The same problems have vexed other deals reached
during the conflict.

Malek, an activist who said he hoped to join his pregnant wife in
northern Aleppo Province, and who asked to be identified only by his
first name for fear of retaliation, said the world saw civilians in
rebel-held territory as “no longer human.”

“They think we are Daesh,” he said via WhatsApp, using an Arabic acronym
for the Islamic State, the militant group that has established a
so-called caliphate in parts of Syria but not in Aleppo.

Using a mournful expression, he added, “we didn’t taste the flavor of
life.”

At the United Nations on Tuesday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said
there had been “credible reports” of atrocities, including extrajudicial
killings, as eastern Aleppo was retaken.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Russia categorically denied the reports, and Mr. Ban said the world body
had been unable to verify them.

Dr. Salem Abou Al-Nasr, a dentist who had kept his clinic open until
last week but finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods when
his was taken by government forces, said Wednesday morning that he could
hear heavy shelling.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We slept a quiet night, but sadly the shelling is back,” he said.

Later, Dr. Abou Al-Nasr posted[a video on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/groups/InstantReportingTeam/permalink/611719489014616/)calling
for global powers to intervene to push through a deal.

“The situation can’t wait,” he said. “Everyone should know, we, the
people here, we love life and want to live.”

The evacuation plan came after two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian
Army and its allies, who drove insurgents into an ever-smaller pocket of
eastern Aleppo, with support from heavy airstrikes and artillery fire.

Rebel groups have received support from Turkey, the United States and
Persian Gulf states, but far less than the direct military aid that Iran
and Russia have provided to Mr. Assad.
