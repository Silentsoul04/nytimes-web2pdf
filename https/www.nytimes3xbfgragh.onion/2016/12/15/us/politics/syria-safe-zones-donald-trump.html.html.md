HERSHEY, Pa. — President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that the
United States would create “safe zones” in Syria, his first reference to
such an American role in the war there since he was elected, and one
that comes as the Syrian government has [all but
recaptured](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/15/world/middleeast/aleppo-syria-evacuation-deal.html "Times article.")
the rebel stronghold of Aleppo.

“When I look at what’s going on in Syria, it’s so sad,” he told a crowd
here. “It’s so sad, and we’re going to help people.” Mr. Trump said he
would ask the Persian Gulf nations to put up money for the project,
adding, “We’ll build and help build safe zones in Syria, so people will
have a chance.”

Mr. Trump talked during the campaign about building safe zones,
presenting them as a way to stem the tide of refugees into Europe. But
this was the first time he had repeated the proposal since he began
receiving intelligence briefings. Some analysts and military commanders
have warned that it would be a significant and potentially dangerous
undertaking on a complex battlefield over which Russian planes have been
flying raids.

The president-elect coupled his plan with a familiar promise to restrict
entry into the United States by people from countries with a history of
Islamic extremism.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was Mr. Trump’s second rally of the week, in what has become an
extended “thank you” tour of states he won. And it featured a familiar
mix for him: a lovingly detailed recap of his victory on election night,
along with campaign appeals to populism, economic nationalism, and
anti-immigration and anti-free-trade sentiment.

“From now on, it’s going to be America first,” he declared. “There is no
such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, a global flag.”

“We salute one flag, and that is the American flag,” Mr. Trump said.
“We’re going to make sure the American flag gets the respect it
deserves,” he added. “We’re going to maybe have to do something about
that” — an apparent reference to [his earlier
suggestion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/29/us/politics/trump-flag-burners-citizenship-first-amendment.html "Times article.")
that people should face penalties for burning the flag, despite a 1989
Supreme Court ruling that found that such actions were protected speech.

Mr. Trump also repeated his campaign promise of a multibillion-dollar
plan to rebuild roads, bridges and airports — something for which the
Republican leadership in Congress has shown little appetite. Even his
designated chief of staff, Reince Priebus, has emphasized other
priorities, like a tax overhaul and [repealing the Affordable Care
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/15/us/politics/paul-ryan-affordable-care-act-repeal.html "Times article.").

“Merry Christmas, everybody,” Mr. Trump said by way of greeting, drawing
out his words in a cheerful rebuke to what he would call political
correctness. His raucous supporters, many wearing Santa Claus hats
rather than the usual red “Make America Great Again” caps, whooped
appreciatively.

In Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a razor-thin
margin of 44,292 votes, out of a total of 6.1 million cast, according to
the final certified count.

Nonetheless, he described his victory as a landslide and, as he has
before, offered a detailed recollection of election night, as CNN called
Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina for him.

Mr. Trump also marveled at his ability to continue drawing big crowds.
“It’s hard to get a big crowd after the election,” he said. “If
somebody else — a normal person — came after an election, even after a
victory, and had 15 people, they would say we had enough.”

The president-elect has settled into a comfortable routine in the last
two weeks: half a day of meetings at Trump Tower, where the world’s rich
and powerful flock to his doorstep, followed by a quick flight to one of
the swing states he won, where thousands of ordinary people wait for
hours to cheer him.

Thursday’s spectacle was typical: He packed Giant Center (named for the
supermarket chain), which sits next to the Hershey chocolate factory.
Mr. Trump drew a similar crowd in the arena the week before the
election; many people were repeat visitors.

More than an hour before the rally began, the crowd began a warm-up
chant of “Lock her up.” In the background, a country singer proclaimed,
“We’re all American,” a campaign soundtrack standard, along with “God
Bless the U.S.A.” and “Heart of Stone” by the Rolling Stones.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the rosy glow of victory, some of the call-and-response chants seemed
more perfunctory than passionate. When the crowd broke into “CNN sucks”
on Tuesday [in West Allis,
Wis.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/13/us/donald-trump-victory-tour.html),
for example, an older man leaned into the press pen and assured the
reporters, “We don’t really mean it.”

Many people at the Hershey event seemed satisfied with how Mr. Trump was
conducting his transition, including his very public search for a
cabinet. “I like how he’s shown us the people he wants to hire, versus
the total secrecy of the last eight years,” said Dennis Egbert, 63, a
retired electrician from York, Pa.

Asked what he thought of Mr. Trump’s attraction to billionaires and
Goldman Sachs bankers, Mr. Egbert said: “When I was a young person, I
didn’t like rich people. But you know, I’ve never gotten a job from a
poor person.”
