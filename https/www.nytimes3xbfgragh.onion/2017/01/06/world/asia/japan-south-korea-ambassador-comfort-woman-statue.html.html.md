SEOUL, South Korea — Japan recalled its envoy to South Korea on Friday
to protest a statue commemorating Korean women who were forced into
sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II, in the latest
sign that ties between Washington’s two key Asian allies were again
deteriorating over the bitter historical issue.

“The Japanese government finds this situation extremely regrettable,”
Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
said during a news conference in Tokyo, referring to the placement of
the statue [outside the Japanese Consulate in
Busan](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/30/world/asia/south-korea-comfort-women-wwii-japan.html),
South Korea’s second-largest city, last week.

A spokesman for Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yasuhisa Kawamura,
said the ambassador, Yasumasa Nagamine, as well as the consul general in
Busan, Yasuhiro Morimoto, had been recalled “temporarily,” declining to
say when they would return.

Japan also said it would suspend negotiations over a currency swap meant
to help South Korea stabilize its currency, the won, in times of
financial crisis. It also suspended high-level economic talks and said
staff at the consulate in Busan would not attend events organized by the
city government.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

South Korea showed no sign of acquiescing to Japan’s demand that it
immediately remove the statue in Busan, a port city in the country’s
southeast. “We want to stress again that despite difficult issues facing
us, both governments must strive to develop bilateral relations based on
mutual trust,” said Cho June-hyuck, a spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry, who called Japan’s announcement “regrettable.”

South Korea’s Finance Ministry urged Tokyo to keep diplomatic disputes
out of economic and financial relations.

Washington has repeatedly appealed to South Korea and Japan to overcome
the persistent, bitter legacies of Japan’s brutal colonial rule over
Korea in the first half of the 20th century and to work more closely
together to better address North Korea’s advancing threat of nuclear
weapons and China’s expanding influence.

But the issue of the comfort women, as the former sex slaves were
euphemistically called in Japan and South Korea, remains seemingly
intractable, despite a 2015 agreement between the countries that was
meant to put the dispute behind
them.

Surviving former sex slaves and their advocates [angered
Japan](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/12/16/world/asia/statute-in-seoul-becomes-focal-point-of-dispute-between-south-korea-and-japan.html)
in 2011 when they installed the first in a series of comfort woman
statues, in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. The bronze,
life-size statue, of a barefoot girl in traditional Korean dress sitting
in a chair, was placed so that diplomats would see it as they left the
office. It is still there, with Korean activists guarding it around the
clock to ensure that it is not removed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since then, activists have put up dozens more such statues, in South
Korea and abroad. But the one in Busan was only the second to be
installed near a Japanese diplomatic mission.

Mr. Kawamura said that statue violated the spirit of [the deal the
countries struck in
December 2015](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/12/29/world/asia/comfort-women-south-korea-japan.html)
to resolve their dispute over the extent of Tokyo’s responsibility for
what the women had to endure. In that agreement, which both sides called
“a final and irreversible resolution,” Japan apologized and promised
$8.3 million to care for the surviving women, in return for South
Korea’s promise not to press any future claims. South Korea also
promised to discuss Japan’s complaint about the Seoul statue with
activists and survivors.

“Each side, Japan and South Korea respectively, should implement the
agreement with a sense of responsibility,” Mr. Kawamura said, specifying
that the deal should extend to the statue in Busan.

South Korea also reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement, though it
has proved to be one of the most unpopular decisions made by President
Park Geun-hye, whose powers have been suspended since the National
Assembly [voted to impeach
her](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
last month over a corruption scandal. The agreement fell short of the
survivors’ demand that Japan pay formal reparations and accept legal
responsibility for what happened to them.

On Dec. 28, the first anniversary of the agreement, civic groups in
Busan installed the statue on a sidewalk near the Japanese Consulate,
despite repeated protests from Tokyo and the consulate.

The local government immediately removed it, saying it had been placed
there without permission, but bowed to public pressure two days later
and allowed it to be put back. A visit that week by Japan’s defense
minister, Tomomi Inada, to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which
commemorates a number of convicted war criminals along with Japan’s
other war dead, had deepened resentments in South Korea.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shinsuke Sugiyama, Japan’s vice minister for foreign affairs, who is in
Washington attending talks with his American and South Korean
counterparts to discuss North Korea and other security issues, lodged an
official complaint with his South Korean counterpart, Lim Sung-nam, over
the Busan statue on Thursday. For his part, Mr. Lim strongly protested
Ms. Inada’s visit to the shrine, officials here said on Friday.

Japan last recalled its envoy to Seoul in 2012, after South Korea’s
president at the time, [Lee Myung-bak, flew to a set of
islets](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/08/11/world/asia/south-koreans-visit-to-disputed-islets-angers-japan.html)
that both countries claim as their territory. The ambassador returned
after 12 days. South Korea temporarily recalled its own ambassador to
Tokyo in 2008, to protest new guidelines for Japanese textbooks that
asserted Japan’s [claim to those
islets](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/08/31/world/asia/31islands.html).
