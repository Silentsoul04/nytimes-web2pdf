WASHINGTON --- In a sign of abortion opponents' newfound clout in the
capital,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/28/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-donald-trump.html}{Kellyanne
Conway}, the Republican strategist who led Donald J. Trump to victory
and will serve as his White House counselor, will speak at a major
anti-abortion march here the week after his inaugural.

Ms. Conway, 49, made history in November as the first woman to manage a
successful presidential campaign. She has long been an outspoken foe of
abortion, and she could become the first sitting White House official to
address the annual march in person, though both Mr. Trump and Vice
President-elect Mike Pence have been invited.

``It's an incredible gesture for pro-life Americans,'' said Marilyn
Musgrave, a Republican former congresswoman from Colorado, now the top
lobbyist for Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group here. Kristan
Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said of Ms. Conway:
``She's one of us.''

This will be the 44th year of the march, which organizers say is
typically attended by tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists. The
annual event, often held on Jan. 22 but pushed back to Jan. 27 this year
because of the inaugural, marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision establishing a national right to abortion.

Neither Ms. Conway nor Trump transition officials responded to requests
for comment on Wednesday. But Jeanne Mancini, the March for Life
president, hinted in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence,
or both, might attend.

``Stay tuned,'' she said.

No president or vice president has attended the march, though Ronald
Reagan sent a video in 1988, and George W. Bush addressed marchers from
the East Room of the White House in 2008.

Quick-witted, confident and comfortable on television, Ms. Conway, a
mother of four, was a powerful force in driving
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/11/us/politics/the-women-who-helped-donald-trump-to-victory.html}{women
to vote for Mr. Trump}; in one election surprise, 53 percent of white
women did, according to exit polls. As the highest-ranking woman in the
new administration, she holds powerful appeal for Republicans in
general, and women especially.

``I don't think it can be underestimated how significant her presence on
the Trump campaign was in terms of motivating and mobilizing the
pro-life vote,'' said Charmaine Yoest, a longtime anti-abortion advocate
here, in an interview.

Abortion foes are looking to make big policy gains in Washington under
Mr. Trump, who as a candidate signed a letter agreeing to four of the
movement's central demands, including appointing conservative Supreme
Court justices and enacting a permanent ban on taxpayer-financed
abortions. Already,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/11/us/abortion-foes-donald-trump-restrictions-politics.html}{states
like Ohio} are rolling back abortion rights.

Ilyse Hogue, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said in a recent
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/11/us/abortion-foes-donald-trump-restrictions-politics.html}{interview}
that abortion rights advocates see themselves ``standing on the edge of
a very dark time.'' Ms. Musgrave happily agreed; she said she spent
Wednesday on Capitol Hill, at a closed-door conference with Republican
leaders who are planning strategy, including stripping funding from
Planned Parenthood.

``It's a great time to be pro-life,'' Ms. Musgrave said.

Ms. Conway will not be the only speaker. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan,
archbishop of New York, is also scheduled to attend, as is Benjamin
Watson, a tight end for the Baltimore Ravens, Karyme Lozano, a Mexican
TV star and Abby Johnson, a former clinic director at Planned Parenthood
who later became an anti-abortion activist.

But, short of Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence, Ms. Conway is the march's biggest
``get.'' She is a well-known figure here in Washington who tends to
arouse the ire of liberal women who consider themselves feminists ---
and has been caricatured on ``Saturday Night Live'' --- which is one
reason anti-abortion women like Ms. Yoest find her both sympathetic and
effective.

During the 2012 presidential primary season, while advising Newt
Gingrich, the former House speaker then running for the Republican
nomination, she ripped into Mitt Romney, who eventually became the
party's nominee, for waffling on the issue, saying in an
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/02/12/us/politics/romneys-path-to-pro-life-position-on-abortion.html}{interview}
that he did not ``seem comfortable in his own skin.''

At the time, Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was
promising a ``pro-life presidency.'' But in 1994, while running for
Senate, he said he thought abortion should be ``safe and legal,'' and in
2002, as a candidate for governor, he had sought the backing of abortion
rights advocates. Ms. Conway wasted little time in calling him out on
the inconsistencies.

``The emperor has no policy clothes,'' she warned, ``and it's costing
him on this issue.''
