WASHINGTON --- Former President George Bush, the 41st president, was in
stable condition at a Houston hospital on Wednesday after doctors
performed a procedure to clear his airway, his spokesman said.

His wife, Barbara Bush, was also admitted to the medical center, Houston
Methodist Hospital, on Wednesday morning ``as a precaution after
experiencing fatigue and coughing,'' the spokesman, Jim McGrath, said in
a statement.

Mr. Bush, 92, was suffering from an acute respiratory problem stemming
from pneumonia when he was admitted to the intensive care unit at the
hospital. After initial reports of Mr. Bush's hospitalization, his
office said he was expected to return home by the weekend.

Mr. Bush, who served as vice president from 1981-89 and president from
1989-93, refused to support Donald J. Trump for president in last year's
election and had already declined to attend Friday's inauguration,
citing health concerns. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F.
Kennedy, said last fall that the former president had told her that he
planned to vote for Hillary Clinton.

His son, former President George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, have
announced that they plan to attend the inauguration, although former
Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who lost the Republican nomination to Mr.
Trump, does not intend to be there. Also scheduled to be on hand are
Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, as well as former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.
