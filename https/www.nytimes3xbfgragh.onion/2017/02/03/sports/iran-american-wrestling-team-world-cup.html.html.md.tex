Iran will bar the United States wrestling team from a major
international meet this month in response to President Trump's order
severely limiting travel from several Muslim-majority countries,
including Iran.

Bahram Qasemi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announced the
decision Friday morning, \href{http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82413890/}{the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported}.

The agency reported that the decision had been made by ``a special
committee, which opposed to presence of the team after necessary
studies.'' Mr. Qasemi said the ministry opposed the Americans'
participation because of Mr. Trump's order.

``We're in talks about it right at the moment,'' said Christina Kelley,
the chief international ambassador for U.S.A. Wrestling. ``We're pretty
devastated.''

A U.S.A. Wrestling statement, while noting that the group had not
received official confirmation of the decision, said: ``If these reports
are true, U.S.A. Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which
we believe would be an unacceptable situation. Wrestling is about
competition and good will through sport, and is no place for politics.''

The event, the Freestyle World Cup, is scheduled for Feb. 16 and 17 in
Kermanshah, Iran. Held annually, it pits the best wrestlers in the world
in team competition. Last year, the event was held in Los Angeles, and
it is scheduled to be held in Iowa City in 2018. Iran has won the event
\href{https://unitedworldwrestling.org/article/iran-captures-fifth-straight-freestyle-world-cup-title}{five
years in a row}.

Americans and Iranians regularly wrestle in each other's countries,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/28/sports/trump-refugee-ban.html}{with
few problems, if any}. Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in
Iran: 43 of the nation's 69 Olympic medals have come in wrestling.

The United States and Iran worked together in 2013 to persuade the
International Olympic Committee to keep wrestling in the Summer Games
when it was threatened with removal.

There is an international wrestling meet
\href{http://usawevents.sportngin.com/events}{scheduled for May in Times
Square}, an annual contest pitting top Americans against international
stars. But it is not clear if Iranians will be granted sports visas to
compete.

Mr. Trump's order bars visitors from seven nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya,
Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Nenad Lalovic, the president of United World Wrestling, the
international federation, said in a statement: ``Though we had hoped for
a different outcome from Iran's Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the
complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a
solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible.''

``United World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season,
and we're certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat
again in the very near future,'' it added.

Mr. Trump's order is a complicated issue for the United States Olympic
Committee, which calls itself ``the steward of the Olympic movement in
the United States.'' The organization does not want to antagonize the
president, so its response has been relatively muted. The committee is
invested in a bid to bring the 2024 Summer Games to Los Angeles, and
that bid's chances have been damaged by the executive order, which
alarmed some of the International Olympic Committee members who will
select the host city.

``We are disappointed for our wrestlers, who have been warmly welcomed
by the Iranian public on many occasions,'' said Patrick Sandusky, a
spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee.

Jordan Burroughs, an American who won a gold medal at the 2012 London
Olympics and who was to participate in the World Cup,
\href{http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article130506864.html}{told
The Associated Press}: ``These executive decisions are always so far
beyond your reach. You always feel like, `Well, the presidency or these
strict laws or these Muslim bans or whatever you like to call them,
they'll never affect me.' This is one of the few times where something
so personal has occurred.''

``There is such a common respect for wrestlers in Iran,'' Burroughs
\href{http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/02/03/jordan-burroughs-wrestling-iran-travel-ban/}{told
NBC}. ``They love wrestling. They're huge fans of mine. I'm bummed about
that. I really wanted to be part of something great in what I consider a
great country. Obviously, my views and our country's views are
different.''

Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering
the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump's order. But American
wrestling officials had been hopeful that an exception could be made to
allow the American athletes to participate.
