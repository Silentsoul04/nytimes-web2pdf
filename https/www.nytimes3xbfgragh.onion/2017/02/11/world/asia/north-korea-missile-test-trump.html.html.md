SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched a ballistic missile toward the
sea off its eastern coast on Sunday, in what South Korea called the
North’s first attempt to test President Trump’s policy on the isolated
country.

A projectile believed to be a modified version of the North’s
intermediate-range ballistic missile Musudan took off at 7:55 a.m. from
Banghyon, a town near North Korea’s northwestern border with China, and
flew 310 miles before falling in the sea, the South Korean military
said. Earlier, the United States Strategic Command issued a statement
identifying the missile as a medium- or intermediate-range system that
“did not pose a threat to North America.”

South Korea condemned the missile launching, saying that it violated a
series of United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar North
Korea from developing or testing ballistic missile and nuclear weapons
technologies. It also said the North had launched the missile to raise
tensions over its weapons programs and to use it as leverage in dealing
with the Trump administration.

“We see this as part of an attempt by the North to grab attention by
demonstrating its nuclear and missile capabilities and to counter the
new United States administration’s strong policy line against North
Korea,” the South Korean military said in its statement.

The missile launch came as Mr. Trump is hosting Japan’s prime minister,
Shinzo Abe, on an official visit, but it was unclear if the test was
intended as a political message.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe hastily arranged a joint appearance in response.
“North Korea’s most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable,”
Mr. Abe said, calling on the country to comply with all relevant United
Nations Security Council resolutions.

Looking grim, Mr. Trump said nothing about the missile launch, but
pledged to staunchly back Japan. “I just want everybody to understand
and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan,
its great ally, 100 percent,” he said. The two leaders are at
Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla., where they are meeting
over the weekend.

The United States Strategic Command statement identified the missile
North Korea launched as “a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic
missile.”

“The missile was tracked over North Korea and into the Sea of Japan,”
the statement added. “The North American Aerospace Defense Command
determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to
North America.”

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said the test, the first by the North
this year, demonstrated the “maniacal obsession” of the North Korean
leader, Kim Jong-un, with developing a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

The test came less than two days after Mr. Trump said on Friday that
[defending against the nuclear and missile
threats](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2017/02/10/world/asia/10reuters-usa-trump-japan.html)
from North Korea was a “very, very high priority.” Mr. Trump made the
comment at a news conference with Mr. Abe at the White House. In their
joint statement, the two leaders had urged North Korea “to abandon its
nuclear and ballistic missile programs and not to take any further
provocative actions.”

The test of an intercontinental-range system would have been especially
provocative because it would mean that North Korea was trying to develop
the ability to strike the United States. South Korean officials said
they believed that the North has been using the Musudan, its
intermediate-range missile, to develop and test some intercontinental
ballistic missile, or ICBM, technologies.

North Korea has deployed and often tested short-range Scud and midrange
Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan,
but it has had a spotty record in test-launching the Musudan, its only
missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the
Pacific, including those on Guam. North Korea’s [last Musudan test ended
in failure in
October](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/20/world/asia/north-korea-musudan-missile-failure.html).

In a New Year’s Day speech, Mr. Kim [said his country had reached a
“final
stage”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/01/world/asia/north-korea-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-test-kim-jong-un.html)
in preparing to conduct its first test of an ICBM. That drew a [Twitter
post](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/816057920223846400?lang=en)
the next day from Mr. Trump that said, “It won’t happen\!”

North Korea has since warned that it could test-launch an ICBM “anytime
and anywhere,” in its first challenge to the new American president.

The American defense secretary, Jim Mattis, visited South Korea on his
first official trip abroad and agreed with South Korea to boost the
allies’ joint defense abilities against North Korea. The two allies also
agreed to push ahead with their plan to [deploy an advanced American
missile defense system known as
Thaad](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/02/world/asia/james-mattis-us-korea-thaad.html)
in South Korea by the end of the year, despite a strong protest from
China.

Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the
United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can
reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never
tested a long-range missile that could fly across the Pacific.

It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable
ICBM, although it has boasted of successfully testing crucial
technologies in the past year, such as long-range missile engines and
heat shields for an ICBM.
