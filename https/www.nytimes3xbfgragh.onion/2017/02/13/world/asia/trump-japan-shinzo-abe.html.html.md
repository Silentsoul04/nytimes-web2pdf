TOKYO — In many respects, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s trip to Washington
and Florida to meet and play golf with President Trump went as well as
the Japanese leader could have hoped.

Sure, there was an [awkward
handshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbP8eC-SIw&feature=player_embedded)
between the two leaders that may have gone on for too long (and
unleashed a meme of Mr. Abe’s uncomfortable facial expression). But
after an election campaign in which Mr. Trump frequently criticized
Japan on trade issues and accused the country of not paying enough for
its military defense, he assured Japan that the relationship between the
two countries “[runs very, very
deep](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/10/world/asia/trump-shinzo-abe-meeting.html?smid=tw-share),’’
and showed a deference to Mr. Abe that belied his previous remarks.

Before the visit last week, some in the Japanese news media had gibed
Mr. Abe for his apparent eagerness to foster a friendship with Mr.
Trump, and some joked that the American president would [take
advantage](https://twitter.com/motokorich/status/829946184269656065) of
the Japanese leader during their bout of golf diplomacy at the
president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. But in a [Kyodo News
poll](http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2017/02/458432.html) taken after
the meeting, 70 percent of the Japanese public said they were satisfied
with the talks between the two leaders, and Mr. Abe’s approval ratings
rose slightly from a month earlier to close to 62 percent.

“In a basic sense, Prime Minister Abe got almost everything he wanted,”
said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of
Tokyo. Mr. Trump’s statements in a joint news conference with Mr. Abe
were “totally different from what he has been saying about Japan since
the 1980s,” Mr. Kubo said. “That is surprising as well as remarkable. In
a sense he showed us, including the American public, that he is capable
of changing his position on such an important issue as Japan.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump, who as a candidate and president-elect assailed Japan as one
of the countries that “[do not pay
us](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/27/us/politics/transcript-debate.html?_r=0)’’
for defense and repeatedly called for an “America First” economy, ended
up thanking the people of Japan for hosting United States troops and
called for a trading relationship “that is free, fair and reciprocal,
benefiting both of our countries.”

Perhaps most significant to the Japanese, Mr. Trump promised that the
United States was “committed to the security of Japan and all areas
under its administrative control,” a reference to the American guarantee
to defend Japan in any confrontation with China over disputed islands,
known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu, in the East
China Sea.

The remarks drew swift criticism from China, where an
[editorial](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrbhwb/html/2017-02/13/content_1749422.htm)
in the overseas edition of People’s Daily, an official newspaper of the
Communist Party, said Mr. Abe had made a “fetish” of Japan’s alliance
with the United States.

Mr. Abe had “exaggerated the threat from China to create momentum for
America and Japan to join hands and contain China’s rise,” said the
editorial, written by Su Xiaohui, a senior researcher at a state-run
foreign policy think tank in Beijing.

Analysts said it was not surprising that Mr. Abe could get along so well
with Mr. Trump. He was the first world leader to [meet with the
president-elect](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/17/world/asia/shinzo-abe-donald-trump.html)
in November at Trump Tower in New York after the election and the
second, after [Prime Minister Theresa May of
Britain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/27/world/europe/theresa-may-britain-trump.html),
to meet with President Trump after the inauguration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Abe has also been adept at developing relationships with other
potentially difficult heads of state.

“Abe himself is just very good at dealing with strong-willed
authoritarian leaders,” said [Michael J.
Green](https://www.csis.org/people/michael-j-green), a former Asia
adviser to President George W. Bush and now at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, referring to Mr. Abe’s
relationships with leaders including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of
Turkey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Vladimir V.
Putin of Russia.

While the majority of the Japanese public approved of Mr. Abe’s meeting
with Mr. Trump, there was some criticism, particularly from the left.
The leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Kazuo Shii, denounced Mr.
Abe for not objecting to Mr. Trump’s barring of refugees and foreign
visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Others cautioned
that the mercurial Mr. Trump could easily change his mind if offended,
and that Mr. Abe had made himself vulnerable by seeming too eager to
align himself with the American president.

In an editorial, [the centrist Mainichi Shimbun
said](http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170212/p2a/00m/0na/009000c)
that Mr. Trump might have taken a strategy of “first giving away what
Japan desires and then making it impossible for Japan to turn down U.S.
demands,” while [Hirotoshi
Sako](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702120030.html), political
news editor of the Asahi Shimbun, wrote that “not being able to voice
views that may run counter to the will of the other side cannot equate
to a mature bilateral relationship.”

Some analysts said that by pursuing a close friendship with Mr. Trump,
Mr. Abe was betraying the moral foundation of the alliance that has
endured since the end of World War II.

“The idea was that the United States is really the standard-bearer of
the liberal international order,” said [Koichi
Nakano](http://www.fla.sophia.ac.jp/professors/nakanokoichi), a
political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. “Now, obviously with
Trump there’s a very big question mark whether the American commitments
to these so-called shared values remain the same.”

From a strategic security standpoint, Japan may have few choices other
than to continue a strong alliance with the United States, given
[threats from North
Korea](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/13/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-success.html?ref=asia),
which tested a ballistic missile while Mr. Abe was still in Florida with
Mr. Trump, and China, which has become more assertive in the East and
South China Seas.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“What exactly are Mr. Abe’s or Japan’s options?” said Grant Newsham,
senior research fellow at the [Japan Forum for Strategic
Studies](http://www.jfss.gr.jp/english/aboutus-en.htm). “What exactly is
to be gained if he was to be standoffish or even pick a fight, which
doesn’t take much when Mr. Trump’s involved? Japan, really, by itself,
cannot handle the security problems in Asia.”

Mr. Trump may also be coming to realize that with a rising China, Japan
is the United States’ best ally in Asia.

“The logical conclusion is that, from the strategic point of view, Japan
and the United States are still in full sync,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a
former Japanese diplomat now teaching at [Ritsumeikan
University](http://en.ritsumei.ac.jp/) in Kyoto.

Before the American election, the Japanese government had clearly
preferred Hillary Clinton to Mr. Trump. But now that Mr. Trump is the
president, some analysts believe he could inadvertently help Mr. Abe’s
ambitions to strengthen Japan’s military and increase defense spending.

Although he has been assiduous about currying favor with Mr. Trump, Mr.
Abe has also pursued a program of diplomacy throughout Southeast Asia,
visiting countries like the Philippines and Vietnam in recent months.

One Achilles’ heel: South Korea. Relations between Tokyo and Seoul are
fraught after Japan [recalled its
envoy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/06/world/asia/japan-south-korea-ambassador-comfort-woman-statue.html)
to South Korea last month to protest a statue commemorating Korean women
who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World
War II.

Analysts said that South Korea is Japan’s most important ally in the
region. “It’s so close and bigger than all of them, except India,” Mr.
Green said. For Japan, he said, South Korea remains “a blind spot.”
