The United States attorney’s office is looking into the way Fox News
handled payments related to sexual harassment cases to determine whether
the company misled investors, according to the lawyer for a woman who is
suing the network.

At a hearing in New York State Supreme Court on Wednesday, the lawyer,
Judd Burstein, who is representing the former Fox anchor Andrea
Tantaros, said that another one of his clients had received a grand jury
subpoena related to Fox News. He did not identify that client.

Mr. Burstein said in a text message that he believed federal
investigators were looking at whether Fox News structured sexual
harassment settlement claims by paying them out in salaries, “so as not
to have to report them.”

He added that the prosecutors had identified themselves as being from a
securities fraud division of the United States attorney’s office in
Manhattan.

In a statement, Fox News said it had not received a subpoena but had
“been in communication with the U.S. attorney’s office for months.”
The statement added that Fox “will continue to cooperate on all
inquiries with any interested authorities.”

The United States attorney’s office declined to comment.

The prospect of a criminal investigation is a surprising escalation of
the [sexual harassment
scandal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/23/business/media/andrea-tantaros-of-fox-news-claims-retaliation-for-harassment-complaints.html)
that engulfed Fox News over the summer and led to the departure of its
chairman, Roger Ailes. After reaching a $20 million settlement with
Gretchen Carlson, [a former anchor who sued Mr.
Ailes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/07/business/media/gretchen-carlson-fox-news-roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html),
and conducting an internal investigation into his conduct, the company
tried hard to put the episode behind it.

The scope of the investigation by the United States attorney’s office,
which appeared to be in the early stages, was not immediately clear. Mr.
Burstein made the remarks while he was arguing that Ms. Tantaros’s case
— she sued the network in August, accusing Fox News of retaliation
after she complained about sexual harassment — should go forward in an
open court. A judge rejected that claim on Wednesday and ruled that her
case would be resolved in arbitration.

In a statement, a spokeswoman for Fox News said, “The court granted Fox
News’s motion to send Andrea Tantaros’s case to arbitration, where it
always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein’s histrionics.”

Asked whether Mr. Ailes had received a subpoena, Susan Estrich, his
lawyer, declined to comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the sexual harassment
allegations.

Ms. Tantaros’s suit asserts that the network’s newsroom resembled “a
sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult.” The suit named a number of Fox
News executives in addition to Mr. Ailes, accusing them of marginalizing
her and removing her from the air after she complained.

Fox News denied the charges, saying that Ms. Tantaros was let go for
violating her contract by writing a book without approval.

In July, Ms. Carlson sued Mr. Ailes for sexual harassment. Fox News’s
parent company, 21st Century Fox, hired the law firm Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to conduct an investigation, and a number of
other women stepped forward with similar accusations, including the
former Fox star Megyn Kelly.
