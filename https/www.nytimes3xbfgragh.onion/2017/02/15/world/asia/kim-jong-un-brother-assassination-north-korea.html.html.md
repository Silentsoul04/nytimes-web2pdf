KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Two more people, one of them a woman with an
Indonesian passport, were arrested Thursday in the assassination of Kim
Jong-nam, the half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, the
Malaysian authorities said as they continued to hunt for conspirators.

The Indonesian, identified as Siti Aishah, 25, is the second woman
arrested in the case. Her appearance matches the image of a woman
captured in airport surveillance videos, said a statement from Khalid
Abu Bakar, the inspector general of police. The police later said in a
statement that Ms. Siti’s boyfriend, a 26-year-old Malaysian, had been
arrested “to assist in investigations.” He was identified as Muhammad
Farid Bin Jalaluddin.

In Jakarta, an official from Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry said that Ms.
Siti was an Indonesian citizen. The Indonesian government has asked for
access to her so that its embassy employees in Kuala Lumpur can provide
legal assistance.

The arrests brought the number of people detained in the case to three.
A woman arrested Wednesday was carrying a Vietnamese passport, but it
remained unclear whether she was from Vietnam.

The news media in Malaysia reported that the police were looking for
four male suspects, suggesting that the plot was more involved than
initially indicated. It was unclear whether the Malaysian man arrested
Thursday was one of the four.

[Kim
Jong-nam](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/15/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-north-korea.html),
45, was preparing to fly to his home in Macau from Kuala Lumpur on
Monday morning when he was [attacked and poisoned by two
women](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/14/world/asia/kim-jong-un-brother-killed-malaysia.html)
at Terminal 2 of the international airport, the authorities said.

The attack occurred near the AirAsia counter where Mr. Kim would have
been checking in for the flight to Macau. The poison took effect
quickly, and he died on the way to a hospital.

While the poisoning of Mr. Kim in a very public place conjured up images
of spy movies, the plot appears to have been rather unsophisticated, and
the Malaysian police rounded up the first two suspects relatively
quickly.

For one, the women appear to have had no getaway car. Photographs from
airport surveillance cameras leaked to the local news media show one
woman waiting with passengers for a taxi outside the airport.

Unlike at some major airports in Asia, departing passengers do not
undergo security screening at the terminal’s entrance, and anyone can
reach the check-in counters well inside the airport without having to
show identification or a ticket.

The authorities were slow to confirm that Mr. Kim was the brother of
North Korea’s leader and initially identified him as Kim Chol, based on
the passport that he was using to fly to Macau.

Malaysia’s deputy prime minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, told reporters on
Thursday that the passport was one of two Mr. Kim was carrying but that
it was authentic. “Probably this is an undercover document,” he said.

Even though Mr. Kim lived with his family in Macau, his body will be
sent to North Korea at the request of the government in Pyongyang, the
capital of North Korea, the Malaysian news media quoted government
officials as saying.

The authorities have said that an autopsy had been completed.
