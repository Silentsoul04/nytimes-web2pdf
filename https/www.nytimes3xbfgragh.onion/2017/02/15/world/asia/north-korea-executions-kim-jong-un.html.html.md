HONG KONG — After Kim Jong-un’s half brother, [Kim
Jong-nam](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/14/world/asia/kim-jong-un-brother-killed-malaysia.html?ref=asia),
was killed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, South Korean officials were quick
to blame the North Korean leader. It would not be the first time that
someone who has fallen out of favor with Kim Jong-un has been targeted
in either a purge or an outright execution. A South Korean think tank,
the Institute for National Security Strategy, [released a report
recently](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/asia/kim-jong-un-executions/)
saying that Mr. Kim had ordered the executions of 340 people since
coming to power in 2011. Some who fall out of favor are not killed but
are abruptly stripped of power.  

## **Ri Yong-ho, purged in 2012**

As Mr. Kim consolidated his rule, he signaled that none of his top
officials were safe [by purging Mr.
Ri](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/07/17/world/asia/north-korea-removes-its-army-chief-from-all-his-posts.html),
his army chief and trusted mentor, with the state news media saying Mr.
Ri had left his posts because of “illness.”

## **Jang Song-thaek, executed in 2013**

In late 2013, Mr. Jang, who was Mr. Kim’s uncle and the country’s
second-most powerful official, was taken [to witness the execution of
his
deputies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/13/world/asia/north-korea-executions-jang-song-thaek.html),
who were torn apart by antiaircraft machine guns before their bodies
were incinerated with flamethrowers. He was said to have fainted during
the ordeal. After he was convicted of treason, he was
[executed](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/13/world/asia/north-korea-says-uncle-of-executed.html?_r=0 "New York Times article")
at the same place and in the same way as his deputies, South Korea’s
intelligence agency said.

The cruelties inside the police state, often reported by defectors, led
to news reports speculating that the North Korean leader may have had
his uncle torn apart by ravenous dogs. ([We got to the bottom of that
tale
here.](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/01/03/inside-the-tale-of-north-korea-execution-by-ravenous-dog/))

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## **Hyon Yong-chol, executed in 2015**

General Hyon, who as minister of the armed forces was the second-highest
officer in North Korea’s military, had apparently [shown disrespect to
Mr.
Kim](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/13/world/asia/north-korea-said-to-execute-a-top-official.html)
by dozing off during military events and second-guessing his orders. He
is believed to have been executed with an antiaircraft gun.

## **Choe Yong-gon, executed in 2015**

Mr. Choe, a vice premier who ran the construction and building materials
industries, [was executed](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33882799)
after he “expressed discomfort against the young leader’s forestation
policy,” according to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency.

## **Kim Yong-jin, executed in 2016**

Mr. Kim, the [deputy premier for
education](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/01/world/asia/north-korea-executes-deputy-premier.html),
had apparently annoyed Kim Jong-un for showing “disrespectful posture”
during a meeting with the North Korean leader. An investigation later
found that the 63-year-old deputy premier was an “anti-party
reactionary” guilty of “modern-day factionalism.” He was executed by
firing squad.

## **Kim Won-hong, purged in 2017**

General Kim, the head of North Korea’s secret police, was considered Kim
Jong-un’s right hand man, but he was [dismissed on charges of corruption
and abuse of
power](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/03/world/asia/north-korea-purge-kim-jong-un-kim-won-hong.html).
The general had been Mr. Kim’s chief henchman in purging potential
enemies.
