HONG KONG --- After Kim Jong-un's half brother,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/14/world/asia/kim-jong-un-brother-killed-malaysia.html?ref=asia}{Kim
Jong-nam}, was killed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, South Korean officials
were quick to blame the North Korean leader. It would not be the first
time that someone who has fallen out of favor with Kim Jong-un has been
targeted in either a purge or an outright execution. A South Korean
think tank, the Institute for National Security Strategy,
\href{http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/asia/kim-jong-un-executions/}{released
a report recently} saying that Mr. Kim had ordered the executions of 340
people since coming to power in 2011. Some who fall out of favor are not
killed but are abruptly stripped of power.

As Mr. Kim consolidated his rule, he signaled that none of his top
officials were safe
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/07/17/world/asia/north-korea-removes-its-army-chief-from-all-his-posts.html}{by
purging Mr. Ri}, his army chief and trusted mentor, with the state news
media saying Mr. Ri had left his posts because of ``illness.''

In late 2013, Mr. Jang, who was Mr. Kim's uncle and the country's
second-most powerful official, was taken
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/13/world/asia/north-korea-executions-jang-song-thaek.html}{to
witness the execution of his deputies}, who were torn apart by
antiaircraft machine guns before their bodies were incinerated with
flamethrowers. He was said to have fainted during the ordeal. After he
was convicted of treason, he was
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/13/world/asia/north-korea-says-uncle-of-executed.html?_r=0}{executed}
at the same place and in the same way as his deputies, South Korea's
intelligence agency said.

The cruelties inside the police state, often reported by defectors, led
to news reports speculating that the North Korean leader may have had
his uncle torn apart by ravenous dogs.
(\href{https://thelede.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/01/03/inside-the-tale-of-north-korea-execution-by-ravenous-dog/}{We
got to the bottom of that tale here.})

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Hyon Yong-chol, executed in

General Hyon, who as minister of the armed forces was the second-highest
officer in North Korea's military, had apparently
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/13/world/asia/north-korea-said-to-execute-a-top-official.html}{shown
disrespect to Mr. Kim} by dozing off during military events and
second-guessing his orders. He is believed to have been executed with an
antiaircraft gun.

Mr. Choe, a vice premier who ran the construction and building materials
industries, \href{http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33882799}{was
executed} after he ``expressed discomfort against the young leader's
forestation policy,'' according to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Kim Yong-jin, executed in

Mr. Kim, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/01/world/asia/north-korea-executes-deputy-premier.html}{deputy
premier for education}, had apparently annoyed Kim Jong-un for showing
``disrespectful posture'' during a meeting with the North Korean leader.
An investigation later found that the 63-year-old deputy premier was an
``anti-party reactionary'' guilty of ``modern-day factionalism.'' He was
executed by firing squad.

General Kim, the head of North Korea's secret police, was considered Kim
Jong-un's right hand man, but he was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/03/world/asia/north-korea-purge-kim-jong-un-kim-won-hong.html}{dismissed
on charges of corruption and abuse of power}. The general had been Mr.
Kim's chief henchman in purging potential enemies.
