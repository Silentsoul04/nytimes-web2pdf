Is this the only known glimpse of Marcel Proust in a motion picture?

A university professor has discovered silent black-and-white film
footage from 1904 showing a man wearing a bowler hat descending church
steps at a wedding in Paris.

The professor,
\href{http://www.lit.ulaval.ca/personnel/professeurs/sirois-trahan-jean-pierre/}{Jean-Pierre
Sirois-Trahan}, of Laval University in Canada, discovered the film in
archives in Paris, he said. The scene provides but a glimpse of the man
(four seconds into the footage), but Prof. Sirois-Trahan believes it
could just be the only known footage of the influential French author.

``We can never prove it beyond all doubt,'' he said in an interview by
email. ``I try to support the hypothesis and to each decide for
himself.''

He said if it indeed was Proust walking carefully down the steps,
glancing from side to side, then the world would for the first time be
able to see the author in the powerful medium of film, which he said
brings the past ``alive.''

\href{http://www.proust-ink.com/}{Professor William C. Carter}, author
of a Proust biography, said that Proust, who died in 1922 at 51, would
have been 34 at the time of the film. He said Proust was known to have
attended the wedding in Paris. While there exist many photographs of
Proust, there is no recording of the author's voice and no known film
footage, he said.

``It would be very important that we have this brief image of Proust in
motion,'' he said. Several experts had contacted him and were convinced
it is Proust, he said, but he is not so sure.

``We would all like that to be Proust,'' he said. ``I am not saying it's
not Proust. It would be helpful if we could see his eyes or his hair.''

He said the man shown on the film looked a little too young for 34.

Professor Sirois-Trahan said the marriage was of a friend of Proust,
Armand de Guiche, with Elaine Greffulhe, in the church of the Madeleine
in Paris.

According to the
\href{http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/proust-on-film/}{British
Times Literary Supplement}, Elaine was daughter of the Count and the
Countess Greffulhe, who is said to have been an inspiration for the
Duchess of Guermantes in Proust's novel.
