# How the North Korean Nuclear Threat Has Grown

When North Korea [tested a
missile](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html)that
fell harmlessly into the sea this month, it was more than just an
attempt by its 33-year-old leader, [Kim
Jong-un](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/kim-jongun), to
jolt a new American president. Arms experts observed something new:
solid-fuel technology that makes such missiles easier to hide and launch
quickly. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has progressed in four
areas that bear watching: arsenal size, bomb strength, missile
technology and ability to elude detection.

### **Arsenal size: small, but thought to be growing**

Knowledge of the weapons stockpile is based on estimates. Experts say
that North Korea has fewer than [10 nuclear
weapons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/12/23/world/nuclear-weapon-countries.html).
Satellite imagery of North Korea’s nuclear complex in Yongbyon, combined
with official North Korean propaganda photos and recent nuclear tests,
suggests that the country could rapidly expand its arsenal. By one
estimate, the country now has enough plutonium and highly [enriched
uranium to build 20 to 25 nuclear
weapons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/12/opinion/the-us-must-talk-to-north-korea.html).

### **Explosive power: from one kiloton to 10 kilotons in 10 years**

The explosive force of North Korea’s first nuclear device, [tested in
October 2006](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/10/09/world/asia/09korea.html),
was less than a kiloton, which is 1,000 tons of TNT. Its second test,
[in 2009](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/05/25/world/asia/25nuke.html),
had more than double that force.

By
[January 2016](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-test.html),
the country claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb in a fourth test,
but outside monitors expressed skepticism. Seismic readings suggested an
explosive force of four to six kilotons.

Seismic readings of North Korea’s fifth test, in
[September 2016](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/10/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-tests.html),
however, registered a force of approximately 10 kilotons, according to
South Korea’s Defense Ministry.

### **Technology: missiles could reach continental U.S. by 2026**

In 1999, [George J.
Tenet](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/02/03/world/cia-sees-a-north-korean-missile-threat.html),
then director of the Central Intelligence
Agency,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>said he could hardly
overstate his concern about North Korea’s program, warning that the
Taepodong-1 missile, with a reach of up to 1,243 miles, could deliver
bomb payloads to Alaska and Hawaii.

In the nearly two decades since, the country’s investment in becoming a
nuclear weapons power has succeeded despite diplomacy and international
sanctions. In 2016, Mr. Kim<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>launched dozens of missiles for tests and as shows of military
might. Some missiles could be launched from mobile pads and submarines,
making them easier to hide. They could potentially carry nuclear
warheads, according to Siegfried S. Hecker, emeritus director of the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, birthplace of the atomic
bomb.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

He and other analysts have said they assume North Korea has designed and
demonstrated nuclear warheads that can be mounted on short-range and
perhaps medium-range missiles. Writing in
[September 2016](http://38north.org/2016/09/shecker091216/), Dr. Hecker
said, “Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the
continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or
so.”

### **Covert capability: smaller, more mobile weapons**  

When he became North Korea’s top leader in April 2012, [Mr.
Kim](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/kim_jongun/index.html?inline=nyt-per)
said that his “first, second and third” priorities were to strengthen
the military, and he declared that superiority in military technology
was “no longer monopolized by
imperialists.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Less than
three years later, Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, then commander of United
States forces in South Korea, said he believed that North Korea had
[made a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a
missile.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/25/world/asia/us-commander-sees-key-nuclear-step-by-north-korea.html)

In May 2015, Mr. Kim said North Korea [had the ability to miniaturize
nuclear
weapons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/21/world/asia/north-korea-claims-it-has-built-small-nuclear-warheads.html).
That claim was greeted with skepticism by analysts, but in March 2016
Mr. Kim [was
photographed](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35760797)admiring what
state media described as a home-built warhead. In
[August 2016](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/24/world/asia/north-korea-submarine-missile.html)
North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine,
demonstrating a significant improvement in its ability to strike enemies
stealthily.

The missile test this month, analysts said, further proved that North
Korea was committed to producing more lethal systems that could be
deployed quickly.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">   </span>“The North
Koreans are sincerely paranoid,” said Joshua Pollack, a senior research
associate at the Middlebury Institute’s James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies. “They’re increasingly very blunt about how
they would use these things preemptively.”
