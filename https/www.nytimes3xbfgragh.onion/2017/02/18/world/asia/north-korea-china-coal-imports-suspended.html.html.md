SEOUL, South Korea — China said on Saturday that it was suspending all
imports of coal from North Korea as part of its effort to enact United
Nations Security Council sanctions aimed at stopping the country’s
nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile program.

The ban takes effect on Sunday and will last until the end of the year,
the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a brief statement posted on its
website on Saturday. Chinese trade and aid have long been a vital
economic crutch for North Korea, and the decision strips North Korea of
one of its most important sources of foreign currency.

Coal has accounted for 34 percent to 40 percent of North Korean exports
in the past several years, and almost all of it was shipped to China,
according to South Korean government estimates.

The ban comes six days after the North Korean [test of a ballistic
missile](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html)
that the Security Council condemned as a violation of its resolutions
that prohibited the country from developing and testing ballistic
missile technology.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the test, [North Korea
claimed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/13/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-success.html)
that it had successfully launched a new type of nuclear-capable missile.
It said its intermediate-range Pukguksong-2 missile used a solid-fuel
technology that American experts say will make it harder to detect
missile attacks from the North.

In [the resolution it adopted in
November](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/30/world/asia/north-korea-un-sanctions.html?_r=0)
in response to the North’s fifth and most powerful nuclear test, the
Security Council said that North Korea should not be allowed to export
more than 7.5 million metric tons of coal a year or bring in more than
$400 million in coal sales, whichever limit is met first. It was unclear
whether that cap has already been reached for this year.

Officials of the United States and its allies, including President
Trump, have suggested that China, North Korea’s principal economic
patron, should be more aggressive in enforcing sanctions. But while it
does not approve of the North’s weapons program, China has also been
seen as reluctant to inflict crippling pain on North Korea, for fear
that it might destabilize its Communist neighbor.

In April, China announced that it would ban coal imports from North
Korea as part of the United Nations’ efforts to squeeze the country’s
ability to raise funds for its nuclear and missile programs. But it
allowed exemptions for coal imports for “livelihood” reasons, and
deliveries continued.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not comment on the
suspension after it was announced on Saturday. Calls to the ministry’s
press officer were not answered. On Friday, the Chinese minister of
foreign affairs, Wang Yi, [said at a conference in
Munich](http://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/zyxw/t1439593.shtml) that the United
Nations sanctions of North Korea “must continue to be strictly
implemented.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Wang also argued that only renewed negotiations would offer any
hope of curtailing North Korea’s nuclear weapons development. China has
hosted six-party talks — including itself, South Korea, North Korea, the
United States, Japan and Russia — aimed at a negotiated settlement of
the North Korean nuclear standoff. But those talks have stopped since
2009, and there seems little hope of them restarting anytime soon.

“This situation cannot continue,” Mr. Wang said, “because the ultimate
outcome may be intolerable to all sides.”

Last year, China imported 22.5 million metric tons of coal from North
Korea, an increase of 14.5 percent on the amount in 2015, according to
Chinese [customs statistics](http://www.sxcoal.com/news/4551922/info).
In December, China imported about 2 million tons of North Korean coal.
Mysteel, a Chinese industrial analysis firm, estimated that under the
limits imposed by the sanctions, the coal quota would be used up by
April or May. In 2015, China’s cumulative imports of North Korean coal
reached 7.5 million metric tons by May.

The coal suspension also followed [the assassination of Kim
Jong-nam](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/14/world/asia/kim-jong-un-brother-killed-malaysia.html),
the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, on
Monday at an airport in Malaysia. The Malaysian authorities are
continuing to investigate the case. South Korean officials have
suspected North Korean involvement in the killing of Mr. Kim, who had
been living in Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave.

Some analysts have speculated that the killing may have infuriated
Beijing because Mr. Kim was considered a pro-Chinese candidate to
replace Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, should the current
government in North Korea fall.
