SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Thursday criticized China in
unusually bitter language for tightening sanctions, accusing its
powerful Communist neighbor of “mean behavior” and “dancing to the tune
of the U.S.”

The anti-Beijing commentary carried by the North’s state-run Korean
Central News Agency, did not name China and was written by a writer
named Jong Phil. While it was not a formal government statement,
commentators in North Korea do not depart from the government’s official
position. Mr. Jong left no doubt about his target, referring to “a
neighboring country, which often claims itself to be a ‘friendly
neighbor.’”

Mr. Jong’s commentary came five days after China [announced that it was
suspending all coal
imports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/18/world/asia/north-korea-china-coal-imports-suspended.html)
from North Korea for the rest of the year. China said the ban was part
of its efforts to enforce United Nations sanctions aimed at ending the
North’s nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile programs.

“Its recent measures are, in effect, tantamount to the enemies’ moves to
bring down the social system in the DPRK,” the commentary said, using
the acronym for North Korea’s official name, Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea. “This country, styling itself a big power, is dancing
to the tune of the U.S.”

China imposed the coal ban after [the North Korean test of a ballistic
missile](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html)
that the United Nations Security Council condemned as a violation of its
resolutions. The ban deprived North Korea of one of its most important
sources of hard currency. Coal accounted for nearly 40 percent of its
exports in the past several years, and almost all of it was shipped to
China, according to South Korean government estimates.

Although North Korea’s “juche” ideology emphasizes the nation’s
self-reliance, in reality the country depends on China for 90 percent of
its external
trade.

## What One Photo Tells Us About North Korea’s Nuclear Program

Clues from a single propaganda photo reveal details about North Korea’s
expanding weapons programs and internal politics.

That has led officials in South Korea and the United States to argue
that Beijing should use its economic influence to force the North to
suspend its weapons programs. While pushing for ever tighter sanctions,
some officials have suggested that Beijing was losing patience with the
North Korean regime over its continued tests of nuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles.

But other analysts remain skeptical about China’s willingness to use its
economic leverage. China and North Korea share a deep bond forged
decades ago when their Communist leaders fought together.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

These analysts think that Beijing also fears a destabilized North Korea
more than a nuclear-armed North Korea, and that it considers the country
a vital buffer against the United States military based in South Korea.

They tend to see China’s suspension of coal imports as a warning to
North Korea, and as a deft move to blunt Washington’s criticism that it
was not doing enough to enforce sanctions. China insists that Washington
engage the North in negotiations to solve the nuclear problem.

On Wednesday, an editorial in the state-controlled Global Times of China
said that despite the coal import ban, China’s friendship with North
Korea remained unchanged.

“Chinese sanctions only target at its nuclear weapon program, and we are
firmly opposed to Seoul’s political fantasy against Pyongyang,” it said.

For its part, North Korea maintained a defiant tone. It warned on
Thursday that it would be “utterly childish” to think that the North
would stop building its “nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic
rockets if a few pennies of money is cut off.”
