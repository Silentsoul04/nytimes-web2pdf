HONG KONG --- The Malaysian authorities said on Friday that Kim
Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korea's leader, had been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/23/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-vx-nerve-agent-.html}{killed
by VX nerve agent} applied to his face. The substance, listed as a
chemical weapon, was kept for decades in the arsenals of many
militaries, including that of the United States. But since the
\href{https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/}{Chemical
Weapons Convention} came into force in 1997, most stockpiles globally
have been destroyed.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-nerve-agent}{%
\subsection{What is a nerve agent?}\label{what-is-a-nerve-agent}}

A \href{https://fas.org/programs/bio/chemweapons/cwagents.html}{nerve
agent}, sometimes called nerve gas, acts on the nervous system of an
organism and prevents muscles from functioning properly. The substance
is derived from organophosphate pesticides, and military officials had
envisioned dispersing it over a wide area --- using a specialized
artillery shell or bomb, for instance --- to kill or incapacitate enemy
forces and make the affected area impossible to safely move through.

\subsection{How does it kill you?}\label{how-does-it-kill-you}}

The VX molecule
\href{https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp}{interferes}
with the way glands and muscles function by blocking an enzyme that
allows them to relax. That causes muscles to clench uncontrollably and,
eventually, prevents a victim from being able to breathe. The lethal
dose for VX ranges from about 10 milligrams via skin contact to 25 to 30
milligrams if inhaled. Early symptoms can include pinprick pupils, runny
nose, wheezing and muscle twitching. Death can occur anywhere from
within a few minutes to hours, depending on the dose and the method of
contact.

Injections of
\href{https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/atropine}{atropine}, if
administered quickly after exposure, can
\href{http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a9388/how-it-works-atropine-the-nerve-gas-antidote-15859092/}{counteract}
the lethal effects of VX. The drug counteracts VX's effects on a
neurotransmitter, while another drug, pralidoxime, counteracts
enzyme-related effects, allowing cells to resume functioning normally.
Hospitals generally have atropine on hand; it is commonly used in much
less drastic situations, like dilating pupils for eye exams.
Anticonvulsive drugs like
\href{https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3016\#section=Therapeutic-Uses}{diazepam}
may also be administered. Military forces are often equipped with
autoinjectors, which can be removed from a wrapper and used directly
through clothing or protective gear in the event of an attack.

\hypertarget{has-vx-been-used-before}{%

Not in combat. In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult
\href{http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/03/14/national/history/cult-attraction-aum-shinrikyos-power-persuasion/\#.WK--yW996po}{Aum
Shinrikyo} used homemade VX to poison three people, one of whom died.

In the 1960s, testing of a nerve agent that may have been VX led to the
\href{http://query.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/gst/abstract.html?res=9F05E7DF1639EF3BBC4A51DFB3668382679EDE\&legacy=true}{accidental
deaths} of thousands of sheep in Utah. Syrian government forces are
accused of using a related nerve agent, possibly
\href{https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/}{sarin}, against civilians
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/29/world/middleeast/new-study-refines-view-of-sarin-attack-in-syria.html}{in
2013}.

\hypertarget{how-detectable-is-vx}{%
\subsection{How detectable is VX?}\label{how-detectable-is-vx}}

In its purest form, VX is colorless, tasteless and odorless. But
production often introduces small impurities, turning it light yellow or
amber. It is slightly oily to the touch and is considered not very
volatile, meaning it does not evaporate quickly. Its chemical makeup is
easily detectable through testing, but if medical personnel are not
expecting to encounter it, that testing may not occur.

VX can also be delivered in
\href{https://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/nerve-agents/\#c4114}{``binary''
form}, meaning two relatively harmless compounds can be combined in the
field to create the lethal nerve agent, which may have been the method
used to kill Mr. Kim.

\hypertarget{how-do-you-make-vx}{%
\subsection{How do you make VX?}\label{how-do-you-make-vx}}

Very carefully. Many of the individual ingredients --- sulfur, for
instance --- are easy to come by. Others, like hydrochloric acid gas,
may require some hunting. Obtaining all of them would most likely draw
the attention of some high-ranking law enforcement officials. Making VX
is, essentially, a matter of having the right ingredients; gear like
flasks, distillation equipment and aspirators; and a desire to
manufacture something deadly enough to kill you with a single misplaced
drop.
