KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia --- An Indonesian woman arrested in the murder of
the half brother of North Korea's leader said on Saturday that she was
paid just \$90 to smear what she thought was a harmless liquid on the
face of an unsuspecting man.

The woman, Siti Aisyah, 25, told Indonesian Embassy officials that she
was paid by foreign men for what she thought was a prank for a
television show and did not know that anyone would be harmed.

``She only said in general that someone asked her to carry out this
activity,'' said Andreano Erwin, Indonesia's deputy ambassador to
Malaysia, after meeting with Ms. Siti for about a half-hour. ``She said
that she met with people who looked Japanese or Korean.''

Kim Jong-nam, 46, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader,
Kim Jong-un, died minutes after two women smeared liquid on his face on
Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The Malaysian police
arrested Ms. Siti and another woman, Doan Thi Houng of Vietnam, within
days.

The Malaysian police said on Friday that Kim Jong-nam was poisoned by VX
nerve agent, a chemical banned by international convention that North
Korea is known to possess.

Ms. Siti described the substance she used in the attack as similar to
baby oil.

Malaysia has named seven North Korean men that it says are connected to
the murder.
