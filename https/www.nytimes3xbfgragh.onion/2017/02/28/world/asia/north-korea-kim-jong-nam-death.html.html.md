KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Two women were charged with murder in a Kuala
Lumpur court on Wednesday in connection with the [assassination of Kim
Jong-nam](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/22/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-korea-malaysia.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fasia&action=click&contentCollection=asia&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=26&pgtype=sectionfront),
the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.

28, of Vietnam, could receive the death penalty. The police said the two
women rubbed [a deadly nerve

on Mr. Kim’s face as he prepared to check in for a flight at Kuala
Lumpur International Airport on the morning of Feb. 13.

The women were charged as North Korea began a diplomatic effort to
repair the damage from the killing, sending delegations to Beijing and
Kuala Lumpur in a rare bit of outreach by the reclusive nation as it
faced accusations that it had carried out the brazen assassination.

The delegation to Beijing was led by Vice Foreign Minister Ri Gil-song,
said the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, which did not
provide further details. The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that Mr.
Ri was visiting at its invitation and would meet with China’s foreign
minister, Wang Yi.

Mr. Ri is the most senior North Korean official to visit Beijing since a
delegation met with President Xi Jinping of China in May. His trip came
five days after the [North lashed out at
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/23/world/asia/north-korea-china.html)
in unusually bitter language for tightening sanctions by [suspending all
coal
imports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/18/world/asia/north-korea-china-coal-imports-suspended.html)
from North Korea for the rest of the year, depriving North Korea of one
of its most important sources of hard currency.

The two women charged in Mr. Kim’s murder were arrested soon after the
Feb. 13 attack and have said they thought they were participating in a
prank.

The police have also arrested a North Korean man, Ri Jong-chol, and are
[seeking seven
others](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/27/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-state-security.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fasia&action=click&contentCollection=asia&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=7&pgtype=sectionfront).
South Korean officials have accused the North Korean government of
ordering the assassination. There was no word yet on whether Malaysian
officials would charge Ri Jong-chol in the attack.

With relations between Malaysia and North Korea fraying over the
killing, a high-level North Korean delegation, including the former
deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ri Dong-il, arrived in the
Malaysian capital to discuss taking Mr. Kim’s body to North Korea, the
South Korean news agency Yonhap reported from Kuala Lumpur.

Ri Dong-il, the envoy, said he also would demand the release of Ri
Jong-chol, Yonhap reported.

“We are here to discuss human rights issues and find an agreement,” Mr.
Ri told reporters outside the North Korean Embassy.

North Korea is widely considered to have one of the world’s worst human
rights records, one that includes enslavement and torture of political
prisoners, extrajudicial executions and forced abortions.

Mr. Ri also said he would discuss “strengthening friendly relations”
with Malaysia.

Whether Malaysia is prepared to discuss friendly relations remains to be
seen. Officials at the Malaysian Foreign Ministry declined to comment on
the standoff over the release of the body and the detention of the North
Korean suspect.
