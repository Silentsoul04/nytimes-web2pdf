KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia --- A North Korean diplomat suggested on Thursday
that Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the country's leader,
died of heart failure despite Malaysia's finding that he was killed by a
banned nerve agent.

The diplomat, Ri Tong-il, who is leading a delegation to Malaysia, made
the surprising assertion in Kuala Lumpur, the capital, during a visit
aimed at repairing a diplomatic breach over the death. He said Mr. Kim
had a history of heart disease and high blood pressure for which he
needed medication.

But while asserting the cause of Mr. Kim's death, without providing any
evidence, he stood by his country's refusal to acknowledge that the
victim was the half brother of Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea,
instead calling him by the name Kim Chol, which South Korean officials
have said is an alias.

He also called on Malaysia to provide samples of the VX nerve agent that
the police say they found on the body to the international organization
charged with carrying out the global treaty that bans the use of
chemical weapons.

``If it is true that it was used,'' he told reporters, ``then the
samples should be sent to the office'' of the group, the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, for examination.

The Malaysian government said it has indeed reported the use of VX to
the organization, which must now decide whether to bring the matter
before the United Nations Security Council.

``The ministry is in close contact with the O.P.C.W. regarding the
recent incident and the latter has provided the Malaysian authority with
some technical materials that have been requested to assist in its
investigation,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday.

But the organization has declined to say whether Malaysia had provided
it with samples for independent testing. Malaysian officials have also
declined to comment on that question.

South Korea has accused the North of orchestrating the killing, and the
Malaysian police have identified seven North Korean men they would like
to question. North Korea has refused to allow the police to interview
two of the suspects, who are said to have taken
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/01/world/asia/malaysia-kim-jong-nam-embassy-immunity.html}{refuge
at the embassy} where Mr. Ri addressed reporters.

Four others are believed to have returned to North Korea, and the
location of the last one is unknown. An eighth, the only North Korean
citizen in Malaysian custody, is expected to be released for lack of
evidence and deported, according to news reports.

Malaysia has not allowed North Korean officials to conduct their own
examination of the body, despite their repeated demands that it be
turned over to them.

In a statement on Wednesday, North Korea argued that any conclusion on
the use of chemical weapons should be made ``only on the basis of the
identical results of analysis made by at least two specialist
laboratories,'' warning that ``if some countries try to use it for other
political purposes, the consequences will be beyond imagination.''

The latest assertions came as Malaysia moved on Thursday to punish North
Korea for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/22/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-korea-malaysia.html}{the
airport assassination of Mr. Kim}, saying that it would require visitors
from that country to obtain visas, the government said.

Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the deputy prime minister, imposed the restrictions
effective this coming Monday, citing national security concerns. Until
now, North Koreans have been able to enter Malaysia without a visa ---
one of the few places in the world that allowed such easy access for
citizens of a country that is widely viewed as a pariah.

About 1,000 North Koreans live and work in Malaysia, where they have
been able to establish international companies and have access to the
global banking system. But relations between the two nations have
rapidly deteriorated since the killing of Mr. Kim and accusations that
North Korea was behind it.

It was unclear whether the visa order would affect North Koreans who are
already in Malaysia.

Mr. Kim was poisoned on Feb. 13 as he prepared to board a plane at Kuala
Lumpur International Airport, the police say. Two women, one from
Indonesia and one from Vietnam,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/28/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-death.html}{were
charged} with murder in the case on Wednesday. The police say they
smeared the poison on Mr. Kim's face using their bare hands. The women
have said they thought they were taking part in a harmless prank. They
could receive the death penalty.

Vietnam's Foreign Ministry
\href{http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns170227105211}{said} on
Thursday that it had been helping to provide legal support to the
Vietnamese suspect, Doan Thi Huong, 28, whom Malaysian officials have
described as an ``entertainment outlet employee'' recruited, trained and
equipped by North Korean plotters.

It was Vietnam's most detailed statement about the suspect, who received
a surge of domestic sympathy after she was shown in television news
clips on Wednesday leaving a Malaysian court wearing a bulletproof vest.

Vietnam was relatively slow to even acknowledge the nationality of Ms.
Doan after she had been arrested. By contrast, her Indonesian
co-defendant, Siti Aisyah, 25, received early and strong
\href{http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/02/17/siti-aisyah-a-victim-says-indonesia-vice-president/}{support}
from Indonesian officials.
