KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said Friday that
it was “greatly concerned” by the use of a banned chemical weapon in a
public place to assassinate Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North
Korea’s leader, and has asked for international help in responding to
the episode.

“The ministry strongly condemns the use of such a chemical weapon by
anyone, anywhere and under any circumstances,” the ministry said in a
statement. “Its use at a public place could have endangered the general
public.”

Malaysia has reported the use of the toxic chemical, [VX nerve
agent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/24/world/asia/vx-nerve-agent-kim-jong-nam.html?_r=0),
to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which
monitors chemical weapons banned under international conventions. The
organization must now decide whether to bring the matter of the
chemical’s illegal use before the United Nations Security Council.

Analysis of chemical residue on Mr. Kim found it to be VX nerve agent.
South Korea has blamed the North for the killing. The Malaysian police
have identified seven North Korean men who remain wanted for questioning
in the case.

If there is compelling evidence that North Korea used the substance, the
United States and its allies can push for a resolution against the North
at the Security Council and for new sanctions. Washington can also place
the North back on its terrorism-sponsor blacklist.

But North Korea has already been under heavy sanctions for decades, and
analysts say that new steps against the North will have a largely
symbolic effect of “naming and shaming.” Such a move could further
dampen what is an already weak desire to start dialogue with the North
to address its growing
[nuclear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/subject/north-koreas-nuclear-program)
and
[missile](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html)
threats, they said.

Malaysia reported the incident to the O.P.C.W. soon after the discovery
that the poison was VX nerve agent, and since then the organization has
been providing Malaysia with assistance in its investigation of the
killing.

“The ministry is in close contact with the O.P.C.W. regarding the recent
incident and the latter has provided the Malaysian authority with some
technical materials that have been requested to assist in its
investigation,” the ministry said.

Mr. Kim, the elder brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, [was
killed on
Feb. 13](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/22/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-korea-malaysia.html)
at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by two foreign women who smeared
his face with poison, the police say. The two women, one from Indonesia
and one from Vietnam, [have been charged with
murder](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/28/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-death.html).

North Korea, which has not been allowed to examine Mr. Kim’s body,
asserts that [he died of heart
failure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/01/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-north-korea-visa-malaysia.html).
North Korean officials contend that it is absurd for Malaysia to say
that VX nerve agent was used since it is so toxic that many others at
the airport also would have died.

After Malaysia reported the use of the chemical, representatives of the
O.P.C.W. came to Kuala Lumpur to provide assistance, one official said.

“The government of Malaysia will fully cooperate with the O.P.C.W. and
other international organizations to bring the perpetrators to justice,”
the ministry said.

The Malaysian authorities on Friday released Ri Jong-chol, the only
North Korean detained in the killing so far, and handed him over to
immigration officials for deportation. The police also issued an arrest
warrant for Kim Uk-il, 37, a North Korean who works for Air Koryo, the
national airline. The authorities have said that they believed Mr. Kim
was at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur along with another
suspect, Hyon Kwang-song, an embassy employee.
