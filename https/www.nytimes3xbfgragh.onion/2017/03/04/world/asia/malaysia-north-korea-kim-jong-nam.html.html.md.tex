BANGKOK --- The government of Malaysia declared North Korea's ambassador
``persona non grata'' on Saturday and gave him 48 hours to leave the
country, a major break in diplomatic relations after the airport
assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korea's leader.

The decision to expel Ambassador Kang Chol came after he failed to
appear at Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as requested. Earlier,
Mr. Kang had ignored a request to apologize for several inflammatory
statements, including questioning the police finding that Mr. Kim was
murdered with a banned nerve agent.

``It should be made clear --- Malaysia will react strongly against any
insults made against it or any attempt to tarnish its reputation,''
Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said in a statement announcing the
expulsion order.

Mr. Kim, the elder half brother of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/14/world/asia/kim-jong-un-brother-killed-malaysia.html}{died
on Feb. 13} less than 20 minutes after two women wiped poison on his
face as he prepared to check in for a flight at Kuala Lumpur
International Airport.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/28/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-death.html}{The
women, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, have been charged with
murder}.

The police are seeking seven North Korean men in the case, including two
believed by the authorities to have taken refuge at the North Korean
Embassy.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/20/world/asia/north-korea-assassination-kim-jong-un-brother-malaysia.html}{South
Korea has accused the North Korean government of masterminding the
attack}.

Mr. Kang, using unusually blunt language for a diplomat, had said that
North Korea ``cannot trust'' the Malaysian police investigation. He
charged that it was politically motivated and accused Malaysia of
colluding with outside powers to defame North Korea.

Mr. Kang referred to Kim Jong-nam only by the name on the passport he
was carrying, Kim Chol, and sought to have his body handed over to the
embassy before an autopsy could be performed. He subsequently challenged
Malaysia's finding that Mr. Kim had been killed with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/24/world/asia/vx-nerve-agent-kim-jong-nam.html}{the
nerve agent VX}, a highly toxic chemical weapon known to be in North
Korea's arsenal but banned under international conventions.

The Foreign Ministry had set a deadline of 5 p.m. last Tuesday for Mr.
Kang to apologize for his statements.

``Almost four days have passed since the deadline lapsed,'' the foreign
minister said in his statement. ``No such apology has been made, neither
has there been any indication that one is forthcoming. For this reason,
the ambassador has been declared persona non grata.''

Mr. Anifah noted that the police had released a North Korean man
arrested in the case, Ri Jong Chol, for lack of evidence on Friday. He
said it was ``proof that the investigation is conducted in an impartial,
fair and transparent manner, as befits a country that practices the rule
of law.''

Declaring an ambassador persona non grata is one of the harshest
measures a country can take short of breaking off diplomatic relations.
Malaysia had previously recalled its ambassador from North Korea for
consultations and there was no indication when he might be sent back.

Some Malaysians have questioned why the country has an embassy in North
Korea, given that there is little trade between the countries and few
Malaysian tourists venture there.

On Thursday, Malaysia announced that it would end its practice of
allowing North Koreans to enter without a visa, effective Monday.

About 1,000 North Koreans live and work in Malaysia, where they can help
bring in foreign currency for their isolated country, which has
struggled economically under international sanctions.
