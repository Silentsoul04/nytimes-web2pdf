<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Three years ago, President Barack Obama ordered Pentagon
officials to step up their cyber and electronic strikes against North
Korea’s missile program in hopes of sabotaging test launches in their
opening seconds.

Soon a large number of the North’s military rockets began to explode,
veer off course, disintegrate in midair and plunge into the sea.
Advocates of such efforts say they believe that targeted attacks have
given American antimissile defenses a new edge and delayed by several
years the day when North Korea will be able to threaten American cities
with nuclear weapons launched atop intercontinental ballistic missiles.

But other experts have grown increasingly skeptical of the new approach,
arguing that manufacturing errors, disgruntled insiders and sheer
incompetence can also send missiles awry. Over the past eight months,
they note, the North has managed to successfully launch three
medium-range rockets. And Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, now
claims his country is in “the final stage in preparations” for the
inaugural test of his intercontinental missiles — perhaps a bluff,
perhaps not.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

An examination of the Pentagon’s disruption effort, based on interviews
with officials of the Obama and Trump administrations as well as a
review of extensive but obscure public records, found that the United
States still does not have the ability to effectively counter the North
Korean nuclear and missile programs. Those threats are far more
resilient than many experts thought, The New York Times’s reporting
found, and pose such a danger that Mr. Obama, as he left office, warned
President Trump they were likely to be the most urgent problem he would
confront.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has signaled his preference to respond aggressively against
the North Korean threat. [In a Twitter
post](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/02/world/asia/trump-twitter-north-korea-missiles-china.html?_r=0)
after Mr. Kim first issued his warning on New Year’s Day, the president
wrote, “It won’t happen\!” Yet like Mr. Obama before him, Mr. Trump is
quickly discovering that he must choose from highly imperfect options.

He could order the escalation of the Pentagon’s cyber and electronic
warfare effort, but that carries no guarantees. He could open
negotiations with the North to freeze its nuclear and missile programs,
but that would leave a looming threat in place. He could prepare for
direct missile strikes on the launch sites, which Mr. Obama also
considered, but there is little chance of hitting every target. He could
press the Chinese to cut off trade and support, but Beijing has always
stopped short of steps that could lead to the regime’s collapse.

In two meetings of Mr. Trump’s national security deputies in the
Situation Room, the most recent on Tuesday, all those options were
discussed, along with the possibility of reintroducing nuclear weapons
to South Korea as a dramatic warning. Administration officials say those
issues will soon go to Mr. Trump and his top national security aides.

The decision to intensify the cyber and electronic strikes, in early
2014, came after Mr. Obama concluded that [the $300 billion
spent](http://wmdjunction.com/120413_missile_defense_costs.htm) since
the Eisenhower era on traditional antimissile systems, often compared to
hitting “a bullet with a bullet,” had failed the core purpose of
protecting the continental United States. Flight tests of interceptors
based in Alaska and California had an overall [failure
rate](https://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/testrecord.pdf) of 56
percent, under near-perfect conditions. Privately, many experts warned
the system would fare worse in real combat.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So the Obama administration searched for a better way to destroy
missiles. It reached for techniques the Pentagon had long been
experimenting with under the rubric of “[left of
launch](http://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/alert/3132/),” because the
attacks begin before the missiles ever reach the launchpad, or just as
they lift off. For years, the Pentagon’s most senior officers and
officials have publicly advocated these kinds of sophisticated attacks
in little-noticed testimony to Congress and at defense conferences.

The Times inquiry began last spring as the number of the North’s missile
failures soared. The investigation uncovered the military documents
praising the new antimissile approach and found some pointing with
photos and diagrams to North Korea as one of the most urgent targets.

After discussions with the office of the director of national
intelligence last year and in recent days with Mr. Trump’s national
security team, The Times agreed to withhold details of those efforts to
keep North Korea from learning how to defeat them. Last fall, Mr. Kim
was [widely
reported](https://www.nknews.org/2016/10/kim-jong-un-to-investigate-espionage-linked-to-failed-missile-launch-report/)
to have ordered an investigation into whether the United States was
sabotaging North Korea’s launches, and over the past week he has
[executed senior security
officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2017/02/27/world/asia/ap-as-north-korea-executions.html).

The approach taken in targeting the North Korean missiles has distinct
echoes of the American- and Israeli-led [sabotage of Iran’s nuclear
program](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html),
the most sophisticated known use of a cyberweapon meant to cripple a
nuclear threat. But even that use of the “Stuxnet” worm in Iran quickly
ran into limits. It was effective for several years, until the Iranians
figured it out and recovered. And Iran posed a relatively easy target:
an underground nuclear enrichment plant that could be attacked
repeatedly.

In North Korea, the target is much more challenging. Missiles are fired
from multiple launch sites around the country and moved about on mobile
launchers in an elaborate shell game meant to deceive adversaries. To
strike them, timing is critical.

Advocates of the sophisticated effort to remotely manipulate data inside
North Korea’s missile systems argue the United States has no real
alternative because the effort to stop the North from learning the
secrets of making nuclear weapons has already failed. The only hope now
is stopping the country from developing an intercontinental missile, and
demonstrating that destructive threat to the
world.

“Disrupting their tests,” William J. Perry, secretary of defense in the
Clinton administration, [said at a recent
presentation](http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-0109-38-North-Press-Briefing-Transcript.pdf)
in Washington, would be “a pretty effective way of stopping their ICBM
program.”

## Decades in the Making

Three generations of the Kim family have dreamed that their broken,
otherwise failed nation could build its own nuclear weapons, and the
missiles to deliver them, as the ultimate survival strategy. With nukes
in hand, the Kims have calculated, they need not fear being overrun by
South Korea, invaded by the United States or sold out by China.

North Korea began seeking an intercontinental ballistic missile decades
ago: It was the dream of Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder, who
bitterly remembered the American threats to use nuclear weapons against
the North during the Korean War.

His break came after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when [out-of-work
Russian rocket scientists began seeking
employment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/10/science/north-korea-nuclear-weapons.html)
in North Korea. Soon, a new generation of North Korean missiles began to
appear, all knockoffs of Soviet designs. Though flight tests were
sparse, American experts marveled at how the North seemed to avoid the
kinds of failures that typically strike new rocket programs, including
those of the United States in the late
1950s.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The success was so marked that Timothy McCarthy of the Middlebury
Institute of International Studies at Monterey [wrote in a 2001
analysis](http://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/40268/inc_barletta_op6.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)that
Pyongyang’s record “appears completely unique in the history of missile
development and production.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In response, President George W. Bush [in late 2002
announced](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/12/18/world/threats-responses-defense-antimissile-system-limited-form-ordered-bush.html)
the deployment of antimissile interceptors in Alaska and California. At
the same time, Mr. Bush accelerated programs to get inside the long
supply chain of parts for North Korean missiles, lacing them with
defects and weaknesses, a technique also used for years against Iran.

## Threat Grows in Obama Era

By the time Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, the North had
[deployed hundreds of short- and medium-range
missiles](https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/npr_18-2_pollack_ballistic-trajectory.pdf)
that used Russian designs, and had made billions of dollars selling its
Scud missiles to Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates
and Yemen. But it aspired to a new generation of missiles that could
fire warheads over much longer distances.

In secret cables written in the first year of the Obama administration,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out the emerging threat. Among
the most alarming [released by
WikiLeaks](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/world/statessecrets.html),
the cables described a new path the North was taking to reach its
long-range goal, based on a missile designed by the Soviets decades ago
for their submarines that carried thermonuclear warheads.

It was [called the
R-27](http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WMRUS_R-27.php). Unlike the
North’s lumbering, older rockets and missiles, these would be small
enough to hide in caves and move into position by truck. The advantage
was clear: This missile would be far harder for the United States to
find and
destroy.

“North Korea’s next goal may be to develop a mobile ICBM that would be
capable of threatening targets around the world,” [said an October 2009
cable](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08STATE105029_a.html) marked
“Secret” and signed by Mrs. Clinton.

The next year, one of the new missiles [showed
up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-10) in a North Korean military
parade, just as the intelligence reports had warned.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By 2013, North Korean rockets thundered with new regularity. And that
February, the North [set off a nuclear
test](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/02/12/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html?ref=global-home)
that woke up Washington: The monitoring data told of an explosion
roughly the size of the bomb that had leveled Hiroshima.

Days after the explosion, the [Pentagon
announced](http://archive.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1759)
an expansion of its force of antimissile interceptors in California and
Alaska. It also began to unveil its “left of launch” program to disable
missiles before liftoff — hoping to bolster its chances of destroying
them. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[announced the
program](http://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Publications/JointIAMDVision2020.pdf),
saying that “cyberwarfare, directed energy and electronic attack,” a
reference to such things as malware, lasers and signal jamming, were all
becoming important new adjuncts to the traditional ways of deflecting
enemy
strikes.

He never mentioned North Korea. But a map accompanying General Dempsey’s
policy paper on the subject showed one of the North’s missiles streaking
toward the United States. Soon, in testimony before Congress and at
public panels in Washington, current and former officials and a major
contractor — Raytheon — began talking openly about “left of launch”
technologies, in particular cyber and electronic strikes at the moment
of launch.

The North, meanwhile, was developing its own exotic arsenal. It tried
repeatedly to disrupt American and South Korean military exercises by
[jamming electronic
signals](http://www.upi.com/North-Korea-jams-Souths-guided-missiles/49341299621609/)
for guided weapons, including missiles. And it demonstrated its
cyberpower in the oddest of places — Hollywood. In 2014, [it
attacked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html?_r=0)
Sony Pictures Entertainment with a strike that destroyed about 70
percent of the company’s computing systems, surprising experts with its
technical savvy.

Last month, a [report on cybervulnerabilities by the Defense Science
Board](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2010s/DSB-CyberDeterrenceReport_02-28-17_Final.pdf),
commissioned by the Pentagon during the Obama administration, warned
that North Korea might acquire the ability to cripple the American power
grid, and cautioned that it could never be allowed to “hold vital U.S.
strike systems at risk.”

## Secret Push, and New Doubts

Not long after General Dempsey made his public announcement, Mr. Obama
and his defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, began calling meetings
focused on one question: Could a crash program slow the North’s march
toward an intercontinental ballistic missile?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There were many options, some drawn from General Dempsey’s list. Mr.
Obama ultimately pressed the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to pull
out all the stops, which officials took as encouragement to reach for
untested technologies.

The North’s missiles soon began to [fail at a remarkable
pace](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/nd-b5.htm). Some were
destroyed, no doubt, by accident as well as by design. The technology
the North was pursuing, using new designs and new engines, involved
multistage rockets, introducing all kinds of possibilities for
catastrophic mistakes. But by most accounts, the United States program
accentuated the failures.

The evidence was in the numbers. Most flight tests of an
intermediate-range missile called the Musudan, the weapon that the North
Koreans showed off in public just after Mrs. Clinton’s warning, ended in
flames: Its overall failure rate is 88 percent.

Nonetheless Kim Jong-un has pressed ahead on his main goal: an
intercontinental ballistic missile. Last April, he was photographed
standing next to a giant test-stand, celebrating after engineers
[successfully fired off a matched
pair](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/kn-14-first-stage-main-engine-cluster-static-test-firing-4-9-2016.htm)
of the potent Russian-designed R-27 engines. The implication was clear:
Strapping two of the engines together at the base of a missile was the
secret to building an ICBM that could ultimately hurl warheads at the
United States.

In September, he celebrated the [most successful test
yet](http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/north-koreas-nuclear-year-reviewand-whats-next/)
of a North Korean nuclear weapon — one that exploded with more than
twice the destructive force of the Hiroshima bomb.

His next goal, experts say, is to combine those two technologies,
shrinking his nuclear warheads to a size that can fit on an
intercontinental missile. Only then can he credibly claim that his
isolated country has the know-how to hit an American city thousands of
miles away.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the last year of his presidency, Mr. Obama often noted publicly that
the North was learning from every nuclear and missile test — even the
failures — and getting closer to its goal. In private, aides noticed he
was increasingly disturbed by North Korea’s progress.

With only a few months left in office, he pushed aides for new
approaches. At one meeting, he declared that he would have targeted the
North Korean leadership and weapons sites if he thought it would work.
But it was, as Mr. Obama and his assembled aides knew, an empty threat:
Getting timely intelligence on the location of North Korea’s leaders or
their weapons at any moment would be almost impossible, and the risks of
missing were tremendous, including renewed war on the Korean
Peninsula.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump complained that “[we're so
obsolete in
cyber](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-transcript.html?_r=0),”
a line that grated on officials at the United States Cyber Command and
the National Security Agency, where billions of dollars have been spent
to provide the president with new options for intelligence gathering and
cyberattacks. Now, one of the immediate questions he faces is whether to
accelerate or scale back those efforts.

A decision to go after an adversary’s launch ability can have unintended
consequences, experts warn.

Once the United States uses cyberweapons against nuclear launch systems
— even in a threatening state like North Korea — Russia and China may
feel free to do the same, targeting fields of American missiles. Some
strategists argue that all nuclear systems should be off limits for
cyberattack. Otherwise, if a nuclear power thought it could secretly
disable an adversary’s atomic controls, it might be more tempted to take
the risk of launching a pre-emptive attack.

“I understand the urgent threat,” said Amy Zegart, a Stanford University
intelligence and cybersecurity expert, who said she had no independent
knowledge of the American effort. “But 30 years from now we may decide
it was a very, very dangerous thing to do.”

Mr. Trump’s aides say everything is on the table. China recently [cut
off coal
imports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/24/world/asia/china-north-korea-relations-kim-jong-un.html)
from the North, but the United States is also looking at ways to freeze
the Kim family’s assets, some of which are believed held in
Chinese-controlled banks. The Chinese have already [opposed the
deployment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/08/world/asia/south-korea-and-us-agree-to-deploy-missile-defense-system.html)
of a high-altitude missile defense system known as Thaad in South Korea;
the Trump team may call for even more such systems.

The White House is also looking at pre-emptive military strike options,
a senior Trump administration official said, though the challenge is
huge given the country’s mountainous terrain and deep tunnels and
bunkers. Putting American tactical nuclear weapons back in South Korea —
they were withdrawn a quarter-century ago — is also under consideration,
even if that step could accelerate an arms race with the North.

Mr. Trump’s “It won’t happen\!” post on Twitter about the North’s ICBM
threat suggests a larger confrontation could be looming.

“Regardless of Trump’s actual intentions,” James M. Acton, a nuclear
analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, [recently
noted](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/trump-twitter-north-korea/512450/),
“the tweet could come to be seen as a ‘red line’ and hence set up a
potential test of his credibility.”
