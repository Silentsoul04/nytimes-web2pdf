BANGKOK — North Korea said Tuesday that it was barring all Malaysians
from leaving the country until there was a “fair settlement” of a
dispute over the assassination in Kuala Lumpur of [Kim
Jong-nam](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/15/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-north-korea.html),
the half brother of North Korea’s leader.

Malaysia responded in kind, with Prime Minister Najib Razak instructing
the police to prevent all North Koreans from leaving Malaysia until he
was assured of the safety of Malaysians in North Korea.

The developments were a drastic escalation in the diplomatic dispute
over [Mr. Kim’s
killing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/22/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-korea-malaysia.html).
The Malaysian police have said that several North Koreans are suspects.

“This abhorrent act, effectively holding our citizens hostage, is in
total disregard of all international law and diplomatic norms,” Mr.
Najib said of North Korea’s action.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Najib convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council
in the evening.

In its statement on Tuesday, North Korea said it would “temporarily ban
the exit of Malaysian citizens” until the safety of North Korean
diplomats and citizens in Malaysia is “fully guaranteed through the fair
settlement of the case that occurred in Malaysia,” the state-run Korean
Central News Agency reported.

It was unclear what resolution to the Kim case North Korea was seeking.
But it has rejected the findings of the Malaysian police that [Mr. Kim
was
poisoned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/02/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-malaysia.html)
by VX nerve agent at the Malaysian capital’s international airport on
Feb. 13, and it has demanded that his body be handed over to the North
Korean Embassy.

The Malaysian police want to question several North Koreans in the case,
including a diplomat.

Malaysian officials said there were 11 Malaysians in the North who could
be affected by the North Korean ban, including embassy staff members,
their family and two workers for the United Nations.

After the security council meeting, Mr. Najib [posted on his Twitter
account](https://twitter.com/NajibRazak/status/839133732489441280): “I
know that the family and friends of our fellow Malaysians detained in
North Korea are anxiously anticipating news of their loved ones.” He
added in a [second
posting](https://twitter.com/NajibRazak/status/839135526946914304): “You
can rest assured that we are doing our very best to secure their safe
return.”

About 1,000 North Koreans are believed to live and work in Malaysia;
until Monday, they had been allowed to enter the country without a visa.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As a peace-loving nation, Malaysia is committed to maintaining friendly
relations with all countries,” Mr. Najib said on Tuesday. “However,
protecting our citizens is my first priority, and we will not hesitate
to take all measures necessary when they are threatened.”

Mr. Kim, the elder half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un,
was killed when two women rubbed poison on his face at Kuala Lumpur
International Airport, the Malaysian police said. The women, one from
Vietnam and one from Indonesia, have been arrested and [charged with
murder](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/28/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-death.html).

The Malaysian police, who conducted an autopsy of Mr. Kim’s body over
North Korea’s objections, concluded that he had been poisoned by [VX
nerve
agent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/24/world/asia/vx-nerve-agent-kim-jong-nam.html),
a banned chemical weapon known to be in North Korea’s arsenal. North
Korea has suggested that he [died of heart
failure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/01/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-north-korea-visa-malaysia.html)
and accused Malaysia of working with other countries to defame North
Korea.

“Once it denied responsibility for the assassination, North Korea had no
option but to push back in a tit-for-tat escalation,” Kim Yong-hyun, a
professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, South
Korea, said on Tuesday. “Offense is the best defense for the North.”

Preventing the Malaysians from leaving North Korea would also give the
government continuing leverage over Malaysia. If the Malaysians had been
free to leave, Malaysia could have broken off diplomatic relations
without any significant political cost.

That would have led to the closing of the North Korean Embassy, with at
least one suspect who has taken refuge there no longer safe from arrest.

The suspect, Kim Uk-il, an employee of the state-owned North Korean
airline, Air Koryo, could be arrested if the embassy were closed. A
second suspect who the police say may be hiding at the embassy, Ri Ji-u,
also known as James, would also be subject to arrest.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A third suspect, Hyon Kwang-song, a second secretary at the embassy, has
diplomatic immunity and could not be arrested.

“If we break diplomatic ties, then all the embassy staff have to leave
Malaysia, but the staff with diplomatic immunity at the time of the
offense is still safe and must be allowed to leave,” said Sivananthan
Nithyanantham, a Malaysian lawyer who has served as counsel at the
International Criminal Court in The Hague. “The airline worker then
loses his sanctuary and will be liable to arrest.”

The police are seeking seven North Korean men in connection with Mr.
Kim’s killing. The other four are believed to have returned to North
Korea.

Khalid Abu Bakar, Malaysia’s top police official, confirmed at a news
conference on Tuesday that at least two suspects had [taken refuge at
the North Korean
Embassy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/01/world/asia/malaysia-kim-jong-nam-embassy-immunity.html)
and that North Korea had refused a request to hand them over.

“The North Korean authorities are not cooperating with us in this
investigation,” he said.

He said the police would wait as long as necessary to arrest Mr. Kim,
the airline employee, and Mr. Ri, if he is there.

“If it takes five years, we will wait outside,” he said. “Definitely
somebody will come out.”

North Korea has denied responsibility for the killing and has not
acknowledged that the victim was Kim Jong-nam.

Lim Kit Siang, a leader of Malaysia’s opposition Democratic Action
Party, called on Parliament to adopt an emergency motion condemning what
he called [North Korea’s “hostage
terrorism”](https://blog.limkitsiang.com/2017/03/07/parliament-should-adopt-an-all-party-emergency-motion-tomorrow-to-condemn-north-koreas-hostage-terrorism-and-to-call-on-north-korea-regime-to-immediately-revoke-the-ban-on-m/#more-36730)
and urging the North Koreans to let the Malaysians leave.

North Korea’s statement on Tuesday described the exit ban as temporary.
But the North Korean government has been accused of playing hostage
politics before, partly to complicate negotiations over its nuclear arms
and missile development. In 2014, [North Korea said it would reopen an
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/05/30/world/asia/north-korea-agrees-to-investigate-fate-of-japanese-abducted-decades-ago.html)
into Japanese citizens it was accused of abducting during the Cold War,
but it halted that inquiry last year [in retaliation for
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/14/world/asia/north-korea-japan-abductions.html)
imposed by Japan over a rocket launch.

Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based nonresident fellow at Georgetown University’s
Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, said on Tuesday that North Korea
was “playing dirty and not diplomatically, apparently hoping this might
force Malaysia to reverse its findings” about Mr. Kim’s killing.

Malaysia, however, showed every intention of pressing ahead with its
contention that VX nerve agent had been used in the Kim assassination.

On Tuesday, the Malaysians presented their formal report about their
findings to the executive council of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the group based in The Hague that
monitors compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Malaysia
has signed.

In a [statement to the executive
council](https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/EC/84/en/Malaysia_ec84_statement.pdf),
Malaysia noted that it did not “produce, stockpile, import, export or
use” VX or any other such chemical weapon.

“Malaysia strongly condemns the use of such a chemical by anyone,
anywhere and under any circumstances,” the statement said. “Its use at a
public place could have endangered the general public.”

North Korea, which has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, is
believed to have a large stockpile of VX despite its denials.

Tuesday’s developments follow the tit-for-tat expulsion of ambassadors
between the two countries. Kang Chol, North Korea’s ambassador to
Malaysia, [was
expelled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/06/world/asia/vx-north-korea-kim-jong-nam.html)
on Monday over what Malaysia considered to be insulting comments. North
Korea responded by formally expelling Malaysia’s ambassador, Mohamad
Nizan Mohamad, though he had already been recalled to Malaysia for
consultations.
