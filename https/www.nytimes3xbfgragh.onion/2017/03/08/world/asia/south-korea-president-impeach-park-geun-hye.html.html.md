SEOUL, South Korea — The Constitutional Court of South Korea said
Wednesday that it would rule on Friday whether to reinstate President
Park Geun-hye or formally oust her from office on charges of corruption
and abuse of power.

Ms. Park has been suspended from office, with all her presidential
powers frozen, since the National Assembly overwhelmingly [voted to
impeach
her](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
in December on charges of abusing power and collecting bribes from
businesses.

If the Constitutional Court supports the vote in its verdict on Friday,
Ms. Park will become the first South Korean president to lose office
through parliamentary impeachment.

The court has held 17 hearings since the impeachment vote, but Ms. Park
has never appeared in court. In a statement read by one of her lawyers
during the last hearing, on Feb. 27, she vehemently denied any
wrongdoing.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I feel crushed by all these misunderstandings and allegations,” she
said, calling the accusations groundless.

But Kweon Seong-dong, the lead prosecutor in the impeachment trial,
called Ms. Park and her secretive confidante, Choi Soon-sil, “enemies to
democracy.”

In the scandal, which has rocked South Korea for months, Ms. Park and
Ms. Choi were accused of conspiring to collect tens of millions of
dollars in bribes from businesses. Ms. Park was also accused of letting
Ms. Choi, who had no experience in policy making, edit her speeches,
install acquaintances as senior government officials and influence state
affairs from the shadows.

In its impeachment motion, the legislature also accused Ms. Park of
undermining freedom of the press by cracking down on her critics and of
shirking her duty to protect citizens’ lives by neglecting to respond
efficiently to a [ferry disaster
in 2014](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/04/21/world/asia/chaos-ruled-sinking-ferry.html)
that killed more than 300 people.

If at least six members of the nine-judge Constitutional Court vote to
impeach, Ms. Park will be removed from office. South Korea will then
have 60 days to elect a successor, with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn
acting as president during that time.

If fewer than six judges vote for impeachment, Ms. Park will immediately
be returned to office. Her five-year term ends next February.

The court has been working with only eight judges after one retired in
January, but that will not affect the required number of votes for or
against impeachment.

No South Korean president has been forced from office through
impeachment. The National Assembly voted in 2004 to impeach President
Roh Moo-hyun, but the Constitutional Court reinstated him, ruling that
his violations of election law were too minor to justify ending his
presidency. Mr. Roh did not attend the court’s hearings on his
impeachment.

The charges against Ms. Park are considered much more serious than those
that Mr. Roh faced, and they have infuriated the public. [Large crowds
have
gathered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/13/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html)
in central Seoul for months on Saturdays demanding an end to her
presidency. In recent weeks, however, Ms. Park’s supporters have also
[organized big
rallies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/18/world/asia/south-korea-impeached-leader-park-geun-hye.html)
calling for her reinstatement.

Regardless of the Constitutional Court’s ruling, Ms. Park will most
likely face criminal charges as soon as her presidency ends. While in
office, she is protected from indictment.

On Monday, a special prosecutor [asked state
prosecutors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/06/world/asia/president-park-geun-hye-bribery-korea.html)
to indict Ms. Park on bribery charges, saying that she and Ms. Choi
conspired to take $38 million in bribes from Samsung, one of the world’s
largest technology companies. Samsung’s vice chairman, Lee Jae-yong, the
third-generation scion of the family who runs the conglomerate, goes on
trial this week [on bribery
charges](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/28/world/asia/lee-jae-yong-samsung.html).

The special prosecutor said that the president should also face a
criminal charge of abusing official power, saying she [conspired with
aides](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/12/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-blacklist-artists.html)
to blacklist thousands of artists, writers and movie directors deemed
unfriendly to her government and exclude them from government-funded
support programs.
