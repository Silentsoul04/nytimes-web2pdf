Andrew Napolitano was a Superior Court judge in New Jersey until,
[frustrated by the constraints of his
salary](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/02/23/nyregion/ban-on-taking-outside-fees-rankles-new-jersey-judges.html?pagewanted=all),
he left the bench for more lucrative pastures: talk radio, a syndicated
small-claims court TV series (“Power of Attorney”) and, eventually, Fox
News, where he rose to become the network’s senior legal analyst.

It was in that basic-cable capacity this week that Mr. Napolitano
managed to set off a cascading scandal, which by Friday had sparked a
trans-Atlantic tiff between Britain and the United States while plunging
President Trump’s close relationship with Fox News into new, murkier
territory.

It was new ground for Mr. Napolitano, 66, who prefers being addressed as
“The Judge” and once insisted that Fox News install bookshelves and
wood-paneling in his newsroom office, the better to resemble a judge’s
chambers.

But Mr. Napolitano’s unlikely leap into global politics can be explained
by his friendship with Mr. Trump, whom he met with this year to discuss
potential Supreme Court nominees. Mr. Napolitano also has a taste for
conspiracy theories, which led him to Larry C. Johnson, a former
intelligence officer best known for spreading a hoax about Michelle
Obama.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Let’s back up. The saga began on Tuesday on “Fox & Friends,” the chummy
morning show, where Mr. Napolitano made a bizarre and unsupported
accusation: Citing three unnamed sources, he said that Britain’s top spy
agency had wiretapped Mr. Trump on behalf of President Barack Obama
during last year’s campaign.

Cable news blather, especially at that hour, usually vanishes at the
commercial break. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean
Spicer, repeated the claim from the White House podium, infuriating
British officials.

On Friday, Fox News was forced to disavow Mr. Napolitano’s remarks. “Fox
News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano’s commentary,” the anchor Shepard
Smith said on-air. “Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the
now-president of the United States was surveilled at any time, any way.
Full stop.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The terse declaration boosted the credibility of Fox News’s newsroom,
which is often attacked as biased, but also put it in the awkward
position of repudiating one of its featured contributors. And it could
threaten the cozy dynamic between Mr. Trump, a frequent Fox viewer, and
the network’s conservative hosts.

Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and the prankster Jesse Watters are among
the few television personalities to be granted one-on-one interviews
with the president. Programs like “Fox & Friends” often serve as
cheerleaders for him, and the network is increasing its focus on
hard-line conservatism: A new weekly series, hosted by a leader of the
Brexit movement, Steve Hilton, will focus on right-wing populism.

Mr. Napolitano, who keeps a residence in Manhattan at Trump
International Hotel & Tower on Central Park West, did not respond to
inquiries on Friday.

But Mr. Johnson, who was himself once a Fox News contributor, said in a
telephone interview that Mr. Napolitano called him on Friday and
requested that he speak to The New York Times. Mr. Johnson said he was
one of the sources for Mr. Napolitano’s claim about British
intelligence.

Mr. Johnson became [infamous in political
circles](http://prospect.org/article/larry-johnsons-strange-trip) after
he spread false rumors in 2008 that Michelle Obama had been videotaped
using a slur against Caucasians. In the interview on Friday, Mr. Johnson
acknowledged his notoriety, but said that his knowledge of surveillance
of Mr. Trump came from sources in the American intelligence community.
Mr. Napolitano, he said, heard about his information through an
intermediary.

“It sounds like a Frederick Forsyth novel,” Mr. Johnson said.

Mr. Trump refused to back down from the claims on Friday, and even
praised Mr. Napolitano, telling reporters, “All we did was quote a very
talented legal mind.”

The president’s next scheduled appearance on Fox News is Saturday night,
when an interview will air between him and Mr. Watters, a host known for
on-the-street interviews that have been denounced as offensive [and, at
times,
racist](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/07/business/media/fox-reporter-accused-of-racism-for-chinatown-interviews-on-trump-clinton-and-china.html).

In [a clip released on
Friday](http://deadline.com/2017/03/jesse-watters-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-jeff-zucker-fire-fox-news-video-1202045640/),
Mr. Watters asks Mr. Trump which celebrity he would most like to fire:
Alec Baldwin, Senator Chuck Schumer or CNN’s president, Jeff Zucker.

“I don’t want to say,” Mr. Trump replied. “But I will say I’m
disappointed in all three.”
