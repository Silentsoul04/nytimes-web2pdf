Bill O'Reilly, the embattled Fox News host, received a powerful show of
support on Wednesday from a longtime friend, interview subject,
ideological sympathizer and fellow scandal-survivor: the president of
the United States.

Speaking in the Oval Office, Donald J. Trump praised Mr. O'Reilly as ``a
good person'' and declared, ``I don't think Bill did anything wrong,''
days after
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html}{The
New York Times reported that five women} had received settlements after
making harassment claims against him.

News of the payouts, totaling about \$13 million, generated a storm of
criticism toward Fox News, which recently renewed Mr. O'Reilly's
contract, and prompted more than two dozen advertisers to withdraw their
support of Mr. O'Reilly's prime time show, the highest-rated program in
cable news.

Few have spoken out publicly in support of the Fox star. The president
had no qualms.

``Personally, I think he shouldn't have settled,'' Mr. Trump told Times
reporters
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/05/us/politics/trump-interview-susan-rice.html?hp\&action=click\&pgtype=Homepage\&clickSource=story-heading\&module=first-column-region\&region=top-news\&WT.nav=top-news}{in
a wide-ranging interview.} ``Because you should have taken it all the
way; I don't think Bill did anything wrong.''

``I think he's a person I know well,'' Mr. Trump said. ``He is a good
person.''

The president is a well-documented fan of Fox News, sitting for
interviews with its prime-time hosts and conferring privately by phone
with Rupert Murdoch, the network's executive chairman.

Mr. Trump has bragged to associates that he now refers to Mr. Murdoch,
one of the world's most powerful media moguls, by his first name,
according to a person who is friendly with both men.

But the president has a particular rapport with Mr. O'Reilly, whose
hectoring braggadocio and no-apologies nostalgia for a bygone American
era mirror Mr. Trump's own.

A regular guest on ``The O'Reilly Factor,'' Mr. Trump has attended
baseball games with Mr. O'Reilly, praised his collection of best-selling
political books, and, as president-elect, granted him a prominent
interview that aired during Fox's Super Bowl pregame show. The men share
a taste for vanilla milkshakes,
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/02/24/fox-newss-bill-oreilly-omits-vanilla-milkshake-disclosure-from-rant-on-media-trump/?utm_term=.0c0e688ee738}{bantering
on-air} about how many of the confections Mr. O'Reilly has bought for
his friend.

The two have something more ominous in common, too: Each has been
accused by women of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. Like
the president, Mr. O'Reilly maintains that the accusations against him
are without merit.

When damaging video footage of Mr. Trump bragging about sexual assault
surfaced during the campaign,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/08/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html}{Mr.
Trump called it ``locker room talk''} and apologized for the remarks.
Mr. O'Reilly, on air that evening, allowed that the tape was ``an
embarrassment'' for the Republican nominee. But he also criticized The
Washington Post, the newspaper that published the footage.

It is remarkable for a sitting president to weigh in on sexual
harassment allegations from the Oval Office, especially allegations at
the center of a churning controversy. But Mr. Trump's advice to his
friend on Wednesday --- that Mr. O'Reilly ``shouldn't have settled'' ---
was consistent with the never-back-down ethos of a president, and former
real estate magnate, who relishes the counterattack.

It also hinted at a deeper symbiosis between the White House and Fox
News. Mr. Trump often praises the network, recently urging his 27
million Twitter followers to tune in for a Saturday evening show; last
month, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/17/business/media/fox-andrew-napolitano-trump.html}{president
cited a Fox commentator}, Andrew Napolitano, as backup for an unproven
allegation that British intelligence spied on his campaign.

In turn, Fox News's prime time and morning hosts are blatant champions
of the administration --- to the extent that NBC News's chairman, Andrew
Lack, recently compared the network to ``state broadcasting.''

The president and Mr. Murdoch have drawn closer, too. Mr. Murdoch, a
savvy political observer, deepened their relationship in the months
after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination, and people who know
them say the two now speak frequently.

Mr. Murdoch's former wife, Wendi Deng, is so close with Ivanka Trump
that the president's daughter became a trustee of the Murdoch children's
fortune. (Ms. Trump stepped down from the role in December.)

Mr. Murdoch, meanwhile, had mentored Ms. Trump's future husband, Jared
Kushner, in the art of media moguldom after his purchase of The New York
Observer in 2006. Mr. Kushner, now a powerful White House aide, would
later serve as Mr. Murdoch's chief conduit to Mr. Trump's campaign.

These entwinements have fueled intrigue about how the president might
influence Mr. Murdoch's corporate interests. Mr. Trump now oversees the
Justice Department, just as Fox News faces an investigation by the
United States attorney's office in Manhattan over its handling of
financial settlements for harassment claims.

Mr. Murdoch's entertainment conglomerate, 21st Century Fox, is also
closing in on a coveted prize in Europe, the British satellite
television giant Sky. But British regulators are scrutinizing the
potential acquisition, and the firestorm around Mr. O'Reilly may speak
poorly of the corporate culture over which Mr. Murdoch presides.

Fox News has often provided cover for Mr. Trump as the president
navigated a host of early controversies. Mr. Trump's kind words for Mr.
O'Reilly on Wednesday seemed a reciprocal gesture of sorts, from a
leader who values loyalty.
