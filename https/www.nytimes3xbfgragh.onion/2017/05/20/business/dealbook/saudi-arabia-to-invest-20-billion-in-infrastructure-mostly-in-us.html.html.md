As President Trump begins [his first presidential trip
abroad](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/20/world/middleeast/donald-trump-saudi-arabia.html)
in Saudi Arabia, an investment company run by one of his top supporters,
the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman, has secured an enormous
investment from the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The company, Blackstone, which Mr. Schwarzman helped found, said on
Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund [had committed $20
billion](https://www.blackstone.com/media/press-releases/blackstone-to-launch-$40-billion-infrastructure-investment-vehicle-and-new-infrastructure-business)
to a new investment fund aimed at infrastructure projects, primarily in
the United States.

The commitment is about half of the capital Blackstone plans to raise
for the fund. All told, including potential borrowed money, the new fund
could invest more than $100 billion in infrastructure projects, the
company said in its statement.

The fund was one of several business deals between an American company
and Saudi Arabia announced after Mr. Trump’s arrival. At a ceremony in
Riyadh on Saturday, General Electric said it had agreements for [$15
billion worth of
projects](http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/support-saudi-vision-2030-saudi-arabia-and-ge-announce-raft-mous-and-agreements-worth).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the Trump administration helped line up [$110 billion worth of arms
deals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/18/world/middleeast/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-lockheed.html),
negotiations in which senior officials played prominent roles. For
instance, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, personally called the
chief executive of Lockheed Martin to cut the price of a radar system.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lockheed Martin has since announced, among other deals, a $6 billion
commitment to building 150 Black Hawk helicopters in the kingdom.

In its statement on Saturday, Blackstone said it had begun discussions
with Saudi Arabia about a year ago. The American investment company said
it had already invested in over $40 billion worth of projects tied to
infrastructure over the last 15 years.

Investing in American infrastructure has been advocated by lawmakers and
business leaders for some time, with [both Mr. Trump and Hillary
Clinton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-infrastructure.html)
endorsing modernizing aging airports, bridges and energy systems through
public-private partnerships.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of Saudi Arabia’s Public
Investment Fund, added: “This potential investment reflects our positive
views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken
in the United States as announced by President Trump, and the strategic
opportunity for the Public Investment Fund to achieve long-term returns
given historical investment shortfalls.”

For Saudi Arabia, the new fund is yet another step toward diversifying
its enormous oil-based economy. The kingdom has already announced what
it calls its Vision 2030 plan, under which the country has prepared to
list its state-owned oil producer, Saudi Aramco, on the public markets.

Earlier on Saturday, the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank
announced [the first end of the first round of fund-raising for its
Vision
Fund](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170520005010/en/SoftBank-Vision-Fund-Announces-Major-Close),
a planned $100 billion technology investment vehicle to which the
kingdom had pledged $45 billion.
