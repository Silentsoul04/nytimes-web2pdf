As President Trump begins
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/20/world/middleeast/donald-trump-saudi-arabia.html}{his
first presidential trip abroad} in Saudi Arabia, an investment company
run by one of his top supporters, the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman,
has secured an enormous investment from the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The company, Blackstone, which Mr. Schwarzman helped found, said on
Saturday that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund
\href{https://www.blackstone.com/media/press-releases/blackstone-to-launch-$40-billion-infrastructure-investment-vehicle-and-new-infrastructure-business}{had
committed \$20 billion} to a new investment fund aimed at infrastructure
projects, primarily in the United States.

The commitment is about half of the capital Blackstone plans to raise
for the fund. All told, including potential borrowed money, the new fund
could invest more than \$100 billion in infrastructure projects, the
company said in its statement.

The fund was one of several business deals between an American company
and Saudi Arabia announced after Mr. Trump's arrival. At a ceremony in
Riyadh on Saturday, General Electric said it had agreements for
\href{http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/support-saudi-vision-2030-saudi-arabia-and-ge-announce-raft-mous-and-agreements-worth}{\$15
billion worth of projects}.

And the Trump administration helped line up
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/18/world/middleeast/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-lockheed.html}{\$110
billion worth of arms deals}, negotiations in which senior officials
played prominent roles. For instance, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's
son-in-law, personally called the chief executive of Lockheed Martin to
cut the price of a radar system.

Lockheed Martin has since announced, among other deals, a \$6 billion
commitment to building 150 Black Hawk helicopters in the kingdom.

In its statement on Saturday, Blackstone said it had begun discussions
with Saudi Arabia about a year ago. The American investment company said
it had already invested in over \$40 billion worth of projects tied to
infrastructure over the last 15 years.

Investing in American infrastructure has been advocated by lawmakers and
business leaders for some time, with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-infrastructure.html}{both
Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton} endorsing modernizing aging airports,
bridges and energy systems through public-private partnerships.

Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of Saudi Arabia's Public
Investment Fund, added: ``This potential investment reflects our
positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being
undertaken in the United States as announced by President Trump, and the
strategic opportunity for the Public Investment Fund to achieve
long-term returns given historical investment shortfalls.''

For Saudi Arabia, the new fund is yet another step toward diversifying
its enormous oil-based economy. The kingdom has already announced what
it calls its Vision 2030 plan, under which the country has prepared to
list its state-owned oil producer, Saudi Aramco, on the public markets.

Earlier on Saturday, the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank
announced
\href{http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170520005010/en/SoftBank-Vision-Fund-Announces-Major-Close}{the
first end of the first round of fund-raising for its Vision Fund}, a
planned \$100 billion technology investment vehicle to which the kingdom
had pledged \$45 billion.
