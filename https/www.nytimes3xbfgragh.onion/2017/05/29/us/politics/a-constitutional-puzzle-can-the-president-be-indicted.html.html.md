WASHINGTON — The Constitution does not answer every question. It
includes detailed instructions, for instance, about how Congress may
remove a president who has committed serious offenses. But it does not
say whether the president may be criminally prosecuted in the meantime.

The Supreme Court has never answered that question, either. It heard
arguments on the issue in 1974 in a case in [which it ordered President
Richard M. Nixon to turn over tape
recordings](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/418/683.html),
but it did not resolve
it.

[Reports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html?_r=0)
that President Trump asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to
shut down an investigation into his former national security adviser,
Michael T. Flynn, prompted accusations that the president may have
obstructed justice. Robert S. Mueller III, the former F.B.I. director
who has been appointed special counsel to look into ties between the
Trump campaign and Russia, will presumably investigate the matter.

But would the Constitution allow Mr. Mueller to indict Mr. Trump if he
finds evidence of criminal conduct?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The prevailing view among most legal experts is no. They say the
president is immune from prosecution so long as he is in office.

“The framers implicitly immunized a sitting president from ordinary
criminal prosecution,” said Akhil Reed Amar, a law professor at Yale.

Note the word “implicitly.” Professor Amar acknowledged that the text of
the Constitution did not directly answer the question. “It has to be,”
he said, “a structural inference about the uniqueness of the president
himself.”

The closest the Constitution comes to addressing the issue is in this
passage, from [Article I,
Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section3):
“Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to
removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office
of honor, trust or profit under the United States: but the party
convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial,
judgment and punishment, according to law.”

This much seems clear: The president and other federal officials may be
prosecuted after they leave office, and there is no double jeopardy
protection from prosecution if they are removed following impeachment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

However, “whether the Constitution allows indictment of a sitting
president is debatable,” Brett M. Kavanaugh, who served on the staff of
Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President
Bill Clinton, wrote in a 1998 law review article. Mr. Kavanaugh, who is
now a federal appeals court judge, also concluded that impeachment, not
prosecution, was the right way to address a sitting president’s crimes.

The most prominent dissenter from the prevailing view is Eric M.
Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra University and the author of
[a 1999 law review
article](http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2059&context=hlr)
that made the case for allowing criminal prosecution of incumbent
presidents.

Professor Freedman demonstrated that the issue had divided the founding
generation and argued that granting sitting presidents immunity from
prosecution was “inconsistent with the history, structure and underlying
philosophy of our government, at odds with precedent and unjustified by
practical considerations.”

He pointed out that other federal officials who are subject to
impeachment, including judges, have been indicted while in office.
Courts have rejected the argument that impeachment is the sole remedy
for such officials.

But Professor Amar said that presidents were different.

“If you’re going to undo a national election, the body that does that
should have a national mandate,” he said. “Even a federal prosecution
would follow only from an indictment from a grand jury sitting in one
locality.”

Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, facing a grand jury investigation that
would lead to [his resignation
in 1973](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/learning/general/onthisday/big/1010.html),
argued that he was immune from prosecution while in office. Impeachment,
he said, was the only remedy.

The Justice Department, in [a brief signed by Solicitor General Robert
H.
Bork](http://query.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=990CE3D71F30E63ABC4E53DFB6678388669EDE),
disagreed. But, though the question was not before the court, Mr. Bork
added that “structural features of the Constitution” barred prosecutions
of sitting presidents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since the president has the power to control federal prosecutions and to
pardon federal offenses, Mr. Bork wrote, it would make no sense to allow
the president to be prosecuted until after he is removed from office and
forfeits those powers. (Mr. Bork would go on to become a federal appeals
court judge and an unsuccessful nominee to the Supreme Court.)

A year later, Leon Jaworski, the Watergate special prosecutor, took a
less categorical position.

“It is an open and substantial question whether an incumbent president
is subject to indictment,” he [told the Supreme
Court](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6mkR0LD6dl3aWJHd3pOUkxWeWc/view)
during his successful quest to obtain the White House recordings that
contributed to Nixon’s resignation.

In a series of memorandums, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal
Counsel [concluded](https://www.justice.gov/file/19351/download) that
indicting a sitting president would violate the Constitution by
undermining his ability to do his job. Those memos, too, though, said
the answer was a matter of structure and inference.

“Neither the text nor the history of the Constitution ultimately
provided dispositive guidance in determining whether a president is
amenable to indictment or criminal prosecution while in office,” a 2000
memo said, summarizing an earlier one. “It therefore based its analysis
on more general considerations of constitutional structure.”

The [Justice Department’s
regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.7) require Mr.
Mueller, the special counsel, to follow the department’s “rules,
regulations, procedures, practices and policies.” If the memos bind Mr.
Mueller, it would seem he could not indict Mr. Trump, no matter what he
uncovered.

But Andrew Manuel Crespo, a law professor at Harvard, has questioned
whether the special-counsel regulations should be read that broadly. The
regulations, [he
wrote](https://takecareblog.com/blog/the-road-to-united-states-v-trump-is-paved-with-prosecutorial-discretion)
on [Take Care](https://takecareblog.com/), a law blog, “focus more on
administrative protocols and procedures than on legal analyses,
arguments or judgments.”

Even if Mr. Mueller has a measure of discretion, Professor Amar said,
the right process for assessing Mr. Trump’s conduct, should it come to
that, is the one described in detail in the Constitution: impeachment.

“Much of the recent pontificating about the technical elements of
obstruction of justice is quite beside the point,” he said. “Donald
Trump is to be judged by the House and the Senate, who are in turn
judged on Election Day by the American people more generally.”
