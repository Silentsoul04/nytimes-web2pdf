When companies settle claims of wrongdoing, they are often compelled to
pay for environmental or community development projects as well as pay
fines and direct compensation to victims. Sometimes the third-party
payments are only marginally related to the damages caused by the
company’s actions.

To settle claims from the Gulf oil spill, [BP was required to spend
billions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/07/02/us/bp-oil-spill-settlement-background.html?mcubz=1)
on coastal restoration projects that were not directly related to spill
damage. [Volkswagen is financing electric vehicle charging
stations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/30/business/volkswagen-diesel-penalties.html?mcubz=1)
under its settlement of the diesel emissions cheating scandal. [Duke
Energy paid for soil
restoration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/11/us/duke-energy-to-pay-fine-over-power-plant-violations.html?mcubz=1)
on federal land as part of its compensation for air pollution violations
at some of its power plants in North Carolina.

That longstanding practice is now under attack on two fronts,
potentially jeopardizing a source of financing for initiatives across
the country that supporters say have paid great environmental and social
dividends. Critics say the practice effectively creates “slush funds”
for favored organizations or causes.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, [in a memo issued this
week](https://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/06/07/document_gw_01.pdf),
directed the [Justice
Department](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/us-justice-department)
to no longer include funding for projects managed by outside groups in
settlements with corporate wrongdoers. The settlement money will instead
go exclusively to the federal Treasury or to victims of the company’s
actions, Mr. Sessions said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It has come to my attention that certain previous settlement agreements
involving the department included payments to various nongovernmental,
third-party organizations as a condition of settlement with the United
States,” Mr. Sessions said. “These third-party organizations were
neither victims nor parties to the lawsuits. The department will no
longer engage in this practice.”

The policy applies only to future cases.

A [bill with similar
intent](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/732/text/ih),
sponsored by Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, passed a House
committee in February. It would prevent the government from using
settlement money from civil cases for purposes other than direct victim
compensation or remediation, like cleanups of environmental disasters. A
[version of the
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5063/text)
passed the House last year, but died in the Senate.

This year, groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute and
Americans for Prosperity, both closely linked to the libertarian
billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, wrote to President
Trump criticizing a recent settlement between the Obama administration’s
Justice Department and Volkswagen.

[The $14.7 billion
settlement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/28/business/volkswagen-settlement-diesel-scandal.html),
over Volkswagen’s use of “defeat devices” to cheat emissions rules,
included almost $2 billion that Volkswagen was required to invest in
electric vehicle charging stations and other clean vehicle technology.
The settlement also directed Volkswagen to pay $2.7 billion to programs
that would reduce pollution from diesel cars and trucks. Volkswagen had
been accused of manufacturing cars that spewed harmful nitrogen oxides
at up to 40 times the levels allowed under the [Clean Air
Act](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/clean_air_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier).

Some of the money was in effect going to pay for clean air initiatives
championed by President Barack Obama, the conservative groups said,
initiatives that Congress twice refused to fund.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Having been twice spurned by lawmakers, the Obama administration
leveraged the Volkswagen settlement,” the groups charged. All settlement
money, they argued, should “instead be deposited into the U.S.
Treasury.”

The groups said that Congress has not authorized or provided money for
electric vehicle infrastructure. They said the plan represents “an
end-run around Congress’s lawmaking power.”

Such settlement funds can be appropriate in cases of environmental
wrongdoing, some environmental lawyers said, because the victims are
often scattered over large areas or are difficult to identify and
compensate directly. At times, the government has ordered a polluter to
pay for unrelated environmental restoration projects as restitution; the
attorney general’s order would prohibit such deals.

Environmental groups say that settlement funds have gone to critical
projects nationwide. The 2012 settlement with BP, in which it agreed to
pay to resolve criminal charges, included more than $2 billion for
projects aimed at environmental restoration in the Gulf of Mexico, and
research into spill prevention and other topics. A 2015 settlement with
Duke Energy allocated $4.4 million to stream and river ecosystem
restoration in North Carolina.

“You’re killing something that’s worked really well — which is getting
violators who’ve broken the law, in some cases in a criminal way, to
agree to fund projects to make the air or water cleaner,” said Eric
Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and
the former director of civil enforcement at the [Environmental
Protection
Agency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/environmental-protection-agency).
“What’s wrong with that?”

Mr. Sessions’ new policy directs Justice Department lawyers not to
include similar payments in settlements with corporations. “The goals of
any settlement are, first and foremost, to compensate victims, redress
harm, or punish and deter unlawful conduct,” he said in his memo, dated
June 5.

The House bill, known as the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017,
would turn that policy into law, making it difficult for future
administrations to reverse.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Goodlatte, who co-sponsored the bill, [cited the government’s
settlement](https://judiciary.house.gov/press-release/statement-house-judiciary-committee-chairman-bob-goodlatte-markup-h-r-732-stop-settlement-slush-funds-act-2017/)
with Volkswagen as an example of the abuse of settlement funds. He also
referred to a deal that required Credit Suisse to originate affordable
housing loans that generate a minimum of $240 million in credit as part
of [a settlement related to its handling of
mortgages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/23/business/dealbook/credit-suisse-mortgage-investigation.html)
before the global financial crisis. Mr. Goodlatte called that
“effectively a donation in the guise of a loan.”

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

Frank Holleman, a senior lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law
Center, said that if settlement money for environmental violations goes
to the Treasury Department, it may be spent on something else, and
prevent restoration of or protection of an affected community or
ecosystem.

“You can’t just dump money in the river and it gets clean,” he said.
“You have to contribute to a nonprofit that does the work to make it
that way. It‘s not just being thrown away or given to these entities —
it’s payments for a particular service.”

The money has gone to a variety of environmental projects.

In 2015, [Duke
Energy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/company/duke-energy-corporation),
a North Carolina utility, reached a settlement with the Department of
Justice over claims that it had violated the Clean Air Act at five of
its power plants in the state. The settlement, which contained
provisions to prevent further air pollution, including shutting down
coal-fired electricity generating units, also required the company to
pay a civil penalty and $4.4 million toward environmental mitigation
projects.

The mitigation projects included ecosystem restoration — soil
restoration in national forests, and restoration of a trout population,
or revegetation of Red Spruce trees — and electric vehicle charging
infrastructure and energy efficiency programs in poor areas.

Neil Nissan, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the utility does not take
a position on the policy or the bill.

One of the projects the [BP settlement
money](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/07/02/us/bp-oil-spill-settlement-background.html?mcubz=1)
has funded is the restoration of more than 13 miles of beach along a
geographical feature known as the Caminada Headlands, which will provide
storm protection for Port Fourchon, La., and other nearby areas. BP
declined to comment.

David M. Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School
and the former chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice
Department, said, “The attorney general’s directive prohibits those
laudable third-party payments and, in doing so, needlessly undermines
public health and environmental protection efforts.”

He added, ”Congress can and should rely on the Justice Department and
regulatory agencies to ensure that companies who commit regulatory
violations make appropriate payments to remedy the harm they have
caused.”
