CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. --- Members of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/ku-klux-klan}{Ku
Klux Klan} rallied here on Saturday afternoon in a protest meant to
assail the city's decision to remove a statue of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/robert-e-lee?inline=nyt-per}{Robert
E. Lee}, the Confederate general.

For about a half-hour, around 50 members of the Klan --- some wearing
hooded white robes --- shouted ``white power'' at Justice Park as more
than 1,000 people protested their presence by hurling insults, water
bottles and apple cores.

By about 4:25 p.m., the Klan members, who said they came from North
Carolina, began to leave and return to their cars. It was then when the
trouble intensified.

City officials said a large group of counterprotesters followed the Klan
members back to their vehicles and stopped them from leaving. Asked to
step aside, the counterprotesters refused, a city spokeswoman said. The
police declared an unlawful assembly, and officers began moving the
protesters back so the Klan members could leave.

As the police returned to Justice Park, though, the crowd followed, and
``there were a number of incidents, including the use of pepper spray by
the crowd,'' Miriam Dickler, a city spokeswoman, said in a statement.

At one point, the police again ordered the crowd to disperse, but the
protesters remained entrenched. Ms. Dickler said the Virginia State
Police then released three canisters of tear gas.

``The crowd immediately dispersed,'' she said.

Over the course of the day, Ms. Dickler said that at least 23 people had
been arrested, and that at least three people had been taken to a
hospital --- two for ``heat-related issues'' and one for an
``alcohol-related issue.''

In an email, Ms. Dickler said she could not ``speak to the
affiliations'' of those who were arrested.

The rally, and the response to it, put the city on edge, and upset some
residents who had hoped the event would end without any problems.

``We were just standing there, peaceful, on the sidewalk,'' said Candice
Maupin, a city resident and one of the counterprotesters. ``We heard
this boom, and then this green smoke, and our eyes started burning.''

City officials and church leaders had asked residents to stay away from
the rally. Concerts and other events were planned to encourage residents
to spend the day elsewhere.

``It's become a game,'' said Bob Fenwick, a city councilman.

Indeed, Charlottesville has become a flash point in a debate about how
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/07/us/new-orleans-monuments.html}{cities
across the South} should reconcile themselves with their past and,
specifically, with the Civil War.

The Charlottesville City Council voted narrowly in April to sell the
statue of Lee. But in May, a circuit court judge in the city issued
\href{http://www.nbc29.com/story/35306157/update-judge-issues-temporary-injunction-to-halt-lee-statue-removal}{a
six-month injunction} to halt the removal of the statue after a
collection of individuals and groups --- including the Virginia chapter
of the Sons of Confederate Veterans --- filed a lawsuit against the
city.

Demonstrators led by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/21/us/politics/richard-spencer-punched-attack.html?_r=0}{Richard
B. Spencer}, a noted white supremacist,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/14/us/confederate-statue-protests-virginia.html}{marched
here in May} to protest the city's plan to remove the statue. Mr.
Spencer posted pictures and videos from the gathering that showed
demonstrators holding Confederate battle flags and a banner proclaiming,
``We will not be replaced.''

``People should be able to respect our heritage,'' said Amanda Barker,
who identified herself on Saturday as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. She
added that she was underwhelmed by the number of people who had turned
out to oppose the rally.

Counterprotesters, who chanted ``go home,'' ``black lives matter'' and a
variety of profanity-laced insults, said it was important for them to
confront the Klan because simply ignoring white-supremacist viewpoints
could allow such views to proliferate.

Ms. Dickler, the city spokeswoman, said another rally by white
nationalists has been planned for Aug. 12.
