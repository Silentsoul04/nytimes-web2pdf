WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Tuesday that he had signed a
sweeping executive order to eliminate and streamline some permitting
regulations and to speed construction of roads, bridges and pipelines,
declaring that the moves would fix a “badly broken” infrastructure
system in America and bring manufacturing jobs back to the country.

In [an explosive news
conference](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference-charlottesville.html)
overshadowed by questions about his response to a [white nationalist
rally](100000005365230/draft/editing) over the weekend in
Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump tried several times to steer the
conversation back to infrastructure.

The president has vowed to pass a [$1 trillion
package](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/03/us/politics/trump-plans-to-shift-infrastructure-funding-to-cities-states-and-business.html)
to revitalize the nation’s infrastructure, but so far [no such
legislation
exists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/23/us/trump-infrastructure-program.html).
Mr. Trump said he was not worried about his chances of winning support
for his plan, even in the wake of a failed effort to overhaul health
care.

“We will end up getting health care, but we’ll get the infrastructure,
and actually infrastructure is something that I think we’ll have
bipartisan support on,” Mr. Trump said. “I actually think Democrats will
go along with the infrastructure.”

Flanked by Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao and Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Mr. Trump unveiled
a head-to-toe-length flow chart purporting to show the permitting
regulations required to build a highway in a state he would not name
that he claimed took 17 years.

“This is what we will bring it down to — this is less than two years,”
Mr. Trump said, dropping the paper to the ground and revealing a new
flow chart about a quarter of the
size.

“We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world, and
today we’re like a third-world country,” he said. “No longer will we
allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and
decay.”

A key element of the new executive order rolls back standards set by
former President Barack Obama that required the federal government to
account for climate change and sea-level rise when building
infrastructure.

It also puts in place what the White House called a “one federal
decision policy” under which one lead federal agency works with others
to complete environmental reviews and other permitting decisions for a
given project. All decisions on federal permits will have to be made
within 90 days, and agencies will have a two-year goal to process
environmental reviews for major projects.

“It’s going to be a very streamlined process, and by the way, if it
doesn’t meet environmental safeguards, we’re not going to approve it,”
Mr. Trump said.

Some Republicans cheered the executive order. [Representative Rob Bishop
of Utah](https://robbishop.house.gov/ "His website.") called it a strong
foundation upon which Congress can move forward an infrastructure bill.
“It’s encouraging to have a president who understands that regulatory
reform is a precondition for any successful infrastructure policy,” he
said in a statement.

Rolling back the [Federal Flood Risk Management
Standard](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/30/executive-order-establishing-federal-flood-risk-management-standard-and- "The Obama order."),
established by Mr. Obama in an executive order in 2015, is the latest
effort by the Trump administration to unravel the former president’s
climate change agenda. Building trade groups and Republican lawmakers
had criticized the rule as costly and overly burdensome.

But environmental activists, flood plain managers and some conservatives
had urged the Trump administration to preserve it, arguing that it
protected critical infrastructure and taxpayer dollars.

“The Trump administration’s decision to overturn this is a disaster for
taxpayers and the environment,” said [Eli
Lehrer](http://www.rstreet.org/people/eli-lehrer/ "His bio."), president
of the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington. He
described the Obama order as a common-sense measure to prevent taxpayer
money from being sunk into projects threatened by flooding.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A White House official said that Mr. Trump’s order reinstated the
previous flood management standard, issued by President Jimmy Carter in
1977, but that it did not prohibit state and local agencies from using
more stringent standards if they
chose.

## Looming Floods, Threatened Cities

The Obama-era rule gave federal agencies three options to flood-proof
new infrastructure projects. They could use the best available climate
change science; they could require that standard projects like roads and
railways be built two feet above the national 100-year flood elevation
standard and critical buildings like hospitals be built three feet
higher; or they could require infrastructure to be built to at least the
500-year flood plain. The order did not regulate private development.

[Representative Ralph Abraham of
Louisiana](https://abraham.house.gov/ "His website."), a Republican who
sponsored legislation that would have blocked Mr. Obama’s flood
standard, said he was thrilled by Mr. Trump’s decision. He acknowledged
that Louisiana was inundated with catastrophic flooding last year, but
called it an isolated event. The bigger threat, he said, is from costly
regulations.

He estimated the rule would have increased the cost of a new home by 25
percent to 30 percent in Louisiana because most of the state would be
put in a federal flood plain.

“We had more than our share of tragedy down here with the water, but we
already have problems meeting requirements,” Mr. Abraham said. “The new
plan would make it so costly for my Louisiana residents.”

The Obama administration had estimated that the more stringent standards
would increase construction costs by 0.25 percent to 1.25 percent, but
save taxpayers money in the long run.

[Representative Carlos
Curbelo](https://curbelo.house.gov/ "His website."), a Florida
Republican who has called for addressing the threat posed by climate
change, criticized Mr. Trump’s decision.

“This executive order is not fiscally conservative,” he said in a
statement. “It’s irresponsible and it will lead to taxpayer dollars
being wasted on projects that may not be built to endure the flooding we
are already seeing and know is only going to get worse.”
