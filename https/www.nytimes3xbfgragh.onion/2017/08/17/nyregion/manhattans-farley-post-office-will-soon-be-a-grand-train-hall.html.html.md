After 25 years of talk about turning the main post office in Manhattan
into an extension of Pennsylvania Station, construction toward that
ambitious and expensive goal is about to get underway.

Next week, workers will shift from demolishing sections of the
105-year-old James A. Farley Building to transforming it into a grand
train hall for passengers of Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road. The
$1.6 billion project is one of several high-cost improvements to New
York’s transportation system championed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has
made transforming the region’s infrastructure, including the airports
and the subway system, into a central focus of his tenure.

When it comes to grand construction projects under his purview, the
governor does not traffic in understatement.

On a tour of [the Farley
building](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/07/nyregion/cuomo-lays-out-renovation-plan-for-penn-station-and-farley-post-office.html)
this week, Mr. Cuomo compared it favorably to Grand Central Terminal,
which is generally considered one of the country’s most awe-inspiring
public spaces. “Architecturally, you could argue this is going to be
even more powerful than Grand Central,” the governor said.

Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, spoke in grand terms about the acre of glass that
will cover the vast hall and the original steel trusses that will hold
the skylights aloft. Over the whir of drills and the crackle of welding
torches, he explained how workers had spent the last several weeks
demolishing the concrete-and-steel floor of the huge room where the
city’s mail once was sorted. The entire complex takes up two city
blocks, from 31st Street to 33rd Street between Eighth and Ninth
avenues.

Critics may differ about the current design – it is the fifth iteration
of a plan first presented by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan in the early 1990s
– but there is little doubt that it would be a vast improvement over
the existing Penn Station. That building, across Eighth Avenue from the
Farley, was already one of the most reviled transit hubs in the region
before two trains derailed there this spring, spurring emergency repairs
that have disrupted the routines of thousands of commuters this summer.

The Farley project would not solve Penn Station’s operational problems
or add capacity for more trains, but it would provide many passengers
with a more pleasant place to wait to board trains. For diversions, it
will contain 700,000 square feet of shops, restaurants and commercial
space.

Two major private developers, Related Companies and Vornado, have agreed
to contribute $630 million toward the conversion in exchange for a
99-year lease on the Farley Building — excluding space along Eighth
Avenue that the post office will
retain.

The other $970 million will come from public sources. The state, through
the Empire State Development agency, has committed to invest $550
million.

An additional $100 million will come from the state-run Long Island Rail
Road, said Rick Cotton, a counselor to Mr. Cuomo who this week assumed
the top executive job at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The Port Authority, controlled by Mr. Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris
Christie, is putting in $150 million, Mr. Cotton said. Amtrak and the
federal government have also agreed to contribute to the project, he
said.

Mr. Cuomo said the current arrangement is a much better deal for New
Yorkers than an earlier plan that had the state contributing about $500
million toward a train hall whose only tenant would have been Amtrak.

“We have more people coming to New York through Penn Station than JFK
Airport, La Guardia Airport and Newark Airport combined,” Mr. Cuomo
said. “That shouldn’t be the first thing you see of New York, coming
through the old Penn Station.”

When the new train hall opens, which is expected in late 2020, he said,
“This will be an entrance befitting New York.”
