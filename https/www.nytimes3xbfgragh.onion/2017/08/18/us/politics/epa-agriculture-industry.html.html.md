WASHINGTON — In the weeks before the Environmental Protection Agency
[decided to reject its own
scientists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/29/us/politics/epa-insecticide-chlorpyrifos.html?mcubz=3&_r=0)’
advice to ban a potentially harmful pesticide, Scott Pruitt, the
agency’s head, promised farming industry executives who wanted to keep
using the pesticide that it is “a new day, and a new future,” and that
he was listening to their pleas.

Details on this meeting and dozens of other meetings in the weeks
leading up to the [late March decision by Mr.
Pruitt](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-03/documents/chlorpyrifos3b_order_denying_panna_and_nrdc27s_petitition_to_revoke_tolerances.pdf)
are contained in more than [700 pages of internal agency
documents](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html "Full email response")
obtained by The New York Times through a Freedom of Information request.

Though hundreds of pages describing the deliberations were redacted from
the documents, the internal memos show how the E.P.A.’s new staff,
appointed by President Trump, pushed the agency’s career staff to draft
a ruling that would deny [the decade-old petition by
environmentalists](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/hea_10072201a.pdf)
to ban the pesticide,
[chlorpyrifos](https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/chlorpyrifos).

Chlorpyrifos is still widely used in agriculture — on apples, oranges,
strawberries, almonds and many other fruits — though it was [barred from
residential use
in 2000](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2000/06/09/us/epa-citing-risks-to-children-signs-accord-to-limit-insecticide.html).
The [E.P.A.’s scientists have
recommended](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0653-0001)it
be banned from use on farms and produce because it has been[linked to
lower I.Q.s and developmental
delays](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/pesticide-chlorpyrifos-linked-childhood-developmental-delays)
among [agricultural workers and their
children](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Frepository.usfca.edu%2Fcapstone%2F529%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFl-3uwWNpfUbCJd4f0OuRRVxcvwA).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[At a March 1 meeting at E.P.A. headquarters with
members](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p32/a369099 "Meeting with American Farm Bureau from Washington State")of
the American Farm Bureau Federation from Washington State, industry
representatives pressed the E.P.A. not to reduce the number of
pesticides available. They said there were not enough alternative
pesticides to chlorpyrifos. They also said there was a need for “a
reasonable approach to regulate this pesticide,” which is widely used in
Washington State, and that they wanted “the farming community to be more
involved in the process.”

According to the documents, Mr. Pruitt “stressed that this is a new day,
a new future, for a common-sense approach to environmental protection.”
He said the new administration “is looking forward to working closely
with the agricultural community.”

Three days before Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, Dow Chemical had
separately [submitted a request to the agency to
reject](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935257-2017-1-17-Dow-Comments-on-Pesticide-Ban-Urging.html)
the petition to ban chlorpyrifos, calling the scientific link between
the childhood health issues and the pesticide unclear, agency records
show.

Amy Graham, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, said the denial of the petition to
ban chlorpyrifos was justified. “Taking emails out of context doesn’t
change the fact that we continue to examine the science surrounding
chlorpyrifos,” she said in a written statement. She added that the
agency was examining “scientific concerns with the methodology used by
the previous administration.”

The emails show that as late as March 7, [Wendy
Cleland-Hamnett](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-chemical-safety-and-pollution-prevention-ocspp),
the acting head of the E.P.A.’s office of chemical safety, was
presenting the top political staff with options for how to handle the
decade-old petition from an environmental group requesting the ban.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We would talk about impacts of different options in the briefing,” Ms.
Cleland-Hamnett [wrote in a March 7
email.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p228/a369116)
The email raised the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Pruitt to discuss
the pesticide, a decision that the E.P.A.’s political staff had called a
“hot” regulatory item, given a court-ordered deadline of late March to
rule on the petition.

The next day, Ryan Jackson, Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, wrote to
another political appointee that he had “scared” the agency’s career
staff, suggesting that he had made clear the direction that the
political staff wanted to go — and given the career staff explicit
verbal orders to prepare documents explaining why the agency had shifted
its position.

“I think I did scare them or surprise them,” [Mr. Jackson wrote to
Samantha
Dravis](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p530/a369101 "Ryan to Dravis"),
Mr. Pruitt’s political appointee to oversee E.P.A. policy. “They are
getting us information for Friday but they know where this is headed and
they are documenting it well.”

As the draft of the order rejecting the ban of the petition was being
written, political staff at the E.P.A. continued to organize meetings
with agriculture industry officials. An [email on March 10
said:](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p317/a369104)
“Basic info for meeting. Purpose is to reset relationship with ag
leaders.”

When Ms. Cleland-Hamnett wrote back to the political appointees on March
16 to provide a draft of the order rejecting the ban of the pesticide,
[she told her
bosses](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p301/a369109)
that “I think this version will allow you to see how we’re describing
the basis for the denial.”

The emails indicate E.P.A. officials closely coordinated their decision
on chlorpyrifos with the White House and the Department of Agriculture,
which is more closely linked with the agriculture industry and [had
questioned the justification for the
ban](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935263-2017-1-17-USDA-COMMENT-DONT-APPROVE-PETITION.html).

On March 29, as the E.P.A. was about to publicly announce Mr. Pruitt’s
decision to forego the ban, an E.P.A. political employee [asked in an
email](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p357/a369105),
“Did you run this by Ray Starling at the White House?” referring to the
[special assistant to the
president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/27/white-house-national-economic-council-director-announces-senior-staff)
for agriculture, trade and food assistance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

E.P.A. officials wanted to demonstrate in the [news
release](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-pruitt-denies-petition-ban-widely-used-pesticide-0)
that they had the support of the Agriculture Department and the White
House, [writing in one
email](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3935290-EPA-HQ-2017-005731-Redacted.html#document/p141/a369102 "USDA email"),
“Do you think we could add ‘With Support from USDA, Admin....’ Into the
headline, to show it’s a joint release? Or is that too much?”

Environmental groups said the emails demonstrate that the E.P.A. under
Mr. Pruitt is doing favors for the industry, even if it means
compromising public health.

“What is clear from these documents is that Administrator Pruitt’s
abrupt action to vacate the ban on chlorpyrifos was an ideological — not
a health-based decision,” said Melanie Benesh, a legislative attorney at
the [Environmental Working Group.](http://www.ewg.org/) “In fact, the
Pruitt E.P.A. has shown time and time again that it seems to only be
willing to act quickly when it comes to dismantling health-protective
rules like the proposed ban on chlorpyrifos at the behest of industry.”
