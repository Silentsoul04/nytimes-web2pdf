It was a little past 9 a.m. on a Tuesday outside the Lycée Janson de
Sailly, a school in the 16th Arrondissement in Paris. Most of the young
teenage students had already filed into the building as one latecomer
strode down the block. Dressed in a light jacket, hooded sweatshirt,
jeans and a backpack slung over one shoulder, the designer Joseph
Altuzarra could have easily passed for another student.

Smiling and speaking mostly French as he approached, Altuzarra was also
going to the school, but not for any curricular reasons: On Saturday,
the New York-based designer was set to present his first runway show in
Paris there. He was meeting with his production team to assess the site
and discuss various logistics: seating, choreography, which rooms would
transform into ``backstage'' preparation areas for the models.

Though several notable American brands have jumped the New York Fashion
Week calendar in favor of presenting in Paris, mostly for business
reasons, Altuzarra's decision was more personal: Born and raised in
Paris, where he lived until his college years, the designer said the
move was inevitable. He plans to show there for the foreseeable future.

``It was a conflation of a lot of different conversations about our
brand: Paris and the optimism I was feeling here, and where my business
was going, and also my family,'' Altuzarra said. ``All of those things
came to a head about nine months ago --- that's when we started thinking
more seriously about it.'' Logistically, the establishment of a
Paris-based office and showroom earlier this year also made the shift
possible --- ``We didn't want to do it unless we had all the components
in place,'' he said --- as did the encouragement and support of the
French luxury group Kering, which acquired a minority stake in the label
in 2013. It could have been more dramatic to hold off for his brand's
10th anniversary next year but, Altuzarra shrugged, the current timing
felt right.

It was now Thursday morning at the Altuzarra offices off the
Champs-Élysées. The designer, working from his new showroom there,
projected a focused calm, yet there was a sense of urgency in the air.
The show was two days away, and the casting and order of looks was only
finalized the night before. His father, Philippe Altuzarra, was seated
at a table, looking on as Altuzarra and the stylist Vanessa Traina
discussed one of the show's final looks, a shimmering gold-sequined gown
with an elaborately beaded bustier. The collection was drawing on
artisanal handicrafts from around the globe, and man's relationship to
nature, with the animated film ``Princess Mononoke*''* and Charles
Freger's ``Wilder Mann,'' a photography book of ancient agricultural
rites, serving as early inspiration points. ``We wanted it to feel quite
multicultural. That's a really big brand pillar,'' said Altuzarra,
holding up a vest adorned with a row of Spanish-style pompoms.

Saturday morning back at the Lycée Janson de Sailly, workers were
setting up lights around the courtyard's perimeter, while Altuzarra and
a small team were there with two models to shoot some looks from the
collection with the photographer Charles Freger. ``I'd been a fan of his
work for a while --- and then of course there was the inspiration for
this season. We reached out when we knew we'd be in Paris, and he was up
for it,'' Altuzarra said, observing the shoot. The show was eight hours
away, and there was still much to do, but for the moment, he was relaxed
and smiling again, perhaps because despite talk of rain, the skies
looked clear for the night.

By evening, Altuzarra was buzzing around the upstairs dressing area,
which was teeming with models, makeup and hair artists, dressers and
photographers. Kering's C.E.O., François-Henri Pinault, and his wife,
the actress Salma Hayek, arrived to wish him luck. They chatted, but
only briefly, as the show was about to start. In 12 minutes, it would
all be over. ``Enjoy it. Enjoy it, because it's a beautiful moment,''
Hayek said before leaving.
