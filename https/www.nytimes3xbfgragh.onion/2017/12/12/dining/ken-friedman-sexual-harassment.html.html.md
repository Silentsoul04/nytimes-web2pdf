Natalie Saibel, a longtime server at [the Spotted
Pig](https://www.thespottedpig.com/#home), a West Village restaurant
with celebrity investors, didn’t quit in 2015 after the owner, Ken
Friedman, ran his hands over her buttocks and then her groin in a room
crowded with customers, joking that he was searching her pockets for a
forbidden cellphone.

Amy Dee Richardson, a bar manager there, didn’t quit in 2004, when she
says Mr. Friedman bit her on the waist as he bent down to duck under the
bar. Neither did Trish Nelson, a longtime server who said he grabbed her
head and pulled it toward his crotch in front of Amy Poehler in 2007 as
Ms. Nelson knelt to collect glasses from a low shelf.

But one night in 2012, Mr. Friedman pushed Ms. Nelson too far, she said:
He invited her into his car to smoke marijuana and almost immediately
lunged forward and pushed his tongue into her mouth.

“I was scared,” she recalled. “I couldn’t believe it. I had worked for
him for six years.”

Ms. Nelson, 40, said she was pinned against the car door, but managed to
open it and scramble out. She gave notice within days. “I was terrified
to tell anyone why,” she said. “Ken bragged about blacklisting people
all the time. And we saw it happen.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From almost the day in 2004 that it opened on West 11th Street with the
backing of investors like Jay-Z, Michael Stipe and the celebrity chef
Mario Batali, the Spotted Pig shot to the top of the list of New York
City’s hottest restaurants and stayed there. A clubby place whose third
floor is a renowned private playroom for handpicked V.I.P.s, the Spotted
Pig has racked up Michelin stars and
[accolades](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/01/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html)
for its chef, April Bloomfield. In 2016, the James Beard Foundation
[named Mr.
Friedman](https://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/2016-james-beard-award-winners),
known for his charisma and business acumen, its outstanding restaurateur
of the year.

But in more than two dozen interviews with former employees of the
Spotted Pig and other restaurants owned by Mr. Friedman and Ms.
Bloomfield, a dark behind-the-scenes portrait emerged of the owner and
the workplaces he runs.

Even by the loose standards of the hospitality business, where rowdy
drinking sessions after shifts and playful sexual banter are part of the
culture, employees described Mr. Friedman’s restaurants as unusually
sexualized and coercive.

Ten women said that Mr. Friedman, 56, had subjected them to unwanted
sexual advances: groping them in public, demanding sex or making text
requests for nude pictures or group sex. Many others also said that
working for him required tolerating daily kisses and touches, pulling
all-night shifts at private parties that included public sex and nudity,
and enduring catcalls and gropes from guests who are Mr. Friedman’s
friends.

The Spotted Pig has been a regular late-night stop for Mr. Batali, who
this week said he was stepping away from day-to-day operations at his
own restaurants and other businesses after [reports of inappropriate
sexual
behavior](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/11/dining/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct.html).
Employees of the Spotted Pig said they regularly experienced or
witnessed sexual aggression by Mr. Batali there, often with Mr.
Friedman’s knowledge.

In a response to questions from The New York Times on Monday, Mr.
Friedman said his personal and professional lives are intertwined with
his restaurants and staff. (His wife is a former host at the Spotted
Pig.) “Some incidents were not as described, but context and content are
not today’s discussion,” he said. “I apologize now publicly for my
actions.”

His behavior, he said, “can accurately be described at times as
abrasive, rude and frankly wrong.” He said the women who work at his
restaurants “are among the best in the business and putting any of them
in humiliating situations is unjustifiable.”

On Tuesday, after this article was published, his company announced that
Mr. Friedman had decided to take an indefinite leave of absence from the
management of the restaurants, effective immediately.

Mr. Friedman is one of the nation’s top restaurateurs, in large part
because of his partnership with Ms. Bloomfield, who is among the
highest-profile chefs. They own five restaurants in New York — the
Spotted Pig, [the Breslin Bar & Dining
Room](https://www.thebreslin.com/), [the John Dory Oyster
Bar](https://www.thejohndory.com/), [Salvation
Taco](https://www.salvationtaco.com/) and [White Gold
Butchers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/07/dining/white-gold-butchers-review-april-bloomfield-restaurant.html?_r=0)
— as well as [Tosca Cafe](http://toscacafesf.com/) in San Francisco and
the [Hearth & Hound](https://www.thehearthandhound.com/), which opened
just last Friday in Los Angeles.

Many employees said that they, like Mr. Friedman, sometimes blurred the
lines between their professional and personal lives.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are not people who can live in cubicles,” said Carla Rza Betts, 39,
who was wine director at the Spotted Pig, [the
Breslin](https://www.thebreslin.com/)and [the John
Dory](https://www.thejohndory.com/) from 2009 until 2013, when she left
the company after experiencing what she said were multiple incidents of
sexual harassment by Mr. Friedman. “There is a grab-ass, superfun
late-night culture — I love that part of the industry. But there is a
difference between fun and sexualized camaraderie and predation. When
you are made to feel unsafe or dirty or embarrassed, that is a different
thing.”

All the employees interviewed said that for many women, Mr. Friedman’s
unwelcome sexual overtures, verbal and physical, were part of the daily
routine at his New York restaurants, especially the small, intimate
Spotted Pig. They said Mr. Friedman had frequent consensual sexual
relationships with employees; openly hired, promoted or fired people
based on their physical attractiveness; was often intoxicated at work;
and pressured staff members to drink and take drugs with him and guests.

Many said they had come to fear Mr. Friedman, a burly man well over six
feet tall, because of his volatile temper and verbal bullying.

“We had to brace ourselves every time Ken arrived,” said Ms. Saibel, 40,
the server who was groped by Mr. Friedman in the dining room of the
Spotted Pig. (Her account was corroborated by two other employees who
were present.) “When he wasn’t coming on to us, he was screaming at us.”

They also said that their fear was motivated by the knowledge that Mr.
Friedman had retaliated against employees who stood up to him by firing
them, blacklisting them or harassing them via phone, text or email.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Saibel wrote up a formal complaint about Mr. Friedman and sent it to
the restaurant’s managers and Ms. Bloomfield. Soon afterward, she and
her husband, both longtime employees, were fired for minor infractions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Several other employees say they also brought their complaints and
concerns about Mr. Friedman to Ms. Bloomfield. “Her response was always
the same,” said Ms. Nelson, who did not bring her complaints to the chef
but was close to others who did. “‘That’s who he is. Get used to it. Or
go work for someone else.’”

Allegations of sexual harassment may seem surprising given Mr.
Friedman’s longtime collaboration with Ms. Bloomfield, 43. The two
have clearly divided their domains: the dining room and bar are headed
by Mr. Friedman, and the kitchens by Ms. Bloomfield. “My energies are
directed to the kitchen, food preparation and menu development,” Ms.
Bloomfield said in a statement.

But staff members said they turned to her for relief. “I went to April
directly multiple times about Ken’s inappropriate and abusive behavior,
because among other problems it generated huge turnover among the
staff,” said Natalie Freihon, a former food and beverage director for
the group’s ventures at the Ace Hotel New York, including the Breslin
and the John Dory. “She really didn’t want the turnover to continue. But
she completely backed off from getting involved with the behavior.”

Ms. Bloomfield denied that. “In the two matters involving uninvited
approaches that were brought to my attention over the years, I
immediately referred both to our outside labor counsel and they were
addressed internally,” she said in her statement. “I have spoken to Ken
about professional boundaries and relied on him to uphold our policies.
Nonetheless I feel we have let down our employees and for that I
sincerely apologize.”

Kelly Berg, who was hired in May as director of human resources for the
restaurant company, Friedfield Breslin L.L.C., said in a statement that
no employees had been dismissed or retaliated against for filing a
complaint.

“All employees are encouraged to report any concerns about the
workplace, and I am saddened to learn some hesitated or chose to not do
so,” she wrote. She would not answer questions about specific complaints
or discuss how long those policies had been in place.

## Perks, at a Price

Many employees said Mr. Friedman was often genuinely warm and
professionally supportive of women, as long as they tolerated his
flirtatious behavior. In retrospect, several women said, his bursts of
good-natured playfulness and generosity made it possible for them to
ignore the fear, chaos and power imbalance in the relationship —
sometimes, for years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He can be charismatic and fun,” said Jamie Seet, who worked for Mr.
Friedman from 2006 to 2014, including three years as general manager of
the Spotted Pig. “But everyone goes on the chopping block eventually.”

And the rewards of a job at a Friedman-Bloomfield restaurant can be
great. Servers at the top of their game can earn six figures in a year.
Working with Ms. Bloomfield confers prestige in restaurants around the
world. Mr. Friedman has treated favored employees to after-work drinks,
field trips to his beach house and top-tier concert
tickets.

Ms. Rza Betts, the former wine director, said working at the Breslin
while Ms. Bloomfield’s star was rising was so rewarding that she simply
shrugged off Mr. Friedman’s hugs that went on too long, and his
occasional slaps on her buttocks.

But one night in the fall of 2010, she recalls, Mr. Friedman took her
out for drinks at a new rooftop bar near the Breslin, ostensibly to
check out the competition. He leaned over, Ms. Rza Betts said, and
planted a sloppy kiss on her mouth.

“In the moment you are not thinking at all,” she said. “He’s your boss.
You don’t punch him. You just don’t kiss back, and pull away and try to
shake it off.”

She politely brushed him off, but they kept coming. “Cone on. One sexy
pic.”

“Nope,” she texted. “No kisses. No pix. I’m a straight shooting career
woman.”

“Just 1. Your body,” he responded.

He gave up only after sending eight separate texts, which she shared
with The Times. “I was embarrassed, felt taken advantage of and
emotionally manipulated,” Ms. Rza Betts said.

She decided to work harder, knowing that pushing back could put her job
in jeopardy. Then, one day in October 2011, she was cleaning up after a
sherry-themed dinner at the Spotted Pig. Mr. Friedman, she said,
remarked that she had started wearing push-up bras — probably, he added,
to conceal the stretch marks on her breasts.

Ms. Rza Betts recorded the incident in her journal the next day. Still,
she kept working for him until 2013. “I made a decision to stay there
because I loved the job and I loved April’s food and I believed in it,”
she said. “You hike up your bootstraps and you work. That’s how we all
survived working for him.”

## On the Third Floor

Tales of sexual predation at the highest levels of the culinary world
have swirled for decades, but have been brought to light only recently.
In October, [The New Orleans Times-Picayune
reported](http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2017/10/john_besh_restaurants_fostered.html)
that more than 25 former and current employees of the chef John Besh
said they experienced sexual harassment while working at his popular
restaurants in that city. (Mr. Besh did not respond directly to the
accusations, but stepped down from his company.)

Industry veterans say restaurants are especially accommodating to
behavior that pushes the boundaries of sexuality in a workplace.
Experienced servers accept that flirting is sometimes part of securing a
good tip. Shifts are filled with sexual banter that many welcome as
playful.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the Spotted Pig turned that formula up several notches. In past
interviews, Mr. Friedman — a former manager of bands, including the
Smiths — has said his goal was to make a restaurant, with exceptional
food, that was as sexy as any bar in town.

His vision was perhaps best expressed on the third floor of the Spotted
Pig, an invitation-only space entered through unmarked doors. Decorated
with posters, mismatched chairs and British knickknacks, it looks more
like the ramshackle studio apartment of a graduate student than a V.I.P.
haunt. The scruffy, bohemian ambience and Mr. Friedman’s talent as a
host and gatekeeper have made it a place where celebrities feel
comfortable.

In the early days, Beyoncé would be there laughing with friends, while
locals like Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin caught up at the next
table. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West celebrated Valentine’s Day there in
2015; [Charlie
Rose](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/20/us/charlie-rose-women.html),
a regular, has held court at birthday dinners.

But late at night, after the first-floor dining room closed and the
party moved upstairs, Mr. Friedman made it clear that normal restaurant
rules did not apply, several employees said. In the frequently packed
room, guests openly groped female servers, who said Mr. Friedman
required them to work until parties ended, often after dawn.

Ms. Seet, the former manager, said that during a party in 2008, she
intervened when she saw on the security camera feed that Mr. Batali, who
was drunk, was groping and kissing a woman who appeared to be
unconscious.

“We called him the Red Menace,” said Ms. Nelson, the former server. “He
tried to touch my breasts and told me that they were beautiful. He
wanted to wrestle. As I was serving drinks to his table, he told me I
should sit on his friend’s face.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Batali apologized on Tuesday. “Though I don’t remember these
specific accounts, there is no question I have behaved terribly,” he
wrote in an email to The Times. “There are no excuses. I take full
responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or
discomfort I have caused.”

Among employees and industry insiders, the third-floor space has earned
a nickname: “the rape room.”

Mr. Friedman has also been intimidating in other parts of his empire,
even to men on the staff. “There were definitely times I was scared of
him,” said David Rabig, a former manager at several Friedman
restaurants. “He’s a very large man. He likes to threaten to fire
people. He liked to remind people he was the boss.”

Mr. Friedman especially likes to show off around celebrities, and “that
involved humiliating the staff,” Mr. Rabig
said.

that included public sex and nudity, and being catcalled or groped by
guests.

Ms. Nelson, the waiter and aspiring comedian whom Mr. Friedman kissed in
his car, recalled the time she met an idol, Ms. Poehler. Ms. Nelson said
she was bartending on the third floor and happened to be kneeling down,
stacking glasses on a tray. Mr. Friedman was standing next to her when
Ms. Poehler walked over. He introduced the two women. Ms. Nelson, still
on her knees, reached up to shake Ms. Poehler’s hand.

As Ms. Nelson recalls it, Mr. Friedman said, “And while you’re down
there” as he grabbed the back of her head and pulled it into his crotch.

“Aside from hanging my head in painful humiliation, I did nothing,” she
wrote in a Facebook post in October, when the cascade of revelations
about [Harvey
Weinstein](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html)
reminded her daily of her time at the Spotted Pig. “I can’t even retell
this story now without getting teary. It is one of the many demoralizing
experiences that have taken place within my 20+ year waitressing
career.”

Contacted through her agent, Ms. Poehler said, “I have no recollection
of this, but it’s horrible.”

## Complaints and Consequences

Like many restaurants, the Spotted Pig operated for many years with a
patchwork approach to human-resources management. Employees were told to
bring sexual harassment claims directly to restaurant managers.

But the managers interviewed by The Times said that they were often
promoted because they were close to Mr. Friedman, so that rarely
happened. Several employees said that when they did report problems,
managers brushed them off or confided that they themselves were too
afraid of Mr. Friedman’s verbal abuse to take action.

“That’s what’s so broken about this industry, and this situation,” said
Ms. Nelson, who has worked in restaurants including the Standard in Los
Angeles, whose owner, André Balazs, has [recently been accused of sexual
harassment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/09/style/andre-balazs-accused-of-groping-standard-chateau-marmont.html?_r=0).
“The people you are reporting the abuse to are the abusers.”

Ms. Berg, the company’s recently hired human resources director, said in
a statement that employees now go through anti-harassment training
sessions and that personnel policies have been outlined in an employee
handbook.

Employees said harassment took many forms under Mr. Friedman. Jessica
Brown, 35, who now oversees food and beverages at JetBlue, took over as
the Breslin’s wine director after Ms. Rza Betts left in 2013. When Ms.
Brown became pregnant, she feared for her job.

In 2015, soon after her marriage, she requested a meeting with Mr.
Friedman and another manager to discuss her compensation. A worried Mr.
Friedman asked her if she was pregnant, she said. She told him she
wasn’t. “Could you at least schedule this kind of thing for during the
slow season?” she quoted him as saying.

Later that year, Ms. Brown did become pregnant, and told a supervisor in
confidence. Just over a week later, she was terminated; managers told
her it was because the organization was downsizing and her position was
being
eliminated.

She filed a complaint with the city’s Commission on Human Rights; the
agency found that because the Breslin was indeed reducing its staff at
the time, her firing was not a violation — but that Mr. Friedman’s
discriminatory comments about her pregnancy could be investigated as a
violation. For legal and financial reasons, Ms. Brown chose to not
pursue the case further but remains convinced that it was her pregnancy
that triggered the firing.

“The sex factor is important to Ken,” she said. “Having a pregnant woman
on the floor is not sexy.”

Ms. Seet, 37, the former manager of the Spotted Pig, left the company in
2014 after eight years. She said that because she is a lesbian, she was
not a sexual target for Mr. Friedman, but the two had a close,
tumultuous relationship that she now sees as abusive.

Ms. Seet said Mr. Friedman subjected her, like other managers, to
screaming, profane tirades over minor details like an imperfectly
fluffed pillow. He would order employees out of the restaurant in a
rage, then rehire them the next day.

When they quit, Mr. Friedman offered apologies, promises to reform and
make-up gifts: in Ms. Seet’s case, tickets to a Lady Gaga concert and
dinner for her and her wife at Quince, an elegant restaurant in San
Francisco, where she had moved to manage the opening of Tosca Cafe.

“I told him I felt like a battered wife,” she said.

Ms. Seet says that when she finally resigned, Mr. Friedman wrote her a
long, profanity-filled email threatening to blackball her in the
industry.

Soon afterward, she moved back to New York to take a job as general
manager of
[Santina](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/22/dining/restaurant-review-santina-in-the-meatpacking-district.html),
a restaurant near the High Line that was being opened by the
high-profile [Major Food Group](https://www.majorfood.com/). But two
days before she was to start, the group abruptly rescinded the offer;
Ms. Seet said a senior manager told her that Mr. Friedman had ordered
them not to hire her. (Her account was corroborated by the manager and a
former assistant to Mr. Friedman.)

“Ken has tried to blacklist many people,” said Ms. Freihon, formerly of
the Breslin. “The restaurant industry is very small and tight knit, and
he does know everyone.”

“‘Everyone’ means the male chefs and the male restaurant owners and the
male C.F.O.s,” she said. “Advancement is incredibly hard for women in
this industry because you never know what the men are saying about you.”

Over all, Ms. Seet said, working for Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield was
nearly as thrilling as it was abusive. The constant drama created tight,
familial relationships.

But, she and many others said, in order for the restaurant industry to
finally allow women to build long-term careers, chaotic workplaces like
the Spotted Pig will have to change.

“I feel guilty even talking to you,” she said. “But it’s got to stop.”
