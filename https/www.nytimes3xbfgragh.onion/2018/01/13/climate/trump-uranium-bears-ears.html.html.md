MONUMENT VALLEY, Utah — Garry Holiday grew up among the abandoned mines
that dot the Navajo Nation’s red landscape, remnants of a time when
uranium helped cement America’s status as a nuclear superpower and
fueled its nuclear energy program.

It left a toxic legacy. All but a few of the 500 abandoned mines still
await cleanup. Mining tainted the local groundwater. Mr. Holiday’s
father succumbed to respiratory disease after years of hacking the ore
from the earth.

But now, emboldened by the Trump administration’s embrace of corporate
interests, the uranium mining industry is renewing a push into the areas
adjacent to Mr. Holiday’s Navajo Nation home: the Grand Canyon watershed
to the west, where a new uranium mine is preparing to open, and the
Bears Ears National Monument to the north.

[The Trump administration is set to shrink Bears Ears by 85
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/04/us/trump-bears-ears.html)
next month, potentially opening more than a million acres to mining,
drilling and other industrial activity. But even as Interior Secretary
Ryan Zinke declared last month that “there is no mine within Bears
Ears,” there were more than 300 uranium mining claims inside the
monument, according to data from Utah’s Bureau of Land Management office
that was reviewed by The New York Times.

The vast majority of those claims fall neatly outside the new boundaries
of Bears Ears set by the administration. And an examination of local
B.L.M. records, including those not yet entered into the agency’s [land
and mineral use authorizations
database](https://reports.blm.gov/content/lr2000/about/), shows that
about a third of the claims are linked to Energy Fuels, a Canadian
uranium producer. Energy Fuels also owns the Grand Canyon mine, where
groundwater has already flooded the main shaft.

Energy Fuels, together with other mining groups, lobbied extensively for
a reduction of Bears Ears, preparing maps that marked the areas it
wanted removed from the monument and distributing them during a visit to
the monument by Mr. Zinke in May.

is part of a wider effort by the long-ailing uranium industry to make a

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Uranium Producers of America, an industry group, is pushing the
Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw [regulations proposed by the
Obama
administration](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/40-cfr-part-192-proposed-rulemaking-and-background-documents)
to strengthen groundwater protections at uranium mines. Mining groups
have also waged a six-year legal battle against a moratorium on new
uranium mining on more than a million acres of land adjacent to the
Grand Canyon.

For the Navajo, the drive for new mines is a painful flashback.

“Back then, we didn’t know it was dangerous — nobody told us,” Mr.
Holiday said, as he pointed to the gashes of discolored rocks that mark
where the old uranium mines cut into the region’s mesas. “Now they know.
They know.”

Supporters of the mining say that a revival of domestic uranium
production, which has [declined by 90 percent
since 1980](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=26472) amid
slumping prices and foreign competition, will make the United States a
larger player in the global uranium market.

It would expand the country’s energy independence, they say, and give a
lift to nuclear power, still a pillar of carbon-free power generation.
Canada, Kazakhstan, Australia, Russia and a few other countries now
[supply most of America’s nuclear
fuel](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=nuclear_where).

The dwindling domestic market was thrust into the spotlight by the
contentious [2010 decision under the Obama
administration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/14/us/politics/uranium-one-hillary-clinton.html)
that allowed Russia’s nuclear agency to buy Uranium One, a company that
has amassed production facilities in the United States. [The Justice
Department is examining
allegations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/13/us/politics/justice-department-uranium-one-special-counsel.html)

decision.

The trip was one of the earliest made by Mr. Zinke to the vast lands he
oversees as secretary of the interior: a visit to Bears Ears, where he
struck a commanding figure, touring the rugged terrain on horseback.

A notable presence on Mr. Zinke’s trip was Energy Fuels, the Canadian
uranium producer. Company executives openly lobbied for shrinking Bears
Ears’ borders, handing out the map that marked the pockets the company
wanted removed: areas adjacent to its White Mesa Mill, just to the east
of the monument, and its Daneros Mine, which it is developing just to
the west.

“They wanted to talk to anyone who’d listen,” said Commissioner Phil
Lyman of San Juan County, Utah, a Republican who participated in the
tour and is sympathetic to Energy Fuels’ position. “They were there
representing their business interest.”

Mr. Zinke has insisted that mining played no role in the decision to
shrink Bears Ears, and a department spokeswoman said he had met with
interested parties on all sides.

But President Trump has prioritized scrapping environmental regulations
to help revitalize domestic energy production. His [executive order
instructing Mr. Zinke to review Bears
Ears](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/05/01/2017-08908/review-of-designations-under-the-antiquities-act)
said that improper monument designations could “create barriers to
achieving energy independence.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In theory, even after President Barack Obama established Bears Ears in
2016, mining companies could have developed any of the claims within it,
given proper local approvals. But companies say that expanding the
sites, or even building roads to access them, would have required
special permits, driving up
costs.

Energy Fuels said it had sold its Bears Ears claims to a smaller
company, Encore Energy, in 2016. But Encore issued shares to Energy
Fuels in return, making Energy Fuels [Encore’s largest
shareholder](http://encoreenergycorp.com/share-structure/), with [a seat
on its
board](http://encoreenergycorp.com/corporate/board-of-directors/).

Curtis Moore, an Energy Fuels spokesman, said the company had played
only a small part in the decision to shrink Bears Ears. The company
proposed scaling back the monument by just 2.5 percent, he said, and was
prepared to support a ban within the rest of the original boundaries.

Yet two weeks after Mr. Zinke’s visit, [Energy Fuels wrote to the
Interior
Department](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-99711)
arguing there were many other known uranium deposits within Bears Ears
“that could provide valuable energy and mineral resources in the
future” and urging the department to shrink the monument away from any
“existing or future operations.”

[A bill introduced last month by Representative John
Curtis](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4532/text),
Republican of Utah, would codify Mr. Trump’s cuts to the monument while
banning further drilling or mining within the original boundaries. But
environmental groups say the bill has little chance of passing at all,
let alone before the monument is scaled back next month.

“Come February, anyone can place a mining claim on the land,” said Greg
Zimmerman, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a
conservation
group.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the end of a dirt road just six miles from the Grand Canyon’s South
Rim, the uranium industry’s renewed ambitions, and challenges, are on
display.

Three decades after exploratory drilling uncovered uranium deposits,
production at Energy Fuels’ Canyon Mine is finally starting up, the
wheel above a 1,500-foot shaft slowly turning during a recent visit. The
company calls Canyon Mine a “high-grade” project, with the potential to
compete with mines overseas.

It is already running into trouble.

As workers drilled into the formations that make up the region’s
distinct rock layers last year, they hit shallow groundwater. The water
flooded the mine’s shaft, forcing workers to pump the runoff — by then
contaminated with uranium — into open ponds, where they used industrial
sprayers to speed evaporation. Those sprayers were present during a
recent visit, and water could be seen from outside the compound
continuing to pour into a large evaporation pond.

Energy Fuels officials said hitting shallow groundwater was to be
expected, and rejected concerns that contamination could escape.

Still, Fred Tillman, an environmental engineer with the United States
Geological Survey, said during a recent visit to the mine that the
groundwater flows in the region were too complex to rule out the risk of
contamination.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“There are these big unknowns about the potential impacts on cultural
resources, on biological resources, on water resources,” Dr. Tillman
said.

Even as troubles persist on the ground, the industry pushback has
continued.

In court, mining groups led by the National Mining Association have
challenged a 20-year moratorium on mining in the Grand Canyon watershed,
established in 2012 by the Obama administration. (The Canyon Mine
predates the moratorium.)

A federal court of appeals [upheld the moratorium last
month](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/mining/Grand_Canyon_Uranium_Mining/pdfs/9thCirOpinionAffirmingGrandCanyonWithdrawal-12-12-2017.pdf).
But the United States Forest Service [has recommended rolling back the
protections](https://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/eo-13783-usda-final-report-10.11.17.pdf),
meaning the Trump administration could soon reverse them on its own.

The Arizona Chamber of Commerce, which represents mining interests, also
backed an effort to defeat a separate proposal that would have
permanently banned mining on 1.7 million acres surrounding the Grand
Canyon. An Energy Fuels executive [testified in Congress against the
ban](https://gosar.house.gov/sites/gosar.house.gov/files/harold%20r%20roberts%20testimony%20april%2011%202016%20\(2\).pdf).

And with the help of Republican senators like John Barrasso of Wyoming,
the industry has pressed the E.P.A. to withdraw [an Obama-era
proposal](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/40-cfr-part-192-proposed-rulemaking-and-background-documents)
that would strengthen groundwater protections at uranium
mines.

Senator Barrasso has received [more than $350,000 in campaign
contributions from mining
groups](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/industries?cid=N00006236&cycle=CAREER&type=I)
over his career. His office did not respond to requests for comment.

The proposal would regulate a mining method called in-situ recovery,
which involves injecting a solution into aquifers containing uranium and
bringing that solution to the surface for processing — a method
[criticized by
environmentalists](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/uranium-mining-report.pdf)
as posing wider contamination risks.

The rule is unnecessary and will cost jobs, Mr. Indall, the lawyer for
Uranium Producers of America, said in [a letter to Scott
Pruitt](http://theupa.org/_resources/news/UPA-Comments-EPA-Regulatory-Review-May-15-2017.pdf),
the E.P.A. administrator. In July, U.P.A. representatives [met with Mr.
Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick
Perry](http://www.theupa.org/_resources/news/UPA-July-25-2017-Press-Release.pdf)
to press their case.

The E.P.A. said in a statement that it was “reviewing options for next
steps.”

Last month, [Mr. Barrasso again called on the agency to withdraw the
rule](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7/b/7b0204a4-681d-4f61-ace0-c76a791467ba/70422F424D1DF2650D3BFD02D7571E04.12.14.17-barrasso-pruitt-letter-isr.pdf),
calling it “unreasonably burdensome.”

The Navajo town of Sanders, Ariz., a dusty outpost with a single
stoplight, is a reminder of uranium’s lasting environmental legacy.

In Sanders, hundreds of people were exposed to potentially dangerous
levels of uranium in their drinking water for years, until testing by a
doctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University named Tommy Rock
exposed the contamination.

“I was shocked,” Mr. Rock said. “I wasn’t expecting that reading at
all.”

Mr. Rock and other scientists say they suspect a link to the 1979 breach
of a wastewater pond at [a uranium mill in Church Rock, N.M., now a
Superfund
site](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0600819).
That accident is considered the single largest release of radioactive
material in American history, surpassing the crisis at Three Mile
Island.

It wasn’t until 2003, however, that testing by state regulators picked
up uranium levels in Sanders’s tap water. Still, the community was not
told. Erin Jordan, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality, said the department had urged the now-defunct
local water company for years to address the contamination, but it had
been up to that company to notify its customers.

Only in 2015, after Mr. Rock raised the alarm, did local regulators
issue a public notice.

The town’s school district, whose wells were also contaminated with
uranium, received little state or federal assistance. It shut off its
water fountains and handed out bottled water to its 800 elementary and
middle-school students.

The schools finally installed filters last May. Parents remain on edge.

“I still don’t trust the water,” said Shanon Sangster, who still sends
her 10-year-old daughter, Shania, to school with bottled water. “It’s
like we are all scarred by it, by the
uranium.”
