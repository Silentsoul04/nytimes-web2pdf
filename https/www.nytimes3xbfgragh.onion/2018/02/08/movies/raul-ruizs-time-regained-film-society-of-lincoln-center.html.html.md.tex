There is a truism that a great novel cannot provide the basis for a
great --- or even a very good --- movie. If so, the 1999 Raúl Ruiz film,
``Time Regained,'' adapted from the last volume of Proust's ``In Search
of Lost Time,'' is an exception that proves the rule.

Showing for a week in a new digital restoration as part of the Film
Society of Lincoln Center's second
\href{https://www.filmlinc.org/press/fslc-announces-life-dream-films-raul-ruiz-part-2-february-9-18/}{Ruiz
retrospective}, ``Time Regained'' is as close as Ruiz, the Chilean-born
filmmaker who died in 2011, came to making the kind of entertainment
that used to be called a ``movie movie.''

As omnipresent as Proust's narrator, the camera insinuates itself among
the glamorous cast. Catherine Deneuve plays the former courtesan Odette
de Crecy, with Emmanuelle Béart as her daughter Gilberte. Ms. Deneuve's
actual daughter, Chiara Mastroianni, has a cameo as the elusive
Albertine. Marie-France Pisier trills her way through the film as the
social climbing Madame Verdurin. Pascal Greggory and John Malkovich also
have juicy roles, as Gilberte's unfaithful husband and the cheerfully
depraved Baron de Charlus.

Standing in for the book's unnamed narrator is the little-known Italian
actor Marcello Mazzarella, made up here with a dapper mustache and
kohl-rimmed eyes to resemble Proust. He is referred to as ``Marcel''
and, in his outsize hat and overly large coat, cuts an almost
Chaplinesque figure --- an obvious outsider in this ostentatiously
glittering ensemble.

Ruiz's film has no particular plot. Or, rather, there are many. Proust's
``Time Regained'' postscripts the action of his novel's six preceding
volumes. The narrator revisits past events and, in effect, explains how
the entire work came into being. The movie opens with Marcel on his
deathbed, imagining his novel. His recent return to Paris is much on his
mind. World War I is raging as he re-encounters his old social circle,
attends their soirees and observes their affairs. People are recalled at
various ages; the writer is watched in memories by his childhood self.

``If there were a prize for sheer ambition at this year's New York Film
Festival, it would justly go to `Time Regained,''' Janet Maslin wrote in
her mixed
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/library/film/093099time-film-review.html}{review}
for The New York Times. Proust is a writer whose work defeated such
distinguished adapters as Joseph Losey and Luchino Visconti; Ruiz
succeeds because his movie is something of a search for Proust's own
search.

``Time Regained'' lacks the majestic screwiness of Ruiz's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/30/movies/the-films-of-raul-ruiz-come-to-lincoln-center.html}{earlier}fun
house labyrinths, like ``Three Crowns of the Sailor'' and
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/12/30/movies/chilean-s-life-is-a-dream.html}{``Life
Is a Dream,''} but finds all manner of visual equivalents to its source
--- not just the circular narrative or modernist, multiple-perspective
simultaneity but also the way that movies themselves are predicated on
physiological memories. Photographs abound, as do match cuts, sound
bridges and other forms of associative editing. All about remembering
(cinema not least), this luxurious bath in the river of time is, to lift
a phrase from Proust, consecrated to ``the miracle of an analogy.''

The movie is also a testament to the Proustian notion that true
paradises are those that are lost. ``Time Regained'' had its theatrical
opening at the recently closed
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/16/nyregion/lincoln-plaza-cinema-close.html}{Lincoln
Plaza Cinema}; it may move some who see it again with an additional
sense of time gone by.
