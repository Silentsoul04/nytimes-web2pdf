WASHINGTON — State Senator Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat an incumbent
senator in 2014, is expected to announce this week that he will
challenge Mississippi’s junior United States senator, Roger Wicker,
testing the potency of an anti-establishment message in the Trump era.

After months of speculation about his intentions, Mr. McDaniel said in a
Facebook video Monday night that he would reveal his decision at a
hometown rally in Ellisville, Miss., on Wednesday, the day before the
filing period to run in 2018 comes to an end.

“We’re looking for a fight, and I can’t wait for you to be on my team
again,” he said in the video.

Yet even as Republicans familiar with his planning said that Mr.
McDaniel would take on Mr. Wicker, there is still uncertainty about
which of the two Mississippi Senate seats Mr. McDaniel will ultimately
attempt to claim.

Mr. McDaniel, 45, a hard-line conservative, [nearly unseated
Mississippi’s senior senator, Thad
Cochran](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/25/us/politics/thad-cochran-chris-mcdaniel-mississippi-senate-primary.html),
four years ago in an extraordinarily bitter, racially tinged primary
that exposed the depth of hostilities between the party’s Tea Party and
establishment wings. Mr. Cochran, now 80, has suffered health
challenges, creating expectations in Republican circles that he would
resign and leave the state’s other seat up for grabs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With Mr. Cochran ailing, Mr. McDaniel put off his [long-anticipated
challenge of Mr.
Wicker](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/21/us/politics/mcdaniel-wicker-mississippi-senate-race-bannon.html)
and turned his sights to what multiple Mississippians said was his
preference: receiving assurances from Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican,
that the appointment would be his once the senior senator stepped down.

But Mr. Bryant has firmly refused to offer any such guarantee, and when
approached by a reporter at a meeting of the National Governors
Association here this weekend, the governor smiled and said: “I think
Senator Cochran is doing a great job.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So with no promise of an appointment, no certainty Mr. Cochran will
resign and a filing deadline looming, Mr. McDaniel has returned to his
original plan of challenging Mr. Wicker, a mild-mannered and
establishment-aligned lawmaker.

Mr. Wicker, 66, could prove difficult for Mr. McDaniel to defeat.
President Trump, stung by the [defeat of Roy S.
Moore](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/12/us/politics/alabama-senate-race-winner.html)
last year in Alabama, has already conveyed his support to Mr. Wicker and
has little appetite to risk another Senate seat in the Deep South. In
fact, Mr. Trump has wooed Mr. Bryant to appoint himself to Mr. Cochran’s
Senate seat, should it come open, to block Mr. McDaniel and pre-empt a
nasty intraparty feud.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. McDaniel is not without assets. He is well known among the
state’s conservative activists thanks to his 2014 run, when he
outpolled Mr. Cochran in the first Republican balloting, and already has
a “super PAC” airing radio ads and lining up field staff to help his
campaign.

“Mississippi deserves a constitutional conservative who holds the same
values as Mississippians and is a consistent and strong voice for them
in Washington, D.C.,” said Tommy Barnett, the treasurer of the Remember
Mississippi super PAC. “We can’t wait to support a McDaniel run. Bring
it on.”

The group had raised over $1 million as of late last month, winning
support from a few major Republican donors including the Illinois
industrialist Richard Uihlein.

To many veteran Mississippi Republicans, though, the specter of yet
another bloody Republican primary, whether against Mr. Wicker or for Mr.
Cochran’s seat, is stomach-turning.

Joe Nosef, who was the state party chairman during the 2014 race, is
close to Mr. Wicker but related by marriage to Mr. McDaniel. Noting that
he stepped down from his post this past fall, Mr. Nosef said, “When I
think of the things I’m going to miss about being state chairman, this
race, if it happens, isn’t going to rank at the top, middle or bottom of
that list.”
