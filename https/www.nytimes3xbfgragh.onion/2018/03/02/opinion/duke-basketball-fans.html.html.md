<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is your senior spring. You are going to your first Duke basketball
game. You will no longer be a shame unto your clan.

You wish you could paint yourself blue, or smear your face with one of
those hands of Saruman the Uruk-hai wear. But then you remember when you
were a freshman and those guys used house paint and were worried it
seeped into their blood. You are O.K. without.

The best you can manage is your Duke biology T-shirt and some light-up
Blue Devil horns someone left in your room. You kept the horns in case
you ever went to a game. The horns will have their day.

You make the two-minute trek from your dorm to Cameron Indoor Stadium,
weaving through K-Ville, the sprawling shantytown that crops up every
year outside the arena. Your friends live in tents from January to
March, waiting in line to earn tickets to the big Carolina game. It has
been raining a lot this year. Lots of tenters have pneumonia and
bronchitis and the flu, so you’re glad you didn’t tent. But you had the
flu and bronchitis anyway, so net neutral, you guess.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As you enter Cameron, you come upon the Line Monitors. At some point in
the hazy past, an enterprising group of rule-followers wrested control
of the shantytown from the administration. Now they’re an organization
that rushes like a frat or sorority but then gets to haze the entire
Duke tenting population.

These are a sadistic people. They emerge with air horns at 3 a.m. to
check IDs and make sure the tenters have not sneaked back to the comfort
of their beds. How do the Line Monitors sleep at night? They sleep well,
you imagine, because they go home when they’re done with the air horns.
But now they look festive and are wearing blue beads. You wish you had
beads.

They hand you a sheet with cheering instructions, which you are grateful
for. It tells you: “Before Tip: Jump in rhythm with band’s drummer. Yell
‘Woo’ every time you jump.” It also says some strategically mean things
that you are to yell at people at the correct moments. If one particular
guy has the ball, you must remember to tell him his father is better at
basketball. (He is a Jr. and apparently his Sr. was in the N.B.A.) If
there is an alley-oop, the sheet says you must “Lean back and yell ‘Oh.’
Point to the baby being held up on the right side of the court. Yell
‘Baby.’” You vow to ask somebody what an alley-oop is and hope one
happens so you can see this baby.

You ask so many people where the student section is that a police
officer feels bad for you and escorts you there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

You spot a friend from your dorm, one of the aforementioned cruel Line
Monitors. She is proud you are there. She shoos you into the writhing
mass of students that must stand always.

You identify some people you know well enough to stand with. You make
your way to them and wedge your body into the line and glare at the
person you have displaced, even though he is clearly in the right and
there was no room for you.

The opposing team comes out. They are from Virginia Tech, which you hear
is a nice place, but your sheet says it is not. “Virginia Tech’s only
national title is for bass fishing.” The players from the Other Team are
introduced and you must chant the ritual welcome: “HI, JUSTIN … YOU
SUCK\!” We do that for each new player. Ah. This is why people hate us.

Now us\! You recognize Alex O’Connell. He was in your documentary
studies class last semester. He is very, very tall but you only saw him
sitting and he slouches so you thought he was a normal-size person for a
while.

Then the Man Himself emerges. Mike Krzyzewski. Coach K. He is our short
angry Polish-American man and we revere him as a god. As with many gods,
you almost never hear him talk and you see him even less. We pay him $9
million a year to be our short angry man and he has a tower where he
keeps his athletes. And he is *so* short you can’t see him now, but you
know he is there because everyone is bowing over and over again.

It is Valentine’s Day today, but it was Coach K’s birthday yesterday, so
the Line Monitors gave everyone birthday hats. Why didn’t they give you
a birthday hat? Maybe they could tell you are a fraud. You are not a
Cameron Crazie. You are a Cameron Reasonable. You are ashamed.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some minutes pass, filled with what are apparently embarrassing
turnovers on both sides. The game is not going well. The guy next to
you, the one you glared at before, is yelling some particularly
inventive obscenities. His name is Trevor. Who hurt you,
Trevor?

The Line Monitors keep trying to get “Happy Birthday” started, but the
band always interrupts before we can get to the “Coach K” part.

More basketball happens. The Line Monitors are upset because we should
be doing much better than the other team, which your sheet clearly says
is unranked.

There is a person in a bright-blue, full-body fur suit a couple of rows
in front of you. Is he Cookie Monster? A fuzzy Blue Devil? Unclear.

You get distracted when you realize there is a guy who hurls his body on
the court to wipe off the sweat when someone falls. He seems both
honored to be there and filled with terror. Is this a student,
frantically scrubbing bodily fluids? Either way, you are glad you are
not him.

All at once, in perfect unison, the students start chanting, “TUCK YOUR
SHIRT IN.” You quickly scan the court and indeed, someone’s shirt has
come untucked. This was not on your sheet. You are caught unawares. How
could you have anticipated this? You consider tucking in your own shirt.

You are starting to get the hang of some of the sounds you’re supposed
to make. When the opposing team does something stupid like drop the
ball, you go “OOP OOP OOP” and wiggle your arms like an octopus. You are
always relieved when this happens because you know you are doing the
correct thing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We are doing better\! Our boys are now “sinking their 3s.” Blue-fur-suit
guy has a cardboard cutout of a banana. What could this signify? He
finally turns around — he has a gorilla mask on\! But he also has a
tail, which you are sure gorillas do not have because you have earned
the Duke biology T-shirt you are wearing.

O’Connell from documentary studies dunks, but it’s a split second after
the shot clock runs out, so it doesn’t count. Duke wins anyway. The Line
Monitors are relieved and smugly pretend they were never worried we
would lose to the bass-fishing school.

Later you hear you were on ESPN. You take a screenshot for posterity so
that your friends and family will see that, indeed, you went to at least
one game. You are about eight pixels but it is clearly you, staring
blankly toward the camera as the Crazies rage around you, all facing an
entirely different direction. It was less than seven minutes into the
game. You were wondering how early is too early to go for Peanut M\&Ms.
