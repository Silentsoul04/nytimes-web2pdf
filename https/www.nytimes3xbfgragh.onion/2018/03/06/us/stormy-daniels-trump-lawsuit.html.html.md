LOS ANGELES — Donald J. Trump never signed the nondisclosure agreement
lawyers had presented in 2016 to a pornographic-film actress, rendering
it null and void, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by a lawyer
for the actress.

The filing, in Los Angeles Superior Court, represents the latest
development in a legal battle involving Mr. Trump, his longtime personal
lawyer and the actress, Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy
Daniels.

The lawsuit came days after Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal
lawyer, had legally pressured Ms. Clifford, initiating arbitration
proceedings against her in Los Angeles in efforts to prevent her from
speaking out about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump, according
to the complaint.

The suit, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, alleges
that Mr. Trump “purposely did not sign the agreement so he could later,
if need be, publicly disavow any knowledge of the Hush Agreement and Ms.
Clifford.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite not having a nondisclosure agreement in place, the lawsuit says
Mr. Cohen proceeded to wire $130,000 to a trust account held by a lawyer
for Ms. Clifford. The court documents filed on Tuesday do not make clear
when that payment was made.

The lawsuit asks the judge to formally declare that either no agreement
was formed, or that, to the extent an agreement was formed, it is
invalid.

“We fully intend on bringing as much sunlight to this matter as
possible,” said Michael J. Avenatti, a lawyer representing Ms. Clifford
in the suit.

Mr. Cohen did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking
comment. The White House also did not immediately respond to emails
seeking comment.

[Last month, Mr. Cohen
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/13/us/politics/stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-trump.html)
that he had paid $130,000 out of his own pocket to Ms. Clifford, and
that he had not been reimbursed by the Trump Organization or the
campaign.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to
the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the
payment, either directly or indirectly,” Mr. Cohen said in a statement
at the time. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a
campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”

He declined to answer several follow-up questions, including whether Mr.
Trump had been aware that Mr. Cohen made the payment, why he made the
payment or whether he had made similar payments to other people.

Mr. Cohen has previously said that Mr. Trump has denied an affair with
Ms. Clifford. She has said the affair took place soon after Mr. Trump’s
wife, Melania, gave birth to the couple’s son, Barron. Tuesday’s lawsuit
reiterated that timeline, saying Ms. Clifford and Mr. Trump began an
“intimate relationship” in the summer of 2006; the relationship
continued “well into” 2007, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit filed on Tuesday also made public for the first time the
onerous terms of the full two-part contract, which Ms. Clifford signed
on Oct. 28, 2016 — days before the presidential election. The agreement
required Ms. Clifford to pay at least $1 million should she violate it,
and to resolve any disputes related to the contract through binding
confidential arbitration. The lines for the signatures of David Dennison
— a pseudonym for Mr. Trump, according to the complaint — were blank on
the copies of the contracts attached to the court filing.

The lawyer who represented Ms. Clifford in the 2016 negotiations, Keith
M. Davidson, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Mr.
Davidson also represented [Karen
McDougal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/16/us/trump-mcdougal-playboy-model.html),
a former Playboy model who received a $150,000 payment in August 2016
that prevented her from going public with her own allegations of an
affair with Mr. Trump.
