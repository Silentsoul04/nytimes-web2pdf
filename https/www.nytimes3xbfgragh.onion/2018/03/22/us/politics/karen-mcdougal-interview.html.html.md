The former Playboy model [Karen
McDougal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/05/us/fox-news-mcdougal.html)
gave her first television interview about the affair she alleges she had
with Donald J. Trump more than a decade ago, saying that he offered her
money after their first sexual encounter.

“After we had been intimate, he, he tried to pay me — and I actually
didn’t know how to take that,” she told Anderson Cooper of CNN [in an
interview](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/karen-mcdougal-donald-trump/index.html)
broadcast on Thursday night. “I looked at him and said, ‘That’s not me,
I’m not that kind of girl.’”

As a security aide of Mr. Trump’s drove her home, she said, “I started
crying, I was really sad — it really hurt me.”

But, she said, in spite of that encounter in 2006, “I went back,”
conducting what she described as a 10-month, serious relationship that
she finally ended when she could no longer bear the guilt of betraying
Mr. Trump’s then-new wife, Melania.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Pressed by Mr. Cooper on what she would say to Mrs. Trump now, Ms.
McDougal looked directly into the camera, tearing up, and said, “What
can you say except, ‘I’m sorry — I’m sorry.’”

Ms. McDougal’s interview made for a jarring, split-screen news night,
with the major presidential headlines toggling between the allegations
about an extramarital affair from a former Playboy model and Mr. Trump’s
decision to remove his national security adviser H. R. McMaster and
replace him with John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to
the United Nations.

The interview came despite an agreement Ms. McDougal struck during the
2016 presidential campaign with American Media Inc., which owns The
National Enquirer, to sell it the exclusive rights to her story about
Mr. Trump in a $150,000 deal — part of what is known as a “catch and
kill” agreement in which a tabloid buys a story only to bury it. Mr.
Trump is a friend of A.M.I.’s chairman, David J. Pecker.

Ms. McDougal filed suit earlier this week to get out of her deal with
American Media, saying she signed it under pressure and false pretenses,
effectively silencing her on the affair. (American Media has denied her
claims, saying over the past couple of days that the [contract is
valid](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-media-inc-statement-in-response-to-complaint-filed-by-karen-mcdougal-300617127.html),
it was not trying to silence her, and indicating the story [“may be
published”](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-media-inc-responds-to-comments-made-by-attorney-peter-stris-300617875.html)
just yet). Many of the details Ms. McDougal shared in her interview with
Mr. Cooper were included in a piece in [The New
Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal)
magazine last month, based on handwritten notes she took about the
relationship.

But an in-person, television interview is uniquely visceral, and Ms.
McDougal’s appearance was clearly of a sort Mr. Trump’s allies would
have wanted to avoid during the campaign. On Sunday, [“60
Minutes’’](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stormy-daniels-60-minutes-donald-trump-interview-to-be-broadcast-sunday/)is
planning to show an interview by Mr. Cooper with another woman who is
suing to get out of a deal restricting her from speaking about an
alleged affair with Mr. Trump, the adult entertainment star Stephanie
Clifford. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied that he had an affair
with either of the two women.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Composed, unwavering, yet sometimes tearful, Ms. McDougal told a
detailed story about a relationship that was based on love — “he always
told me he loved me,” she said — and was facilitated by one of Mr.
Trump’s bodyguards.

She described herself as a Republican and said she voted for Mr. Trump
in November, describing him as “brilliant” and “charming” and someone
she loved enough to even consider marrying. She said she was now eager
to tell her story because it was already known and she wanted the chance
to tell it herself.

Ms. McDougal said she first met Mr. Trump when he filmed an episode of
“Celebrity Apprentice” at the Playboy Mansion in 2006, where they
struck up conversation and he asked for her number.

She said they had their first date that June, on Mr. Trump’s birthday,
at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mr. Trump invited her for dinner, she said,
so she was surprised when they entered the grounds from a rear entrance
and went directly to a private bungalow. “We’re talking about his
birthday, and then as the night ended, we were intimate,” she said.

What followed, she said, were dozens of dates and sexual encounters in
which, she said in answer to a specific question from Mr. Cooper, Mr.
Trump did not use birth control.

Many of those encounters, she said, took place at the Beverly Hills
Hotel, but she also spent time with Mr. Trump at his other properties
across the country. “I went to his golf course in California,” she said.
“I went to his golf course home in New Jersey. I went to his home in New
York.” At one party, she met his son Eric, and posed with him in a
picture, she said. At another, at the Playboy Mansion, she posed for a
picture with Mr. Trump, Melania Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and
other people, keeping her distance from Mrs. Trump as best she could,
she said.

Ms. McDougal said Mr. Trump had compared her, favorably, to his
daughter. “He said I was beautiful like her and, ‘You’re a smart girl,’”
she said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Once, she said, she was even whisked to his apartment at Trump Tower,
when Mrs. Trump and Barron were not home.

“I said, ‘Aren’t you afraid to bring me here?’ He’s like, ‘They won’t
say anything,’” she said. While he gave her a tour, she said, “we passed
a room and he said this is Melania’s room she likes to have her alone
time.” But, she said, being in the apartment, “just puts a little stab
in your heart,” and she could not wait to leave.

An unbearably guilty conscience prompted her to finally end the
relationship in 2007.

Ms. McDougal said she was “disgusted” by the hot-mic “Access Hollywood”
tape recording that came out late in the presidential campaign in which
Mr. Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, just as she was
“mortified” when more than a dozen women leveled sexual misconduct
allegations at him. “I’ve never seen that side of him,” she said.

Asked about denials Mr. Trump’s representatives have issued about her
allegations of an affair, Ms. McDougal said, “I think somebody’s lying,
and I can tell you it’s not me.”
