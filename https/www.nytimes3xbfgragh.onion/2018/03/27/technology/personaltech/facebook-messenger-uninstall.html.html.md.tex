\textbf{Q.} \emph{How do I delete Facebook Messenger from my phone?}

\textbf{A.} \href{https://www.messenger.com/features}{Facebook
Messenger}, the company's chat program, was spun out of the Facebook
mobile app
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/notes/facebook-engineering/building-facebook-messenger/10150259350998920/}{in
2011}, before the social network removed the chat function from the main
app
\href{https://bits.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/04/15/facebook-forces-users-to-install-separate-messaging-app/}{in
2014}. As with other third-party apps, you can remove it from your phone
with a few taps.

If you use Messenger on a phone
\href{https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2521768?hl=en}{running
a recent version of Android,} open the Settings icon and select Apps \&
Notifications. Find the Messenger icon; if you do not see it, tap See
All Apps (or App Info) first. Tap the Uninstall option. You can also
delete an app from the Android home screen by pressing its icon and then
dragging it to the Uninstall symbol that appears at the top of the
screen.

You can also remove Android apps by opening the Google Play store icon
on your phone, tapping the three-lined menu icon in the top-left corner
and selecting My Apps \& Games. On the next screen, tap the Installed
tab, find the Messenger icon and tap the Open button. When the app's
page is open, tap the Uninstall button.

To delete Messenger \href{https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207618}{on
an iPhone}, go to the home screen, find the app's icon and press your
finger on it until the tile begins to wiggle. Once the wiggling starts,
a small X appears in the icon's top-left corner. Tap the X, and when the
alert box pops up, confirm you wish to delete the app.

Even if you remove the mobile Messenger app (and do not
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/21/technology/personaltech/delete-facebook.html}{delete
your Facebook} account), your Facebook friends can still send you
messages when you are
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/help/735006619902401}{logged
into the desktop version} of the site. A stand-alone web version is also
available at \href{https://www.messenger.com}{Messenger.com}. If you
prefer not to use the chat function, tell your friends to reach you by
other means.
