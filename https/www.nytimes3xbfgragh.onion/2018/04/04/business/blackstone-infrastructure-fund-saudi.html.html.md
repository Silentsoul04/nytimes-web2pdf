Last May, the private equity firm Blackstone announced that it was
creating a $40 billion fund that would invest in infrastructure projects
in the United States. The fund’s largest backer was the government of
Saudi Arabia, which agreed to kick in half the cash.

Ten months later, the highly anticipated fund has yet to complete an
initial round of fund-raising, much less start investing in
infrastructure.

Although the Saudis promised to contribute up to $20 billion, Blackstone
is required to raise a dollar from other investors for every dollar the
kingdom’s Public Investment Fund puts in. So far, only two other
investors have publicly committed to the fund, with their contributions
totaling $575 million, according to data provider Preqin, which tracks
such investments.

In the short term, Blackstone’s goal now is to raise a total of $15
billion — much less than it trumpeted during President Trump’s visit to
Riyadh last spring — according to [a
document](http://www.psers.pa.gov/About/Board/Resolutions/Documents/2018/res02.pdf)
posted on the website of a Pennsylvania pension plan that has agreed to
invest in the fund.

Facing hesitant investors, Blackstone has twice missed its own deadlines
for completing the first round of fund-raising, according to people
briefed on the plans and a timetable included in the Pennsylvania
pension plan’s documents.

Among the factors that have complicated the fund’s launch: Saudi
officials told Blackstone last year that they wanted to create an
investment committee — including one or more Saudi representatives —
that would oversee the fund, according to four people briefed on the
talks who weren’t authorized to discuss them publicly.

The idea was a non-starter for Blackstone officials, who have
consistently avoided outside influence over their investment decisions,
said three of the people briefed on the talks.

“We’ve had a long and broad-based relationship with the Kingdom that’s,
frankly, never been stronger,” said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman
for Blackstone. “They’ve been exceptional partners.” She declined to
discuss the details of the firm’s fund-raising efforts, citing legal
restrictions that apply during marketing periods.

A spokesman for the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund declined to
comment.

Blackstone — whose co-founder and chief executive, Stephen A.
Schwarzman, is a prominent supporter of President Trump — [rushed to
unveil the infrastructure
fund](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/19/business/the-benefits-of-standing-by-the-president.html)
during the pomp-filled presidential visit to Saudi Arabia last May. Wall
Street titans including Mr. Schwarzman attended opulent ceremonies to
celebrate the two countries’ financial and political ties.

The deal fit neatly into the White House’s efforts to coax foreign
countries to invest in the United States. Blackstone’s president at the
time, Hamilton E. James, predicted that the fund would spur
infrastructure projects that would “create well-paying American jobs and
will lay the foundation for stronger long-term economic growth.”

In the joint Blackstone-Saudi news release, H.E. Yasir Al Rumayyan, the
head of the Public Investment Fund, said that the $20 billion Saudi
pledge “reflects our positive views around the ambitious infrastructure
initiatives being undertaken in the United States as announced by
President Trump.”

The venture’s $40 billion target drew skepticism from Blackstone’s rival
firms. But the company said it could pull it off. “Blackstone has the
talent, scale and experience to be an effective private sector partner
in filling the massive infrastructure funding gap,” Mr. James, now
executive vice chairman of the company, said in the announcement.

In public, Blackstone is sticking with its goals of creating an immense
fund and deepening its relationship with the Saudi regime, which has
drawn criticism for its human rights record.

“We’re very confident in the long term we’ll reach the $40 billion
capacity,” Mr. James told a group of reporters in February. He added
that Blackstone hoped to hit that target “over the next decade or
so.”

the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who chairs the kingdom’s Public

Blackstone began contacting big institutional investors such as pension
funds last spring as it sought contributions to the fund. But some
balked at putting money in until Blackstone had a team in place to run
the infrastructure fund, according to a person briefed on the process.
Blackstone had promoted Sean Klimczak, a partner [who had brokered
previous infrastructure
investments](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstones-100-billion-bridge-and-tunnel-man-1495618203),
to run the infrastructure group around the time of the fund’s unveiling.
Other hires took longer.

By February, the news release announcing the $40 billion fund had
[disappeared from Blackstone’s
website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180227170302/https://www.blackstone.com/media/press-releases/blackstone-to-launch-$40-billion-infrastructure-investment-vehicle-and-new-infrastructure-business),
although a version remained on the Public Investment Fund’s site. (The
release
[reappeared](https://www.blackstone.com/media/press-releases/blackstone-to-launch-%2440-billion-infrastructure-investment-vehicle-and-new-infrastructure-business)
on Blackstone’s site on Wednesday after The Times asked about it.)

“They announced it with such fanfare and certainty, and clearly things
were dragging,” said Colin C. Blaydon, director of the Center for
Private Equity and Entrepreneurship at the Tuck School of Business at
Dartmouth. “I wondered what on earth was going on. If anybody ought to
be able to pull something like this off, you’d think Blackstone would be
the one to do it.”

The only two investors to firmly commit to the infrastructure fund,
according to Preqin, are the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’
Retirement System, which committed up to $500 million in January, and
the Parochial Employees’ Retirement System of Louisiana, which committed
$75 million but was still finalizing the details.

“For us, I think it was a good fit,” said Troy Searles, chief investment
officer of the Louisiana fund. He said he liked the idea of focusing on
North American infrastructure and thought Blackstone would succeed.

Last month, Mr. Schwarzman mentioned the fund-raising efforts at a New
York investment conference with about 200 people in the room.

“We’re raising other money,” he said, according to a transcript of the
event. He invited anyone in the audience who was interested to come
forward after his speech. “Don’t be hesitant. Don’t be embarrassed.”
