**Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching:**

• Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.

• Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may
have been accessed.

• The White House is still talking tough on trade with China.

• Blackstone’s infrastructure fund isn’t doing so well.

## Is he or isn’t he?

On Wall Street, there’s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie
Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, would try to run for president
in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have
only increased the chatter, and this year’s letter, released Thursday,
is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration.
While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself “barely a Democrat,” says he
plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among
political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon’s policy views could ever
find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.

Mr. Dimon’s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of
President Trump’s policies, while taking the opposing side on others.
Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation
efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: “It is not unreasonable for
the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,” and that “one of
the administration’s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not
worked.” However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with
U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should “revisit
the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, “American
citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully
protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.” He
also said, “People immigrating to this country should be taught American
history, our language and our principles.” At the same time, he also
advocated for “a path to legal status and citizenship” for “Dreamers”
and improving “merit-based immigration” programs so that immigrants
educated here can stay.

Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the
country is that too many people are talking past each other.

“When people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is
almost always wrong,” he wrote, advocating that people try to look at
all sides of a situation. “I tell my liberal friends to read columnists
like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends
to read writers like Tom Friedman.”

If Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an
independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much
of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions – and
especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter —
may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.

Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been
kind to third-party candidates.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Dimon chafes under liquidity rules.

Jamie Dimon, in his annual
[letter](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/ceo-letter-to-shareholders-2017.pdf)
to JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, had much to say about political issues
like trade and immigration.

But he also addressed a policy area much closer to home – bank
regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of
the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial
crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now.
Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point
since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory
requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for
those wanting to roll back the rules.

Mr. Dimon in this year’s letter zeroed in on regulations that require
banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for
access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.

In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers,
depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and
taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat
of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of
liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in
favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the
letter, released Thursday, he wrote:

> Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of
> rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to
> use that liquidity when they most need to do so — to make loans or
> intermediate markets. They have a “red line” they cannot cross (they
> are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As
> clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially
> will be unable to provide it.

Notably,
[legislation](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/cheat-sheet-inside-crapos-reg-relief-deal-with-democrats)
currently in Congress would tweak liquidity rules. If it passes, bankers
may press for more loosening. And, as they have before, bank lobbyists
may deploy Mr. Dimon’s main argument here – that regulation can lead to
less lending. But there are flaws in this line of attack, especially
when it comes to liquidity rules.

First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a
bank’s creditors and customers fear it doesn’t have enough cash in
reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only
deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces
its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center
for American Progress puts it, “You won’t be able to take this action if
you fail.”

Perhaps more importantly, Mr. Dimon leaves out some crucial context.
Congress designed the whole post-crisis overhaul to ensure that banks
have the funds on hand to lend during a downturn. Dodd-Frank’s
architects saw that when banks stop lending, it makes a recession far
worse. And that is one reason why banks now have much higher levels of
capital. Regulators expect that they will use up some of that capital to
keep lending through the economic tumult. This is why the Federal
Reserve
[said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170622a.htm)
after its last bank stress tests:

> The nation’s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels
> and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a
> severe recession.

Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr.
Dimon’s thinking on liquidity.

He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon’s point about having to tie up funds that
could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows
would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in
compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for
lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not
liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend
through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an
important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in
wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may,
thus, crimp that activity.

## You get a raise. You get a raise.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in “wasteful
spending.” He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of
$0.

That attitude apparently didn’t apply to two of his recent hires.

Mr. Mulvaney [appointed two senior staff members who are paid
salaries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/05/business/cfpb-mick-mulvaney-pay-raises.html)
far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs
in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York
Times through a public records request.

• **Kirsten Sutton** was hired in January to be the agency’s chief of
staff. Mr. Mulvaney agreed to pay her $259,500 a year. Her salary is the
highest allowed under [the consumer bureau’s pay
scale](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_pay_scales.pdf)
and represents a raise of more than 50 percent working for one of the
C.F.P.B.’s fiercest critics, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the
Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. It is
also 22 percent more than her predecessor.

• **Brian Johnson** is another new deputy. In late December, Mr.
Mulvaney [signed
paperwork](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4430796-Johnson-Schedule-C-CFPB.html)
that awarded Mr. Johnson a salary of $239,595. Mr. Johnson previously
worked on the House Financial Services Committee. In his most recent job
there, as policy director, he earned about $170,000 a year, according to
LegiStorm. Of the 20 people at the bureau with the title of senior
adviser, Mr. Johnson is the second-highest paid. (Another adviser, whose
name wasn’t disclosed in the public records reviewed by The Times, is
paid $240,000.)

**Context**

The consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees
significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale
is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees
who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than
the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency’s 1,600 employees, 219
make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.

## Gun-free funds.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of
new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market
indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of
firearms.

They include:

• a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI
USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with
favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while
specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian
firearms.

• a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and
distributors.

• an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking
major market indexes, including the S\&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three
others.

## ‘That was a huge mistake, and it was my mistake’

[What emerged from
Facebook](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html?dlbk)
yesterday — in Mark Zuckerberg’s conference call with reporters and in a
[company blog
post](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/) —
were revelations that users’ public data was more compromised than
previously thought.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million
users, not 50 million.

• A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have
exposed “most” of Facebook’s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting
of their public profile information.

Mr. Zuckerberg, ahead of his testimony to Congress, [struck a
conciliatory
tone](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-user-privacy-issues-my-mistake.html).
But regulators in Australia, the U.S. and elsewhere [are
investigating](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-house-committee-on-april-11-1522844990)
whether the company broke privacy rules.

Facebook also outlined steps to prevent misuse of its platform. Among
the most significant: restriction of access to so-called A.P.I.s that
let developers plug into its network. [The Verge’s
take](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199632/facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-collection-87-million-users-api-developer-restrictions?dlbk):
“Effectively, Facebook has put a nail in the coffin of its app
platform.”

The most immediate effect: Tinder users [couldn’t log
in](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/cant-log-into-tinder-blame-facebook.html?dlbk).

A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading
today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that \#DeleteFacebook didn’t appear to
be having much effect.

**The Facebook calendar**

• April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information
may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.

• April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate’s
Commerce and Judiciary committees.

[President
Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/981492087328792577)
and [the White
House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=uN1SkixgZ5Y)
insist that the U.S. isn’t in a trade war with China. But it hasn’t
backed off from its tariff threats, and the White House press secretary,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the U.S. may feel “[a little bit of
short-term
pain](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/04/china-tariffs-us-imports-trump-500163?dlbk).”

More [from behind the
scenes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/04/business/the-united-states-is-starting-a-trade-war-with-china-now-what.html?dlbk),
by Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT:

> People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury

> argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that

Calming the markets [has mostly fallen to Larry
Kudlow](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/04/kudlow-trump-trade-economy-502446?dlbk),

[Peter Eavis’s
take](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/04/business/dealbook/china-us-tariffs.html?dlbk):
We can take lessons on the U.S.-China trade skirmish from Brexit.
Looking back, the panicky early reaction to that seems to have sprung
more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global
trading system.

The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its
highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six
straight months, the longest such streak since 2000.

The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in
February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100
billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China,
Bloomberg points out. During President Trump’s first year in office, the
United States’ trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017,
a record
high.

## Whither Blackstone’s giant infrastructure fund?

Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40
billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to
$20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other
outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575
million in such commitments — and missed two fund-raising deadlines.

What’s happened, per [Kate Kelly and
Andrew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/04/business/blackstone-infrastructure-fund-saudi.html?dlbk):

• The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a
seat for them. Blackstone refused.

• Many potential investors balked at committing money until an
investment team was in place, a process that took some time.

**In other infrastructure news:** D.J. Gribbin, the Trump
administration’s infrastructure point person, [is leaving the White
House](https://apnews.com/1b0b9aafef6c416a85c1a71d7d80b7c3), which looks
to have delayed its investment plan until after the midterms.

## The political flyaround

• The E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt, the subject of some unhappy rumblings
from the White House, has begun a media pushback against claims about
his spending.

## ‘Google should not be in the business of war’

More than 3,100 Googlers have signed a petition [protesting the tech
colossus’s A.I. work with the Defense
Department](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html?dlbk).

More from Scott Shane and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:

> That kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all
> Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is “Don’t
> be evil,” a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly
> foreign to Washington’s massive defense industry and certainly to the
> Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a
> central goal is to increase the “lethality” of the United States
> military.

The company line: “We’re actively engaged across the company in a
comprehensive discussion of this important topic.”

## The YouTube suspect had complained about ad policies

The woman suspected of shooting three people at YouTube headquarters
before killing herself had become angry with the company’s policies.
Police did not say which ones, but she had posted about [YouTube pulling
ads from

less money from her posts.

## The hot take: Les Moonves shouldn’t run CBS-Viacom

As the two corporate siblings jostle over a potential union — Viacom
[has reportedly rejected CBS's
offer](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-viacom-cbs-merger-20180404-story.html?dlbk)
and is preparing a counter bid — who would run the combined company
remains a sticking point. Rich Greenfield of BTIG [offered a contrarian
case](https://www.btigresearch.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=%2F2018%2F04%2F04%2Fviacom-and-cbs-merger-must-avoid-management-chaos%2F%3Fdlbk)
against it being Mr. Moonves of CBS, one of the best-regarded media
executives around.

“The future of a combined Viacom and CBS is going to be driven by an
increasing focus on international and scaling up,” he wrote — an agenda
better suited to Viacom’s C.E.O., Bob
Bakish.
