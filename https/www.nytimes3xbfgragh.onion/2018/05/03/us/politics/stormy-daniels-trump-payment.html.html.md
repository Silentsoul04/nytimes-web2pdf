<div class="css-53u6y8">

It may prove to be the most-talked-about secret payment in American
political history — the $130,000 that President Trump’s lawyer Michael
D. Cohen paid to the pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford to
keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump before he became
president.

That payment to Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels,
was a mere 0.005 percent of the $2.4 billion spent on the 2016 election.
But it could have an outsize impact on the presidency: The payment has
helped spur a lawsuit by Ms. Clifford against Mr. Trump and a federal
investigation into Mr. Cohen. Campaign finance watchdogs assert the
transaction was the result of a secret, and illegal, effort to subvert
election spending laws on behalf of the president.

[Mr. Trump on Thursday
rejected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/03/us/politics/trump-cohen-giuliani.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
any notion that payments to Ms. Clifford had violated campaign finance
laws, though in the course of his defense he contradicted earlier
statements that he hadn’t known of payments to the actress.

The story behind the payment to Ms. Clifford — when Mr. Cohen paid it,
how he paid it, whether he was paid back and by whom — will be critical
to both the lawsuit and investigation, not to mention others that may
come.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Below is what we know about what happened, how the explanations have
evolved and why it all matters.

## Cohen forms a shell company in Delaware

**Oct. 17, 2016**

Mr. Cohen sets up a new company in Delaware, Essential Consultants
L.L.C., from which he will later pay Ms. Clifford.

Delaware has minimal disclosure requirements for people who create
companies there, making it hard to know their identities.

Many companies incorporate in Delaware. The location of Essential
Consultants could become legally significant if investigators establish
that Mr. Cohen used Essential Consultants to evade campaign finance laws
requiring full disclosure of campaign donations and disbursements. Mr.
Cohen and lawyers for Mr. Trump have denied wrongdoing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Money is moved, and aliases are involved

**Oct. 26, 2016**

Mr. Cohen communicates with his bank, First Republic Bank, about a
payment to Ms. Clifford through his Trump Organization email account.
Ms. Clifford’s lawyer Michael Avenatti [has pointed to Mr. Cohen’s use
of that
account](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/michael-cohen-used-trump-org-email-stormy-daniels-arrangements-n855021)
to argue he was working on the payment in his official capacity working
for the Trump Organization. Mr. Cohen has said that “neither the Trump
Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction.”

**Oct. 27, 2016**

Keith Davidson, then Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, [receives
a](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyers-payment-to-porn-star-was-reported-as-suspicious-by-bank-1520273701)
$130,000 wire transfer in his client-trust account at City National Bank
in Los Angeles.

**Oct. 28, 2016**

Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford sign a contract that effectively promises Ms.
Clifford money in exchange for not talking about the alleged affair with
Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump’s name does not technically appear on the document.

According to a draft amendment to the original contract, which was
shared with The New York Times, Ms. Clifford was referred to as “Peggy
Peterson.” Mr. Trump was named as “David Dennison” in the document.

Mr. Avenatti now contends that in failing to sign the document himself,
Mr. Trump rendered the contract null and void.

## A close call just before the election

**Nov. 4, 2016**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[The Wall Street Journal publishes an
article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380)
about a $150,000 deal between the tabloid company American Media and
another woman alleging an affair with Mr. Trump, the former Playboy
model Karen McDougal, to keep silent during the campaign. That article
makes glancing mention of Ms.
Clifford,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>reporting that she
was considering sharing her story with ABC News but abruptly disappeared
on the network before doing so.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>

The election is held four days later. The story about Ms. Clifford’s
payment does not get any real attention for another 14 months.

## The secret deal is secret no more

**Jan. 12, 2018**

News reports reveal that Mr. Cohen [arranged the deal to
pay](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678)
Ms. Clifford $130,000 during the campaign and that a contract amendment
[identifies Ms. Clifford as Peggy
Peterson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/12/us/trump-stephanie-clifford-stormy-daniels.html)
and Mr. Trump as David Dennison.

Mr. Cohen responds in a statement, “These rumors have circulated time
and again since 2011. President Trump once again vehemently denies any
such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels,” and forwards a denial from Ms.
Clifford. A White House official says, “These are old, recycled reports,
which were published and strongly denied before the election.”

**Feb. 13, 2018**

Mr. Cohen [tells The
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/13/us/politics/stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-trump.html)
that he paid the $130,000 to Ms. Clifford out of his own pocket, adding
that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign reimbursed
him.

The implication: Mr. Cohen struck the deal with Ms. Clifford on his own
and without the knowledge of the president. The watchdog group Common
Cause alleges that Mr. Cohen’s payment was in effect a campaign
contribution made to help protect Mr. Trump from negative news toward
the end of his campaign; individual donations to candidates were
[limited to $5,400 per
election](https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/02/02/fec-raises-contribution-caps-for-2016/)
cycle in 2016.

**March 6, 2018**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Clifford [files a
lawsuit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/06/us/stormy-daniels-trump-lawsuit.html),
and reveals that Mr. Cohen took her to arbitration to [secure a
restraining
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/07/us/politics/stormy-daniels-trump.html)
to silence her, which her lawyer declares invalid because Mr. Trump
never signed the contract.

**March 7, 2018**

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, says, “There
was no knowledge of any payments from the president,” adding, “I’ve had
conversations with the president about this.” She says, “He has denied
all these allegations.”

## Cohen: The secret payment was from a home loan

**March 9, 2018**

Mr. Cohen provides [a detailed
account](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-cohen-dismisses-claims-email-proof-trump-knew/story?id=53642094)
of the payment to Ms. Clifford, describing where the money used for the
payment came from. “The funds were taken from my home equity line and
transferred internally to my L.L.C. account in the same bank,” he said.

Mr. Cohen repeats his statement that he was not reimbursed by either the
Trump Organization or the Trump
campaign.

## Trump denies knowing about the payment: ‘You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen’

**April 5, 2018**

Reporters on Air Force One [ask Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/05/us/politics/trump-stormy-daniels-hush-money.html)
if he knew about the payment to Ms. Clifford. He responds, flatly, “No.”
Asked why Mr. Cohen made the payment, Mr. Trump says: “You’ll have to
ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney.” He says he does not know
where the money for the payment came from.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Trump reverses his stance

**April 26, 2018**

Mr. Trump, in [an interview on “Fox &
Friends,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/26/us/politics/trump-cohen-fox-friends.html)
acknowledges knowing that Mr. Cohen represented him in dealing with Ms.
Clifford. “He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal,
he represented me,” he said.

**May 2, 2018**

Mr. Trump’s new lawyer, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York,
tells Sean Hannity of Fox News that the “the president repaid it,”
referring to the payment Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford. In fact, he
says, “they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month.”

Those payments, [he says
later](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/giuliani-trump-repaid-lawyer-cohen-for-stormy-daniels-settlement/2018/05/02/526cde54-4e76-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html)
in
[interviews](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/03/us/politics/trump-cohen-giuliani.html),
started in early 2017 and ultimately added up to as much as $470,000,
which included “incidental expenses.”

In a tweet the next morning, [Mr. Trump acknowledges paying Mr.
Cohen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/03/us/politics/trump-cohen-giuliani.html)
a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>monthly retainer. He
reiterates that the retainer had nothing to do with his campaign.
