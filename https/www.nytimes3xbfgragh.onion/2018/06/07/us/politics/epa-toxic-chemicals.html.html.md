WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, after [heavy
lobbying](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4496312-How-the-EPA-Revised-the-Way-It-Will-Evaluate.html#document/p24/a427924 "American Chemistry Council testimony advocating changes now made")
by the chemical industry, is scaling back the way the federal government
determines health and safety risks associated with the most dangerous
chemicals on the market, [documents from the Environmental Protection
Agency](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4496312-How-the-EPA-Revised-the-Way-It-Will-Evaluate.html "Side by Side: How Risk Assessment Process at EPA Has Changed")
show.

[Under a law passed by
Congress](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/frank-r-lautenberg-chemical-safety-21st-century-act "The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act")
during the final year of the Obama administration, the E.P.A. was
required for the first time to evaluate hundreds of potentially toxic
chemicals and determine if they should face new restrictions, or even be
removed from the market. The chemicals include many in everyday use,
such as [dry-cleaning
solvents](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/tetrachloroethylene.pdf "Perchloroethylene"),
[paint
strippers](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-03/documents/ffrro_factsheet_contaminant_14-dioxane_january2014_final.pdf)
and substances used in health and beauty products like shampoos and
cosmetics.

But as it moves forward reviewing the first batch of [10
chemicals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/21/us/epa-toxic-chemicals.html "The E.P.A.’s Top 10 Toxic Threats, and Industry’s Pushback"),
the E.P.A. has in most cases decided to exclude from its calculations
any potential exposure caused by the substances’ presence in the air,
the ground or water, according to [more than 1,500
pages](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4495888-Problem-Forumulations.html "Problem Formulation Documents for 10 Priority Toxic Chemicals")
of documents released last week by the agency.

Instead, the agency will focus on possible harm caused by direct contact
with a chemical in the workplace or elsewhere. The approach means that
the improper disposal of chemicals — leading to the contamination of
drinking water, for instance — will often not be a factor in deciding
whether to restrict or ban them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The approach is a big victory for the chemical industry, which has
repeatedly pressed the E.P.A. to narrow the scope of its risk
evaluations. Nancy B. Beck, the Trump administration’s appointee to
[help oversee the E.P.A.’s toxic chemical
unit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/21/us/trump-epa-chemicals-regulations.html "NYT: Why Has the E.P.A. Shifted on Toxic Chemicals? An Industry Insider Helps Call the Shots"),
previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one
of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

A spokesman for the E.P.A. said that the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act and other laws already provided the agency with the authority to
regulate chemicals found in the air, rivers and drinking water, so there
was no need to revisit them under the 2016 law, which updated the [Toxic
Substances Control
Act](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-toxic-substances-control-act "TSCA")
of 1976.

The agency can “better protect human health and the environment by
focusing on those pathways that are likely to represent the greatest
areas of concern to E.P.A.,” said the spokesman, Jahan
Wilcox.

</div>

</div>

But three former agency officials, including a former supervisor of the
toxic chemical program, said that the E.P.A.’s approach would result in
a flawed analysis of the threat presented by chemicals.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is ridiculous,” said [Wendy
Cleland-Hamnett](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/aboutepa/wendy-cleland-hamnett-principal-deputy-assistant-administrator-office-chemical-safety-and_.html),
who retired last year after nearly four decades at the E.P.A., where she
ran the toxic chemical unit during her last year. “You can’t determine
if there is an unreasonable risk without doing a comprehensive risk
evaluation.”

Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and Representative Frank
Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who played leading roles in passing
the 2016 law, said the E.P.A. was ignoring its directive for a
comprehensive analysis of risks.

“Congress worked hard in bipartisan fashion to reform our nation’s
broken chemical safety laws, but Pruitt’s E.P.A. is failing to put the
new law to use as intended,” Mr. Udall said in a statement referring to
Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator.

A spokesman for Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, who is
chairman of the Senate committee that oversees the agency, declined to
comment.

Cumulatively, the approach being taken for the 10 chemicals means the
E.P.A.’s risk analysis will not take into account an estimated [68
million pounds a
year](http://blogs.edf.org/health/files/2018/06/First-Ten-Emissions-TRI.pdf)
of emissions, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense
Fund, based on agency data.

Dr. Beck declined requests for comment. She had [pushed the E.P.A.
during the Obama
administration](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4496312-How-the-EPA-Revised-the-Way-It-Will-Evaluate.html#document/p33/a427929)
to narrow the scope of the risk evaluations, in a fashion similar to the
approach under her watch.

Also helping oversee the risk evaluation effort is Erik Baptist, a
former senior lawyer at [the American Petroleum
Institute](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4387727-Erik-Baptist-Financial-Disclosure.html),
another big player in the chemical industry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The American Chemistry Council said in a statement last week that the
E.P.A.’s approach met “the requirements of the law,” adding that it
wanted the risk assessments to be “protective and practical.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Under the approach, the E.P.A. will examine what harm can be caused, for
example, to anyone directly exposed to
[perchloroethylene](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/risk-evaluation-perchloroethylene)
— a dry-cleaning solvent and metal degreaser designated by the E.P.A. as
a [likely
carcinogen](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/tetrachloroethylene.pdf)
— during manufacturing or when using it in dry cleaning, carpet cleaning
or handling certain ink-removal products.

But [the agency will not
focus](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4496312-How-the-EPA-Revised-the-Way-It-Will-Evaluate.html#document/p4/a428062)
on exposures that occur from traces of the [chemical found in drinking
water](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/contaminant.php?contamcode=2987#.Wxkdgu4vwkI)
in 44 states as a result of improper disposal over decades, the E.P.A.
documents say. The [decision conflicts with a risk assessment
plan](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4496312-How-the-EPA-Revised-the-Way-It-Will-Evaluate.html#document/p3/a428061)
detailed by the agency a year ago, which included drinking water. And
the change came after the American Chemistry Council [argued in February
last
year](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4496312-How-the-EPA-Revised-the-Way-It-Will-Evaluate.html#document/p27/a427925 "EPA has discretion...")
that “the E.P.A. has discretion to select the conditions of use that it
will consider.”

The agency will also not consider the hazards of perchloroethylene
discharged into streams or lakes, landfills or the air from dry-cleaning
stores or manufacturing or processing plants, the documents say.

The documents contain similar conclusions about nine of the 10 chemicals
under review. One of these is
[1,4-dioxane](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/risk-evaluation-14-dioxane "EPA Risk Evaluation for 1,4-Dioxane"),
which can be found in small amounts in antifreeze, deodorants, shampoos
and cosmetics and is considered “likely to be carcinogenic to humans.”
Another is trichloroethylene, which is used to make a refrigerant
chemical and remove grease from metal parts and is [associated
with](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=171&tid=30) cancers of
the liver, kidneys and blood.

Other changes identified in the E.P.A. documents narrow the definitions
of certain chemicals, including asbestos. Some asbestos-like fibers will
not be included in the risk assessments, one agency staff member said,
nor will the 8.8 million pounds a year of asbestos deposited in
hazardous landfills or the 13.1 million pounds discarded in routine dump
sites.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The most likely outcome of the changes will be that the agency finds
lower levels of risks associated with many chemicals, and as a result,
imposes fewer new restrictions or prohibitions, several current and
former agency officials said.

“They don’t want to open Pandora’s box by looking comprehensively at the
risk, as they may prove to be significant and then they have to deal
with it,” said [Robert M.
Sussman](https://www.lw.com/people/RobertMSussman), a former chemical
industry lawyer and E.P.A. official who now works as a consultant to
[Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families](https://saferchemicals.org/), an
advocacy group.

Despite the changes, the E.P.A. is [still
expected](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-action-methylene-chloride)
to ban the use of [methylene
chloride](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/risk-evaluation-methylene-chloride-0 "EPA Risk Evaluation for Methylene Chloride")
as a paint stripper soon — an action first proposed at the end of the
Obama administration. The chemical, one of the 10 under review, is a
popular ingredient used in dozens of products sold at home improvement
stores nationwide, and has been blamed in dozens of deaths.

A collection of more than a dozen groups — representing environmental,
public-health and labor organizations — are [suing the
E.P.A.](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/Petitioners_Opening_Brief.pdf)
to challenge earlier changes in the toxic chemical evaluation program.
The case is before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit in San Francisco.
