\textbf{Name}: Cordell Broadus

\textbf{Age}: 21

\textbf{Born}: Diamond Bar, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles.

\textbf{Now Lives:} An 1,800-square foot, 2-bedroom apartment in the
Westwood section of Los Angeles.

\textbf{Claim to Fame:} The second son of Snoop Dogg,
\href{https://www.instagram.com/cbroadus}{Mr. Broadus} stepped away from
a promising football career (he was a wide receiver for the University
of California Los Angeles' Bruins) to pursue work in fashion. Taking a
break from his undergraduate studies in film at U.C.L.A., he recently
walked in
the\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/26/fashion/tommy-hilfiger-gigi-hadid-milan-fashion-week.html}{Tommy
Hilfiger}show in February, and starred in campaigns for
\href{https://www.kennethcole.com/campaign-tcc-spring-2018-cordell-broadus.html}{Kenneth
Cole} and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA8shaO9sYk}{MCM}
Worldwide.

\textbf{Big Break:} In 2016, Mr. Broadus attended a benefit for the
\href{https://www.smiletrain.org/}{Smile Train} hosted by Quincy Brown
(the son of Sean Combs) and Karrueche Tran, a model and actress. While
hanging with his friends, he was approached by Ms. Tran's agent at
Wilhelmina, who asked him to come into the agency to discuss modeling.
``It was a no-brainer,'' Mr. Broadus said. ``They were telling me the
amount of money you make on a certain gig. I'm a businessman. You could
get a campaign and get paid \$50,000. And I'm 18 at the time and I'm
listening. Karrueche had just bought a Maserati.''

**Latest Project: **During Made's Los Angeles fashion week in 2017, Mr.
Broadus unveiled a capsule collection with
\href{https://joyrich.com/}{Joyrich}, a sparkly apparel brand from Los
Angeles, that featured blue bathrobes and faux fur jackets that were
inspired by his father. His next collaboration with Joyrich will be a
tribute to NBA Hall of Famer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/05/sports/basketball/allen-iverson-hall-of-fame-shaquille-oneal-yao-ming-tom-izzo.html}{Allen
Iverson}. ``The clothes will be inspired by how I think he shaped the
culture in basketball and the urban community,'' Mr. Broadus said.

\textbf{Next Thing:} Mr. Broadus plans to put his film education into
use, directing a promotional film for
\href{http://www.kangol.com/us/}{Kangol} about New York City that will
debut in November at \href{https://www.complexcon.com/}{Complex Con}.
``This is a cool place for young millennials striving for something in
life,'' he said. ``I would love to shine a light on those hard workers.
That's how I'm going to cast it.''

\textbf{Father Knows Best:} While Mr. Broadus was great at football, he
now admits that fashion is his true passion, and that he played to
please his father. ``I played to create a relationship with my father,''
he said. ``I thought that that was the only way he would love me. He
loved me for me and I should love myself.''
