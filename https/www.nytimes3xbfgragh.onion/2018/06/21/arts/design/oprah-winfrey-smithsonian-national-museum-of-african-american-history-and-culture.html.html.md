WASHINGTON — Has any American spent more of her career flinging her arms
up in shock and elation than Oprah Winfrey? Maybe — *maybe —* certain
long-suffering and spoiled-rotten sports fans. But in 25 years of
hosting a daytime talk show five days a week, nine months out of 12,
often to gigantic ratings, Ms. Winfrey raised her arms a lot — over
makeovers and giveaways and celebrity surprises, like that time, in
2011, nearing the final broadcast of “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” when she
[turned around and saw Stevie
Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le4eqSw6GMY), at a piano, rising
out of an arena floor. O.K., it was only one arm, but it went up with
the force of two. Her reaction was part “buzzer beater,” part “pageant
win.”

She and her thousands of hours of TV are now the subjects of a big,
fascinating exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African
American History and Culture that captures what the show was, did and
has meant. And it includes that Stevie Wonder moment, in a short montage
focused on the show’s leap, in its final years, into lavish,
thrill-a-minute mega-production.

The installation — [“Watching Oprah: The Oprah Winfrey Show and American
Culture”](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/watchingoprah) — is
what can only be called *so* Smithsonian: a mouthwatering, heartwarming,
eye-opening, foot-aching conflation of biography, anthropology,
sociology, nostalgia, history and insight (about culture, race, gender,
technology, media, education, consumerism, economics, beauty, fashion
and the law) into a potent dioramic spectacle. You leave it with a
fuller understanding of Ms. Winfrey’s rare determination to matter to
everybody and in awe of how acutely she still does.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That bit with Mr. Wonder lasts about 15 seconds in the montage. But it
sticks with you. For one thing, it exposes something endearingly normal
in a woman, who as a very famous TV host, could presumably have had Mr.
Wonder pop out of any floor anytime she wanted. For another, the women
in the audience (thousands of them, black and white; I didn’t spot a
single man) leap and shout and wail, with *their* arms in the air, in a
dozen different ways, from “Lotto win” to “praise Jesus.” They’re going
nuts for Mr. Wonder, obviously. But they might be more ecstatic about
the joy he’s bringing Ms. Winfrey. This isn’t a cult, exactly. It’s a
living, screaming symbiotic social network. Affirmation and intent
became muscular cornerstones of the “Oprah Winfrey” enterprise. When she
banged the “like” button, her vast constituency banged on it, too.

The show’s been off the air for seven years, and we miss it: More than a
year before “Watching Oprah,” Chicago’s WBEZ released the podcast
“Making Oprah,” a delicious behind-the-scenes casserole that Jenn
White served with a fan’s appreciation and a critic’s forensic eye. And
Ms. Winfrey hasn’t disappeared at all. Since “Oprah” went off the air,
Winfrey has evolved into an even more instinctive screen actress, for
one thing. She’s [written
books](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Wisdom_of_Sundays.html?id=0dw1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false);
she’s vividly alive on Instagram, her cable network and wellness
podcast; and she [looked supremely
tickled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/slideshow/2018/05/19/style/the-royal-wedding/s/xxRoyal-Wedding-Arrive-slide-6NCY.html)
to be at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s wedding last month.

And yet, if America can’t actually *miss* Oprah Winfrey, it might miss
an *idea* of her. As “Oprah Winfrey Show” Oprah, a totem of humanity,
respect, largess and fun. As a figure of immense, almost assaultive
generosity, who could unleash, in us, bombastic yet utterly sincere
gratitude.

Maybe the chaos extremity of current events has made us wistful for the
moral authority of “Oprah Winfrey”: school massacres, police shootings
of unarmed black people, men chronically mistreating women, the
government’s separation of children from their migrant parents. Whenever
somebody pleads for a national conversation — about anything, really —
what they’re saying is, “Where the hell is Oprah?”

Many a desperate “O”-shaped Bat signal has gone up in the last
half-dozen years, and in January, the country believed she was answering
it. That’s one way to interpret the thunderous response to her speech
[accepting<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the Cecil B. DeMille
Award](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/07/movies/oprah-winfrey-golden-globes-speech-transcript.html)
for lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes. *Oprah for President\!*
As oratory, the moment really was electrifying. She endorsed the
evening’s gender-equity platform, in part, by telling the story of
[Recy
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/29/obituaries/recy-taylor-alabama-rape-victim-dead.html),
a black woman from Alabama whom white men repeatedly raped one night in
1944. She denounced the coarseness of our national moment by praising
the news media. Her pulpit gravitas would have brought down the house at
a political convention. But the speech wasn’t enough. People seemed
desperate to work themselves into [Oprah 2020
fever](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/08/movies/oprah-winfrey-lifetime-achievement-golden-globes.html).

To the extent that “queen of daytime” is any kind of office, it’s one
Ms. Winfrey has never abused. She loves people, and she seems to
understand the intensity of people’s love for her. But people also love
power, and Ms. Winfrey’s display of it that night (and perhaps a New
York Post column [she
retweeted](http://ew.com/tv/2017/09/29/oprah-for-president-2020/))
sparked pandemonium for her to ride it into Washington. President Oprah
was fantasized about as an antidote to a caustic, whimsical president:
the woman with the extensive [“angel
network”](http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/about-oprahs-angel-network)
taking on a master Twitter troll, one television genius locking horns
with another.

But the Smithsonian show leaves you thinking that she’d probably expect
better fantasies from us. It makes you think she might be too good for
whatever a candidate would have to do or say in this political climate
to be elected president of anything.

**BEFORE YOU EXIT** “Watching Oprah,” you’ve scrutinized a case full of
childhood photos, diary entries, high school letters and [a signed copy
of Maya Angelou’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx447ShQLeE) “I Know
Why the Caged Bird Sings.” You’ve soaked up the music, speeches, imagery
and writing in a room devoted to the musicians, actors, authors and
political movements that helped a young Oprah determine who she wanted
to be. You’ve checked out the amusingly arranged spot devoted to her
Oscar-losing performance in “The Color Purple” (she had her Oscar
luncheon biscuit bronzed, instead) and the space that enumerates her
early television-news work, including a three-minute montage of her in
Baltimore and Chicago in the 1970s and 1980s that is one of the most
charming pieces of editing you’re going to see. At some point, a young
Ms. Winfrey, in spandex, has to put her legs up for an aerobics-class
segment and jestingly complains, “Oh, you’re gonna love this
shot.”

Ms. Winfrey trod to get to the stage. It opens into the space devoted to

monitor that plays a six-minute highlight reel. You’ve seen the large,
almost sentient, encased Sony TV camera and the signed guest books and a

the black turtleneck and leather pants she put on for Tina Turner, the

You’ve noticed the decades of hair styles and pivots in emotional

was once called “talk-back TV” to the “best self” era — basically, from
her inspiring the cage matches of Jerry Springer and Maury Povich to
featuring the real talk of Iyanla Vanzant, the gender decoding of John
Gray and the Richter-scale-registering impact of Oprah’s Book Club.

There’s a lot here. And you depart it all mystified by the absurd
contradictions that Ms. Winfrey’s achievements reveal about this
country. Here’s a black woman who grew up poor in the segregated South
and became the country’s first black female billionaire. Her prosperity
inspired others to prosper, yet “Watching Oprah” is situated not far
from the museum’s moral and scholastic centerpiece (“A People’s
Journey”), a devastating
[odyssey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/22/arts/design/smithsonian-african-american-museum-review.html)
down into — and then up out of — the creation of the United States from
slavery, racism, revolution, innovation, hard work and good luck. She
doesn’t seem to know how she made it, but like a lot of successful
Americans, she appears to have moments when she can’t entirely believe
she
has.

You wonder whether the show’s integrationist philosophy arises from its
host’s having been raised, reared and professionally trained in
Milwaukee, Mississippi, Tennessee and the broadcast environs of
Baltimore and Chicago. Just geographically, Ms. Winfrey is
intersectional. But it also explains something like the [trip the show
took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WErjPmFulQ0) in 1987 to Forsyth
County, Ga., after it purged itself of nearly all its black residents.
She wanted to know what about black people so scared the white
residents, and she keeps having to remind the racists in her audience
that the woman interrogating them is also black.

Ms. Winfrey contributed more than $20 million to the sponsorship of the
museum. So there’s an urge to distrust the intent of an exhibition like
this, to say that she bought it. But her museum donation doesn’t seem at
all like vanity. It’s “how to use your life,” “what do you stand for”
money. Across from “A People’s Journey” sits the Oprah Winfrey Theater.
Maybe she paid for a piece of *that*. Anyway, our tax dollars are hard
at work here, too. So Ms. Winfrey just paid a little more than I did.

Nonetheless, “Watching Oprah,” in its uncompromised captioning, goes out
of its way to remind you about the chronic dissatisfaction, among some
black people, with the lack of attention to the crises of black America.
The show includes a 1986 letter from a black woman upset that Ms.
Winfrey didn’t call on her during a broadcast because she didn’t “look
like an ugly, fat, uneducated, frustrated black woman which is typical
of the majority of the women you allow to speak on your show.” If that
was ever true (suburban white women made up its biggest demographic), it
wasn’t that way for long.

This might be the only show in television history to feature a ferocious
four-way argument among black women about being a Republican. You watch
a moment like that, in the exhibition’s “Talk-Back TV” montage, and you
remember the show’s deep roots as a roving dialogue, often through
national events, tragedies and disasters, with Ms. Winfrey holding the
microphone (several of which are on display). It was a show that, in
1992, devoted a handful of daring episodes to racism, including a couple
after the Los Angeles riots and one that featured a panel of American
Indians and a white audience actually *hearing* the panelists’ dismay.
Even when it was in the mud, “The Oprah Winfrey Show” was determined to
make so-called rednecks understand the problem with“redskins.”

**ONE PROBLEM WITH** being really good at your job is that people won’t
let you stop doing it. But you watch enough of these montages and
realize two things. First, “Watching Oprah” needs a lot more of “Oprah”
to watch, more clips, segments, whole episodes, something. Second, Oprah
didn’t do this work alone. She helped *us* do it. She was a platform.
She was Facebook. Forget the presidency. She was the facilitator in
chief.

The more she empowered us to speak, the better she got at knowing how
her emotional algorithm could supply us with books and feelings and
tools for betterment. And she took real risks to better understand this
country, too.

That Forsyth County episode might have been a stunt, but it’s more
audacious than Geraldo Rivera’s dragging millions of Americans into a
bloody brawl with skinheads the following year. “Watching Oprah” doesn’t
privilege any one episode over any other. So it’s hard, at first, to see
what *exactly* it is about the show that matters. But then you think
about that massive wall of episode titles and how it’s impossible to
take it all the way in. And that incomprehensible vastness seems
perfectly right, both for the enduring vitality of the show itself and
the woman at its center.
