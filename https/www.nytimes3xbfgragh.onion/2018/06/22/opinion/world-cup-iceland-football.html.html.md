<div class="css-53u6y8">

Because my husband, Luke, and I are both former football players and we
want our boys to love the game as we do, we packed our bags and our sons
— Ellis, 2, and Dane, 5 — on a nine-hour flight to Reykjavik. Tiny
Iceland, for the first time, made the World Cup. And the United States
did not.

Our plan: to traverse volcanoes and glaciers in the never-ending
daylight; whisper in our sons’ ears of trolls, fairies and elves; and
hoist them on our shoulders as thousands Viking-clap in unison on a
cobblestone street. We hoped it would all get conflated in their little
hearts and minds as one magical thing: football.

Thora Helgadottir, my college roommate, would be our Icelandic spirit
guide. With white blond hair, ice blue eyes and a stronger punt than the
keeper on our Duke men’s team, she fully embodied the “hammer-wielding
god” of Norse mythology. She was — and I will say this until I die — the
best women’s keeper in the world, better than Hope Solo.

For Iceland’s first ever World Cup game — against Argentina and the
all-mighty Lionel Messi — Thora took us to a rooftop bar with a
rain-filled view of the Reykjavik skyline. Wearing Icelandic “fotbolti”
garb and waving foam fingers we’d bought at the grocery store, we piled
onto a couch. Sigga, a strawberry-blond 40-something-year-old, sat next
to us.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“My name,” she told us, “means victory\!” She worked in a fish factory
for over 20 years, gutting and deworming fish, on the Westman Islands, a
place known for puffins. With her platform heels up on the “No Smoking”
sign, she lit a cigarette and showed us her “lucky puffin” pendant.

She set a tiny Viking figurine in the middle of the table: “He will
protect us.” Dane took possession of a red-white-and-blue face paint
stick, which he smeared across every cheek in sight — and Sigga’s
forearms and calves.

While Ellis could say “ball” and “goal” before he could say “mom” and
“dad,” Dane hasn’t inherited the family passion — at least not yet.
When I coached him last season, he stood in the middle of the field with
his eyes closed, hands behind his back, humming “The Nutcracker Suite.”
But he was happy tucked beneath Sigga’s arm.

The game kicked off, and a loud cheer went up around the bar, the whole
country pulling for “our boys.” Iceland’s coach, [Heimir
Hallgrimsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimir_Hallgr%C3%ADmsson),
is, like Sigga and her mother, Inga, from the Westman Islands.

Thora has instructed us to use only first names: “If you refer to a
player by his last name, we won’t know who you are talking about.”

“We have known Heimir since he was small,” Inga said. He was the
family’s dentist. Really.

The first 10 minutes were all terror and jubilation — terror every time
Messi touched the ball (“No, no, no\!” everyone mutter-gasped in unison)
and jubilation because the Viking boys had been strong, fortresslike, on
defense. They had occasionally charged forward, Gylfi Sigurdsson
carrying the ball with confidence, with downright élan, and Birkir
Saevarsson with a chance in front of the goal.

Then, early — too early — the Argentines scored. 1-0. The atmosphere at
the bar deflated.

But Iceland went on the attack. They are accustomed to battling (the
elements, the odds), and quicker than a Viking clap, Alfred Finnbogason
sent the ball home — goal, Iceland\! The rooftop erupted, everyone
jumping and hugging. The Icelandic announcer screamed. “Argentina, one,
Iceland, one\! Ha ha\!”

“I am so nervous,” Thora moaned as the game continued. It’s a sentence I
never heard her say while she was playing. It’s odd to see her on this
side of the game, as a player instead of a fan — and it is odd
apparently for her, too. “I was never nervous as a player,” she said.
“But not being able to do anything\! I can’t take it.”

She had been her usual calm self earlier that morning, hanging out in
her living room in downtown Reykjavik. I admired a large Tolli painting
of a turf home illuminated by sunlight. It was given to her as a gift
for her 100th cap with the Icelandic national team. In the United
States, we often honor similar achievements with bronze cleats mounted
to plaques. Iceland’s football federation believes that the national
team players value art — and she does.

Thora was never just a single-minded soccer player. After college, she
became the C.F.O. of Iceland DHL, then quit to play in the Champions
League with Malmo in Sweden. While winning Swedish Goalkeeper of the
Year two seasons in a row, she earned a master’s degree in sustainable
management in her down time.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This double pursuit of football and a different career isn’t unique to
Thora or Heimir. Youth coaches are subsidized by the government and have
other jobs; the men’s goalkeeper is also a successful filmmaker.

The game settled into a grueling test of survival for Iceland —
something they’ve been doing for over a thousand years. And then, at the
64th minute, horror: a [penalty kick for
Argentina](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/16/argentina-v-iceland-world-cup-2018-live).
Messi stepped up. This, surely, was the end.

But no, he missed — keeper save\!

“The elves are protecting us\!” Sigga screamed, hands on Dane’s cheeks.

Thora collapsed against the couch. “I think I’m going to cry.”

Iceland survived the pounding, and at last, the whistle was blown: tie
game. A point earned against Argentina — the perennial powerhouse, a
country with approximately 130 times as many people as Iceland. Even if
the island nation doesn’t make it back to the World Cup for another
century, people will talk of this — using only first names.

We spilled out of the bar and into the rain. A musician wearing a
double-French-braid wig banged his drumsticks on his Viking helmet. A
woman in an Icelandic superwoman costume, lace underwear on top of blue
tights, led an understandably sloppy rendition of the chant “Afram
Island.”

Petra, who plays on Thora’s Monday night adult team, joined us at a bar.
She’s also from the Westman Islands and knows Heimir. Twenty years ago
he coached her team and removed her wisdom teeth. Now Petra is a single
mother to Frosti, an 11-year-old with a neurodegenerative disease.
Heimir’s family often takes him for the day so that Petra can have a
break. Heimir teases him — rolling him up in rugs, tying the ends of his
socks together.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Petra said, “Now Frosti always asks me to tie his socks together.”
Frosti does not love football, but he does love Heimir. I sipped my Gull
beer and felt great awe for this country, where the national team coach
is a friend who sometimes takes in your son for the weekend and where
even the superstars are like family. Petra and Thora practiced the
Viking clap with Dane and Ellis — “Huh\!” shouted in unison, in shared
celebration. Luke and I lasted as long as we could with the kids out in
the rain, and then we left Thora celebrating with her friends.

On the walk back, I stared at the foam hand on top of the wet double
stroller, wondering whether I had had too many Gulls. I seemed to be
having double vision. Instead of the standard “We’re No. 1\!” finger,
the Icelandic version is a two-fingered peace sign. Which sums up what I
want for our boys: the game not as a singular pursuit but as a way to
experience the world.

True, Dane barely glanced up at the game. But he did enjoy the face
painting. And there was a moment where he waved the Icelandic flag and
marched around in the rain (while once again humming “The Nutcracker
Suite”).

Chances are good, I think, that he’ll have a memory of Sigga’s cheek
kisses and a current that swept through rainy streets. Next, we’ll watch
Iceland-Nigeria, once again singing “Afram Island.” I don’t know whether
Dane and Ellis will grow up loving the game after this, but I’m pretty
sure Dane now believes in elves, and maybe that is enough. For now.
