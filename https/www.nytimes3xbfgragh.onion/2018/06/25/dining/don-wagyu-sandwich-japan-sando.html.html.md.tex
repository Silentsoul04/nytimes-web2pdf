Don Wagyu in the Financial District serves Japanese Wagyu beef cooked
like a country-fried steak.

With a straight face, Derek Feldman, an owner of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/26/dining/sushi-on-jones-review.html}{Sushi
on Jones} and the bar \href{http://uchu.nyc/}{Uchu} said he thought New
York needed the ultimate Japanese sando, or sandwich, made with Wagyu,
and priced from \$28 to \$180, depending on the meat. Bonuses are
already being blown with preorders for this bite of lunch: a five-ounce
slab of beef nearly an inch thick, trimmed to fit a square of white
bread, and deep-fried in a wrap of panko. The sando is served with a
side of nori-dusted fries. Mr. Feldman, his business partner, Samuel
Clonts, and the chef Corwin Kave offer an American Wagyu cross (\$28),
and two types of Japanese Wagyu from Miyazaki Prefecture. The
top-of-the-line Ozaki, aged longer and from a single farm, outshines the
others for richness and flavor and comes in a trim wooden gift box
(reusable!) for takeout. The wood-paneled shop is tiny, with six seats
at a bar. For dining in, there are Japanese whiskies, sake and beer.
