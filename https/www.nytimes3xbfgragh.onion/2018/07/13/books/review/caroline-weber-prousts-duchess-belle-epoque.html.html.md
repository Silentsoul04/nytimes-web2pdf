**PROUST’S DUCHESS**  
**How Three Celebrated Women Captured the Imagination of Fin-De-Siècle
Paris**  
By Caroline Weber  
Illustrated. 715 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.

Even if you haven’t read “À la Recherche du Temps Perdu,” you shouldn’t
be afraid to read “Proust’s Duchess,” Caroline Weber’s beguiling group
biography of three aristocratic *salonnières* of Parisian high society
in the [Belle
Époque](https://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/academic/artsletters/art_philosophy/humanities/belleepoque.htm).
Together they inspired the composite figure of the exquisite, elegantly
remote Duchesse de Guermantes, the muse of Proust’s dreams of chivalric
French history, romance and *la vie Parisienne*. Watching, following,
and even stalking them as a young law student in the 1890s, he idolized
Geneviève Halévy Bizet Straus; Laure de Sade (great-granddaughter of the
Marquis), who became Comtesse de Chevigné; and especially [Élisabeth
Comtesse
Greffulhe](http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/prousts-muse.php),
whom he imagined as a goddess “made of different stuff from ordinary
people.”

They viewed themselves, and were praised by Proust and others, as the
exotic golden birds of French high society. “When confined to an aviary
or a cage,” Élisabeth wrote, “woman cultivates her plumage and her song
for reasons of pleasure, power.” Her kinsman, the gay aesthete [Robert
de
Montesquiou](https://bonjourparis.com/history/robert-de-montesquiou/),
called her “the Swan,” and coined the term “cygniform” to describe her
sinuous grace; and she adopted mythic personas from “Swan Lake,”
“Lohengrin” and the story of Leda, wrapping herself in a frothy
winglike cloak of swan’s plumes, gliding in white satin mules trimmed
with swan’s feathers or waving a gigantic swan’s-down fan.

All three women married for money and status, and lived unhappily with
neurasthenic mothers, chilly in-laws, unfaithful husbands, disappointing
children, loneliness, depression and ennui. But they were brilliant in
exploiting the language of fashion. Upper-class Parisiennes changed
their clothes seven or eight times a day, so they had many opportunities
to model their wardrobes for society photographers like Otto Wegener and
[Nadar](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/photographs-of-the-famous-by-felix-nadar/).
The beautiful, wasp-waisted Élisabeth showed particular genius in “*le
shopping poétique*”: “I believe there is no ecstasy in the world,” she
wrote, “that can compare to the ecstasy of a woman who feels she is the
object of every gaze, and draws nourishment and joy from the crowd.” In
her lavish accessories and spectacular gowns by Worth and Fortuny, she
courted admiration, celebrity and copious fan
mail.

Laure, Comtesse de Chevigné, cultivated her persona as a sophisticated
intellectual and swaggering rebel. At the Bal des Bêtes in 1885, when
1,700 guests came costumed as insects, vermin, crustaceans and big-game
animals, she appeared as a white snowy owl, symbol of Minerva, goddess
of wisdom. In 1891, at the fashionable Black and White Ball, she defied
the invitation by dressing as an androgynous harlequin in yellow and
blue.

Geneviève had connections to Bohemia and the artistic world through her
first marriage to Georges Bizet. They established a salon in their
Montmartre home, attended by Turgenev, Berlioz, Jules Massenet, Charles
Gounod, Gustave Moreau and Gustave Doré, and led a summer artists’
colony in Bougival. After her second marriage, to the lawyer Georges
Straus, Geneviève began a new salon that became the center for the
pro-Dreyfusards. As the daughter of Fromental Halévy, the composer of
“The Jewess” (1835) and “The Wandering Jew” (1852), she was active in
protesting the vicious anti-Semitism of the 1880s and 1890s.

But over all, the *grandes dames* were uninterested in politics, public
affairs or feminism. As Caroline Kaufmann, the leader of the militant
women’s rights group Solidarité des Femmes, wrote: “They are and want to
remain the phoenix, the rare bird, the priceless object. They don’t care
at all about women’s emancipation, and for good reason — they wouldn’t
stand to gain anything from it.” Although Élisabeth longed to be a
writer, and labored on a secret autobiographical novel for 20 years, she
never published it. She lived to be seen, not read.

Weber, a professor of French and comparative literature at Barnard
College, is an erudite literary historian as well as a fashion
connoisseur, and she spent years of archival research amassing the
sumptuous details, apt and amusing illustrations, lengthy endnotes, huge
bibliography and three appendixes of this engrossing story. She
describes not only the three women, but an enormous cast of the dandies,
decadents, artists, writers, musicians and financiers of the *fin de
siècle*. Clearly Weber loves this period; while the book is long and
weighty, it is never dull. Still, I wish she had gone even longer
through the Dreyfus affair, which marked a tragic turn in what she calls
“a soon-to-be-extinct society.” Geneviève Straus, for example, was
shunned by many of her noble guests, who no longer saw her as a
glamorous hostess but “as a troublemaking Jew.”

Soon Proust was disenchanted by his goddesses. As Weber notes, his
“idealizing vision of his ladies changed over time into something
darker.” To the Comtesse de Chevigné, he wrote, “What one used to love
turns out to be *very, very stupid*.” She, he told a friend, was just “a
tough old bird I mistook, long ago, for a bird of paradise.” No longer
infatuated, he mocked even the divine Élisabeth as superficial,
pretentious and shallow. And in old age, she proved his point by
remembering him as “a displeasing little man who was forever skulking
about in doorways.”

Maybe you’ll be tempted to give Proust another go when you read about
them all. In any case, Weber has succeeded much as he did in bringing
that lost time back to glorious life.
