With print magazines having lost readers and advertisers in recent
years, one of the world's largest magazine publishers has turned to a
digital specialist as its new leader.

On Wednesday, Hearst Magazines, the company behind venerable titles like
Esquire, Harper's Bazaar and Cosmopolitan, named
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/business/media/hearst-harassment-troy-young.html}{Troy
Young}, 50, as its president, effective immediately. Mr. Young, who
spent nearly five years running the company's digital media division,
succeeds David Carey, 57, who started as the head of Hearst Magazines in
2010 and will stay on as its chairman through the end of 2019.

``Troy has done an outstanding job building our world-class digital
business,'' Steven R. Swartz, the president and chief executive of
Hearst's corporate parent, Hearst Communications, said in a statement.
``He brings great skill and enthusiasm to this new challenge, leading
our global magazine brands, in print and digital form, to ever higher
levels of editorial and commercial excellence.''

Mr. Young changed the corporate structure at Hearst Magazines so that
the digital teams creating content for the magazines' websites reported
to him, rather than to the editors of the individual titles. In recent
years Hearst's multiplatform unique viewership has nearly doubled, and
the company opened a 26,000-square-foot production studio near the
Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan.

``Troy understands how vital it is for our brands to engage more
actively with consumers across platforms,'' Mark E. Aldam, Hearst
Communications' chief operating officer, said in a statement.

Last October, the company
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/18/business/media/hearst-rodale-magazines.html}{agreed
to acquire Rodale}, the publisher of Men's Health, Runner's World and
Prevention, among other magazines. The deal was made final in January.

Mr. Young's appointment at the company, which was founded by William
Randolph Hearst in 1887, comes at a time when the magazine industry is
in steep decline. Before its acquisition by Meredith Corporation, Time
Inc. had lost revenue every year since 2011. Hearst's sometime rival,
Condé Nast, the publisher of The New Yorker, Vogue and Vanity Fair,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/02/business/media/conde-nast-teen-vogue.html}{cut
roughly 80 employees} last year while also reducing the frequency of
certain magazines' print editions and ceasing the regular print
publication of Teen Vogue.

``Hearst Magazines is an extraordinary content company, well positioned
to thrive in today's media ecosystem,'' Mr. Young said in a statement.
``Our powerful brands are part of consumers' daily lives on every
medium, from print to voice to video, and we're serving consumers and
marketers with increasing engagement and precision across platforms.''
