1. The first story in the collection, ``The Future Looks Good,'' begins
and ends with the same statement, that Ezinma does not see what's coming
behind her. How does this statement both propel the action in the story
and reveal the characters' history?

2. In ``War Stories,'' does the girl's father's war stories parallel her
own violence at school? If so, how? What is it he wants her to learn?

3. In ``Wild,'' Ada and her cousin Chinyere initially greet one another
with skepticism but ultimately find a common bond. What is it that
brings them together?

4. The story ``Light'' begins and ends with a father describing the
spark in girls that he sees the ``wolves of the world'' extinguish. What
is it he's talking about? Who takes that spark away?

5. In ``Wild,'' ``Light,'' and other stories in this collection the
relationships between the mothers and daughters are fraught. What is it
the mothers want from their daughters? What role does propriety and
rebellion play?

6. Has the girl's mother really returned from the dead in ``Second
Chances''? What is the significance of the photograph?

7. In what genre would you put these stories: magical realism, sci-fi,
fairytale, folktale, something else?

8. Why do you think Nneka Arimah chose to write ``Windfalls,'' about a
mother who feigns injuries to get money, in the second person?

9. ``Who Will Greet You At Home'' tells the story of a woman who weaves
a baby out of yarn. Do you see echoes of other fairy tales you've read?
Or other fantastical stories?

10. How does class play a role in the story ``Buchi's Girls''? How does
it divide families?

11. In the title story, ``What It Means When A Man Falls From The Sky,''
society has supposedly figured out ``the equation of a person.'' But at
the end, the main character Nneoma, a so-called ``grief worker,'' finds
the math too vast to calculate. What is Nneka Arimah trying to tell us
in this story?

12. In ``Glory,'' we believe the title character has all the bad luck
until we meet Thomas' mom, and Thomas gives her the ring. What decision
do you think she makes in the end? What does this moment say about
womanhood and marriage?

13. ``What Is a Volcano'' reads like a straight folk tale and
``Redemption'' like gritty realism. Do you enjoy how this collection
shifts from one genre to the next?

14. The book's last paragraph seems to be a kind of thesis statement for
Nneka Arimah, who writes that ``girls with fire in their bellies will be
forced to drink from a well of correction till the flames die out.'' But
then the main character in the story refuses to be corrected. Why?

15. What themes resonated most for you in these stories? Nneka Arimah's
explorations of family and home? Race and class? Or womanhood and
mother-daughter relationships?

16. From the legacy of the Biafran War to the contemporary party scene
in Lagos, we get many glimpses into Nigeria in this collection. What did
you learn about the country's past, present and even imagined future?
