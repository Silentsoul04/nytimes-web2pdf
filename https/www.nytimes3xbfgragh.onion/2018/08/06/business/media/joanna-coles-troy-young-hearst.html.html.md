On July 25, Hearst Magazines named [Troy
Young](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/business/media/hearst-harassment-troy-young.html)
as its new president. And now the magazine company behind Esquire,
Cosmopolitan and Harper’s Bazaar has lost its chief content officer.

Joanna Coles, a former editor of Cosmopolitan who was appointed one of
the highest-ranking executives at Hearst Magazines in 2016, has resigned
from the company. Her decision to leave ends her 12-year stint at the
publisher, which she joined in 2006 as the top editor of Marie Claire.

Ms. Coles, who is known for using a treadmill desk at work, posted a
short video on social media on Monday. “Have you any idea of the miles I
have walked on this treadmill desk through the peaks and the valleys of
Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan and as Hearst’s first chief content officer?”
she said while walking on her trusty machine. “But my route is being
recalculated. It’s time for a new adventure.”

The selection of Mr. Young, 50, to take control of Hearst’s magazines
signaled the company’s intention to move more deeply into digital media.
He was in charge of the company’s online efforts before he succeeded
David Carey, 57, as the president of the magazine division.

In choosing Mr. Young for the job, Hearst had apparently alienated the
company’s other star executive.

Ms. Coles, who was born in Yorkshire, England, was the New York bureau
chief of The Guardian and a columnist for The Times of London before
going into the magazine business. She distinguished herself at two
Hearst titles by expanding the role of magazine editor into a position
that embraced multimedia.

While at Marie Claire, Ms. Coles became partners with the reality show
“Project Runway All Stars” and served as an on-air mentor to its
contestants. Later, she made Cosmopolitan a popular destination on the
Snapchat Discover platform, attracting three million daily visitors.

Her television work has continued. Ms. Coles, 56, is a regular pundit on
cable television and has worked on both sides of the camera for an E\!
channel reality show, “So Cosmo.” She is also an executive producer of
“The Bold Type,” a series set at a women’s magazine that airs on the
ABC-owned cable network Freeform, with the actress Melora Hardin playing
a character modeled after Ms. Coles.

She joined the board of
[Snap](https://investor.snap.com/corporate-governance/officers-and-directors/independent-directors),
the maker of Snapchat, in 2015, which paid her $110,866 in cash and
stock in 2016. She signed a new contract at the beginning of last year
and now receives a package worth $896,179 that pays out over a
three-year period, according to security filings. Earlier this summer
[she was
made](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a21238867/joanna-coles-obe-queen-elizabeth/)
an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to
journalism and the media business.

“Joanna is an innovator, a connector and an inspired editor,” Hearst
Magazines said in a statement on Monday. “She’s made the decision to
start a new adventure and we thank her for her creativity and many
contributions and wish her the very best.”

News of Ms. Coles’s departure from Hearst was first reported by The New
York Post.
