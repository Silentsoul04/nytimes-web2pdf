SEOUL, South Korea --- Park Geun-hye, South Korea's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html?action=click\&contentCollection=Asia\%20Pacific\&module=RelatedCoverage\&region=EndOfArticle\&pgtype=article}{impeached
and ousted president}, was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison, as an
appeals court convicted her of collecting more bribes than previously
believed from Samsung, the country's largest business conglomerate.

In
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea.html}{a
lower-court ruling in April}, Ms. Park, 66, was sentenced to 24 years in
prison on bribery, extortion, abuse of power and other criminal charges
and ordered to pay 18 billion won (\$16 million) in fines. But on
Friday, the appeals court in Seoul added another year to her prison term
and increased her fine to 20 billion won, saying that the collusive ties
between Ms. Park and Samsung were more expansive than the lower court
had ruled.

Ms. Park, who has been in jail since last year, did not appear in court
on Friday to hear the verdict. Her trial does not end until the Supreme
Court rules on the case.

Ms. Park's fall from power began in 2016, when hundreds of thousands of
protesters began months of weekly rallies in central Seoul demanding
that she be forced from office. That December, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html}{National
Assembly impeached} her on charges of bribery and abuse of presidential
power. In March 2017,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html?action=click\&contentCollection=Asia\%20Pacific\&module=RelatedCoverage\&region=EndOfArticle\&pgtype=article}{Ms.
Park became the first South Korean leader removed} from office through
parliamentary impeachment after the Constitutional Court upheld the
lawmakers' decision.

The case of Ms. Park, a daughter of the former military dictator Park
Chung-hee, has exposed the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/02/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-samsung.html}{entrenched,
collusive ties} between powerful politicians and the huge
family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol.

When she was convicted in April, a lower court ruled that Ms. Park and
her longtime secretive friend and confidante,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/01/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-choi-soon-sil.html}{Choi
Soon-sil}, had collected or demanded 23 billion won in bribes from three
big businesses, including nearly 7.3 billion won from Samsung.

But on Friday, the appeals court put the amount of bribes Ms. Park and
Ms. Choi received from Samsung at 8.7 billion won. It said Samsung
offered the bribes to help win government support for an attempt by
Samsung's vice chairman, Lee Jae-yong, to inherit management control
from his father, Lee Kun-hee, the company's chairman.

The ruling on Friday could have legal implications for Lee Jae-yong, who
is the de facto head of Samsung, as his father remains seriously ill.

In August of last year, Mr. Lee was sentenced to five years in prison
for offering bribes to Ms. Choi and Ms. Park. But he
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/05/business/samsung-lee-jae-yong-appeal.html}{was
released from prison} in February after an appeals court cut his
sentence in half and suspended it, saying the amount of bribes he
offered was smaller, at 3.6 billion won --- a finding the judges in Ms.
Park's case disagreed with.

Also on Friday, Ms. Park's friend, Ms. Choi, was sentenced to 20 years
in prison.

The two women were also convicted of coercing 18 businesses into making
donations worth 77 billion won to two foundations that Ms. Choi
controlled.

The 25-year sentence is not the only prison term Ms. Park faces.

In two separate trials last month, Ms. Park was sentenced to a total of
eight years in prison on charges of violating election laws and
illegally using millions of dollars from the budgets of the government's
National Intelligence Service.
