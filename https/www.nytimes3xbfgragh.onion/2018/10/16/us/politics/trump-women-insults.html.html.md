# ‘Horseface,’ ‘Lowlife,’ ‘Fat, Ugly’: How the President Demeans Women

President Trump has a history of attacking women by mocking their bodily

WASHINGTON — President Trump referred to the pornographic film actress
Stephanie Clifford as “Horseface” in [a tweet on
Tuesday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1052213711295930368),
adding her to a long list of women he has attacked by demeaning their
looks, mocking their bodily functions or comparing them to animals.

Mr. Trump’s verbal assault came as he gloated about a federal judge’s
[decision to dismiss a defamation
suit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/15/admin/stormy-daniels-lawsuit-dismissed-trump.html)
filed by Ms. Clifford, who is known professionally as Stormy Daniels.
Ms. Clifford’s lawyer responded by calling the president “a disgusting
misogynist.” Ms. Clifford — who was paid $130,000 through Mr. Trump’s
former lawyer to buy her silence about sex she said she had with Mr.
Trump — [replied on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1052224021855637505)
by using the nickname “Tiny” for the president.

Mr. Trump’s tweet landed in the final days of a congressional election
cycle in which Republican candidates are already struggling to woo
female voters. The president’s language is unlikely to be helpful to
them.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although the president’s comment was striking about Ms. Clifford, who
has graphically described Mr. Trump’s genitals in a recent memoir, it
was hardly unique.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has accused women of having “fat, ugly” faces and of repelling
voters because of their looks. He called one woman a “crazed, crying
lowlife” and said another was a “dog” who had the “face of a pig.” He
said Hillary Clinton’s bathroom break during a 2015 presidential debate
was “too disgusting” to talk about. He has repeatedly mocked women for
being overweight.

“This rhetoric is the kind of thing that has turned off college-educated
Republican women who voted for Trump in 2016, but have fallen away,”
said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and
Politics at Rutgers University. Calling the president’s comment
“adolescent,” Ms. Walsh said that “you cannot continue to be a party
in power if the voters that you are appealing to are white men over the
age of 60.”

Mr. Trump’s turn toward juvenile mockery illustrates why even those
Republicans who were buoyed by the bounce they received in the aftermath
of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination were still cautious in their
midterm forecasts: One can never guess when this president will veer off
message, as he did on Tuesday with Ms. Clifford.

“To say this is unbecoming of any man, let alone the POTUS, is a vast
understatement,” [tweeted Representative Ryan A.
Costello](https://twitter.com/RyanCostello/status/1052224404124561408),
a Pennsylvania Republican who is retiring from Congress, referring to
the president. “And to say this enables teenage boys to feel they have a
license to refer to girls w such names is obvious. It’s all very
embarrassing.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of Mr. Trump’s comments came before he was elected. Voters learned
just weeks before Election Day that he had bragged that he could “grab
’em by the pussy.” He has continued to make crude comments about
women’s bodies since taking office, repeatedly testing the limits of
the public’s acceptance of a president’s locker-room vocabulary.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.

Here are some of the president’s most remarkable attacks on women over
the
years:

## Women’s faces

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When he attacks women, as he did with Ms. Clifford in his tweet on
Tuesday, Mr. Trump often goes after their faces.

As he battled his rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential
nomination, Mr. Trump [made fun of Carly Fiorina’s
face](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/politics/first-draft/2015/09/10/donald-trumps-uncomplimentary-comments-about-carly-fiorina/)
on television, saying that people wouldn’t vote for the former chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard because of her looks.

“Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?” Mr. Trump said
during [an interview with Rolling Stone
magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-seriously-on-the-trail-with-the-gops-tough-guy-41447/).
“I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not supposed to say bad things, but
really, folks, come on. Are we serious?”

Mr. Trump later denied that he was talking about Ms. Fiorina’s
appearance and told CNN that he was [referring to her
“persona.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/politics/first-draft/2015/09/10/donald-trump-denies-attacking-carly-fiorinas-looks/?ref=first-draft)
But similar remarks about other women have been a regular part of his
repertoire.

During his long-running feud with the television star Rosie O’Donnell,
Mr. Trump described her as having “a fat, ugly face.” In 2016, he
[retweeted an unflattering photo of Heidi
Cruz](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/712850174838771712),
the wife of Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who was one of his
primary campaign rivals. The caption on the picture: “Images are worth a
thousand words.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a 1992 issue of New York magazine, [Mr. Trump was quoted as
saying](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=if+you+like+a+woman+with+a+bad+complexion+who+is+built+like+a+linebacker&source=bl&ots=tX79s7pj6e&sig=-MyardUohO0r2F5owgwjaWfoXnU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_4KDQgfvPAhVJBsAKHZ5gAagQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=if%20you%20like%20a%20woman%20with%20a%20bad%20complexion%20who%20is%20built%20like%20a%20linebacker&f=false)
that Katarina Witt, a German Olympic figure skater, would be considered
attractive only “if you like a woman with a bad complexion who is built
like a
linebacker.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president often expresses his ire by comparing women to animals, an
effort to dehumanize his opponents that he also uses against men.

After his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman published her tell-all
book, “Unhinged,” Mr. Trump [responded by calling her “that
dog”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/14/us/politics/trump-omarosa-dog.html)
and a “crazed, crying lowlife.”

It was not unlike language Mr. Trump used in the early 1990s, when he
sent Gail Collins, then a columnist for New York Newsday, a copy of a
column she had written. Ms. Collins, now an opinion columnist for The
New York Times, [recalled that he scrawled several
insults](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/15/opinion/trump-omarosa-dogs-insults.html)
on the column, branding her “a dog and a liar” and writing that she had
“the face of a
pig.”

At a campaign rally in December 2015, Mr. Trump called attention to Mrs.

debate, eliciting cheers from his supporters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I know where she went — it’s disgusting. I don’t want to talk about
it,” [Mr. Trump
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/12/24/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-women-isis.html).
“No, it’s too disgusting. Don’t say it, it’s disgusting.”

Mr. Trump also [suggested in
August 2015](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/08/09/us/politics/donald-trump-disinvited-from-conservative-event-over-remark-on-megyn-kelly.html?module=inline)
that Megyn Kelly, a Fox News journalist at the time, was tough on him
when she was moderating a Republican debate because she was
menstruating. The night after the debate, Mr. Trump said, “You could see
there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her
wherever.”

And after becoming president and moving into the White House, Mr. Trump
[mocked MSNBC’s Mika
Brzezinski](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/29/business/media/trump-mika-brzezinski-facelift.html)
in 2017, saying that she had a “low I.Q.” and that she had been
“bleeding badly from a face-lift” during a social gathering at his
resort in Florida around New Year’s Eve.

On Monday, Mr. Trump invited a disturbing image when he told reporters
that he would keep his pledge to donate $1 million to a charity only if
he could “personally” test [Senator Elizabeth Warren’s
DNA](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/15/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-ancestry.html).
“That will not be something that I enjoy doing,” he
added.

Perhaps most common is Mr. Trump’s fixation on the overall appearance of
women. He often uses their looks as a way of diminishing their
abilities, their intelligence or their effectiveness — sometimes all
three. Attacking a woman’s looks has become his standard response to
female critics and rivals.

After [Jessica
Leeds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/15/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html)
said in 2016 that Mr. Trump groped her on an airplane in the 1980s, he
said “believe me, she would not be my first choice.” Of Natasha
Stoynoff, a former People magazine writer who said Mr. Trump accosted
her during an interview, Mr. Trump denied it and said, “Check out her
Facebook page, you’ll understand.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In March 2012, Mr. Trump [attacked
Cher](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/201044011954348032),
the singer and actress, over her criticism of Republican candidates
running for office, saying on Twitter that she should “stop with the bad
plastic surgery and nasty statements.”

That same year, Mr. Trump lashed out against Arianna Huffington, the
founder of HuffPost, saying she was “unattractive both inside and out.”
In 2014, he reiterated that she was “[ugly both inside and
out](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/458031670164459521?lang=en)\!”
In 2015, he [again
tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/585262729511972864)
about “the extremely unattractive (both inside and out) Arianna
Huffington.”

Mr. Trump derided Heidi Klum, the German supermodel and entrepreneur, in
[a 2015 interview with The
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/introducing-donald-trump-diplomat.html?_r=0),
saying: “Heidi Klum. Sadly, she’s no longer a 10.” She responded by
tweeting a photo of herself wearing a “10” label on her T-shirt.

In 2012, Mr. Trump [dismissed the actress Bette
Midler](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/262584296081068033)
as “an extremely unattractive woman,” adding that “I refuse to say that
because I always insist on being politically correct.” And as he watched
the 2014 Oscars, Mr. Trump attacked the actress Kim Novak, [writing on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/440313189062823937?lang=en):
“The last song was terrible\! Kim should sue her plastic surgeon\!” He
later walked the criticism back by saying that she was “[a wonderful
actress](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/457208802027507712?lang=en).”

Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist who oversees the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce’s political affairs, pleaded with the president on
Tuesday not to get distracted by lashing out at women the way he has in
the past.

“We need a strong dose of message discipline out of the White House for
the next 20 days,” Mr. Reed said. “If not, this midterm election becomes
a crapshoot.”
