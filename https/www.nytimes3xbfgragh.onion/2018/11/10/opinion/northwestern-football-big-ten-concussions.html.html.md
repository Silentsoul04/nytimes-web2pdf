# I Miss Northwestern Football’s Losing Tradition

My college was usually on the bottom of the Big Ten. When I think of the
players’ futures, I wish it still was.

The football team at my alma mater, Northwestern, is having a pretty
good season. Once, that would have thrilled me. Now, it just makes me
uneasy.

The first game I attended at N.U. was a doozy: The Wildcats beat
Northern Illinois on Sept. 25, 1982, to break what remains the longest
losing streak ([34
games](http://www.espn.com/page2/s/list/colfootball/teams/worst.html))
in Division I-A history. My classmates streamed onto the field at Dyche
Stadium to dismantle the goal posts in triumph and deposit them in Lake
Michigan. The team went on to a losing season, though: It had been a
long time since the days when[the future Notre Dame legend Ara
Parseghian was its relatively successful
coach](http://exhibits.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/football/7.html),
and even longer since Northwestern had gone to the Rose Bowl.

We would have been delighted if the team had won more games (it didn’t
have a winning season until 1995), but we consoled ourselves by taking a
sort of perverse pride in our losses. As the Wildcats were being pounded
by Big Ten opponents — especially our downstate rival, the University of
Illinois — the N.U. students in the stands would chant, “That’s all
right, that’s O.K., you’re going to work for us one day\!” Obnoxious and
classist, yes, but satisfying.

When I worked for the sports section of the campus newspaper, we’d
dutifully write features about the hopes and dreams of the football
players at the beginning of the season. Then, as the season rolled on,
we would just as dutifully record their losses next to accounts of the
exploits of the university’s real star athletes: the field hockey team.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And that was all right, that was O.K., because nobody went to
Northwestern for its football prowess. I don’t recall ever meeting a
fellow student who regretted taking a pass on Ohio State because the
football there was better. If only a few of our players got jobs in the
N.F.L., that was all right and O.K., too.

So it’s been disconcerting in recent years to see Northwestern be
competitive in the Big Ten and regularly appear in bowl games. Right
now, as The Times [noted with bemusement last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/30/sports/college-football-playoff.html),
it leads its division, with a 5-1 conference record.

The school has invested plenty in the team; a couple of months ago an
indoor practice field on prime lakefront property opened, [part of a
$270 million
complex](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-northwestern-athletics-facility-football-20180802-story.html)
that Northwestern hopes will lure recruits and render practices more
efficient — and make the team more competitive in a conference that has
a lucrative television deal. It’s a commonplace for non-athletes to
complain about too many resources being devoted to athletics, but
colleges *should* spend money on sports for a lively campus and to
promote students’ health.

And there’s the problem: Football’s not healthy.

So it’s been much more than disconcerting that my alma mater’s success,
and its big investment in the sport, comes as we are being reminded
every day of the price football players pay in traumatic brain injury.
The [rash of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html)
among N.F.L. players has gotten the most attention, but [college
players](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/09/14/sports/14football.html)
[are](https://concussionfoundation.org/CTE-resources/cte-college-football)
[hurt,
too](https://www.today.com/health/college-football-player-tyler-hilinski-who-died-suicide-had-cte-t131843).
[Some colleges, like
Dartmouth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/26/sports/ivy-league-football-dartmouth.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer),
are trying ways to reduce these injuries by eliminating tackling in
practice and [taking other
measures](http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/24859819/concussions-drop-ivy-league-football-kickoff-change),
but they remain outliers.

News of Northwestern’s triumphs now just serves as a reminder that there
are real young men behind those wins whose brains are being battered. I
want the Wildcats to win less so they won’t play as much.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s also making me increasingly uncomfortable about giving to my old
school. When I donate nowadays, I make sure to earmark my gift so it
won’t be applied to the football team in some way, but I’m wondering
if I’m still making myself complicit by donating at all to a university
that is willing to risk its students’ health and happiness for a share
of television revenue.

The Wildcats play Iowa on Saturday. A victory would put them a step
closer to the Big Ten championship game after the regular season. I’ll
root for them to play safe — and lose.
