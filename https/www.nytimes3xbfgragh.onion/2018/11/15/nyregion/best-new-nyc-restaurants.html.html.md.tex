Now)}\label{10-of-the-best-new-nyc-restaurants-for-now}}

These are the dinners and dining rooms our restaurant critic, Pete
Wells, craves most --- at least for the next few months.

Pete Wells has been The New York Times's restaurant critic since 2012.
He has reviewed hundreds of places to eat, from high-profile,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/09/dining/manhatta-restaurant-review.html}{high-end
restaurants} to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/02/dining/village-cafe-review-brooklyn.html}{small
neighborhood spots}.

These are the 10 restaurants he doesn't want you to miss --- for now.

While its approach to French cuisine can be novel (snails with soft
scrambled eggs),
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/10/dining/frenchette-review-restaurant-tribeca.html}{Frenchette's}
setting, menu structure and portion sizes are formidably traditional.
Reservations at night are scarcer than Burgundy truffles, but they are
easier to find for lunch, which the restaurant began serving this fall.

Rather than stealing looks from Instagram, Adda doubles down on
home-style cooking from around India. The menu runs from stuff you may
know, like butter chicken, to stuff you may not, like chicken liver
masala. Ingredients, like the bouquet of greens in saag paneer, are
chosen with care and the spices practically vibrate.

Every opportunity latent in the tasting-menu format is brought out and
turned to advantage by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/16/dining/atomix-review-korean.html}{Atomix},
where each course comes with a flash card that builds your understanding
of Korean ingredients and culture. At the end of the night, you have a
full deck and a set of new impressions of Korea, too.

Joseph Johnson, known everywhere as J J, can fit more ideas on one plate
than most chefs get into their entire menus. The ideas that animate him
come from Africa and from across the African diaspora; his global vision
has had diners crowding in ever since August, when his arrival brought

back from the dead.

Many of the appetizers and main courses at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/23/dining/hunan-slurp-review.html}{Hunan
Slurp} turn out to have the direct, intense energy that you'd hope for
from a stylish restaurant with a Hunan-born chef. Many, but not all. The
bowls of rice noodles, though, are consistently impressive.

A love letter to the simple coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia and the
Chinese-influenced cooking they serve,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/25/dining/kopitiam-restaurant-review.html}{Kopitiam}
now has a nicer, larger space. You can drop in at any time of day for
superior renditions of classics like nasi lemak and grilled stingray;
sample a few sweets and snacks; and watch as your milky coffee is cooled
and frothed by being poured from pot to cup in long, curving ribbons.

It's pronounced ``missy,'' after the chef, Missy Robbins, who's become
the most exciting interpreter of Italian food in the city.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/28/dining/missy-robbins-misi.html}{Misi's}
menu is largely meatless and is divided into two categories: vegetables,
seasoned simply but energetically, and house-made pastas.

When you need your faith in restaurants restored, go here.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/slideshow/2018/06/12/dining/shabushabu-macoron-nyc/s/13rest-ss1.html}{Mako
Okano}, the chef, has turned the rowdy scrum of shabu shabu hot pot
cooking into a quietly personal experience. She cooks and serves nearly
every bite of food herself, and making you feel taken care of seems to
be her only goal.

On the first floor of a Brooklyn brownstone,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/11/dining/sofreh-review.html}{Sofreh}
has a hospitable, dinner-party atmosphere and Persian cooking of the
sort that an Iranian émigré might make for friends. The saffron rice,
the nigella-flecked loaves of barbari, the eggplant and yogurt dips are
painstaking and meant to impress, but they're also relaxed, with a
modern, cosmopolitan attitude.

Crunchy salt-cod fritters with fresh hot chiles; juicy fried snapper
escoveitch doused in pickled vegetables; barbecued chicken with a sauce
like a Christmas ham glaze:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/26/dining/the-islands-review.html}{The
Islands} cooks Jamaican food without gimmicks. This is the restaurant's
second location, but it's so much bigger, brighter and more welcoming
that it hardly seems related to the cramped old spot.

671 Washington Avenue (Saint Marks Avenue), Crown Heights, Brooklyn;
718-398-3575.
