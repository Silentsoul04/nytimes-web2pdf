For decades, the fashion designer has been escaping to an estate outside
Milan that proves even minimalists (sometimes) like a little coziness.

GIORGIO ARMANI, NOW 84, spends a great deal of time shuttling between
his nine residences throughout Europe, the United States and the
Caribbean. Unsurprisingly for someone whose exacting, understated
aesthetic has profoundly shaped both fashion and the culture at large,
he likes things to be just so in each of them. One of the reasons he
keeps such a vast array of homes is that he doesn’t like to stay in
hotels; he is easily upset by a sink mounted too high or an
unnecessarily oily
[bruschetta](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/3846-sourdough-bruschetta).
Decorative flamboyance dismays him, as does poor execution.

In view of such fabled perfectionism, not to mention the sharp lines and
hushed neutrals that define both his clothing and home décor
collections, the weekend compound he has owned for nearly 30 years in
Broni — an unremarkable industrial town about an hour and a half south
of
[Milan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/11/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-milan.html)
— is nothing you would expect. Unlike Lake Garda or
[Como](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/28/travel/lake-como-italy-younger-travelers.html),
the area is not known as a fashionable retreat for wealthy Milanese, but
from the moment you drive through the unmarked metal-plate gates
incongruously set on a two-lane highway, you are transported into a vast
Impressionist canvas stippled with fruit trees and fields of roses,
where sunshine diffuses into a blur of pastels.

The house that anchors the property is grand — Armani is, after all, on
the [Forbes list of the world’s
billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/profile/giorgio-armani/#35f49c492c5b)
— but it is also pink, a color one does not readily associate with him.
The nearly 15,000-square-foot, 26-room chalky rose stucco villa that he
visits at least a dozen times a year — far more than any of his other
vacation homes — stands on a slight rise overlooking 25 groomed acres.
Its color evokes the 1950s, the era in which the house was built (by the
Italian count Franco Cella di Rivara, who made a fortune creating Marvis
toothpaste), but its style is late 18th century — a supremely decorative
period that the designer, who made his name displacing 1980s kitsch with
sophisticated Italian minimalism, seems to crave in his off time. It is
to this romantically accoutered house that he repairs, in the back of
his chauffeured Bentley after a workweek in Milan. He grew up the son of
an accountant in nearby Piacenza, so the area has profound resonance for
him. “When you are here, you want to escape from things that are dark or
serious,” he says (in Italian — he has never mastered English), as he
squeezes your arm gently for emphasis. “I come on the weekend to see the
light.”

He also comes to surround himself with his collection of fauna, many of
which he has imported in the past few years from distant lands. (“Now I
am a zookeeper\!”) Beyond the pink villa and the pond stocked with swans
and egrets lie large grassy enclosures where a menagerie of exotic
animals lazily grazes — zebras, guanacos, alpacas, longhorn deer: about
80 animals in total. A pair of South American parrots spread wide wings
of crimson, marigold and emerald as they nuzzle each other in a giant
outdoor cage. The designer’s dogs, a pack of six that includes not
merely obscure purebreds with noble lineage but a football-size
coffee-brown mutt called Pepe, greet you enthusiastically; the
soundtrack is the soft call of the cuckoos hiding in the beech trees
that rim the property’s distant borders.

Inside the main house as well, Armani’s lingua franca — white, gray,
taupe and black — is markedly absent. In its place is a palette that
somehow in his hands is both subtle and vibrant: celadon, slate blue and
pale coral. The smooth plaster walls have a gently mottled finish that
suggests age and depth. “I wanted this house to make one feel as though
you are part of history,” he says.

Sunlight streams into the 70-foot-long main gallery through a series of
arched glass doors to the patio and a sweeping back staircase inlaid
with smooth pebbles. Most of the doorways on the main floor are crowned
with ornate 18th-century gilded arches, rescued by the home’s former
owner from a neglected, centuries-old villa nearby. The repeating motif
lends a gravitas that belies the house’s relatively recent vintage.
“These symbols of the past make you let go,” says Armani. “You can
breathe.”

IT IS DIFFICULT to imagine the notoriously precise designer — seemingly
always in his uniform of navy cashmere pullover, navy trousers, white
trainers and a late August tan — taking the time for deep breaths, much
less relinquishing control. And yet, despite its classical proportions,
the house has a warmth, a relaxed coziness, that makes you question
everything you thought you knew about the man who spent decades building
an international empire.

While his Milan palazzo on Via Borgonuovo in the Brera neighborhood was
famously done up by the designer [Peter
Marino](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/03/11/magazine/peter-marino-likes-playing-bad-cop.html)
in the 1980s in linear monochrome, there is no trace of an outside
decorator’s statement here. Nor has Armani updated it much through the
decades. Absent, too, are sculptural contemporary furniture pieces or
antiques of the great-to-look-at-but-miserable-to-sit-in sort. There is
also little evidence of the spare, Deco-inspired furniture he creates
for his own line, [Armani/Casa](https://www.armani.com/casa/us/).
Instead, the living areas are dominated by deep-cushioned ivory
roll-armed sofas that you instantly want to sink into for a nap, perhaps
with a dog or two snoozing beside you. The lush neutral carpets are
lightly stained here and there; there may be evidence of a canine tooth
mark on a low wood-edged coffee table. In a nook off the grand main
entrance with its mirror-polished marble floors (the doorway is flanked
by a seven-foot-tall pair of classical stone statues whimsically turned
into giant lamps) stands a foosball table.

Armani has never been much for hanging art on his walls — “distracting,”
he says — and the *objets* arranged on the low Asian-influenced tables
and painted étagères in the living areas are a mix of the precious and
the sentimental: a marble bust picked up in the local flea market (“to
me, it resembles Seneca”), a collection of 19th-century pharmacy bottles
from Tunisia (“charmed away, for a price, from a man who looked about
120 years old”), a stone lion from the 1700s purchased at the [Marché
aux
Puces](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/11/30/travel/at-a-paris-flea-market-tips-for-treasure-hunters.html)
outside Paris. On a side chest in the dining room is a collection of
silver serving pieces from Gran Caffè Doney, once his favorite osteria
in
[Florence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/09/28/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-florence-italy.html),
long defunct. A small table is arrayed, shrinelike, with sculptures of
graceful male bodies and a framed image of [Sergio
Galeotti](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1985/08/16/nyregion/sergio-galeotti.html),
Armani’s partner in life and business, who died in 1985. There is
another framed image of Galeotti in the master bedroom; almost no other
photographs are on display.

While other designers may use an invitation to their weekend homes to
cement relationships with celebrities, Armani’s guests at the villa are
never famous. Too tiring, he says, with a wave of his hand: “And then
one tells the other and you have to have them all.” Instead, he prefers
to be surrounded by family — his sister and nephew once worked for the
company, and his nieces still do — and his close group of key employees
and friends, many of them journalists. After a day strolling the gravel
paths, visiting the alpacas, a late afternoon swim in the pool and a
simple dinner by his chef, his guests will gather in one of the living
rooms. The lofty ceilinged space is made cozy by his collection of
folding screens — Japanese antiques and one by the revered 20th-century
architect [Renzo
Mongiardino](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/06/t-magazine/renzo-mongiardino-architect.html)
— that soften the room’s angles. At the far end sits a pool table that
[Paul
Newman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/28/movies/28newman.html)
played on in “[The Color of
Money](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1986/10/17/movies/screen-paul-newman-in-the-color-of-money.html),”
a gift from one of his nieces.

And then, once the lights are dimmed, Armani, finally far from the
demands of the sprawling principality he has ruled for nearly half a
century, settles into what could be an almost ordinary life. He pushes
up the sleeves of his fine-gauge sweater. He arranges himself just so on
the goose-down cushions of one of the ivory sofas. He flicks on the
enormous flat-screen that dominates one corner. It is time to binge late
into the night on “[The
Crown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/07/arts/television/the-crown-season-2-review.html?action=click&contentCollection=Television&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article).”
Even the emperor sometimes needs a break.
