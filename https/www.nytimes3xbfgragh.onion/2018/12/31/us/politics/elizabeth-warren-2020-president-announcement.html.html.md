Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and a sharp critic
of big banks and unregulated capitalism, entered the 2020 race for
president on Monday, becoming the first major candidate in what is
likely to be a long and crowded primary marked by ideological and
generational divisions in a Democratic Party determined to beat
President Trump.

Ms. Warren quickly made plans to campaign this weekend in Iowa, which
holds the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses in February 2020.
The senator, who has not traveled to Iowa recently, announced Tuesday
that she would visit several of the state’s major cities: Des Moines,
Council Bluffs, Storm Lake and Sioux City.

\[[Here are five ways Elizabeth Warren and other 2020 hopefuls will
campaign when there’s no campaign
yet.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/02/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-candidates.html)\]

The competition for the Democratic nomination is poised to be the most
wide open since perhaps 1992: The party has no single leader, no obvious
front-runner for 2020, and no broadly unifying ideology as it moves away
from a quarter-century of dominance by the Clintons and Barack Obama.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After a midterm election in which many women, liberals, minorities and
young Democrats won, the presidential primaries and caucuses next year
are likely to be fought over not only who is the right policy match for
the party, but also which mix of identities should be reflected in the
next nominee. The range of candidates will also force Democratic voters
to consider which electoral approach is best suited to defeat Mr. Trump,
balancing questions of ideological purity with how to appeal to a wide
range of demographic groups like white rural voters, suburban women,
college students, and black and Latino Democrats in the South and the
Sun Belt.

Ms. Warren, 69, is among the best-known Democrats seeking to take on Mr.
Trump, whom she has denounced in the past as “a thin-skinned racist
bully” and a “wannabe tyrant.” Mr. Trump, who has already announced his
re-election campaign, frequently mocks her as “Pocahontas” because of
her claims to Native American ancestry, a slur Native American groups
have denounced as a racist epithet.

While Ms. Warren’s stinging attacks on Mr. Trump and Wall Street have
helped make her a favorite of grass-roots liberals, she also faces
challenges as a presidential candidate: [controversy over a DNA test to
prove her Native American
heritage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/06/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-test-2020.html),
skepticism from the party establishment and a lack of experience in a
national race.

The editorial board of The Boston Globe, her hometown newspaper,
[recently urged her not to run for
president](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/12/07/deval-patrick-knew-when-call-quits-presidential-bid-other-political-figures-should-take-note/nOLcrzE5xTQgfXpPMKrUZM/story.html),
saying she had become “a divisive figure.” And some in her party believe
she missed her best chance to run in 2016, when liberal activists urged
her to challenge Hillary Clinton.

Two potential top-tier candidates who have run before, [former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/01/us/politics/biden-2020-anita-hill-kavanaugh.html)
and [Senator Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/27/us/politics/bernie-sanders-president-2020.html),
are eyeing 2020 and are expected to disclose their plans this winter.
Yet both men carry political baggage and would be in their late 70s on
Election Day 2020, and many Democrats say they want a fresh face as
their next nominee.

is also popular with grass-roots activists — as a courtesy and had a
brief, matter-of-fact conversation, according to a Democrat briefed on
the call.

More than three dozen Democratic senators, governors, mayors and
business leaders are also weighing bids — most of whom have not sought
the White House before. The race is expected to draw several women and
nonwhite contenders, making for the most diverse field in history.
Several Senate colleagues of Ms. Warren’s are likely to enter the race
soon: [Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and
Kirsten Gillibrand of New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/29/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-kamala-elizabeth-warren.html).
A mix of liberal and more moderate politicians are also considering a
run, including Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York
City mayor, who has said he is prepared to spend well over $100 million
of his own money on the race.

Getting a jump on the competition, Ms. Warren plans to head not just to
Iowa but other early voting states in the coming weeks. According to a
person familiar with Ms. Warren’s thinking, the timing of her
announcement had been decided weeks in
advance.

\[[*How early do presidential campaigns
start?*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/31/us/politics/presidential-campaigns-2020.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)
*Earlier than you may think.*\]

In an email to supporters on Monday — 13 months before votes will be
cast in Iowa — Ms. Warren said she was forming an exploratory committee,
which allows her to raise money and fill staff positions before a formal
start of her presidential bid.

On Monday afternoon outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., flanked by her
husband, Bruce H. Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, and their
golden retriever, Bailey, Ms. Warren leaned into her stinging criticisms
of wealthy financial interests as she ripped Mr. Trump and branded
herself as a champion of the middle class.

“The problem we’ve got right now in Washington is that it works great
for those who’ve got money to buy influence, and I’m fighting against
that,” Ms. Warren said. “And you bet it’s going to make a lot of people
unhappy. But at the end of the day, I don’t go to Washington to work for
them.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In her remarks before a pack of cameras, Ms. Warren shrugged at a
question about how she had handled the release of her DNA test,
reiterating that she had “put it all out there” and people could see the
information for themselves.

She also took a revealing warning shot at the emerging field of
presidential hopefuls. “I don’t think we ought to be running campaigns
that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or
their own money that they’re spending,” she said. “Democrats are the
party of the people.”

Among grass-roots activists eager to highlight their message of a rigged
economic system, there was particular excitement that [a video released
by Ms. Warren on Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbH0RU4GcVo)
focused on issues like income inequality and corporate greed. The
Progressive Change Campaign Committee said that “Elizabeth Warren meets
the moment,” and Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the leftist group
Justice Democrats, said Ms. Warren’s “message of multiracial populism is
exactly the right way to take on Trump’s divide-and-conquer agenda.”

In an interview set to air on Fox News on Monday night, Mr. Trump
addressed Ms. Warren’s entrance into the race.

“She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage,” Mr.
Trump said, according to a partial transcript. “That didn’t work out too
well. So, we’ll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well,
I’d love to run against her.”

A longtime bankruptcy law professor at Harvard who never held public
office before 2013, Ms. Warren became the first woman elected to the
Senate from Massachusetts after defeating a self-styled moderate
Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, with a populist message based on
advocacy for strict Wall Street regulation.

Ms. Warren has both assets and possible drawbacks in a White House run.
Strategists for several other likely Democratic candidates say private
polling found Ms. Warren’s political brand — as a warrior against
powerful corporate interests — to be exceptionally strong with
Democratic primary voters. Her signature initiative in recent months has
been a sweeping bill to crack down on government corruption, effectively
adapting her longtime focus on private-sector greed for the
public-sector scandals of the Trump era.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Ms. Warren has also become a favorite target of conservatives, who
have sought to label her as an out-of-touch liberal from academia. In
2012, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Ms.
Warren represented a “threat to free enterprise,” and this year two
Democratic senators — facing difficult re-election races in states Mr.
Trump won in 2016 — took the unusual step of distancing themselves from
Ms. Warren, their own colleague.

Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said in
an interview Monday that it had been a mistake for Ms. Warren to spend
so much time sparring in personal terms with Mr. Trump and called that a
losing path for her or any other presidential candidate.

But Ms. Dvorsky also said Ms. Warren’s announcement video — particularly
her focus on “how the middle class is being destroyed” — would resonate
in Iowa.

“She has always done well in Iowa,” said Ms. Dvorsky, who recalled
hosting Ms. Warren when she campaigned there for Democrats in the 2014
midterm elections. “She had people eating out of her hand, in tears,
because her story is extremely powerful and she is a powerful teller of
it.”

A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-December underscored Ms. Warren’s
strengths as a primary candidate, finding her better known, and better
liked, by Democrats than any other candidate who had not run for
president before. Three in five Democrats had a favorable opinion of
her, compared with just 12 percent who viewed her unfavorably, a ratio
outdone only by Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.

But the same poll pointed to Ms. Warren’s likely challenges. Voters at
large were far more divided in their views of her: [Only about 30
percent viewed her
favorably](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2591),
with 37 percent holding an unfavorable view and the rest
undecided.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To the extent that Democratic primary voters are inclined to cast their
ballots tactically — in favor of a candidate who appears likeliest to
beat Mr. Trump — Ms. Warren may have some serious convincing to do. She
is regarded with anxiety by much of the Democratic political
establishment, including some Senate colleagues who complain that she
has pursued an inflexible agenda on matters like bank regulation at the
cost of party unity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

During her Senate years, Ms. Warren has demonstrated the most influence
as a member of the Banking Committee, [aggressively
questioning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/21/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-senate-testimony.html)
leaders of the financial industry about excesses and abuses, seeking
accountability for the Great Recession and challenging the Obama and
Trump administrations to take tougher lines on regulations and trade
policy. In 2015, Ms. Warren [sank the nomination of Antonio
Weiss](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/11/28/business/economy/liberal-treasury-nominees-deal-making-prowess-could-be-a-liability-.html?module=inline),
the Wall Street banker selected by the Obama administration to serve as
the third-ranking official at the Treasury Department, taking on her
party on the grounds that Mr. Weiss, the former head of investment
banking for Lazard, was too closely connected to the financial services
industry to serve in public office.

The map of states with early nominating contests appears, at least on
the surface, to be an inviting one for Ms. Warren: The race begins in
Iowa, where Farm Belt populism long defined Democratic politics, before
moving to her political backyard of New Hampshire. During the midterm
elections, she got a rousing reception in Nevada, an early state that
suffered grievously in the 2008 financial crisis, and where rhetoric
lashing Wall Street and major mortgage lenders tends to resonate.

Ms. Warren’s prospects may also depend, in part, on which Democrats
decide to run. Like other white liberals in a historically diverse
field, Ms. Warren may have to work harder to win over black primary
voters. African-American Democrats have played a decisive role in
settling the last two open contests for the party’s nomination, and Ms.
Warren is expected to be competing against her party’s only two black
senators, Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker.

And several other fiery economic populists could join the Democratic
field, including Mr. Sanders and Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff
Merkley of Oregon, potentially splintering the voters most energized by
Ms. Warren’s core themes. Advisors to other top-tier candidates, who
were granted anonymity because their campaigns are yet to be announced,
said that while they were surprised that Ms. Warren had announced her
candidacy before the new year, it would have no influence on their
decisions.
