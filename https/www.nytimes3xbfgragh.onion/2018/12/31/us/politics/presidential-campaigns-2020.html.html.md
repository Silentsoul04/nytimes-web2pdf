It’s nearly two years until Election Day 2020, but Elizabeth Warren is
forming her exploratory committee right on schedule, if recent history
is any guide.

The 2020 presidential race is happening — now, today, before 2018 is
even over. On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of
Massachusetts, became the first major candidate to enter the contest,
[announcing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/31/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-president-announcement.html)[that](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/31/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-president-announcement.html)[she
was forming an exploratory
committee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/31/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-president-announcement.html).

In modern politics, forming the committee, which facilitates early
fund-raising, is seen as an all-but-official announcement that a person
is running for the presidency. Julián Castro, the former federal housing
secretary and San Antonio mayor,[also
formed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/12/us/politics/julian-castro-president-democrat-texas.html)
one this month. Several other candidates[are
expected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/29/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-kamala-elizabeth-warren.html)
to join the race in the coming weeks. (A congressman from Maryland, John
Delaney, has been running since 2017. [Read more about him
here](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/10/us/politics/john-delaney-2020-iowa.html).)

And President Trump, never one to shy away from political combat, has
also gotten an early jump on the 2020 race, naming a campaign manager
last February and flouting precedent by raising money for his
re-election during the midterm campaign.

With the election more than 670 days away, this can all feel a little
ridiculous. But that does not make it unusual. A glance at recent
history suggests that the candidates are roughly on schedule.

It was not always this way. In 1960, John F. Kennedy did not announce
his candidacy until 11 months before Election Day. As recently as the
1992 election, Bill Clinton did not formally enter the presidential
contest until just over a year before the general election. But since
then, campaigns have grown longer, bloating into nearly two-year
affairs.

Here is a look back at some candidates who jumped in early, how they did
it and whether it did them much good:

Mitt Romney: April 2011. Barack Obama: Incumbent

## 2012: Candidates waited until springtime 2011

[The 2012 election got off to a slow
start](https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/02/25/lots-of-talk-but-still-no-2012-republican-candidates/),
although it was widely expected that **Mitt Romney**, who had run in
2008, would again seek the Republican nomination. But few of the
Republicans lining up to run against President Barack Obama were willing
to formally claim an early stake in the race.

Former Gov. **Tim Pawlenty** of Minnesota **** became [the first major
Republican to enter the
race,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/03/22/us/politics/22pawlenty.html)
announcing an exploratory committee in March 2011. But he would not win
the party nomination.

Mr. Romney, **** the former governor of Massachusetts, [announced his
own exploratory
committee](https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/04/11/romney-makes-it-official-quietly/)
in April 2011 and would eventually emerge as the Republican
standard-bearer against Mr. Obama, who won
re-election.

John McCain: November 2006. Barack Obama: January 2007

## 2008: And you thought this year was fast?

If you think there wasn’t enough room between the midterm election and
the start of presidential campaigns this year, look no further than the
2008 election cycle.

For the first time in more than half a century, [the presidential race
did not include an
incumbent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/01/22/us/politics/22campaign.html)—
either the president or the vice president — on the ballot. And the
campaigning started so early that it bumped up against the midterms.

the week of the 2006 midterms and [made it
official](https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/11/30/vilsack-kicks-off-08-bid/)
by the end of November. **John McCain**, the senator from Arizona who
would go on to capture the Republican nomination, formed his
presidential exploratory committee that same month.

By January 2007, when **[Barack

and **[Hillary
Clinton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/01/20/us/politics/20cnd-clinton.html)**

with candidates. It was a breathtakingly fast start to a presidential
race that would propel Mr. Obama to the White House.

John Kerry: December 2002. President Bush: Incumbent

## 2004: The nominee went early

Going into the 2004 election, George W. Bush was the incumbent
president, but that did not dissuade prospective Democrats from
campaigning.

**John Kerry**, the senator from Massachusetts, established himself as
an early contender: In early December 2002, he [went on NBC’s “Meet the
Press”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/01/04/us/political-memo-with-no-04-front-runner-democrats-inch-toward-line.html)
to declare that he was creating an exploratory committee. By January, a
flood of other candidates had entered the race.

Initially, Mr. Kerry’s early move paid off: He bested the other
Democratic candidates to become the party’s nominee for president. But
he, too, lost to the incumbent president as Mr. Bush secured a second
term.

Al Gore: January 1999. George W. Bush: March 1999

## 2000: Started early, ended late

The unforgettable 2000 presidential race that ended with a recount in
Florida began with the long-shot candidacy of a liberal senator from
Minnesota.

The senator, Paul Wellstone, [announced an exploratory
committee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/04/09/us/minnesota-senator-may-challenge-gore.html)
as early as April 1998, more than two years before the election. In a
solicitation letter to Democrats during his short-lived campaign, [he
wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/11/27/us/one-democrat-has-hat-in-ring-and-in-hand-for-presidency.html),
“Nov. 7, 2000, probably seems a long time away to you. (It does to
me\!)”

**Al Gore,** then the vice president of the United States, was the
favorite for the Democratic nomination and announced [his first formal
step toward running for
president](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/01/01/us/gore-forming-organization-for-2000-bid-for-president.html)
on Jan. 1, 1999. The future **President Bush** [announced his
exploratory committee two months later, in
March 1999](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/03/03/opinion/the-fight-in-george-bush-s-future.html).

But there was another notable candidate that election cycle: **Donald J.
Trump**. Encouraged by “amazing” polls, “unbelievable” news media
interest and a “huge” ground swell of public support, he [announced an
exploratory
committee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/10/08/us/citing-public-support-trump-forms-exploratory-committee-on-presidency.html)
to run for president in October 1999. He suggested that Oprah Winfrey
would be his vice president.

That campaign didn’t take off. But we know how this story goes. Mr.
Trump made it to the White House, where he has uprooted American
politics — and opened the door to the wide field of candidates who will
fight to challenge him in 2020. It starts now.
