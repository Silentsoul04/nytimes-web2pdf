Below are questions to help guide your discussions as you read the book
over the next month. You can also submit your own questions for Jauhar
on our
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/groups/NowReadThisBookClub}{Facebook
page}, which he will answer on the NewsHour broadcast at the end of the
month. Spoiler alert on questions further down.

1. Why do you think Jauhar opened ``Heart'' with his perspective as a
patient, not as a doctor?

2. Jauhar says the heart became his obsession because of his family
history. Do you have relatable history in your own family?

3. The heart is the only organ that can move itself. What else is unique
about it?

4. Jauhar takes us through many heart studies and experiments that help
us understand how the organ works and how to fix it. Which of these
surprised you?

5. ``Heart'' tells us that you can actually die of a broken heart. How
does this happen?

6. Why do you think the heart became such a powerful metaphor for
romantic love, and for the soul?

7. The book includes many diagrams, photos and works of visual art
depicting the heart. Which did you find most useful or illuminating?

8. How do you feel about all of the animal testing done so humans can
learn about the heart and how it can fail?

9. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women. Why?

10. How does understanding the human heart help us better understand
ourselves as a species?

11. Jauhar describes the devices invented to treat heart disease, but
argues we are better off focusing on how we live. Do you agree?

12. The end of the book returns to Jauhar's family history with heart
disease. What did you learn about your own?

13. How will this book change how you live, if at all?
