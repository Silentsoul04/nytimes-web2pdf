Kamala Harris’s new memoir, “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,”
begins with a prologue set on Nov. 8, 2016, the night Harris was elected
a United States senator from California. The rest of the book addresses
the urgent political matters that have risen in the wake of that night,
but it also goes back to cover, among other things, Harris’s tenure as
California’s attorney general and her childhood in Oakland as the
daughter of immigrant parents: her father an economist from Jamaica and
her mother a cancer researcher from India. Though rumors of Harris
[gearing up for a presidential run
in 2020](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/12/us/politics/kamala-harris-democrats.html)
are becoming noisier by the minute (when [Stephen Colbert asked her on
Thursday](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/colbertlateshow/videos/374316359794531/)
if she would run, Harris coyly said, “I might”), she told me the memoir
is not meant to help lay the groundwork for [such a
campaign](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/29/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-kamala-elizabeth-warren.html).
“At the expense of sounding immodest,” she said, the book is “really
about the work I’ve done already that’s had national impact, and what I
hope to come from it.” Below, Harris talks about how she connects
personal experiences to her professional life, the breakneck speed of
the news cycle, the inspiration she takes from Bob Marley and more.

**When did you first get the idea to write this book?**

Election night, 2016. I sat on our couch at home after my night at the
election party with a family-size bag of Doritos, which I ate by myself,
one after the other, in awe and in shock about what I was watching on
TV. It was a night that was bittersweet for my campaign, for all of us.
None of us saw it coming.

After that night, I really felt a more urgent need to tell people what
we’re fighting for. When we talk about a fight, it’s born out of
optimism; and it’s not a fight against something, but it’s a fight for
something. It was that emotion that led me to speak the words I spoke
that night, about the need to fight; and that, by extension, led to the
book.

**What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?**

I was raised to do things, not to talk about myself or my feelings — or
frankly, even to look back. It was an effort to talk about my feelings
as things were happening. It was difficult. I talk about a lot that’s
really personal, and that I had not talked about in public. That was a
component of it that made me feel very vulnerable. But I felt it was
important to talk about for a couple of reasons. One, I’m really clear
in my mind that there are a lot of experiences I’ve had, emotional
experiences and responses, that are in common with a lot of people. But
more important, I wanted to give context to the work I’ve done. Almost
everything I’ve done professionally has been motivated by some
experience I’ve been exposed to.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The process of writing the book required me to really explore what I was
feeling at those moments. For example, the whole chapter that we named
“Underwater” — I had never talked about the fact that our mother
bought our first house when I was a teenager. I’ll never forget, when my
mother came back and said, “This is going to be our home.” The pictures
and the excitement she had, and the excitement we then had. I connected
that emotion to what it meant for all those homeowners who either had
that hope when they engaged in what ended up being a fraudulent mortgage
scheme or when they lost their homes. Knowing what that meant, when I’m
sitting across the table from executives at the biggest banks in the
country and feeling a sense of responsibility, that this wasn’t simply a
financial transaction. When your mother comes home with the picture of
the first home you’re ever going to have, it’s not like someone waving
around a piece of paper with a stock portfolio. It’s a whole other
thing.

**In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out
to write?**

Hopefully the book takes the reader on a journey down memory lane about
the last 12 months and how much happened. Everything is happening so
rapidly right now that a lot of people tend to forget what just happened
six months ago, when the thing that happened six months ago was
earth-shattering. There’s a lot in the book that was happening in real
time; so literally as I’m writing it, it’s happening. The book was due
and then the Brett Kavanaugh hearings happened, and so how do I handle
that? It was important to me to at least try to talk about that, knowing
that people will be reading about it months after it
happened.

**Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and
your work?**

Certainly my mother. She was incredibly creative, as a scientist. But
when I think about performers: Bob Marley. I first started listening to
him when I was a child. My father had an incredible jazz collection but
also a lot of Marley. I saw him in concert at the Greek Theater in
Berkeley. I was hooked.

Jamaica’s history is actually not that well known in the context of the
issues we deal with in the United States. But Jamaica grappled with
vicious slavery for generations, and then colonists, with a very strong
sense of identity in terms of what it meant to be particularly a black
Jamaican. A lot of his music was about what it means to fight for the
people. He was a very spiritual person also. I’m very spiritual. I don’t
talk a lot about it, but the idea that there is a higher being and that
we should be motivated by love of one another — that also requires us to
fight.

**Persuade someone to read “The Truths We Hold” in 50 words or less.**

I hope you’ll walk away renewing your faith in the nobility and
importance of public service, and convinced that we are a country that
was founded on noble ideals. Imperfect though we may be, what makes us
strong, and special, is that we’ve always aspired to reach those ideals.
