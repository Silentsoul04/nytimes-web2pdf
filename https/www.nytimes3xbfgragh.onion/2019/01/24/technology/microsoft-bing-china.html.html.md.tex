SEATTLE --- Microsoft said its Bing search page was back online in China
after being inaccessible for part of this week. It appeared
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/23/business/china-microsoft-bing.html}{to
have been blocked} by government censors.

Users in parts of China were unable to access Bing on Wednesday and
Thursday, and it remained unclear what led to the shutdown.

While Bing is not widely used in China, it has been one of the few
remaining portals to the broader internet as the government isolates
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/06/technology/china-generation-blocked-internet.html?module=inline}{China's
internet from the rest of the world}. Bing has survived in part because
Microsoft has worked to follow the government's censorship practices
around political topics. It has also cooperated with the government in
developing other parts of its business, such as working with a state-run
firm that supplies the military to produce a government-approved version
of its Windows 10 software.

``There are times when there are disagreements, there are times when
there are difficult negotiations with the Chinese government, and we're
still waiting to find out what this situation is about,'' Brad Smith,
Microsoft's president,
\href{https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/5993355739001/\#sp=show-clips}{said
in an interview with Fox Business Network} at the World Economic Forum
in Davos, Switzerland.

Mr. Smith acknowledged that Microsoft had fewer legal rights in China
than in other countries.

``There are certain principles that we think it's important to stand up
for,'' he said, ``and we'll go at times into the negotiating room and
the negotiations are sometimes pretty darn direct.''

The company is still investigating the shutdown, he said.
