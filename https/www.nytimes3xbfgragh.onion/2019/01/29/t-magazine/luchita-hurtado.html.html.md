On a cloudless afternoon in October, I meet the artist Luchita Hurtado,
98, in her Santa Monica home studio — a sand-colored three-story
building a 20-minute walk from the Pacific Ocean. Inside, her riotously
colorful paintings — in which genderless figures transform into trees —
animate the walls of her compact 145-square-foot studio, interspersed
with dried leaves and a framed rare butterfly. **** She offers me a bowl
of wrinkled red jujubes, then settles into a padded **** arm chair in
the middle of her tchotchke-filled **** living room and regales me with
stories. She recounts **** searching for Olmec colossal heads from a
two-seater plane above San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán; camping at the Lascaux
Cave in southern France before the site closed permanently to the public
in 1963; posing for Man Ray, and forging friendships with Frida Kahlo,
Isamu Noguchi and Leonora Carrington.

Last summer, Hurtado’s lush paintings, rich with cosmic motifs and
geometric abstractions, captivated visitors of the Hammer Museum’s
“[Made in
L.A. 2018](https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2018/made-in-la-2018/)”
show. Exhibited sporadically over the course of her life, and almost
exclusively in group shows, Hurtado has recently experienced a rise to
fame that has been thrilling to witness — albeit maddening in its
lateness. Later this month, [Hauser &
Wirth](https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/23119-luchita-hurtado-dark-years)
will dedicate three floors of its gallery on New York’s Upper East Side
to her **** charged figurative drawings from the ’40s and ’50s; in May,
the [Serpentine Sackler Gallery](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/)
in London will mount a **** solo exhibition that spans seven decades of
her work; and in 2020, the year she turns 100, Hurtado’s first
international retrospective will debut at the [Museo
Tamayo](http://museotamayo.org/) in Mexico City and then travel to a
series of art institutions in the United
States.

In her **** expansive oil paintings, ink-based drawings, fabric collages
and patterned garments, Hurtado explores what she sees as the
interconnectedness of all beings. Her paintings from the ’70s — sinuous
bodies that morph into mountains, bare nipples that juxtapose spiky
leaves, bulbous fruits that echo curving belly shapes — represent women
as sacred beings, powerful subjects of their own lives. Hurtado also
incorporated womb imagery into her work before the feminist art movement
made popular the same subject matter in the late ’70s.

Born in the seaside town of Maiquetía, Venezuela, in 1920, Hurtado
migrated to New York at age 8. At the then-all-girls high school
Washington Irving, she studied fine art and developed a keen interest in
anti-fascist political movements. After graduating, she volunteered at
the Spanish-language newspaper La Prensa and met her first husband, a
Chilean journalist twice her age. When he abandoned her and their infant
son, she supported herself by creating imaginative installations for
Lord & Taylor and fashion illustrations for Vogue — at night, she
created totemic figure drawings with watercolor and crayon*.* **** (In
1946, at age 26, she met and married the Austrian-Mexican painter
Wolfgang Paalen, moving with her two sons to join him in Mexico City.)

“Luchita has always had this very fluid identity, which makes her art so
21st century,” says the curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, who is organizing
her retrospective in London. “We have to contextualize her clearly with
the historic avant-garde, because she is a contemporary of Frida Kahlo,
she knew Diego Rivera and was married to Wolfgang Paalen, a key figure
of surrealism — and she is a key figure of spiritual surrealism, with a
connection to pre-Columbian art, but we cannot lock her in that.”
Hurtado’s work blurs the lines between micro- and macroscopic worlds;
she was at the forefront of not just spiritual surrealism, but also the
environmental and feminist art movements. As Obrist puts it, “she
navigated a century of different contexts and played an important role
in all of those.”

![<span class="css-1l9o2ey e13ogyst0" data-aria-hidden="true">“Life
changes you,” says Hurtado, shown here in a photograph taken by her son
Matt Mullican in 1973. “I’ve been many persons, but each day, I’m
completely different.” During this period, Hurtado and her husband Lee
Mullican used the Barker Hangar at the Santa Monica airport as their
studio. The following year, the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles hosted
her first solo exhibition, including paintings that melded English and
Spanish
words.</span><span class="css-1nlbvxy e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Matt

Hurtado possesses the grace of someone who has not spent her **** life
promoting her art, but quietly and diligently producing it — at her
kitchen table, in backyards and closets and, at one point, in a
stand-alone studio in the Santa Monica Canyon (by 1951, she had
relocated to Los Angeles). “I never stopped drawing, looking, living,”
she tells me. “It’s all the same thing, all solving your own life.” Yet
in the ’70s — when she was producing pioneering **** fabric collages
punctuated with words including “you” and “womb” — she wrote to Noguchi
to request professional favors for her third husband, the artist Lee
Mullican, but rarely, if ever, did she tell him about her own practice.
When asked why she didn’t openly share her paintings with artist
friends, she says, “I always felt shy of it. I didn’t feel comfortable
with people looking at my work.” She adds, too, that “there was a time
when women really didn’t show their work.”

Later in the afternoon, we zip across town to a nondescript brick
warehouse in Los Angeles’s West Adams neighborhood — the same building
where, nearly four years ago, her studio director, Ryan Good, ****
stumbled on nearly 1,200 works **** that were undated, many signed with
the initials “LH.” While family and close friends were aware that
Hurtado painted, her cross-disciplinary practice, distinct visual
vernacular and prolific output remained largely unknown. “We didn’t know
the extent of it,” says Good, while leafing through a photo album. “I
knew that Luchita had made some paintings, but it was a different thing
to look at her entire career.” He continues, “we know Isamu Noguchi and
Sam Francis have jewelry she made, that Agnes Martin has clothes Luchita
made and Gordon Onslow-Ford has some things, but it doesn’t seem like
she gave other work away to the prominent artists she
knew.”

In preparation for her upcoming shows, Hurtado’s studio registrar, Cole
Root, has been sifting through photographs — self-portraits, family
travel shots, abstract shadow studies — looking for clues about
paintings that might have been sold or given to friends. “When I started
there was no archive whatsoever,” says Root. “We’ve gone from a casual
pace to moving at the speed of light.”

Part of the challenge in organizing Hurtado's archive is that she moved
frequently throughout her life — early works from New York City and
Mexico City, for instance, are mostly lost — and she doesn’t remember
many of the pieces herself. “Some things survived, some things didn’t,”
says Hurtado, “I’ve gotten use to loss.” Also, few of her works have
ever been publicly exhibited. “Women artists have not had the visibility
they should have and we need to protest, systematically, against
forgetting — through books and exhibitions,” Obrist says. The exhibition
at the Serpentine will be **** animated by what he calls “decisive
moments or epiphanies” throughout Hurtado’s life.

“I remember my childhood more and more,” Hurtado tells me, tucking a
tortoiseshell comb into her hair, which she had cut short herself the
day before. She shares memories from Venezuela — hiding under fan-shaped
leaves, watching crabs scuttle across the beach, devouring mangoes in a
cool stream. Lately, when she wakes, she sees a vision of a pink ceiling
floating above her. I imagine the series of paintings she created in
1975 in which bright-white squares are framed by mesmerizing planes of
blue, goldenrod and fiery red — intended to draw moths to an illusory
light, they give off a sense of ascension and expansion. “I’ve concluded
that I’m going somewhere,” she tells me. “It’s not death; it’s a border
that we cross. I don’t think I’ll be able to come back and tell you, but
if I can, I’ll find a way. If you suddenly see a pink ceiling, that’s
me.”

“Luchita Hurtado. Dark Years” is on view from Jan. 31 – April 6, 2019,
at Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, New York,
