AMERICAN SPY  
Lauren Wilkinson

One of the enduring pleasures of genre fiction is the occasional
appearance of a novel that does more than it says on the tin: a murder
mystery that offers genuine social insight, for example, or a thriller
that informs as well as entertains. This happens less often than you’d
think. More usual is the genre novel offered by a literary heavyweight
self-consciously paddling in shallow waters, doing the genre a favor by
splashing about in it. They might imagine their heft is adding sparkle
to the waves, but all too often there is, as Gertrude Stein said, “no
there there.” Just a few borrowed accessories, and a misguided sense of
entitlement.

It’s a relief, then, that Lauren Wilkinson’s “American Spy,” while
embracing ambitions and concerns that don’t always figure highly in the
spy genre, is first and foremost a thriller. Its trigger sends us
straight into plot: Marie Mitchell, a young black woman, is confronted
in her home one night by an intruder. Dispatching him without undue
difficulty, she flees the United States with her 4-year-old twin sons,
and then — hiding out at her mother’s home in Martinique — sets about
unraveling the complicated back story that produced her present (which,
in the novel’s reality, is 1992).

The key to her current situation turns out to be her role, in the 1980s,
as an F.B.I. intelligence agent. “Recruiting and running informants was
about cultivating their trust,” Marie tells us. “To do that I found it
worked best to lie frequently to them.” But like any agent in the field,
she’s more lied to than lying: Recruited to an overseas operation, she
finds herself the bait in a honey trap intended to remove the
charismatic, popular leader of the newborn Burkina Faso, and soon
realizes that the United States is interfering in another country’s
democratic processes for its own
advantage.

Plenty to enjoy on its own terms, then, as a slick, well-observed
thriller, but what adds depth are the perspectives offered by the
central character. As a black woman, Marie is undervalued twice over in
the [boys’ club atmosphere of the
F.B.I.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/23/us/politics/fbi-academy-women-discrimination.html)
of the 1980s. Spying is in her blood — her grandmother, fair-skinned
enough to pass for white, “moved in and out of the New York places where
Negroes were *interdits*, gathering her intelligence on the world that
white people inhabited” — but her career choice remains morally
problematic: Her mentor in the F.B.I. had been “one of a small handful
of black special agents hired under J. Edgar Hoover’s tenure … used
almost exclusively to undermine civil rights activists.” Her gender,
too, puts barriers in her way. On being told, “We give female officers a
hard time … We hold women to an unfair double standard,” she says,
“Hearing him explain it in theoretical terms when I’d lived it caused
me a specific type of maddening anger.”

\[ *[A Times national security reporter writes about “that time the
C.I.A. tried to recruit
me.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/14/insider/are-spies-like-us-a-national-security-reporter-says-yes-and-no.html)*
\]

More controversial, perhaps, is Marie’s relationship with the
revolutionary leader she is helping undermine. The novel is “inspired by
true events,” and the man in question — with whom she falls in love, and
who fathers her children — is [Thomas
Sankara](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1989/11/01/world/a-west-african-land-s-new-name-brings-it-little-relief-from-old-troubles.html),
often referred to as “Africa’s Che Guevara.” It’s not unusual for a
real-life figure like this to appear in fiction, but it might be pushing
at the bounds of propriety to press-gang him into parenthood. Then
again, challenging boundaries is what brave fiction does, and Wilkinson
proves confident enough to carry it off. For a debut novel it’s
remarkably assured, earning its genre stripes with panache, and
addressing thought-provoking issues along the way.
