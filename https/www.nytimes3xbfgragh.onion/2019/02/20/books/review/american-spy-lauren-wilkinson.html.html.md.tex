AMERICAN SPY\\
Lauren Wilkinson

One of the enduring pleasures of genre fiction is the occasional
appearance of a novel that does more than it says on the tin: a murder
mystery that offers genuine social insight, for example, or a thriller
that informs as well as entertains. This happens less often than you'd
think. More usual is the genre novel offered by a literary heavyweight
self-consciously paddling in shallow waters, doing the genre a favor by
splashing about in it. They might imagine their heft is adding sparkle
to the waves, but all too often there is, as Gertrude Stein said, ``no
there there.'' Just a few borrowed accessories, and a misguided sense of
entitlement.

It's a relief, then, that Lauren Wilkinson's ``American Spy,'' while
embracing ambitions and concerns that don't always figure highly in the
spy genre, is first and foremost a thriller. Its trigger sends us
straight into plot: Marie Mitchell, a young black woman, is confronted
in her home one night by an intruder. Dispatching him without undue
difficulty, she flees the United States with her 4-year-old twin sons,
and then --- hiding out at her mother's home in Martinique --- sets
about unraveling the complicated back story that produced her present
(which, in the novel's reality, is 1992).

The key to her current situation turns out to be her role, in the 1980s,
as an F.B.I. intelligence agent. ``Recruiting and running informants was
about cultivating their trust,'' Marie tells us. ``To do that I found it
worked best to lie frequently to them.'' But like any agent in the
field, she's more lied to than lying: Recruited to an overseas
operation, she finds herself the bait in a honey trap intended to remove
the charismatic, popular leader of the newborn Burkina Faso, and soon
realizes that the United States is interfering in another country's
democratic processes for its own advantage.

Plenty to enjoy on its own terms, then, as a slick, well-observed
thriller, but what adds depth are the perspectives offered by the
central character. As a black woman, Marie is undervalued twice over in
the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/23/us/politics/fbi-academy-women-discrimination.html}{boys'
club atmosphere of the F.B.I.} of the 1980s. Spying is in her blood ---
her grandmother, fair-skinned enough to pass for white, ``moved in and
out of the New York places where Negroes were \emph{interdits},
gathering her intelligence on the world that white people inhabited''
--- but her career choice remains morally problematic: Her mentor in the
F.B.I. had been ``one of a small handful of black special agents hired
under J. Edgar Hoover's tenure \ldots{} used almost exclusively to
undermine civil rights activists.'' Her gender, too, puts barriers in
her way. On being told, ``We give female officers a hard time \ldots{}
We hold women to an unfair double standard,'' she says, ``Hearing him
explain it in theoretical terms when I'd lived it caused me a specific
type of maddening anger.''

More controversial, perhaps, is Marie's relationship with the
revolutionary leader she is helping undermine. The novel is ``inspired
by true events,'' and the man in question --- with whom she falls in
love, and who fathers her children --- is

Sankara}, often referred to as ``Africa's Che Guevara.'' It's not
unusual for a real-life figure like this to appear in fiction, but it
might be pushing at the bounds of propriety to press-gang him into
parenthood. Then again, challenging boundaries is what brave fiction
does, and Wilkinson proves confident enough to carry it off. For a debut
novel it's remarkably assured, earning its genre stripes with panache,
and addressing thought-provoking issues along the way.
