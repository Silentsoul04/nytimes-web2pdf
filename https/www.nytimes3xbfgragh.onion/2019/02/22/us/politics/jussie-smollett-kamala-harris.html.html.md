Several Democratic presidential candidates spoke up when the actor
Jussie Smollett [described a hateful
attack](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/29/arts/television/empire-jussie-smollett-attacked.html)
based on his race and sexual orientation in January.

Not as many have spoken up since the police said the assault had been
staged.

Mr. Smollett [surrendered to face a felony
charge](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/21/arts/jussie-smollett-empire-fox.html)
of filing a false police report on Thursday, after the police in Chicago
said he hired two brothers for the assault. Mr. Smollett denies the
accusation, and his legal team said Thursday that he “feels betrayed by
a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly
to sentencing.”

*\[Latest update —* [*For Jussie Smollett, how a life of arts and
activism is
upended*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/23/us/jussie-smollett.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

At first, several Democratic presidential candidates expressed support
for Mr. Smollett, who stars on the show “Empire.” Senators Kamala Harris
and Cory Booker both called the reported assault a “modern day
lynching,” comments that Republicans are now criticizing them for.

In [a Facebook post on
Thursday](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/KamalaHarris/posts/10157494880507923),
Ms. Harris said she was “sad, frustrated and disappointed” by the
reports about Mr. Smollett. But other candidates have not publicly
revisited their initial views of the case.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Trump, who initially told reporters the alleged attack was
“horrible,” criticized Mr. Smollett on Twitter on Thursday for what he
called “racist and dangerous comments.”

Here are the responses — and lack thereof — of Democratic presidential
contenders on social media. Several candidates have not said anything.

## Updated statements on Thursday

Two candidates who made statements in January offered new thoughts on
Thursday: Ms. Harris and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[On
Jan. 29](https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1090361495119187969),
Ms. Harris called Mr. Smollett “one of the kindest, most gentle human
beings I know.”

But in [her Facebook post on
Thursday](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/KamalaHarris/posts/10157494880507923),
she said a false claim to the police “not only diverts resources away
from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other
victims of crime to come forward.” She then pivoted to a discussion of
hate crimes, citing F.B.I. statistics showing a 17 percent increase last
year.

“Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from that
truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and
downplay the very real problems that we must address,” she said.

On Jan. 29, Ms. Gabbard called the described assault “heartbreaking.”

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

On Thursday, she said in a series of tweets that, if guilty, Mr.
Smollett “needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law to send a
strong message to any potential future ‘hoaxers.’”

## Spoke out in January but not after charges were filed

Mr. Booker, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand and Joseph R. Biden Jr. —
who is thought to be considering a presidential run but has not
announced one — spoke up on Jan. 29 but have not put out new statements.

Mr. Booker used the alleged assault to promote an anti-lynching bill. He
[said this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIsU4uyGyKE) he would
withhold further comment “until all of the information actually comes
out from on-the-record sources”; a spokesman did not immediately respond
to a message on Thursday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary and mayor of San Antonio, was
the only candidate to hedge his statement on Jan. 29, prefacing it with
“If the reports of Jussie Smollett’s attack last night are true.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But later in the day he tweeted more definitively about Mr. Smollett.
“In 2019, he was violently attacked because of his race and sexual
orientation,” he wrote. A spokeswoman said Thursday that Mr. Castro had
no new comment.

Initially, Ms. Gillibrand, a New York senator, called the reported
assault “a sickening and outrageous attack” and said she was “praying
for Jussie and his family.” She [told CNN this
week](https://twitter.com/DJJudd/status/1097723633605267456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1097723633605267456&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redstate.com%2Fsister-toldjah%2F2019%2F02%2F21%2Fpass-the-ranch-gillibrand-statement-jussie-worst-yet%2F)
she would “wait to find out the facts before I make another statement”;
a spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a message on Thursday.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

Mr. Biden, the former vice president, said “we are with you, Jussie”
after the reported attack. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a
message on Thursday.
