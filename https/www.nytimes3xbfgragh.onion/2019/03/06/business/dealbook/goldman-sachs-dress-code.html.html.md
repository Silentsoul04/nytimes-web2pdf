For decades, Goldman Sachs’s bankers have flown across the world
pitching prospective clients and drawing up multibillion-dollar deals in
expensive suits, ties and pantsuits.

Those deal makers can now plan on dressing down — at least a little bit.

Goldman Sachs told its employees on Tuesday that it planned to relax its
dress code. In an internal memorandum, executives said they were
adopting a “flexible” dress code in keeping with the times.

It’s the latest attempt by a Wall Street firm to cater to the younger
workers whom the industry eagerly tries to recruit. A top competitor,
JPMorgan Chase, [took the leap into business
casual](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/04/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-chase-embraces-business-casual.html?dlbk)
nearly three years ago, making a more informal look the default dress
code.

The new sartorial rules are also a concession to the Silicon Valley
giants that Goldman and other banks have assiduously courted, companies
where the norm is jeans and [wool
sneakers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/11/technology/allbird-shoes-silicon-valley.html?dlbk),
not bespoke suits and Gucci loafers. (Deal makers have been known to don
hoodies to win business from the likes of Facebook.)

“We want all of our clients to feel comfortable with and confident in
our team, so please dress in a manner that is consistent with your
clients’ expectations,” Goldman executives said in the memo.

David M. Solomon, Goldman’s chief, has himself drawn attention for his
seemingly unbankerlike pursuits, including his side hustle as a D.J.,
going by the name of D-Sol, whose first single [cracked the Billboard
Top 100
charts](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-dj-d-sol-billboard-charts-fleetwood-mac-2018-7-1027408060?dlbk).
And, like his counterpart at JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, Mr. Solomon has been
known to go tieless for public occasions.

But Wall Street’s efforts to embrace casual dress have been met,
unsurprisingly, with caution. Denim remains a relative rarity among
bankers based beyond the West Coast, perhaps for fear of being seen by
their bosses as slacking off.

Indeed, Mr. Solomon and his lieutenants urged some restraint.

“Of course, casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every
interaction,” they wrote in the memo. “We trust you will consistently
exercise good judgment in this regard.”
