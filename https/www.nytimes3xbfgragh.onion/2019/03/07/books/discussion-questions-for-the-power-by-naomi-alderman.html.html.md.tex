on our Google form

Alderman will answer reader questions on the NewsHour broadcast at the
end of the month.

*Spoiler alert on questions further down.*

1. Before starting ``The Power,'' what assumptions do you have about a
book on women who develop superpowers?

2. The book's epigraph is a quote from the Bible, 1 Samuel 8, about how
Samuel cautions people against wanting a king, but they do not listen.
What is the significance of this passage?

3. From the beginning of ``The Power,'' the reader discovers that it is
a book-within-a-book. What did you make of the opening correspondence
between Naomi and Neil?

4. ``The shape of power is always the same; it is the shape of a tree,''
Alderman writes on page 3. ``Root to tip, central trunk branching and
re-branching, spreading wider in ever-thinner, searching fingers.'' What
does she mean by this? How does the book's cover play off this imagery?

5. Why do you think Alderman chose the ability to conduct electricity
and send jolts as women's newfound superpower?

6. The novel-within-a-novel's structure is divided into chapters about
different people affected by ``the power'': Roxy, Allie, Tunde, Margot
and more. To which story line did you feel most attached, and why?

7. The novel's characters include a politician, a journalist, a
religious figure and a member of an organized crime family. How does
Alderman use these characters to explore the theme of power?

8. What is the significance of the illustrations Alderman includes?

9. As more and more women gain ``the power'' in the book, how does the
global order shift? How does the change shift your own perspective of
``the power''?

10. In The New York Times Book Review, speculative fiction writer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/25/books/review/naomi-alderman-power.html?rref=collection\%2Fspotlightcollection\%2Fnow-read-this\&action=click\&contentCollection=books\&region=rank\&module=package\&version=highlights\&contentPlacement=2\&pgtype=collection}{Amar
El-Mohtar writes that the book} explores ``how power corrupts everyone:
those new to it, and those resisting its loss.'' How does it corrupt
those new to it?

11. On page 135, Alderman includes archival documents that explain the
electrostatic power's origins and potential cure. Were these convincing
to you?

12. On page 154, she excerpts discussions from an online forum
discussing Mother Eve. Did this feel relevant to today's online
communities, and if so, how?

13. At several points in the book, Alderman writes that women are using
the power in unsettling ways simply ``because they can.'' Do you believe
this is true of human nature?

14. Near the end of the book, the voice tells Allie that the questions
she's asking are the mistake. The voice says everything is more
complicated than about Adam vs. Eve, who's good or who's bad, and the
powerful vs. the powerless. Do you agree?

15. At the end of the novel, the correspondence between Naomi and Neil
reappears. What do their letters tell us about the future the world is
set in? What does it show us about the present we're living in?

16. How did this book make you think differently about gender, or about
power? Was it unsettling to you?
