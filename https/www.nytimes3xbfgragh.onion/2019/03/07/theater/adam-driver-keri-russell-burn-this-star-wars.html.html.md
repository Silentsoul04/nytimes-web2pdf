Nine floors above Times Square, Adam Driver hurtled through a door — or
what would become a door once the set was fully built — thundering about
the traffic, the parking, the trash. “This street’s dying of crotch
rot,” he bellowed.

“Do I know you?” Keri Russell asked coolly.

It was the second week of rehearsals for [Lanford
Wilson’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/03/25/theater/lanford-wilson-pulitzer-prize-winning-playwright-dies-at-73.html)
[“Burn This,”](http://www.thehudsonbroadway.com/whatson/burn-this/) a
combustible 1987 play about the unlikely romance between Anna (Ms.
Russell), a serious-minded choreographer, and Pale (Mr. Driver), a
hothead restaurant manager. Anna has a gentlemanly boyfriend, Burton.
Pale has a wife, two kids and a line of cocaine where his superego
should be. If you tried to match them on Tinder, your phone might
explode. Still, anguish and pheromones jolt them into love or lust or
something more relentless.

“It’s a weird love story,” Ms. Russell said once rehearsal had paused.
“It’s a unique one. It’s a good one.” And it’s one that collides two
masterly, if hugely dissimilar actors — Mr. Driver, 35, who brings a
Method hyperintensity to every project, even the brash traumedy “Girls,”
and Ms. Russell, 42, a former teen star who perfected steely interiority
on the espionage drama “The Americans.”

“Burn This,” which begins previews at the Hudson Theater on March 15,
was originally announced with Jake Gyllenhaal attached. (Other famous
Pales: [John
Malkovich](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1987/10/15/theater/stage-burn-this-by-wilson.html),
[Edward
Norton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/09/20/movies/theater-review-revival-works-a-transformation.html).)
After some [scheduling
zigzags](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/22/theater/jake-gyllenhaal-broadway-burn-this.html),
[Mr.
Driver](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/28/movies/adam-driver-interview-paterson-silence.html)
replaced him. [Ms.
Russell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/20/arts/television/keri-russell-discusses-the-americans-her-pregnancy-and-life-at-40.html)
joined the director Michael Mayer’s production last summer, just after
she signed on for “Star Wars: Episode IX,” the ultrasecret final
installment of the current saga in which Mr. Driver plays the angsty
villain Kylo Ren. Whom does Ms. Russell play in “Star Wars”? She starred
as a superspy for six seasons. Good luck getting her to talk.

Mr. Driver, a recent Oscar nominee for
“[BlacKkKlansman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/09/movies/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee.html),”
enrolled at Juilliard after a stint in the Marines and spent his
post-grad years in the theater. But “Burn This” is his first play since
he began shooting “Girls” in 2013. Ms. Russell was a Mouseketeer and
then a fickle college student in
[“Felicity.”](https://abc.go.com/shows/felicity) She has appeared in
only one other play, Neil LaBute’s [“Fat
Pig”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/12/16/theater/reviews/shes-fat-hes-a-man-can-they-find-love.html)
in 2004. Until her partner and “The Americans” co-star, [Matthew
Rhys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/01/22/theater/matthew-rhys-in-look-back-in-anger-on-new-york-stage.html),
talked her into a reading of “Burn This,” she hadn’t wanted to do
another
one.

Ms. Russell and Mr. Driver know each other through Mr. Rhys, who
appeared with Mr. Driver in the moody 2012 revival of [“Look Back in
Anger.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/02/03/theater/reviews/look-back-in-anger-starring-matthew-rhys.html)
The two couples (Mr. Driver is married to the actress Joanne Tucker)
live just down the street from each other in Brooklyn Heights and are
friendly. Which probably explains why, during a brief photo shoot that
morning, Mr. Driver messed with Ms. Russell’s boot when he was meant to
lie reverently at her feet and why she suffocated him with her shirt
just when he was looking especially sultry. It can be hard to smolder at
10 a.m.

Once they’d collected themselves, they sat down on the “Burn This” set
to discuss big feelings, fierce chemistry and whether or not they cross
lightsabers. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Why did you want to work on “Burn This”?**  

**ADAM DRIVER** If I’m going to do a play, I like the idea of it being
something contemporary, something American, kind of at a fever pitch. I
knew this play from before, from Juilliard. I had played Pale, which is
embarrassing, a kid in a costume at 23, being like, “I know what I’m
talking about\!” I had no idea.

**KERI RUSSELL** I hadn’t been actively searching to do a play. But I
thought, I guess I’ll do the reading. And then it just felt like such an
escape. We’re so inundated with all of this political stuff and
obviously it’s very important. But it felt so nice to read something
just about feelings. And it touched me. Everyone talks about the
fireworks of Pale and how crazy he is. But there’s something about the
relationship that really moved me. I cried.

**DRIVER** These people need to live gigantic lives in order to feel
something. These people want to feel something big. We’re not often
given that space to feel. Or probably we are, but we don’t take it.
We’re too distracted by everything else.

**RUSSELL** [Tanya Berezin](http://www.tanyaberezin.com/), she holds the
rights to “Burn This.” Before we started, she came in and said Lanford’s
characters need everything about their lives to feel humongous. They
wanted to do the best possible art, they wanted to fall in love in the
best possible way. Everything had to mean something and it had to be
huge.

And you sort of go, ‘Well, I did want to do that, but I guess I needed
to make money, too.” Or, “I did really like that guy, but he was a lot
of work.” Life moves in.

**These characters are in so much pain. What’s the experience of
rehearsing that kind of pain?**

**DRIVER** The rehearsals are six hours long. You get in that mind-set
for six hours and you go home, you’re still pumping, and it’s hard to
not make everything urgent. My dog will do something pretty mundane and
my first impulse will be like, “WHAT THE — ” \[The rest of Mr. Driver’s
sentence was too colorful for publication.\] I’m not good at letting
things go. Other people are and I envy that. I’m always working. It’s
always in the back of my mind. There’s a benefit to constantly asking
yourself questions about it. The disadvantage is you drive yourself
insane.

**In the play, Anna says that she and Pale are apples and oranges. I’m
not sure they’re both even fruit. What attracts them to each other?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**RUSSELL** Pale’s feelings are so loud and he’s not embarrassed by
them, he’s not ashamed of them. I know a few people like that and
they’re so fun to be around. Pale, he’s so alive. Burton is a great
guy. He’s rich and he’s polite and he’s nice. But he doesn’t have the
stuff, the excitement. That’s what Anna wants desperately.

**DRIVER** I think there’s hopefully a physical attraction, though ——

**RUSSELL** I’m not going to do that.

**This play only works if we feel that connection, pheromones that hit
the back row. How do you find that?**

**DRIVER** I don’t know if that’s something we really work on. I feel
like either it’s there ——

**RUSSELL** Or it’s not.

**DRIVER** We don’t sit around and consciously work on chemistry. We
have such affection for each other, but that doesn’t really matter. It’s
what the play is.

**RUSSELL** But when someone is truly vulnerable in front of you,
there’s this immediate connection, an instant intimacy. This crazy
first moment where they meet, it’s so intimate, so raw. There’s
definitely an animal thing in this connection. But I don’t know that you
can work on it.

**Do you think most people want what these people want, to feel
overwhelmed by emotion, attraction?**

**RUSSELL** Of course\! Yes\! That’s what everyone wants. Although these
days all I want is a hotel room. Alone. Someone to connect with, who
cares about that? I want room service.
\[Laughs.\]

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**RUSSELL** \[deadpan\] We are doing it onstage. Twice.

choreographer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/15/theater/need-to-fake-an-orgasm-theres-an-intimacy-choreographer-for-that.html)?**

**RUSSELL** No, there’s nothing too crazytown. It’s pretty tame. I think
we’ve both done a lot worse. There was one Tuesday morning on “The
Americans,” 7 a.m., Staten Island, I show up and they were like, “This
is the threesome on the bed.” I said to the sweet little assistant
director, “I need a beer in my hand in the next 15 minutes or this is
not going to happen.”

**You have very different backgrounds. Keri, you’ve been working since
you were 15. Adam, you had formal training at one of the best
conservatories in the country. Do you feel like you approach acting
differently?**

**RUSSELL** I’m sure. My stage career is so limited and this is a new
crazy leap of faith. I was not going to do it and Matthew was like, “Do
it, do it. It’ll be fine.” I was like, will it? Knowing Adam a little
bit, his sensitivity, I thought, Oh, I could do this with him. Because
it’s not my world, it’s a different style altogether, which is very
daunting.

**DRIVER** But it *is* your world.

**RUSSELL** It’s not my experience. Right now, I’m losing about 15
pounds of weight every day. Sweat and
nerves.

**Why do theater at all? Theater is very exposing. It doesn’t really
pay. You don’t get to grow with characters as you did on your television
series**.

**RUSSELL** I don’t have an answer right now.

**DRIVER** Good, I’ll vamp. In theater, it’s different every night. The
audiences are different. I mean, I came from a theater background where
there’s always a new question to ask yourself. I got used to that. It
was hard to adjust to suddenly doing a TV show or a huge franchise.
That’s why I can’t watch anything I do. I know the potential of not
having a right answer, of not settling. In the theater you get to
explore it again tomorrow. Whereas in film, that’s it. Your mistakes,
that’s it.

**You’ve recently ended prestige series, “The Americans” and “Girls.”
Are you consciously trying to choose different projects and different
characters?**

**RUSSELL** I like what I like. Probably if something came across that
was like a 1980s spy I probably wouldn’t want to do it.

**DRIVER** You try to work with the good filmmakers if you can, then
just because they’re different people, the things you work on are
different. And you want to work with the best playwrights. But I don’t
sort of consciously think, O.K., now I have to do a
thing.
