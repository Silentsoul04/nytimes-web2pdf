Old}\label{in-los-angeles-an-eccentric-shrine-to-books-new-and-old}}

With Owl Bureau, Richard Christiansen, the founder of Chandelier
Creative, brings a host of rare (and some current) titles to Highland
Park.

The joy of printed books, according to Richard Christiansen, founder of
the ad agency \href{https://www.chandeliercreative.com/}{Chandelier
Creative}, ``is that you really feel as though you can wrap your arms
around craft and culture in the world --- to really appreciate not just
what's in those books, but the craft and skill that goes into making
them.'' He vividly recalls the transformative effect that Madonna's 1992
coffee table book, ``Sex,'' had on him as a teenager. Edited by Glenn
O'Brien and photographed by Steven Meisel --- ``amazing luminaries I had
no idea of at the time'' --- it offered him a glimpse outside his
sheltered upbringing in rural Australia. ``I remember thinking, oh my
god, I want to be able to create work like that. I want to be part of
that world.''

Fast forward to our current digital age, and Christiansen still believes
in the power of print. This week he opens his own bookstore, Owl Bureau,
in Highland Park, a northeast Los Angeles neighborhood not far from the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/14/t-magazine/los-angeles-dream-house-flamingo-estate.html}{hillside
home} he bought in 2013. On Figueroa Street, where trendy new coffee
shops have recently joined the longstanding mix of mom-and-pop
storefronts, it shares space with Chandelier Creative's Los Angeles
outpost inside a former pharmacy called Owl Drugs, which is still
complete with its original signage.

Inside, the Los Angeles-based designers Waka Waka and Machinehistories
have erected a curved wall of blond California wood where the books rest
on shelves and wooden pegs. Christiansen, with the Paris-based
architects
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/23/t-magazine/minimalism-design-studio-ko.html}{Studio
KO}, conceived of a fanciful shrine to print media, culminating in a
pair of doors ornately carved with reliefs of owls, cactuses and
bumblebees (the office is just on the other side). The inventory,
curated in collaboration with \href{https://www.mastbooks.com/}{Mast
Books}, is a mix of new titles in art, fashion, architecture and design,
plus 200 or so from Christiansen's personal collection. Madonna's
``Sex,'' is there, alongside other rare gems that include Herb Ritts's
``Notorious'' celebrity portraits and the kitsch catalog to Karl
Lagerfeld's 1991 Sotheby's auction of Memphis furniture.

Christiansen sees the space as a place to host book and magazine
launches, signings and readings, like an evening with the French
architectural photographer François Halard, who will be signing a few
rare publications at the shop's opening on Saturday. Owl Bureau will
also host an artist residency on site (the first artist will be ceramist
Alex Reed) and will eventually even serve coffee. For Christiansen, the
space also fulfills a personal need for a store he felt had been lacking
--- a place to buy a copy of French Vogue within a 45-minute drive from
his house.

As for the books he will be selling from his personal collection, he
says: ``I almost feel like they've been my best friends; I have turned
to them when I've needed inspiration, and when I've needed solace.'' But
he doesn't feel a shred of sadness about parting ways. ``Hopefully they
can end up in someone's hand who pores over every page like I did, and
does something great with where it takes them.''

\emph{Starting Monday, March 18, Owl Bureau will be open seven days a
week, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., at 5634 N. Figueroa Street, Los Angeles.}
