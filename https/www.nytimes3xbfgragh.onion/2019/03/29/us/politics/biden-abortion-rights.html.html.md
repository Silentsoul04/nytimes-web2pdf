It was a new era in Washington in 1981, and abortion rights activists
were terrified.

With an anti-abortion president, Ronald Reagan, in power and Republicans
controlling the Senate for the first time in decades, social
conservatives pushed for a constitutional amendment to allow individual
states to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that had made
abortion legal nationwide several years earlier.

The amendment — which the National Abortion Rights Action League called
“the most devastating attack yet on abortion rights” — cleared a key
hurdle in the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 1982. Support came not
only from Republicans but from a 39-year-old, second-term Democrat:
Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“I’m probably a victim, or a product, however you want to phrase it, of
my background,” Mr. Biden, a Roman Catholic, said at the time. The
decision, he said, was “the single most difficult vote I’ve cast as a
U.S. senator.”

The bill never made it to the full Senate, and when it came back up the
following year, Mr. Biden voted against it. His back-and-forth over
abortion would become a hallmark of his political career.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As Mr. Biden prepares for the possibility of a third presidential run,
women’s rights leaders and activists in both parties are recalling these
shifts on abortion, which are likely to draw fresh scrutiny in a
Democratic primary race where women are expected to make up a majority
of voters.

\[[*Sign up for our politics

*and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.*\]

Mr. Biden entered the Senate in 1973 as a 30-year-old practicing
Catholic who soon concluded that the Supreme Court went “too far” on
abortion rights in the Roe case. He told an interviewer the following
year that a woman shouldn’t have the “sole right to say what should
happen to her body.” By the time he left the vice president’s mansion in
early 2017, he was a 74-year-old who argued a far different view: that
government doesn’t have “a right to tell other people that women, they
can’t control their body,” as he put it in 2012.

Abortion has long been a difficult issue for Catholic Democrats and
leaders including former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, Senator Bob Casey
of Pennsylvania and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Many Catholic
Democrats in government have cited their faith in explaining their
personal opposition to abortion while taking stands to support abortion
rights — and, in some cases, also holding positions in favor of some
abortion restrictions. A Pew Research Center poll last fall showed
[Catholics<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

on whether abortion should be legal.

But some of Mr. Biden’s more moderate-to-conservative stances in his
legislative record are raising questions in the party about whether he
could win over an ascendant liberal wing eager to impose purity tests
around issues of race and gender in 2020.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Even before announcing a candidacy, Mr. Biden has started trying to
rebut those concerns, telling party officials in Delaware this month
that he has “the most progressive record” of anyone running for
president.

But the issue of abortion poses particularly challenging terrain for Mr.
Biden. Efforts to restrict access to abortion by the Trump
administration, and the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court,
have heightened concerns among many Democrats that federal protections
of abortion rights could be chipped away or eventually overturned — and
that the next president needs to be a dependable ally on abortion
issues.

“Anxiety is super high among women across the country,” said Ilyse
Hogue, president of the abortion rights organization Naral Pro-Choice
America. “Joe Biden is trying to carve out a space for himself as the
middle, moderate candidate, and he’s going to have to really get with
the times and understand that standing with abortion rights is the
middle, moderate position.”

She added, “I can’t tell you if he’s there or not.”

Mr. Biden is already facing criticism from some women’s rights activists
over his aggressive questioning of Anita Hill during the Supreme Court
confirmation hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas in 1991. Mr. Biden’s
comment Tuesday that [he wished he “could have done
something”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/26/us/politics/biden-anita-hill.html)
to give Ms. Hill’s claims of sexual harassment a more respectful hearing
drew fierce backlash from critics, who pointed out that Mr. Biden was
chairman of the Senate committee that questioned Ms. Hill. Some women’s
rights leaders say Mr. Biden must offer a stronger and more personal
apology to Ms. Hill, as well as clarify his views on a broad range of
issues including sexual assault, harassment and Republicans’ efforts to
limit abortion access. (Mr. Biden has spoken warmly about some
[Republicans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/23/us/politics/biden-speech-fred-upton.html)
and
[bipartisanship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/24/us/politics/biden-praise-republican-speaking-fee.html)
in recent months.)

\[[*Read Michelle Goldberg’s column about how the abortion divide is
getting deeper in
states.*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/29/opinion/abortion-heartbeat-ban-georgia.html)\]

Mr. Biden declined to be interviewed for this article. His spokesman,
Bill Russo, said the former vice president is a supporter of the Roe
decision who fought to protect abortion rights by mounting a fierce
opposition to the nomination of a conservative judge, Robert H. Bork, to
the Supreme Court in 1987.

“Because of that, Roe and its progeny have been preserved for 30 years.
But for that effort, Roe v. Wade would not be the law of the land
today,” Mr. Russo said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Mr. Russo declined to detail Mr. Biden’s current views on specific
policies he once supported, including banning all federal funding for
abortion services and
research.

What is clear from a review of Mr. Biden’s record in the Senate, his
public statements as vice president and interviews about his comments in
private meetings is that his position on abortion grew more liberal over
his four decades in federal office.

“I’m prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there’s human
life and being, but I’m not prepared to say that to other God-fearing,
non-God-fearing people that have a different view,” he told the
[Catholic magazine America
in 2015](https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/everyones-entitled-dignity).

Mr. Biden has cast his evolution as a matter of wrestling with the
teachings of his faith. But his shifting views also reflect a political
calculation about the changing mores of his party in the 1980s and
1990s, when many moderate Democratic leaders, including Al Gore and Bill
Clinton, altered their skeptical positions on abortion. Mr. Clinton, for
one, sought to stake out a center-left position by saying abortion
should be “safe, legal and rare.”

Today, every candidate in the 2020 field supports abortion rights, with
a dozen boasting a perfect scorecard from Naral Pro-Choice America.

\[*Who’s in? Who’s out?* [*Keep up with the 2020 field with our

“The benevolent reinvention of Joe Biden is what’s unfolding,” said the
Rev. Derrick Harkins, the former head of religious outreach for the
Democratic National Committee, who was once criticized for what some
party activists saw as conservative views on abortion. “His perspectives
around a number of issues over the years were reflective of a different
context and maybe even, if you will, a different time.”

In interviews during his first decades in the Senate, Mr. Biden said he
supported the right to an abortion but opposed federal funding to pay
for it. That position was shared by Mr. Gore and other Democrats who
wanted to support abortion rights but were uncomfortable making
taxpayers who were anti-abortion pay for it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As Mr. Biden put it to U.P.I. in 1986, “If it’s not government’s
business, then you have to accept the whole of that concept, which means
you don’t proscribe your right to have an abortion and you don’t take
your money to assist someone else to have an abortion.”

In the 1980s, he repeatedly voted against funding abortions as part of
the health care plan provided to federal employees and in federal
prisons, except in cases where it was medically necessarily for the
mother.

In 1981, he crafted the Biden amendment to ban the use of foreign aid
for biomedical research related to abortion. He repeatedly voted for the
so-called Hyde amendment prohibiting the use of federal funds for
abortion, including through Medicaid. Both policies remain in place
today, despite efforts by Democrats to end the ban on the use of federal
funds.

In 1984, Mr. Biden supported an amendment praising the Reagan
administration’s “Mexico City policy,” which banned federal funding for
organizations around the world that provide abortion counseling or
referrals. In 2005, he voted against it, supporting an amendment that
would have nullified President George W. Bush’s reinstatement of the
policy.

A voter guide put out in 1987 by two abortion rights groups described
Mr. Biden as having an “erratic” record on reproductive rights, writing
that he had a “mixed voting and rhetorical record on the issue of
whether women should have the right to choose an abortion.”

“Joe Biden moans a lot and then usually votes against us,” Jeannie
Rosoff, a founder of the abortion rights research organization
Guttmacher Institute, told The Wall Street Journal as Mr. Biden weighed
whether to enter the 1988 presidential race. “It’s very difficult to
know whether this issue is purely personal, purely political or a
combination of both with him.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the time, opponents of abortion rights say they saw him much the same
way as liberals: “Unreliable,” said Marilyn Musgrave, a former
Republican congresswoman from Colorado and current vice president of
government affairs for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion
group.

“I don’t believe he’s made a public statement recently about funding, so
I don’t know where he really stands on that now,” said Ms. Musgrave.
“Perhaps he evolved on that also.”

Aides to Mr. Biden declined to say whether he still supports those
specific policies.

As the years went on, abortion rights advocates recall, Mr. Biden spoke
passionately in meetings about how his religious beliefs shaped his
views on abortion. And they, with equal emotion, worked to reframe the
issue as a matter of trusting women and their doctors to manage their
health care.

“Biden’s struggle was genuine and heartfelt,” said Kristina Kiehl, an
abortion rights activist who met with Mr. Biden during the 1980s and
1990s. “And I think we were very helpful in kind of guiding him into how
this is O.K. and it’s the right thing to
do.”

As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987, Mr. Biden drew
praise from supporters of abortion rights for sharply questioning Judge
Bork about his opposition to a ruling that struck down birth control
bans. In Congress, Mr. Biden repeatedly voted to give access to abortion
services for members of the military, and in 1994 he voted to establish
fines and penalties for barring access to abortion clinics. In
interviews and congressional votes, he defended the Roe ruling.

But at other times, he sided with Republicans and conservative Democrats
who were trying to limit abortion access.

When Republicans began introducing legislation in the 1990s that would
outlaw a rare abortion procedure they termed “partial-birth abortion,”
Mr. Biden emerged as a reliable ally. He voted for the ban, and then
against efforts by President Clinton to veto the legislation in 1996 and
1998.

Those proposals did not prohibit a wide enough range of procedures, he
argued in a speech on the Senate floor in 1997.

“It did not, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions,”
he said, backing a proposal by Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic
majority leader, that would include an exception if the mother’s health
was at risk. “I was and still am concerned that in banning on
partial-birth abortions, we do not go far enough.”

In 2003, he backed a third ban that included no exception for the health
of the mother, sponsored by Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of
Pennsylvania. That law moved through the courts for several years before
being upheld by the Supreme Court in April 2007.

By that point in his career, Mr. Biden was running for president for a
second time against Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both of
whom had voted against bans of the procedure. Mr. Biden cast himself as
a strong supporter of abortion rights and criticized the court’s ruling
as “paternalistic,” worrying that it could be a step toward overturning
Roe.

“I was 29 years old when I came to the U.S. Senate, and I have learned a
lot,” he said in [a 2007
interview](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18381961/ns/meet_the_press/t/mtp-transcript-april/#.XJKTZRNKjfY)
with NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Look, I’m a practicing Catholic, and it is
the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and
cultural views with my political responsibility.”

When Mr. Obama picked him as vice president more than a year later, some
abortion rights advocates worried about Mr. Biden’s record. But they
felt confident that Mr. Obama’s more liberal views on the issue would
prevail, recalled Kate Michelman, a former leader of Naral.

“Joe Biden continued his evolution on the issue under Obama. He got
there,” she said. “I can’t say for absolute, 100 percent, but I would
trust him as president to protect and defend women’s right to
choose.”
