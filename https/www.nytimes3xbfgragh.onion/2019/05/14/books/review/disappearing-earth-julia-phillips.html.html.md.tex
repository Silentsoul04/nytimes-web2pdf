\textbf{DISAPPEARING EARTH}

By Julia Phillips

\emph{{[}}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/22/books/review/best-books.html}{\emph{This
was selected as one of the Book Review's 10 best books of 2019. See the
full list}}\emph{. {]}}

The first chapter of Julia Phillips's superb debut, ``Disappearing
Earth,'' begins with two sisters at the edge of a bay on a summer day.
One wants to venture deeper, the other clings to shore, embarrassed by
the childish antics of her younger sibling. By chapter's end the sisters
will have disappeared --- kidnapped, it seems, by a man in a shiny black
car. It's a familiar setup in a wholly unfamiliar setting --- the remote
and beautifully bleak Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia.

What follows this abduction is a novel in the form of overlapping short
stories about the women who are affected both directly and indirectly by
the kidnapping. The purpose of these stories is not to unite a community
around a tragedy as a less daring and more conventional narrative would
have it, but to expose the ways in which the women of Kamchatka are
fragmented personally, culturally and emotionally not only by the crime
that jump-starts the novel, but by place, identity and the people who
try, and often fail, to understand them.

It's a well-worn cliché of book jacket copy to say that place is as
important a character as any of the people in a book, and yet the women
who populate Phillips's novel are so intrinsically and intelligently
identified with their region that it's impossible to understand or even
consider them without Phillips's precise evocation of Kamchatka. She
describes the region with a cartographer's precision and an
ethnographer's clarity, drawing clear distinctions between the relative
metropolis of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the south, where the sisters
are kidnapped, the verdant town of Esso with its hot springs and wood
cabins in the middle, and Palana, a tiny city of Soviet architecture
nestled in a valley at the foot of the Koryak Mountains in the sparsely
populated north.

Phillips introduces us to a cast of women who are emblematic of the
ethnic and cultural conflicts of each region --- Ksyusha, a reindeer
herder's daughter who is at university in the capital and finds herself
torn between her controlling white boyfriend and another indigenous
student she meets in a native folk dance troupe; Zoya, a bored
policeman's wife dangerously drawn to the Uzbek and Tajik immigrants who
are doing construction work across from her apartment; Marina, the white
mother of the missing sisters who travels to a cultural festival in the
north where she confronts a Native woman whose teenage daughter also
disappeared under similar circumstances but whose case sparked little
interest.

As the novel progresses, the links between the stories and the women
coil tighter in surprising and troubling ways. Sometimes the sisters'
disappearance is in the foreground but more often it lingers at a
distance --- an echo on the news or a remote unease that serves as a
baseline refrain to the other tragedies, small and large, that permeate
the narrative. It falls to Oksana, the sole witness to the kidnapping,
to link the missing sisters to her own plight, the loss of her dog, and
in doing so she articulates an anxiety common to the women of
``Disappearing Earth'': ``It hurts too much to break your own heart out
of stupidity, to leave a door unlocked or a child untended and return to
discover that whatever you value most has disappeared. No. You want to
be intentional about the destruction. Be a witness. You want to watch
how your life will shatter.'' But these women are never granted such a
vantage point.

There will be those eager to designate ``Disappearing Earth'' a thriller
by focusing on the whodunit rather than what the tragedy reveals about
the women in and around it. And if there is a single misstep in
Phillips's nearly flawless novel, it arrives with the tidy ending that
seems to serve the needs of a genre rather than those of this
particularly brilliant novel. But a tidy ending does not diminish
Phillips's deep examination of loss and longing, and it is a testament
to the novel's power that knowing what happened to the sisters remains
very much beside the point.
