# At Restaurants, Thank You for Not Sharing

After a decade of treating every plate like a pie, individual dishes are
making a welcome comeback.

In 2011, upon visiting Taavo Somer’s erstwhile Brooklyn restaurant Isa,
the New York Times critic [Eric
Asimov](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/eric-asimov) wrote that he
“couldn’t help noticing many people eating a few small plates, or
sharing a main course.” He wondered, “Is this really how people want to
eat nowadays?”

Sharing food has been both a boon and a boogeyman to the restaurant
industry since the 1980s, when “grazing” restaurants such as the Casual
Quilted Giraffe thrived in Manhattan. Spanish-inspired tapas were chic
in the ’90s, and then came Chinese and Middle Eastern restaurants that
were — and always will be — meant for family-style eating. Asimov wasn’t
the first to bemoan sharing, but his inquiry presaged a decade in New
York dominated by a new type of cuisine, one defined less by provenance
or a chef’s palate than by the way it was meant to be consumed, with
each diner taking a single bite before relinquishing the plate. At
[Estela](https://www.estelanyc.com/), which opened in 2013, there were
hedgehog-like piles of pale endive crowned with anchovies; at
[Wildair](http://wildair.nyc/), opened in 2015, beef tartare hidden
beneath a blizzard of white Cheddar. Both iconic dishes, they adhered to
a symmetrically circular plating style and highlighted ingredients (oily
fish, raw meat) that exhausted taste buds after just a few forkfuls.

Living in the “sharing economy,” we are accustomed to apportioning cars,
offices and, yes, plates of food. Lately, though, chefs and diners seem
to have grown weary of the communal experience. Two of the most exciting
restaurants to have opened in New York within the past year are
[Benno](https://www.bennorestaurant.com/) and
[Oxalis](https://oxalisnyc.com/), both of which serve casual-leaning
prix fixe menus. Elsewhere — at [Rocco
DiSpirito](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/rocco-dispirito)’s
revamped [Standard Grill](http://www.thestandardgrill.com/) and Adam
Leonti’s [eponymous restaurant](http://www.leontinyc.com/) — one finds
modern renditions of Continental cuisine such as stuffed rabbit and
truffled poussin (a young chicken), which can technically be shared but
seem designed for one, their textures and flavors varying from bite to
bite. At [King](http://kingrestaurant.nyc/), an Italian-inspired
restaurant that opened in 2016, dishes like quail with braised chicories
and tiny potatoes are pointedly, deliciously unsharable. “Sharing is
often to the detriment, because then awkward social interactions get in
the way of having dinner out together,” says King general manager Annie
Shi. “Everyone is staring at the plate — no one wants to touch it.”

Food is always political, and yet this debate seems particularly aligned
with our era. With socialism back in the national discourse, what could
be a better use of collective resources than collaborating on a meal?
But that, like socialism itself, is an impure ideal, as it’s impossible
to get through a shared supper without someone (or everyone) feeling
like an autocrat: There is the bully who orders for the entire table,
the allergy sufferer who regrets forcing her sensitivities upon friends,
the hungry person who snags the last lobster ravioli and is then filled
with shame. If in other realms it is prudent to share, here is an
opportunity for everyone to feel heard by doing the opposite. In that
sense, at least, ordering — and eating — for one’s self is downright
democratic.
