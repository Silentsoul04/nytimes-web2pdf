Senator Kamala Harris of California unveiled a plan on Tuesday that
would require states and localities with a history of unconstitutionally
restricting abortion rights to obtain federal approval before such laws
can take effect.

Ms. Harris, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president,
called for what is known as a ``preclearance requirement''
\href{https://kamalaharris.org/repro-rights/}{in the plan}, released as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/us/abortion-laws-states.html}{numerous
states have passed laws to sharply limit abortions}.

``When we look at a law like what's happening in Alabama and they're
saying they're going to sentence a doctor to 99 years, as a prosecutor,
let me tell you, I got a real problem with that,'' Ms. Harris said on
MSNBC on Tuesday night, referring to an Alabama law intended to ban most
abortions in the state.

``We cannot tolerate a perspective that is about going backward and not
understanding women have agency, women have value, women have authority
to make decisions about their own lives and their own bodies,'' she
said.

The requirement would apply to jurisdictions with a history of violating
Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's landmark decision in 1973 that
established the constitutional right to abortion. These jurisdictions
would have to clear new abortion laws with the Justice Department before
putting them into effect.

Ms. Harris
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/15/us/politics/democrats-react-alabama-abortion.html}{is
one of several Democrats in the 2020 race} who have sharply criticized
laws passed in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/15/us/alabama-abortion-facts-law-bill.html?rref=collection\%2Ftimestopic\%2FAbortion}{Alabama},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/24/us/missouri-abortion-law.html?rref=collection\%2Ftimestopic\%2FAbortion}{Missouri}
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/24/us/mississippi-abortion-law.html?rref=collection\%2Ftimestopic\%2FAbortion}{other
states} that severely restrict abortion. She is also one of several
Senate co-sponsors of the
\href{https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/510}{Women's
Health Protection Act}, which would prevent any government entity from
imposing various restrictions on abortion services.

Though some Democratic presidential candidates have already
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/17/us/politics/alabama-abortion-law-democrats-roe.html}{called
on Congress to codify abortion rights}, Ms. Harris's campaign said her
proposal went further by shifting the burden to states with a history of
flouting Roe; the campaign cited
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/27/how-many-states-could-see-their-abortion-restrictions-struck-down-after-the-supreme-courts-big-ruling/?utm_term=.6f746962a800}{South
Carolina},
\href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/01/23/iowa-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-law-ruling/2655252002/}{Iowa}
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/01/14/us/supreme-court-wont-hear-arizona-appeal-on-abortion-ban.html}{Georgia}
as examples.

``Are we going to go back to the days of back-alley abortions? Women
died before we had Roe v. Wade in place,'' Ms. Harris said on MSNBC,
during a televised town-hall event. ``On this issue, I'm kind of done.''

The preclearance requirement would work much like the one included in
the Voting Rights Act, which was first passed in 1965 to combat voter
discrimination. From 1965 to 2013, that law blocked hundreds of
discriminatory laws and practices from going into effect.

In 2013, the Supreme Court
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html?module=inline}{effectively
struck down} the heart of the Voting Rights Act, ruling the formula that
determined which states had to receive preclearance before making
changes to voting procedures was unconstitutional.

Ms. Harris noted Tuesday night she would need 60 votes in the Senate to
establish her proposed preclearance requirement and called on voters to
pay attention to Senate races.

The Harris campaign said any change to abortion laws in a covered
jurisdiction would remain legally unenforceable until the Justice
Department determined that it adhered to the standards laid out in Roe
and by the Women's Health Protection Act, which remains stalled in the
Republican-controlled Senate.

Ms. Harris's campaign also said a number of guardrails would be put in
place to protect the preclearance requirement regardless of a particular
administration's view of abortion.

``With reproductive freedom under attack nationwide, we're heartened to
see Senator Kamala Harris rolling out a bold plan to defend our
fundamental rights,'' said Sasha Bruce, senior vice president at NARAL
Pro-Choice America, an advocacy organization.

``Every candidate in this field should know it's not enough to simply
call yourself pro-choice,'' Ms. Bruce said. ``All candidates need to
back up their words with a concrete plan for action, especially given
the tenuous thread by which reproductive freedom hangs.''
