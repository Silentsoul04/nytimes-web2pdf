WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. --- Senator Kamala Harris of California has, for
months, faced criticism from activist Democrats who have said her record
as California attorney general was at odds with her progressive
reputation.

But on Saturday, as Ms. Harris
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/08/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-trump.html}{seeks
to reinvigorate her presidential campaign}, she went on the offensive,
laying out a robust defense of her record as prosecutor and decrying
what she called ``self-appointed political commentators'' who fail to
understand the complexities of criminal justice.

``There have been those who have questioned my motivations, my beliefs
and what I've done,'' Ms. Harris said in a speech in South Carolina.
``But my mother used to say, `Don't let people tell you who you are. You
tell them who you are.' So that's what I'm going to do.''

out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.}}{]}

In the speech, Ms. Harris cast herself as a change agent from within the
system.

``It matters who is in those rooms,'' she said. ``I demanded we reject
the false choice that said you're either tough on crime or soft on
crime. Instead, I said we must be smart on crime.''

Ms. Harris burst onto the presidential stage with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-rally-2020.html}{an
announcement before a crowd of 20,000} in her hometown, Oakland, Calif.,
an early show of force in a race that began without a clear
front-runner. She has fallen in recent polls, however, which has
triggered concern within her campaign and among her supporters.

But those close to Ms. Harris say they are confident she is finding her
stride. On Sunday, at a dinner for Iowa Democrats that several
presidential candidates will attend, Ms. Harris will revive her focus on
President Trump, according to an aide, and argue that she is uniquely
positioned to ``prosecute the case'' against him. Her speech Saturday
got several ovations among the older black crowd that gathered for the
annual N.A.A.C.P. Freedom Fund dinner.

Ms. Harris was the first black woman to serve as California attorney
general and the second black woman to serve in the United States Senate.
The speech made a vigorous case for the power of racial representation,
and she frequently used ``we'' to refer to the black community. Ms.
Harris argued that because of her identity, background and experiences,
her mere presence in the state's law enforcement systems helped make
them more just and equitable.

Government needs ``people who bring the context, awareness and life
experience to the job, to make the system more just,'' she said.

In addition to a more direct defense of her prosecutorial record, Ms.
Harris has talked more explicitly about Mr. Trump in recent months. As
the campaign has edged along, she has more explicitly rejected the
language of ``structural change'' that defines the more leftist
candidates and increasingly cast herself as a policy pragmatist in the
tradition of Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Helen Rosamond-Saunders, a 73-year-old retired teacher, said Ms.
Harris's identity as a black woman gave her a special connection with
black voters in South Carolina.

``It gives us, as black women, a special opportunity to support someone
with the same goals and experiences that we have,'' she said. ``Now we
need to step up to the plate.''

Katie Davis-Hill, 67, said she liked when Ms. Harris talked directly
about Mr. Trump.

``She's awe-inspiring,'' Ms. Davis-Hill said. ``We now have someone who
thinks he's above the law, but with her as a prosecutor, she knows what
someone who isn't telling the truth looks like.''

In Democratic events this presidential cycle, even at those for other
candidates, Ms. Harris is typically mentioned as a candidate who
generates significant interest. She has repeatedly drawn sky-high
television ratings for cable news town halls.

But she has also been accused of relying too much on her identity and
biography, particularly in a race in which all Democratic candidates,
including white ones, are talking more specifically about race.

Her campaign recently announced a major summer investment in Iowa staff,
after Democrats there openly wondered if Ms. Harris had done enough
grass-roots organizing to succeed in the state. New Hampshire Democrats
have also questioned whether Ms. Harris has visited the state enough.

In South Carolina, where Ms. Harris has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-black-voters.html?searchResultPosition=1}{appeared
at more campaign events} than any other Democratic candidate has, she
received a rousing ovation whenever she assailed the president.

The voters she was courting are also being wooed by former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner at this early
stage. Part of her goal was to show she can best argue the case against
Mr. Trump.

``We've got to hold this guy accountable by prosecuting the case in
front of the American people against four more years of this
administration,'' Ms. Harris said to applause. ``I've prosecuted a lot
of cases. But rarely one with this much evidence.''
