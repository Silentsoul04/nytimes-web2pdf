America’s coal-burning power plants are [shutting down at a rapid
pace](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/06/13/climate/coal-nuclear-bailout.html?module=inline),
forcing electric utilities to face the next big climate question:
Embrace natural gas, or shift aggressively to renewable energy?

Some large utilities, including Xcel Energy in the Upper Midwest, are
now planning to sharply cut their coal and gas use in favor of clean and
abundant wind and solar power, which have steadily fallen in cost. But
in the Southeast and other regions, natural gas continues to dominate,
because of its reliability and low prices driven by the fracking boom.
Nationwide, energy companies plan to add [at least 150 new gas
plants](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/pdf/epa.pdf) and
thousands of miles of pipelines in the years ahead.

A rush to build gas-fired plants, even though they emit only half as
much carbon pollution as coal, has the potential to lock in decades of
new fossil-fuel use right as scientists say emissions [need to fall
drastically by
midcentury](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html)
to avert the worst impacts of global warming.

“Gas infrastructure that’s built today is going to be with us for 30
years,” said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Rice University.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“But if you look at scenarios that take climate change seriously, that
say we need to get to net zero emissions by 2050,” he said, “that’s not
going to be compatible with gas plants that don’t capture their
carbon.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In some states, policymakers are now pushing to leave gas behind to meet
ambitious climate goals. Last week, New York lawmakers [passed a
sweeping energy
bill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/18/nyregion/greenhouse-gases-ny.html)
that calls for the state to switch to entirely carbon-free electricity
sources by 2040, following states like California and New Mexico that
have passed similar laws.

Since 2005, most power companies have lowered their carbon dioxide
emissions significantly, in large part by shifting from coal to gas.
Coal plants have become uncompetitive with other kinds of energy
generation in much of the country, despite the Trump administration’s
efforts to save them by [rolling back federal pollution
regulations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html).

But in [a recent
analysis](http://www.energyandpolicy.org/utility-carbon-targets), David
Pomerantz, the executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, a
pro-renewables group, looked at the long-term plans of the 22 biggest
investor-owned utilities. Some in the Midwest are planning to speed up
the rate at which they cut emissions between now and 2030. But other
large utilities, like Duke Energy and American Electric Power, expect to
reduce their carbon emissions at a slower pace over the next decade than
they had over the previous decade.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I really think gas is at the crux of it,” Mr. Pomerantz said. “You’ve
got some utilities looking at gas and saying, ‘No thanks, we think
there’s a cleaner and cheaper path.’ But then you’ve got others going
all-in on
gas.”

## Where Natural Gas Plants Are Expanding

Last fall, in North and South Carolina, a pair of utilities owned by
Duke Energy [filed plans with state
regulators](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/duke-15-year-plans-lean-heavy-on-gas-to-replace-coal/531924/)
to continue retiring coal plants and largely replace them with more than
9,500 megawatts of new natural gas capacity by 2033. The utilities also
plan to add a smaller amount of solar capacity, about 3,600 megawatts,
over the same time frame.

“Right now, gas is still the most cost-effective option for us,” said
Kenneth Jennings, Duke’s director of renewable strategy and
policy.

## How Does Your State Make Electricity?

There’s been a major shift in how America makes electricity over the
past two decades. Each state has its own story.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One challenge with using more solar power, he noted, is finding a way to
supply electricity when the sun isn’t shining. Although Duke is
installing some large lithium-ion batteries to store solar energy for
less-sunny hours, the company says batteries still haven’t reached the
point where they’re as cheap or effective as gas power, which can run at
all hours.

Mr. Jennings also said that it can be tough to add wind power in the
Carolinas, where the terrain is less favorable than the wide-open
Midwest and lawmakers have limited the construction of new turbines on
mountain ridges and near military bases along the coast.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Opponents of Duke’s plans, including environmental groups and local
renewable energy producers, have urged state regulators to push the
utility to reconsider. They [have sharply disputed Duke’s
analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BXbaHrhTTSAk7yq7WsMQwlnlkCBG5l35/view),
arguing that the utility is downplaying the potential for solar, wind
and batteries.

A similar fight is unfolding in Florida, where the local Sierra Club [is
challenging a
proposal](https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2019/05/despite-opposition-judge-allows-teco-plans-for-fracked-gas-and-coal-move)
by Tampa Electric to replace two older coal units with a large new
natural gas plant. The Sierra Club’s pitch to the governor, who still
has to approve the plan: Florida can’t afford to deepen its reliance on
gas at a time when climate change and sea level rise are threatening the
state’s coast.

For Tampa Electric, the choice is complex. The utility plans to get 7
percent of its power from solar by 2021, but says that until storage
technologies improve, gas will form the backbone of its energy mix as it
tries to meet energy needs in a fast-growing part of the state.

These disputes are popping up in states around the country. Over the
last decade, groups like the Sierra Club have tried to persuade
utilities and regulators that they could save money by retiring coal and
shifting to a cleaner mix of gas and renewables. Now they’re running the
same playbook against gas, arguing that the costs of wind, solar and
batteries [have declined so
drastically](https://rmi.org/insight/the-economics-of-clean-energy-portfolios/)
that it’s time to stop building new gas plants, too.

So far, results have been mixed: Regulators in
[Arizona](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/arizona-regulators-move-to-place-gas-plant-moratorium-on-utilities/519176/)
and
[Indiana](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/indiana-regulators-reject-vectren-gas-plant-over-stranded-asset-concerns/553456/)
have recently blocked plans for new gas plants, agreeing with opponents
that utilities hadn’t fully considered alternatives and that large new
gas projects could be a risky bet at a time when clean energy technology
is improving fast.

But last year in Michigan, [regulators
approved](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-approves-1b-dte-natural-gas-plant-blow-environmentalists)
DTE Energy’s plan to build a new $1 billion gas plant, rejecting
[analyses](https://blog.ucsusa.org/sam-gomberg/dte-customers-could-save-340-million-with-clean-energy-compared-to-proposed-gas-plant)
by outside groups that the utility could save ratepayers money by
scrapping the plant and making greater use of wind, solar and energy
efficiency.

## Where Renewables Are Gaining

At the same time, some utilities are discovering on their own that it
can make financial sense to take a more ambitious leap toward renewable
energy.

Last year in Indiana, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, or
Nipsco, opened bidding to outside energy developers and found that
adding a mix of wind, solar and batteries [would be
cheaper](https://www.nipsco.com/docs/librariesprovider11/rates-and-tariffs/irp/irp-executive-summary.pdf?sfvrsn=9)
than building a new gas plant to replace its retiring coal units. (The
company will keep its older gas plants online to fill in gaps when wind
and solar aren’t available.) Doing so, the utility estimated, would
reduce its emissions 90 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

“We were surprised by that,” said Joe Hamrock, the chief executive of
the company that owns the Nipsco. “Renewables in our particular
situation were far more competitive than we realized.”

Mr. Hamrock noted that his utility had advantages that others might not
have: Its territory sits near land that’s ripe for wind development,
making it easier to build new turbines close by without the need for
lots of costly new transmission lines. “The answer we got might look
very different for someone just 100 miles away,” he said.

Indeed, things look very different nearby in [the vast regional grid
known as PJM](https://www.pjm.com/) that serves 65 million people from
Ohio to New Jersey. There power plants compete in a largely deregulated
market and companies are expected to build over 10,000 megawatts of new
gas plants by 2024 to take advantage of cheap natural gas from the
nearby fracking boom in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

“The shale gas revolution has, frankly, caused a delay in the growth of
renewables here,” said Stu Bresler, senior vice president for operations
and markets at PJM Interconnection, which oversees the system. Wind and
solar make up less than 6 percent of the region’s generating capacity,
well below the national average.

## Decisions From the States

State legislatures are also increasingly weighing in on which energy
sources get built. To date, 29 states [have enacted
laws](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx)
that require their utilities to get a certain fraction of their power
from wind and solar.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, some states are going further. Over the past year, California,
Colorado, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Washington [have all
passed
laws](https://www.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/State-and-Utility-Climate-Change-Targets.pdf)
aimed at getting 100 percent of their electricity from carbon-free
sources by midcentury, which would eventually mean phasing out
conventional gas plants.

Yet even utilities that are already shifting more heavily into
renewables say that it will be challenging to get rid of gas altogether.

Last year, Xcel Energy, which serves eight states including Colorado and
Minnesota, [said it would shut down all its remaining coal plants in the
years
ahead](https://www.xcelenergy.com/environment/carbon_reduction_plan) and
push to go completely carbon-free by 2050, saying that renewable energy,
helped in part by federal subsidies, had fallen so much in price that
this was now the cheapest option.

While the utility thinks it can get 80 percent of the way to its
emissions goals by 2030 with a mix of wind, solar, batteries and its
existing nuclear plants, it will still rely on natural gas to provide
the rest of its power and is building a new gas plant in Minnesota to
balance out its supply.

Ben Fowke, the chief executive of Xcel, said that getting to 100 percent
carbon-free power will likely require new technology that can supplant
natural gas as a cost-effective backup fuel. Some possibilities include
burning clean hydrogen instead of gas in power plants, developing
techniques that enable carbon produced by gas plants to be captured and
stored underground, advanced nuclear power or the invention of new
energy storage techniques.

Perfecting that technology would likely require big new investments in
research and support from policymakers, he said. “But I’m convinced we
can get there.”
