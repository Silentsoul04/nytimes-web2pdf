WASHINGTON — When President Trump
[meets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-meeting-trade.html)
President Xi Jinping of China this week to discuss contentious trade
issues, they will face each other in another nation that was once the
United States’ main commercial rival, seen as a threat to American
dominance.

But the competition between the United States and Japan, which
[hosts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/25/us/politics/trump-g-20-japan.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)
the [Group of 20
summit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/07/business/economy/g20-trade-war-trump-tariffs.html)
this week for the first time, settled into a normal struggle among
businesses after waves of American anxiety in the 1980s. Japan hit a
decade of stagnation, and in 2010, China overtook it as the world’s
second-largest economy.

There is no sign, though, that the rivalry between the United States and
China will reach the same kind of equilibrium. For one thing, Japan is a
democracy that has a military alliance with the United States, while
China is an authoritarian nation that most likely seeks to [displace
American military dominance of the western
Pacific](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/14/world/asia/usa-china-trade-pacific.html).
In China’s competition with the United States, a rancorous trade war has
persisted for a year, and issues of national security are [bleeding by
the
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/08/business/trump-economy-national-security.html)
into economic ones. Some senior American officials are pushing for
“decoupling” the two economies.

*[\[What is the
G-20?\]](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/world/asia/what-is-the-g20.html)*

The main elements in relations — economic and commercial ties — have
become unmoored, and few agree on the future contours of the
relationship or the magnitude of the conflicts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For American officials, the stakes seem much higher now than in the race
with Japan. Most economists estimate China will overtake the United
States as the largest economy in 10 to 15 years. And some senior
officials in Washington now view China as a steely ideological rival,
where the Communist Party aims not only to subjugate citizens but to
[spread tools of authoritarian control
globally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/24/technology/ecuador-surveillance-cameras-police-government.html)
— particularly surveillance, communications and artificial intelligence
technology — and [establish military
footholds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/20/world/asia/south-china-sea-navy.html)
across
[oceans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/25/world/africa/us-djibouti-chinese-naval-base.html)
and
[mountains](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-central-asias-forbidding-highlands-a-quiet-newcomer-chinese-troops/2019/02/18/78d4a8d0-1e62-11e9-a759-2b8541bbbe20_story.html?utm_term=.0322993a30c0).

Though Mr. Trump incessantly praises Mr. Xi — he said they [“will always
be
friends”](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/982954355509907457?lang=en)
— the idea of China as a dangerous juggernaut, more formidable than the
Soviet Union, has become increasingly widespread in the administration.
It was articulated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a visit to
the Netherlands, part of a weeklong trip across Europe this month in
which he talked about China at each stop.

“China has inroads too on this continent that demand our attention,” he
told a news conference in The Hague. “China wants to be the dominant
economic and military power of the world, spreading its authoritarian
vision for society and its corrupt practices worldwide.”

The [National Security
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf)
issued by the White House in December 2017 sounded the alarm: The United
States was re-entering an era of great power competition, in which China
and Russia “want to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and
interests.” But since then, Mr. Trump and cabinet officials, [distracted
by
Iran](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html)
and other foreign policy matters, have failed to outline a coherent
strategy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That has left administration officials struggling to piece together an
approach to China that has elements of competition, containment and
constructive engagement, none of them sharply focused.

Mr. Trump’s closest advisers on China are split on strategies. His top
foreign policy officials, [John R.
Bolton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/28/us/politics/trump-john-bolton-north-korea-iran.html)
and
[Mr](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/22/world/middleeast/trump-pompeo-iran.html).[Pompeo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/22/world/middleeast/trump-pompeo-iran.html),
have pushed for tough policies, as has Peter Navarro, the trade adviser
and creator of a polemical book and documentary film, [“Death by
China.”](http://deathbychina.com/) In the opposite camp are
[tycoons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-phone-security.html)
— among them Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Stephen A. Schwarzman
and Steve Wynn.

Midlevel bureaucrats are formulating their own ideas. The view of a
drawn-out ideological conflict was laid out in stark terms by Kiron
Skinner, the head of policy planning at the State Department, [in a talk
in Washington on
April 29](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china).

“This is a fight with a really different civilization and a different
ideology, and the United States hasn’t had that before,” she said. “The
Soviet Union and that competition, in a way, it was a fight within the
Western
family.”

Now, she said, “it’s the first time that we will have a great power

Many analysts have tried to discern whether the striking remarks point
to a new policy direction. Officials say privately that is not the case.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While there has been bipartisan praise in Washington for the
administration’s tougher line — with measures ranging from
[tariffs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/09/us/politics/china-trade-tariffs.html)
to [sanctions of Chinese technology
companies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html)
— critics say they see strategic ambiguity without the strategy.

“The economic and security and technological and even scientific
components of the U.S.-China relationship are now being conflated,” said
[Jessica Chen Weiss](https://government.cornell.edu/jessica-chen-weiss),
a professor of government at Cornell University who studies [Chinese
politics](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-06-11/world-safe-autocracy)
and nationalism. “What’s worrying to many is not being able to decipher
different levels of risk and how far and how quickly the efforts to
indiscriminately decouple the United States and China will go.”

That idea of decoupling rests on the premise that two economies so
intertwined poses a significant security risk to the United States. The
linking accelerated when China [entered the World Trade
Organization](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-04-02/was-letting-china-wto-mistake)
in 2001 and in recent years had seemed irreversible. But Mr. Trump’s
hard-line trade advisers want the two nations to unwind their supply
chains, which means some American businesses exit China, and others stop
selling components to Chinese companies.

Mr. Trump is narrowly focused on [cutting the
trade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/06/us/politics/us-trade-deficit.html)deficit
with China, which many economists say is not meaningful. But his
imposition of tariffs and the general uncertainty around the economic
relationship are forcing some American companies to rethink keeping
operations in China. And putting Chinese companies, notably Huawei, the
giant maker of communications technology, on what officials call an
entity list to cut off the supply of American components is [having an
effect](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/20/technology/google-android-huawei.html).

“After a long period of globalization and squeezing out economic

said [Daniel M. Kliman](https://www.cnas.org/people/daniel-kliman),
director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the [Center for a New

That has not gone unnoticed in China. This spring, with trade tensions
rising, Chinese state-run television began showing [old Korean War
films](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/05/23/amid-trade-tensions-with-america-china-is-showing-old-war-films)

[Wang Wen](http://en.rdcy.org/Index/news_cont/id/14791), executive dean
of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin
University of China, said in an interview that the new model for United
States-China relations was “fight but not break.”

The fallout from the struggle is widening. Chinese security officers
have [arrested two Canadian men on charges of
spying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/16/world/asia/china-canadian-arrested.html)
in apparent retaliation for the [arrest in

of Meng Wanzhou, a top Huawei executive, on an extradition request by
the United States. The F.B.I. has been [canceling
visas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/14/world/asia/china-academics-fbi-visa-bans.html)
of Chinese scholars suspected of intelligence ties.

Some observers say they fear a new Red Scare.

“Rather than proclaiming a ‘whole of society’ threat from a hostile
‘civilization,’ U.S. officials would be wise to emphasize the value
that immigrants from China and other countries have brought, while
establishing policies to safeguard against theft of intellectual
property,” Ms. Weiss said.

The case of Huawei is at the nexus of concerns in Washington over both
Chinese economic dominance and security threats. The Trump
administration has been pushing countries to bar Huawei from developing
[next-generation 5G communications
networks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/31/technology/personaltech/5g-what-you-need-to-know.html),
arguing it [poses a national security
risk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html?module=inline).
Huawei, a private company, denies the
charge.

Australia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/23/technology/huawei-banned-australia-5g.html),
shows how nations are unwilling to jeopardize their economic relations

Some American companies are trying to bypass the limits set by the Trump
administration on their dealings with China. Semiconductor companies,
for example, have found a legal basis for
[sidestepping](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html)
the Commerce Department prohibition on selling components to Huawei.

But the administration itself sometimes pulls punches on China in the
name of economic relations — a sign that the traditional foundation of
the relationship still stands to a degree.

Since last year, the administration has debated imposing sanctions on
Chinese officials for their role in interning one million or more
Muslims in the Xinjiang region. Though Mr. Pompeo and other officials
have pushed for the sanctions, the Treasury Department, led by Mr.
Mnuchin, has [opposed
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/04/world/asia/trump-china-uighurs-trade-deal.html)
for fear of derailing the trade talks. So the administration has taken
no action.

China’s extraordinary [human rights abuses in
Xinjiang](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html)
are one major reason many American officials have abandoned any notion
of a future turn toward liberalism within the Communist Party.

For their part, Chinese officials have seized on the Trump
administration’s actions to argue that the United States is trying to
stop China’s rise. On Tuesday, People’s Daily, the official Communist
Party newspaper, [ran a
commentary](Http://opinion.people.com.cn/n1/2019/0625/c1003-31177840.html)
urging citizens to fight for the nation’s dignity.

“The Chinese people deeply understand that the American government’s
suppression and containment of China is an external challenge that China
must bear in its development and growth,” the paper said, “and it is a
hurdle that we must overcome in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation.”
