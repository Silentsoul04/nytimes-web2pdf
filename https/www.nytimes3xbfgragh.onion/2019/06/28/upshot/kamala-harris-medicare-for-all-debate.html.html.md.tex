\section{Where Is Kamala Harris on Medicare for All vs. Private
Insurance?}\label{where-is-kamala-harris-on-medicare-for-all-vs-private-insurance}}

A candidate has a history of making conflicting comments about a
divisive health care plan.

On the debate stage Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris raised her hand,
seemingly in support of a government insurance proposal that would
eliminate employer insurance. On Friday, she said she had misunderstood
the question.

The wording of the question left room for confusion, but Ms. Harris also
has a history of making conflicting statements on the issue. In a CNN
town hall in January, she said
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/harris-private-insurance-medicare/index.html}{she'd
favor eliminating all private health insurance}. The next day, her
campaign
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/29/us/politics/medicare-for-all-harris-bloomberg.html}{walked
it back}.

A single-payer health plan requires people with other forms of
comprehensive health insurance to switch. That is a politically risky
position. Some Democrats have hedged by backing more gradual, optional
expansions of public coverage. Others have decided that they can
persuade voters that the advantages outweigh the disruption. Ms. Harris,
so far, hasn't chosen either one.

Surveys show that most Americans --- and a substantial majority of
Democrats --- back a single-payer system in which the government
provides health insurance to everyone. But when surveys ask them if
they'd still like that idea if they had to give up their insurance,
\href{https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-single-payer-national-health-plans-and-expanding-access-to-medicare-coverage/}{many
change their minds}. Surveys asking people if they could keep their
insurance under such a
plan\href{https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-release/poll-most-americans-dont-realize-how-dramatically-medicare-for-all-proposals-would-revamp-nations-health-care-system/}{find
many}\href{http://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/knowledge-about-medicare-for-all-remains-low.aspx}{who
say yes}.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has supported a single-payer plan
for decades and is the author of the Medicare for All Act, which Ms.
Harris has co-sponsored, argues that support will increase as more
voters learn about the benefits of his plan. Insurance under Medicare
for all, he argues, will cover all doctors and hospitals, and include no
co-payments or deductibles. He thinks such a plan has so many advantages
that few Americans will remain attached to their current coverage once
they understand it.

Some Democratic strategists look at the polls and worry about a backlash
to the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/23/health/private-health-insurance-medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders.html}{major
disruptions} such a plan would create. Candidates like Senator Michael
Bennet of Colorado and the former vice president, Joe Biden, say they'd
prefer a system in which people could choose to buy public insurance if
they want --- or keep the plan they have.

Medicare for all was once cast as a litmus test for the Democratic
presidential field, but at this point most of the candidates favor this
sort of optional approach, with a mix of public and private insurance.

Most candidates in the field
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/23/us/politics/2020-democrats-medicare-for-all-public-option.html?module=inline}{endorsed
such a plan} in a recent New York Times survey, and in the debates' less
formal vote by show of hands.

Another solution might be government plans that cover some things, but
allow people to buy private insurance for extras. In other countries
with a universal public plan \emph{and} private insurance, private
insurance is there to fill holes in the government system. In Canada,
private insurers pay for prescription drugs, which Canadian Medicare
does not cover. In Britain, private insurance can get you extra services
and the ability to jump the line for certain treatments. In the United
States today, older people on Medicare buy supplemental insurance to
help cover deductibles and co-payments charged by the government system.

Several candidates who have signed on to Medicare for all legislation
suggested they would like to preserve ``a role'' for private insurance,
and these vague statements could point to such a public-private system.

But such a policy stance may not reassure people who are reluctant to
give up their current insurance arrangements. It could offer both the
disruption of Medicare for all, and the inconvenience of private
insurance, in one package.

In the debate Thursday, Lester Holt, the NBC anchor and one of the
moderators, said: ``Many people watching at home have health insurance
through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health
insurance in favorite of a government-run plan?'' Ms. Harris
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-clarifies-debate-answer-on-eliminating-private-insurance/}{later
said} she thought the ``their'' meant her, and not the people watching
at home.

But in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/23/us/politics/2020-democrats-health-care.html?module=inline}{recent
answers} to a detailed New York Times survey on her health care policy
preferences, Ms. Harris also positioned herself on the single-payer side
of the line. When asked if she'd favor a plan that abolished private
insurance, she said yes. When asked if she'd prefer a Medicare for all
plan or an optional proposal, which she also endorsed, she said,
``Medicare for all.''

``Medicare for All will extend health insurance to every single
American, with no co-pays or premiums,'' she wrote. ``It will cover most
procedures, as well as dental, vision and hearing aids, and will allow
you to choose your doctor, without worrying about who's in-network or
not. We have to change a system that allows big insurance companies to
put profit over people's health.''

On Friday morning, she
\href{https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1144586331424731137?ref_src=twsrc\%5Etfw\%7Ctwcamp\%5Etweetembed\%7Ctwterm\%5E1144586331424731137\&ref_url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fthehill.com\%2Fhomenews\%2Fcampaign\%2F450839-harris-clarifies-private-insurance-stance-no-no-i-dont-think-it-should-be}{told
the hosts of the MSNBC show ``Morning Joe},'' ``No, I do not'' support
abolishing private insurance. ``The question was would you give up your
private insurance for that option, and I said yes.''

It is hard to reconcile those positions.
