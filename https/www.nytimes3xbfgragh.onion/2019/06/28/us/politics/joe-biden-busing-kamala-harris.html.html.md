One of the most tense and [dramatic
moments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html)
of the [Democratic
debate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/democratic-debate-live.html)
on Thursday night began with a stipulation.

“I do not believe you are a racist,” Senator Kamala Harris of California
told former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

What followed was [a deeply personal and at times lacerating
explanation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-debate.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmatt-flegenheimer&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection)
of what Ms. Harris, a black former prosecutor, did believe and had
experienced. It was a story about segregation, about busing, and about
Ms. Harris herself. And it was a story she wanted Mr. Biden to hear.

In an instantly memorable exchange, Ms. Harris said it had been “very
hurtful” to hear Mr. Biden invoke the names of two segregationist
senators [as he did on the campaign trail this
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html?module=inline).
She then recalled Mr. Biden’s [opposition to school busing in
the 1970s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/factcheck-democratic-debate.html?module=inline).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second
class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every
day,” Ms. Harris said. “And that little girl was me.”

*\[[Read a transcript of the
exchange](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer)*
*between Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden.\]*

Mr. Biden called her remarks “a mischaracterization of my position
across the board.” And when Ms. Harris asked moments later whether Mr.
Biden would agree that he had been “wrong to oppose busing in America,”
Mr. Biden again pushed back on the premise.

“I did not oppose busing in America,” Mr. Biden said. “What I opposed is
busing ordered by the Department of Education.”

[In
reality,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/factcheck-democratic-debate.html)
Mr. Biden was a [leading
opponent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline)
of busing in the Senate during the 1970s and 1980s, and his opposition
went beyond the federal government’s role in the practice.

But [speaking at a conference Friday in
Chicago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/28/us/politics/biden-harris-debate-democratic.html),
Mr. Biden doubled down, claiming that he had “never, never, never ever
opposed voluntary busing” like the program Ms. Harris participated in as
a child, implicitly drawing a distinction between voluntary busing
allowed by some local governments and the mandatory, court-ordered
busing that also took place decades ago.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then he added: “I’ve always been in favor of using federal authority to
overcome state-initiated
segregation.”

Here’s a look at what we know about Mr. Biden’s record in the 1970s and
’80s, as a senator from Delaware, and how it squares with the claims
he made this week.

## ‘An asinine concept’

Mr. Biden was a liberal on most civil rights issues, but he [did not
support integrating schools through
busing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline)
from the 1970s to the 1980s.

In 1975, Mr. Biden
[supported](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1975-pt22/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1975-pt22-6-2.pdf#page=122)
a sweeping anti-busing measure offered by [the segregationist Senator
Jesse Helms of North
Carolina](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/07/05/us/politics/00helms.html?module=inline),
and he offered his [own less stringent anti-busing
amendment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1975/09/18/archives/anti-busing-measure-approved-in-senate.html?module=inline)
to an appropriations bill.

“I oppose busing,” he said [in an interview
in 1975](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transcript-of-then-sen-biden-s-interview-with-the-people-paper/3d9be388-6871-4993-ae53-869a88c3c6eb_note.html?questionId=bdc5761e-0777-4db5-9d00-e22e67012c96&utm_term=.650a28e274a6).
“It’s an asinine concept, the utility of which has never been proven to
me.”

“The new integration plans being offered are really just quota-systems
to assure a certain number of blacks, Chicanos, or whatever in each
school,” he added. “That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come
up with; what it says is, ‘in order for your child with curly black
hair, brown eyes and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to
sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son.’ That’s racist\! Who the
hell do we think we are, that the only way a black man or woman can
learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child?”

He went on: “The problem, you see, is that the courts have gone
overboard in their interpretation of what is required to remedy unlawful
segregation. It is one thing to say that you cannot keep a black man
from using this bathroom, and something quite different to say that one
out of every five people who use this bathroom must be black.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He concluded: “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ’60s, which
said, ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man
is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order
to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even
hold the white man back, to even the race.’”

## More anti-busing legislation

Mr. Biden introduced another
[proposal](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1976-pt16/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1976-pt16-5-1.pdf#page=36)
in 1976 that blocked the Justice Department from seeking busing as a
desegregation tool, and co-sponsored an
[amendment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/06/21/senate-unit-challenges-president/d9f6eac0-0350-4dab-887f-4ffd431ab1f9/)
in 1977 that limited federal funding of busing efforts. He continued his
efforts that year with a
[bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/senate-bill/1132/actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22busing%22%5D%7D)
curbing court-ordered busing.

In February 1982, he
[voted](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-CRECB-1982-pt1) for an
amendment to a Justice Department appropriations bill
[described](https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal82-1164676)
as the “toughest anti-busing rider ever approved by either chamber of
Congress.” A month later, he [voted in
favor](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1982-pt3/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1982-pt3-1.pdf#page=96)
of another amendment that allowed the Justice Department to participate
in litigation “to remove or reduce the requirement of busing in existing
court decrees or judgments.”

A spokesman for Mr. Biden [recently told The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline)
that he had always supported integration, but that he did not think
busing was the right mechanism to achieve it. The spokesman also said
Mr. Biden thought busing placed an undue burden on African-American
families. In an attempt to highlight other aspects of Mr. Biden’s record
on civil rights, he pointed to comments in 1975 calling for housing and
employment integration, and in 1986 [pressing Justice William H.
Rehnquist on
integration.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1986/07/31/us/excerpts-from-questioning-of-rehnquist-in-the-senate-judiciary-committee.html?module=inline)

## Dismal support for busing in ’70s

To some extent, Mr. Biden’s opposition to busing reflected the majority
of the country at the time. Polling in the 1970s found only single-digit
support for the practice.

“Busing is unpopular for many reasons,” [The New York Times reported
in 1978](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1978/03/13/archives/nations-resistance-to-busing-softens-but-rate-is-slowed-nations.html).
“Some parents say they fear that their children will be unsafe or get an
inferior education; many parents and children say they sincerely prefer
the neighborhood school concept; the comments of some are racist.”

[Research has
shown](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/public-school-desegregation-in-the-united-states-1968-1980/orfield_american-desegregation-1983.pdf)
that nationwide, the segregation of black students in public schools
declined significantly between 1968 and 1980, the period during which
the courts decided that busing could be used to aid school integration.
And indeed, [a 1999 Gallup
poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/3577/americans-want-integrated-schools-oppose-school-busing.aspx)
showed that Americans believed busing had served a positive historical
purpose in improving the education of African-American students.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But by that time, [most busing plans had been
dismantled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/09/11/us/by-court-order-busing-ends-where-it-began.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=8FCED2DAE1A76942112CE3A94FF569A0&gwt=pay)
and were considered by some to be a vestige of a different era. In line
with that sentiment, the majority of respondents to the Gallup poll said
they would prefer to integrate schools through methods other than
busing.

## A ‘liberal train wreck’ in Delaware

[In his 2007
memoir](https://books.google.com/books?id=3SqRQnn4IykC&q=busing#v=snippet&q=busing&f=false),
Mr. Biden discussed a cross-district busing effort in the 1970s aimed at
desegregating schools in a county in Delaware — his home state.

Busing, Mr. Biden said, was a “liberal train wreck” that was “tearing
people apart” there. In the book, he argued that it was forcing some
students to travel great distances and some teachers to transfer and
take pay cuts. Black and white parents alike, he said, were “terrified.”

He spoke out publicly against Delaware’s court-ordered school-busing
program, arguing that the money spent on transportation could be better
spent on other educational needs, and that it made no sense to stop
students from attending a school just blocks away from their homes.

He would later recount telling constituents that “I was against busing
to remedy de facto segregation owing to housing patterns and community
comfort, but if it was intentional segregation, I’d personally pay for
helicopters to move the children.”

## Drawing a distinction

Mr. Biden’s remarks on Friday about never having been opposed to
“voluntary” busing appeared to echo an argument he made the night
before, on the debate stage.

At one point during his exchange with Ms. Harris, Mr. Biden noted that
she had been able to participate in a busing program because of “a local
decision” made by a City Council to allow it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“That’s fine,” he said. “That’s one of the things I argued for.”

Ms. Harris pushed back, saying that it had been almost two decades since
Brown v. Board of Education and that states had largely failed to
integrate public schools. As a result, she argued, it was the federal
government’s responsibility to step in.

On Friday, Mr. Biden told the crowd gathered in Chicago: “Folks, the
discussion in this race today shouldn’t be about the
past.”
