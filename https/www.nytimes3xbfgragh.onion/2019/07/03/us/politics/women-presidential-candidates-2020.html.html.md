GREENVILLE, S.C. — Some people whisper it, some apologize for it, and
some are very careful to mention their neighbors — their neighbors would
be the ones to ask.

“Do you really think a woman could be elected president?”

In ways subtle and overt, Democrats keep hearing that same question,
even days after debates where [Senator Kamala Harris commanded the
stage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-busing-joe-biden.html)
and Senator Elizabeth Warren dominated the policy discussion.

It’s the anxiety of a party still carrying the scars of its 2016 defeat.

“My colleagues, some have said that to me, and I just have to push back
and say, ‘Wait just a minute,’” said Representative Barbara Lee of
California, who worked as a young organizer for former Representative
Shirley Chisholm’s 1972 presidential bid. “I’m just quite frankly
shocked to still hear them in 2019.”

Three years after nominating the first woman in history to head a
presidential ticket, nearly six months after a [wave of energized
women](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/11/09/us/women-elected-midterm-elections.html)
swept Democrats into power in the House, and as a record number of women
run for president, the party finds itself grappling with the strangely
enduring question of the electability of women — and with the challenge
for the candidates of refuting it before it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

Also, before real life descends into parody: “I Don’t Hate Women
Candidates — I Just Hated Hillary and Coincidentally I’m Starting to
Hate Elizabeth Warren” was the title of a [satirical
essay](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-dont-hate-women-candidates-i-just-hated-hillary-and-coincidentally-im-starting-to-hate-elizabeth-warren)
published late last year on the website McSweeney’s that circulated
widely on social media.

Privately, Democratic strategists, candidates and officials say they’ve
been alarmed by how deeply doubts about female electability have taken
hold. In polling, interviews and focus groups, a portion of the party’s
voters suggest they’re eager to see a woman on the ticket but fear that
putting her in the top slot could cost them the White House — again. The
question comes up frequently in early primary states, including at
events organized for female voters.

Much of the concern centers not on what Democratic voters themselves say
they want but a prediction of what they believe others will support.

That left the women in the race with a considerable challenge for last
week’s debates: introducing themselves to voters while also finding a
way to tackle the lingering doubt that this country would elect a female
president.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Immediately after the debate, strategists said they succeeded, arguing
the six women onstage left little doubt that a woman could win. The
female candidates spoke, on average, more than their male rivals, and
Ms. Harris’s performance was considered by many to be the best of either
night. A [poll conducted by
CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-poll/index.html)
in the days after the debate [showed both Ms. Harris and Ms. Warren
making

Yet echoes of the question persisted.

“Is it time for a female president?” a reporter asked Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand, interrupting her attack on Mr. Biden’s position on gun
control before a crowd of cameras in the spin room Thursday. She shot
back, midsentence: “It is. It should be me.”

When asked whether she thought about the higher bar she faces to be seen
as presidential while on the stage, Ms. Harris said simply: “I’m just
being
me.”

*\[*[*Here are the Democrats at risk of missing the cutoff for the next
debates*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/03/us/politics/july-democratic-debate-participants.html)*.\]*

But the women running for president are not seen as just being
themselves — or just candidates. They are women candidates. That can be
infuriating to prominent female Democrats, who argue that their party is
adopting a retrograde narrative based in little more than post-traumatic
stress from the last presidential campaign.

“The fact that a woman hasn’t won yet does not mean that a woman cannot
win,” said Senator Patty Murray, the highest-ranking Democratic woman in
Senate leadership. “I’m confident that, should one get through the
primaries, she will do well.”

For the candidates, the question of whether a woman can win leads to the
challenge of confidently projecting the idea that one can, while also
hoping people simply stop asking.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Gillibrand, who has made female empowerment a theme of her
candidacy, argued that the 2018 elections showed that voters are
comfortable voting for women — whether or not the political class
believes it.

“They just need more exposure,” Ms. Gillibrand said of the female
presidential candidates. “I truly believe that.”

*\[*[*Ms. Harris and Ms. Warren gained in post-debate
polls*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-polls.html)*.\]*

For years, organizations that promote women in politics argued that
having multiple women running for president — rather than the
one-and-only nature of Mrs. Clinton’s campaigns — would demystify the
idea of a female president. Now, with six women running, they are
discussing how to more aggressively dispel questions around whether a
woman could get elected president.

“I’m urging voters and activists, I’m urging donors and I’m urging the
entire Washington press community that this race is wide open,” said
Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily’s List, which supports female
Democratic candidates. “Don’t let yourself get limited by things like
gender.”

In the early months of the contest to choose a candidate to unseat
President Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s argument that he could woo white
men in the Midwest seemed to hold considerable appeal.

“There are people who are not necessarily strong Biden people, but they
think he’s the strongest candidate,” said Sara Riley, a 59-year-old
lawyer from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who is a longtime supporter of Mr.
Biden. “They love Senator Harris or Senator Warren, but they are
concerned about whether they can
win.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 defeat, more people have acknowledged the
higher standards faced by female candidates, who research shows are
disproportionately punished for traits that voters accept in male
politicians, including ambition and aggression.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Kathy Sullivan, the former head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party,
said some voters are conflating the fact that Mrs. Clinton lost with the
fact that she was the first woman to get so far, and urged them to “snap
out of it.”

Even some Republicans dismiss the idea: “I don’t believe gender plays a
role in their ability to win,” said Jeff Roe, a strategist who ran the
presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. “I think
how left-wing loony their ideas have become will be much more
important.”

Yet a[recent
poll](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-and-kamala-harris-are-being-held-back-by-sexist-voters-exclusive-poll-finds?ref=home)
conducted by Ipsos for The Daily Beast showed that while three-quarters
of respondents said they were personally comfortable with a female
president, only a third believed their neighbors would feel the same — a
question pollsters ask to get a sense of opinions that voters may be
embarrassed to tell someone they hold themselves.

Another survey, conducted by Avalanche Strategy, a liberal
communications firm, found that nearly a quarter of voters who initially
picked a male candidate said that if they had a “magic wand” to crown
someone president, they would pick a woman.

“Honestly, I love Elizabeth Warren, I just worry that we as a society
are not ready for that,” said Ann Mason, 44, from Cedar Rapids, after
hearing Ms. Warren and other candidates speak at a state party event
last month. “This election is far too important. We just have to get
Donald Trump out. From there on, I think the door is open to whoever.”

Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii had a message for voters like Ms. Mason:
“We should not do it to ourselves that a woman cannot be a president.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, the widespread nature of the electability question has prompted
many of the female candidates to address the problem.

At an event in Iowa earlier this summer, Ms. Gillibrand put it bluntly:
“To the pundit class who still says, ‘Can a woman win?’ Yes, of course
we can.”

Ms. Warren often mentions her 2012 Senate victory against Scott Brown, a
well-liked Republican incumbent — a win that made her the first woman
elected to the Senate in Massachusetts history. Her implicit message:
She can win tough races.

Ms. Harris also highlights her barrier-breaking career as the first
female district attorney in San Francisco’s history, the first black
female attorney general of California and the second black female
senator. On the campaign stump, she often recounts being asked to
describe “what it’s like to be the first woman
fill-in-the-blank.”

“I’d look at them and say, you know, I don’t really know how to answer
that question because I’ve always been one. But I’m sure a man could do
the job just as well,” she said.

“I don’t think she can win. And I’m sorry to have to say that. She is a

who is supporting Ms. Harris. “As a black woman myself, I think that as

sorority](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/01/us/politics/kamala-harris-alpha-kappa-alpha.html),
which Ms. Harris joined as a student at Howard, some of the attendees
spoke of their pride in her run so far, praising her debate performance,
but also of their concerns about electability.

“It’s just — is she going to be able to do it?” said Kayla Wilson, who
works at a nonprofit in Dallas. “I’ve been in America long enough to
know that we’ve come a long way, but maybe not that far.”

Strategists to the female candidates say they are studying how Barack
Obama overcame skepticism of his 2008 effort to become the country’s
first black president. In the fall of 2007, Mr. Obama lagged far behind
Mrs. Clinton, including among black voters. The campaign focused on
Iowa, believing that the question “Could a black man win?” could only be
answered there. His poll numbers changed rapidly after he won the Iowa
caucus in January.

“In terms of electability, the best cure of that is winning,” said David
Axelrod, a former top adviser to Mr. Obama.

And Democrats are focused on that cure. The obsession with predicting
who will win has led to some strange dynamics at this stage of the race.

While the female candidates promote their ability to triumph in tough
races, several of the male candidates, including Senator Cory Booker of
New Jersey and Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, have all but
promised to select a woman as their vice-presidential nominee.

Picking a woman for the second spot on the ticket comes up frequently at
events for the male candidates. Sarah Barnes and her husband, Phil
McGarvey, braved a cold mist — while wearing matching orange rain
jackets — to catch Mr. Biden at an event in Nashua, N.H. in May, a month
before the first debate. Ms. Barnes, 74, suggested what she saw as the
ideal scenario.

“We both want Kamala as a running mate,” she
said.
