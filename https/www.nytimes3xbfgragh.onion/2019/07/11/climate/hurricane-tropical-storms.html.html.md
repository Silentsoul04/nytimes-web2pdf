When a tropical storm is approaching, its intensity or wind speed often
gets the bulk of the attention. But as [Tropical Storm Barry bore down
on the Gulf
Coast](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/11/us/hurricane-barry-tropical-storm-questions.html),
it was the water that the storm would bring with it that had weather
watchers worried.

The National Weather Service called for roughly 10 to 20 inches of rain
to fall from late [Thursday night through
Saturday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/11/us/hurricane-barry-tropical-storm-questions.html).
The average rainfall for July in New Orleans, which is in the path of
the storm, is just under six inches.

And Tropical Storm Barry, which may become a Category 1 hurricane before
making landfall, will drop rain on already saturated land. On Wednesday,
the region was hit by severe thunderstorms, which dropped as much as
seven inches of rain according to [preliminary National Weather Service
data](https://w2.weather.gov/climate/getclimate.php?date=&wfo=lix&sid=LA&pil=RTPxx&recent=yes&specdate=2019-07-11+00%3A34%3A52).

“Climate change is in general increasing the frequency and intensity of
heavy rainfall storms,” said Andreas Prein, a project scientist with the
National Center for Atmospheric Research.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This week’s rainfall came after the region experienced an extremely wet
spring, causing the region’s rivers to swell, and raising concerns that
the upcoming storm may overtop levees in New Orleans. “If you look at
the records, mostly it’s the water that kills most people,” Dr. Prein
said.

In an email interview, David Gochis, a hydrometerological scientist at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that flooding of the
Mississippi River had left very little room to accommodate additional
water, and that the storm surge would inhibit river water from flowing
out to sea.

“The ingredients are there for a real catastrophe if the flood control
infrastructure simply gets overwhelmed,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent years, researchers have found that hurricanes have lingered
longer, as Barry is expected to do, and dumped more rainfall — a sign of
climate change, said Christina Patricola, a research scientist at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and a co-author of [a study that
found that climate
chang](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0673-2)e is making
tropical cyclones wetter. (Tropical cyclones include both hurricanes and
tropical storms, which are hurricanes’ less speedier kin.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Researchers have been studying the effects of climate change on tropical
cyclones because those sorts of storms are driven by warm water. Water
in the gulf is 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius warmer, according to Dr. Prein,
who said: “This is really increasing the likelihood of a hurricane to
form in this basin. And it will increase the intensity of the hurricane
as
well.”

Though storms can form at any time, the Atlantic hurricane season
stretches from June 1 through Nov. 30 because that is typically when the
Atlantic Ocean’s waters are warm enough to sustain storms. But t[he
oceans are now warmer than
ever](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/10/climate/ocean-warming-climate-change.html):
They have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat caused by
human-released greenhouse gas emissions.

“We wanted to understand how climate change so far could have influenced
tropical cyclone events,” Dr. Patricola said about her study. “And then
the second part is to understand how future warming could influence
these events.”

The researchers used climate models to simulate how tropical cyclone
intensity, or wind speed, and rainfall would change if hurricanes like
Katrina, Irma and Maria had occurred absent climate change and under
future climate scenarios. They found that for all three storms, climate
change increased rainfall by up to 9 percent.

This study is not the first to find that climate change is causing
tropical cyclones to have more rainfall. Studies on Hurricane Harvey
found that climate change contributed as[much as 38 percent, or 19
inches, of the more than 50 inches of rain that fell in some
places.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/13/climate/hurricane-harvey-climate-change.html)
Dr. Patricola’s study broadens the research by using global climate
models and analyzing a large number of storms.

“What’s really interesting is that, regardless of the methodology that
you use, we’re starting to see more and more evidence that climate
change so far has been enhancing the rainfall on some of these recent
hurricane events,” she said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the researchers looked at the impact on storms under some possible
future conditions, they found that under scenarios with higher
greenhouse gas emissions there would be more rainfall associated with
storms. The largest increases would occur over regions, like the Gulf
Coast, that also have the heaviest historical rainfalls.

In other words, the wetter places are just going to get
wetter.

Expected rainfall and path for a storm that threatens Louisiana.

And the structure of cities may exacerbate the problem even further,
said Gabriele Villarini, an associate professor of civil and
environmental engineering at the University of Iowa.

At issue: Dirt absorbs water, but paved surfaces such as roads,
sidewalks and even the footprint of building homes that make up cities
don’t. The end result is that less water gets absorbed and the excess
inevitably has to go somewhere.

Dr. Villarini and his colleagues researched what might have happened in
Houston in 2017 during [Hurricane
Harvey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/100000005395222/hurricane-harveys-damage-in-texas.html)
if the area had been cropland. They looked at both the changes in
rainfall patterns that cities cause as well as differences in how water
behaves based on ground type. They found that the twin effects increased
the likelihood of extreme flooding by 21 times, he said.

In addition to factors faced by most cities, New Orleans has some unique
geological factors at play. There are degraded wetlands and a complex
drainage system that keeps much of the city dry enough for development
but has also contributed to roughly half of the city sinking below sea
level, making it especially vulnerable.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Villarini noted that in the case of Hurricane Harvey, even absent
the impact of urbanization, there was “a huge amount of rainfall. And
I’m struggling to think how you would design a city so that basically
you would be able to zero out any effect of flooding.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Figuring out how to do that is something that researchers are working
on, particularly in places that, unlike New Orleans, are subject both to
intense rainfalls and intense periods of drought.

In places along the Texas Gulf Coast, for example, “we have too much
water during the floods and not enough water during the drought,” said
Qian Yang, a research associate in geology at the University of Texas at
Austin.

To help balance out that flow, Dr. Yang looked at a concept known as
[managed aquifer recharge and studied sites in
Texas.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab148e)

The idea is that because aquifers, or large bodies of permeable rock
that contain groundwater, get depleted during droughts, cities should
work to refill them during times of significant rainfall. The potential
benefit would be to avoid the large capital construction, and large
geographic footprint, that comes with building new reservoirs because
these aquifers already exist.

For the Houston area, the researchers found that under high flow
scenarios they could recharge aquifers with roughly the same amount of
water as contained in Lake Mead, a [reservoir formed by the Hoover
Dam.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/19/climate/colorado-river-water.html)

But in the case of extreme rain events like Hurricane Harvey and what is
expected of a potential Hurricane Barry, “you would need some sort of
interim storage because the aquifers can’t take the water in that fast,”
said Bridget R. Scanlon, a senior research scientist in geoscience at
the University of Texas at Austin and co-author on the study.

What many scientists and experts agree on: As climate change increases
extreme precipitation, [cities will need to
adapt](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/climate/seawalls-cities-cost-climate-change.html).
