But it is unclear if prosecutors plan to file additional charges in the
case, which led to the conviction of Michael D. Cohen, the president's
former lawyer.

A federal judge in Manhattan disclosed on Wednesday that prosecutors
have concluded their investigation into campaign finance violations
involving President Trump and ordered that they publicly release some of
their files, a new twist in a case that had threatened to upend the
Trump presidency.

The judge's order did not answer one of the lingering questions of the
investigation: whether prosecutors in the United States attorney's
office in Manhattan still plan to file additional charges in connection
with the case.

The investigation, which centered on hush money payments arranged during
the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs
with Mr. Trump, already resulted in the conviction of the president's
former fixer, Michael D. Cohen.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html}{Mr.
Cohen, who is now serving a three-year prison sentence}, has said he
helped arrange the hush money at the direction of Mr. Trump,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/07/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence.html}{an
accusation that the federal prosecutors in Manhattan ultimately repeated
in court papers.}

In ordering the unsealing of search warrants and related documents in
connection with a 2018 raid on Mr. Cohen's home and office, the judge,
William H. Pauley III, said the campaign finance violations discussed in
the papers ``are a matter of national importance.''

``Now that the government's investigation into those violations has
concluded,'' Judge Pauley wrote, ``it is time that every American has an
opportunity to scrutinize the materials.''

As recently as this spring, prosecutors were still considering whether
one Trump Organization executive was untruthful when testifying before
the grand jury in the Cohen case, according to people briefed on the
matter.

The prosecutors have also examined Mr. Trump's role in the hush-money
arrangements, and effectively labeled him an unindicted co-conspirator.
Justice Department policy holds that a sitting president cannot be
indicted.

Prosecutors have not told the Trump Organization, or its executives,
that the investigation has been closed, according to people briefed on
the matter.

The United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.
The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment, but a
lawyer for Mr. Trump declared victory.

``We are pleased that the investigation surrounding these ridiculous
campaign finance allegations is now closed,'' said the lawyer, Jay
Sekulow. ``We have maintained from the outset that the president never
engaged in any campaign finance violation.''

Mr. Trump has denied having affairs with the two women, Stephanie
Clifford,\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/04/us/politics/trump-hush-payment-stormy-daniels.html}{an
adult film actress known as Stormy Daniels, and Karen McDougal,} a
Playboy centerfold.

Michael D. Monico, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, was surprised by the ruling,
because, he said, ``I do believe he has provided substantial and
significant information.

The records that the judge ordered unsealed may reveal new details about
the role played by members of the president's inner circle in the
hush-money arrangements.

In his three-page order, Judge Pauley directed prosecutors to publicly
file, with only minimal redactions, a confidential report that they had
sent to him detailing the status of their investigation. The underlying
search warrants and other records were also to be filed publicly, with
limited redactions.

The material is expected to be released Thursday morning.

An original set of nearly 900 pages of search warrants and other records
that contained extensive redactions was ordered released by the judge in
March in response to a request by The New York Times and other news
organizations. Judge Pauley ordered prosecutors to provide him with the
confidential status report by this week.

Judge Pauley is still allowing the prosecutors to black out some
portions, which he called ``limited references'' to an ``uncharged
third-party.'' The identity of that person is unclear.

In a separate inquiry, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also
investigating Mr. Trump's inaugural committee, an investigation that
evolved out of the Cohen case.

Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.
