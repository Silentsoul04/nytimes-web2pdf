Alfred Portale, the chef whose name has been synonymous for 34 years
with [Gotham Bar and Grill](https://www.gothambarandgrill.com/), a
mainstay near Union Square, is no longer in the kitchen there. He has
been replaced as executive chef by Victoria Blamey, who rose to
prominence as the executive chef at Chumley’s, in the West Village, from
2016 to 2017.

Mr. Portale, who plans to open his own restaurant, Portale, this fall in
Chelsea, left the job several weeks ago, after his business partners —
Jerome Kretchmer, Jeff Bliss, Robert Rathe and Richard Rathe — decided
to change the direction of the restaurant.

Mr. Portale, 65, took charge of the kitchen in 1985, a year after Gotham
opened, and remains a partner. In an interview on Tuesday, he said that
discussions about updating the restaurant began a few years ago. “At
first I was involved in the process,” Mr. Portale said. “But finally, it
did not happen the way I would have liked it to.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said he informed his partners in January that he had signed a lease
for the new restaurant, hoping that would give him time to train a new
chef for Gotham. But then the search for a replacement kicked into high
gear, he said, and his partners shut him out of the process.

Mr. Kretchmer, one of the partners, said, “We wanted to make some
changes, and Alfred was a little uncomfortable with the changes we
wanted. Also Alfred opening another restaurant was not consistent with
what we wanted to do.”

It’s not uncommon for a prominent chef to run more than one restaurant.
Mr. Portale himself once ran Gotham Steak in Miami Beach.

Still, Mr. Kretchmer said that “the whole thing was amicable — there are
no hard feelings.” The partners plan to close briefly in August to make
some cosmetic changes to the restaurant. “It will have a different
future,” he said. “We’re still working out the details.”

Using an employment recruiter, the partners interviewed a number of
chefs before choosing Ms. Blamey, 39. A native of Santiago, Chile, who
worked at restaurants in Spain and Australia before coming to New York
for stints at Corton, Atera, [Il Buco Alimentari e
Vineria](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/02/15/dining/reviews/il-buco-alimentari-e-vineria-nyc-restaurant-review.html)
and Upland. Her work at the renovated Chumley’s drew a [two-star
review](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/31/dining/chumleys-review-bar-west-village.html)
from Pete Wells of The New York Times.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Chumley’s is emphatically worth going to,” he wrote, “as long as Ms.
Blamey remains content to work in that kitchen.”

Ms. Blamey, who has been cooking in pop-ups since leaving Chumley’s, is
developing her menu gradually. She said she expected to keep Gotham’s
steak and caviar services when the new menu debuts in September.

She also said she wanted to add some multiculturalism to the fare. The
restaurant has long been known for Mr. Portale’s often trendsetting
new-American cuisine, which Sam Sifton awarded three stars [in a 2011
review](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/05/18/dining/reviews/gotham-bar-and-grill-nyc-restaurant-review.html)
in The Times.

“This is a multicultural city, so the menu will be a melting pot,” she
said. “Maybe some kind of Indian sauce. Or whatever chiles I see in the
market.”

Mr. Portale, asked what Gotham Bar and Grill would be like without him,
said, “I’ve gotten used to the idea, but most people would find it
shocking that I’m no longer there.”
