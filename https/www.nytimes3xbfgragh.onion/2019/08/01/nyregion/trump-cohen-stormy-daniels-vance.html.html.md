State prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed President Trump’s family
business on Thursday, reviving an investigation into the company’s role
in hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign,
according to people briefed on the matter.

The subpoena, issued by the Manhattan district attorney’s office,
demanded the Trump Organization provide documents related to money that
had been used to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film
actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.

The inquiry from the district attorney’s office, which is in early
stages, is examining whether any senior executives at the company filed
false business records about the hush money, which would be a state
crime, the people said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Marc L. Mukasey, an attorney for the Trump Organization, called the
inquiry a “political hit job.”

“It’s just harassment of the president, his family and his business,
using subpoenas as weapons. We will respond as appropriate,” Mr. Mukasey
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The investigation will focus on a $130,000 payment [Michael D.
Cohen,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html?module=inline)
the president’s lawyer and fixer at the time, gave Ms. Daniels. Mr.
Cohen also helped arrange for a tabloid media company to pay the Playboy
model Karen McDougal, a second woman who said she had had an affair with
the president. The disclosure of the payments ignited a scandal that
threatened to derail the Trump presidency.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office on Thursday separately
subpoenaed the media company, American Media Inc., the publisher of the
National Enquirer.

The subpoenas from Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney,
came only weeks after[the Trump Organization had appeared to fend off
federal scrutiny of the same
payments.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/18/nyregion/stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-documents.html)

The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, which charged Mr.
Cohen last year with campaign finance violations in the hush-money case,
revealed in a court filing last month that prosecutors had “effectively
concluded” their inquiry, signaling that it was unlikely they would file
additional charges.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But state law makes it a crime to falsify business records, offering the
Manhattan district attorney’s office another avenue.

The Trump Organization reimbursed Mr. Cohen for his payment to Ms.
Daniels. State prosecutors are examining whether the company — and any
of its senior executives — then falsely listed the reimbursement as a
legal expense, the people briefed on the matter said.

Following the groundwork laid in the federal investigation, the district
attorney’s office is expected to scrutinize the senior ranks of the
company, although it is unclear whether the inquiry will reach the
president. [Mr. Trump has denied the affairs and any
wrongdoing.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/04/us/politics/trump-hush-payment-stormy-daniels.html?module=inline)

While Mr. Cohen has said he arranged the hush-money at the direction of
Mr. Trump — and federal prosecutors have since repeated that accusation
in court papers — less is publicly known about the president’s role.
[Mr. Cohen is currently serving a three-year prison sentence in
Otisville,
N.Y.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html?module=inline)

A spokesman for American Media Inc., the media company that was
subpoenaed, did not respond to a request for comment. The company bought
the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story of an affair with Mr. Trump and never
ran the story. The company, whose leader was friends with Mr. Trump,
cooperated with the federal investigation and received a nonprosecution
agreement.

The district attorney’s office initially considered mounting the inquiry
nearly a year ago, after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty. Mr. Vance’s office
paused at the request of the federal prosecutors.

Mr. Vance’s latest foray into the hush-money case could present a legal
and political quandary.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers will try to portray Mr. Vance, a Democrat, as
leading a partisan attack. Earlier this year, similar criticism was
leveled by a lawyer for [Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign
chairman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing.html).
After Mr. Manafort was convicted of federal crimes, Mr. Vance’s office
charged him with state felonies in hopes he would still face prison if
he received a presidential pardon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, if Mr. Vance declined to bring charges in the hush-money case,
the decision could fuel criticism that he has pulled punches with the
Trump family. His office previously declined to charge two of Mr.
Trump’s children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who were under
criminal investigation in 2012 over allegations that they misled buyers
interested in the Trump SoHo hotel-condominium project.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Vance declined to comment on Thursday’s subpoenas.

Even if the new investigation ultimately leads to charges, state law
would limit the severity of the punishment. A charge of filing false
business records could amount to a misdemeanor. It becomes a felony only
if prosecutors can prove that the filing was done to commit or conceal
another crime.

It is unclear whether, under the law, the state prosecutors can cite the
federal campaign finance violations as the other crime.
