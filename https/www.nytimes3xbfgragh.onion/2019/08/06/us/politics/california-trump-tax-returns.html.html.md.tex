WASHINGTON --- President Trump and the Republican National Committee
filed a pair of lawsuits on Tuesday against officials in California
challenging a new law requiring presidential candidates to release five
years of tax returns in order to be placed on the state primary ballot
in 2020.

The R.N.C. suit, which was filed in the Eastern District of California
and included the California Republican Party and several California
Republican voters as plaintiffs, called the law a ``naked political
attack against the sitting president of the United States.'' It was
filed against Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California secretary of state.

Mr. Trump and his campaign filed a second suit challenging the
constitutionality of the new law, and it named the California secretary
of state and the state attorney general. In that suit, they argue that
states do not have the power to ``supplement'' the qualifications for
the president, set forth by the Constitution.

The California law, known as the Presidential Tax Transparency and
Accountability Act, was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/30/us/politics/california-trump-tax-returns.html}{signed
by Mr. Newsom last week}, and was the latest flash point between the
White House and the State of California, which is involved in more than
40 lawsuits against the Trump administration, on issues including
environmental regulation and immigration.

The California State Legislature approved a similar measure in 2017, but
the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, vetoed it, raising questions
about whether it was constitutional.

The suits filed Tuesday claim that the law would suppress the votes of
millions of Californians who want to vote for Mr. Trump by adding a new
requirement for a presidential candidate. The R.N.C. suit asserts that
Mr. Newsom was creating an ``extra-constitutional qualification for the
office of president.'' The suit argues that Democratic-controlled state
legislatures were challenging Mr. Trump because they were ``enraged'' by
his 2016 victory, when he did not disclose his federal tax returns.

The two lawsuits followed a complaint filed in Sacramento on Monday by
Judicial Watch, a conservative group, on behalf of four California
voters, seeking to block the law on constitutional grounds.

``There's an easy fix for the president,'' Mr. Newsom said in a
statement. ``He should release his tax returns as he promised during the
campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973.''

The vast majority of presidential nominees over decades have released
their tax returns, with the exception of President Gerald Ford in 1976.
Mr. Trump's decision not to release his tax returns was one of the early
traditions he shattered. But Mr. Newsom's attempt to codify the
tradition of disclosure into a law has raised serious constitutional
issues, according to legal scholars.

``The complaint includes more political rhetoric than is common, but it
raises the correct legal issues that certainly pose serious challenges
to this law,'' said Richard H. Pildes, a professor of constitutional law
at New York University.

In a statement, Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the R.N.C., said that ``it
certainly doesn't bode well for Democrats heading into 2020 that their
best bet for beating President Trump is to deny millions of Californians
the ability to vote for him.''

She called it a ``stunt'' that was ``unconstitutional and, simply put,
desperate.''

Jay Sekulow, counsel to Mr. Trump and to the campaign, called the
campaign's lawsuit a ``decisive action in federal court challenging
California's attempt to circumvent the U.S. Constitution.'' He said
``the issue of whether the president should release his federal tax
returns was litigated in the 2016 election and the American people
spoke.''
