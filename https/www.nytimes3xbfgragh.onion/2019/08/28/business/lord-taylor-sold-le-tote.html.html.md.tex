The clothing rental craze is coming for the struggling department store.

Hudson's Bay
\href{https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190828005408/en/}{said on
Wednesday} that Lord \& Taylor, the beleaguered department store chain
founded in 1826, would be acquired by Le Tote, a seven-year-old clothing
rental start-up.

In an unusual deal, Hudson's Bay, the chain's parent company, will
continue to own Lord \& Taylor's real estate and cover Le Tote's rent at
those properties for three years. Le Tote will pay \$100 million in cash
for Lord \& Taylor's brand and inventory and take control of 38 stores
and the chain's digital presence. Five stores will close as part of the
transaction, but the company did not say which ones.

Lord \& Taylor will continue to make regular sales, but the acquisition
will add ``millions of pieces of inventory to our selection,'' Rakesh
Tondon, a co-founder and the chief executive of Le Tote, said in an
interview. ``This is going to be the most robust inventory offering of
any rental service or any subscription service out there.''

It's a surprising marriage, especially given the relatively low profile
of Le Tote. The San Francisco-based company, started in 2012, lacks the
name recognition of Rent the Runway, the best-known clothing rental
business, and has raised only \$75 million in venture capital. (It is
still securing financing for the purchase.) It is one-tenth the size of
Lord \& Taylor based on revenue, Mr. Tondon said.

The idea emerged from discussions Le Tote was having with Lord \& Taylor
about helping the chain develop rental and subscription services, he
said. Clothing and accessory rentals have been on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/08/style/rent-subscription-clothing-furniture.html}{a
tear recently}, attracting interest from high-end designers to mall
chains like American Eagle. The start-up grew to believe it could use
its technology and data know-how to personalize store visits and online
shopping for Lord \& Taylor customers, while injecting new fuel into its
rental offering.

``The crux of our rental business is the technology and tools that allow
us to offer a really personalized experience to every single customer,''
Mr. Tondon said.

He described a long-term vision where a customer could download a Lord
\& Taylor app, visit a store and walk up to a screen that would
recognize her. The customer would receive product recommendations based
on her digital browsing habits, and a fitting room could be curated for
her, Mr. Tondon said.

The purchase most likely comes as a relief for Hudson's Bay, which has
been stymied by how to handle Lord \& Taylor. The Canadian retail group,
which also owns Saks, has closed Lord \& Taylor stores,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/24/business/lord-taylor-wework.html}{sold
the chain's storied New York flagship building} to WeWork and even
started
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/16/business/walmart-lord-and-taylor-website.html}{selling
its wares} on Walmart's website. Hudson's Bay said in May that it was
pursuing ``strategic alternatives'' for Lord \& Taylor.

Helena Foulkes, the company's chief executive, has said that Lord \&
Taylor is in ``the middle'' among retailers, which she views as the
toughest place to be. ``It's neither the high-end luxury where you can
really own it, nor is the low-cost deep discount retailer,'' Ms. Foulkes
said in
\href{https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/3/9/18256683/hudsons-bay-helena-foulkes-saks-fifth-avenue-kara-swisher-podcast-interview-commerce-recode-decode}{an
interview} with Recode in March.

On Wednesday, Ms. Foulkes said in an interview that the deal would bring
much more technology into Lord \& Taylor stores and allow Hudson's Bay
to focus on its Saks Fifth Avenue chain and ``real estate opportunities
down the road.''

``It's unique to have a technology company purchasing a department store
chain,'' Ms. Foulkes said. She added that it was also good for
associates, as an acquisition by a regional chain would probably have
eliminated more jobs.

Mr. Tondon said on Wednesday that Lord \& Taylor had about 180 corporate
employees and 4,000 store-related workers, while Le Tote had 250
employees. Ms. Foulkes did not specify how many Lord \& Taylor employees
would lose their jobs, saying the ``vast majority'' would be asked to
stay.

Lord \& Taylor customers could start seeing signs of Le Tote in stores
in the next few months. The start-up's subscribers may also see hundreds
of new brands and new options for buying undergarments, swimwear and
cosmetics through the service.

Mr. Tondon said that the companies were preparing for ``the customer of
the future.''

``A lot of them will buy, a lot of them will rent, they'll come into
stores and return online,'' he said. ``We want to be able to offer
customers the ability to do all of the above.''
