# Italy’s Politics Go to the Beach

For decades, immigrant peddlers have been part of the familiar fabric of

ORBETELLO, Italy — The girls, tanning their arms and tattooed ankles,
looked up from their phones to sift through the caftans hanging from the
Moroccan peddler’s cart. The fathers and sons kicking around orange
balls paused to check out the sun hats that a Bangladeshi had balanced
on his head. Mothers, fresh from cooling their legs in the sea, were
implored by their children to consider the plastic sand buckets and
inflatable flamingos that a Senegalese had spread at their feet.

For decades, migrant beach peddlers — disparagingly called vu cumprà or
“wanna-buys”— **** have sidestepped cat-walking musclemen to march
right into the familiar fabric of the Italian beach holiday. Heat waves
and economic downturns made their jobs harder. Now, so do politics.

Exasperation in Italy over the migrant crisis prompted the rise of a
hard-right, populist government, and the crackdown it imposed took many
forms, from [blocking aid ships carrying rescued asylum
seekers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/01/world/europe/italy-mayors-migrants-salvini-security-decree.html)
to a much-lesser-known program called Operation Safe Beaches.

Introduced by **** the anti-migrant Interior Minister [Matteo
Salvini](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/08/world/europe/matteo-salvini-italy-beach.html),
the operation earmarked millions of euros for seaside communities to
patrol the beaches for unlicensed peddlers, especially those trafficking
in counterfeit goods.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“At last,” Mr. Salvini said at a rally at a Sabaudia beach. “We will
make sure that Italians can spend a quiet week under the beach umbrella,
after having worked a whole year, without having a vu cumprà annoy
them.”

Mr. Salvini may be gone, a casualty of political overreach that caused
him to stumble out of power and[trigger the formation of a new, more
liberal
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/28/world/europe/italy-government-salvini.html),
but many of his hard-line policies remain in place, including Operation
Safe Beaches.

Up and down the shore, the peddlers still lug their stores of dresses,
bathing suits, blankets, charm bracelets, umbrellas, necklaces, fishing
rods, fake tattoos, inflatable toys, counterfeit bags and sneakers, and
whatever else they can fit in their carryalls. But now they need to look
over their shoulder.

“It’s really hard,” said Gueye Diayua, 29, who arrived from Senegal five
years ago and was walking the Giannella, a strip of soft beach bordered
by pine woods in southern Tuscany, selling African-themed books for a
few euros.

Peddlers like Mr. Diayua are among the few African and South Asian
immigrants that many Italians interact with in a country where
[integration lags far behind other Western
countries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/20/world/europe/italy-tuscany-migration-elections.html).
The rise of hard-right politics in Italy has added a strange layer to an
already odd relationship in which migrants, often fully dressed in pants
and long sleeves and hats, spend the day pitching scantily clad Italians
on the beach.

The Italians mostly ignore
them.

For some, the peddlers are part of the scenery, as incessant and
harmless as the waves lapping on the shore. For others, they are a
painful reminder that Italians, who migrated en masse in search of
economic opportunity a century ago, have failed to welcome and find
legal work for the immigrants. And for those more in line with Mr.
Salvini, the peddlers represent lawlessness and an insidious connection
between migration and the mafia, as well as annoyances to shoo away.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many peddlers seem to have noticed the change. They have become
particularly wary of the police. Some turned on a dime at the sight of a
camera to melt away into the canopy of beach umbrellas. Others ducked
into the dunes.

“This year is tougher than last, because there are more and more
crackdowns from police,” Fatima Diop, 33, said on the Giannella beach as
she earned €5 to adorn a girl’s blonde hair with pink, turquoise and
blue braids.

Orbetello, which includes the Giannella beach, received €40,000 from the
Safe Beaches funds. The police put up fliers warning sunbathers not to
buy goods from unlicensed peddlers, confiscated about 1,000 items and
cruised the beaches in small dune buggies. They warned that Italians who
bought illegal goods faced fines as high as €7,000.

Yet the peddlers keep coming.

Mr. Diayua said he found the sand lighter and easier to walk on at
Giannella, and so he had taken a two-and-a-half-hour train south from
Pisa that morning with scores of other peddlers. Together with more
migrants traveling north from Rome, they walked the familiar path past
abandoned buildings and camper lots, by the Simply supermarket and to
the pine woods shading the
beaches.

Some wondered whether, in the face of the crackdown, it was worth it.

On Ansedonia, a popular beach north of Rome, Kabir Zemron, 49, stood
next to his cart, its umbrellas hanging with floral and monochrome
sundresses, watching Carlotta Robbiano, 26, a district manager for the
lingerie chain Calzedonia try on a purple pareo.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Are you sure it’s only in this color?” she asked.

A few days earlier, Mr. Zemron had more options, but the police had
confiscated an entire cart of goods in a sweep, and he said he could not
afford to pay the €5,000 fine to get them back.

“I’ve stayed put here for years,” said Mr. Zemron, who came to Italy
from Morocco nearly 30 years ago. ”I don’t go around bothering anybody.”

Farther south, on the beach of Capalbio, a redoubt of the left-wing
leadership and liberals whom Mr. Salvini [excoriated as
do-gooders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/13/world/europe/italy-do-gooders-buonisti-matteo-salvini.html),
sympathized with the peddlers’ plight.

“Every year, we buy a little something,” Sara Francescangeli, 66, from
Terni, said as she greeted a Senegalese man known as Jimmy Jim. “He’s
our friend since forever.”

This is the sort of thing that drives some right-wing lawmakers crazy.

“It’s a problem,” said Senator Daniela Santanchè, a member of the
right-wing Brothers of Italy who owns a beach club in Tuscany. “It’s an
open market. The problem is that people also buy things, which is
illegal because they don’t pay taxes. At our club, we hired two security
guards to make sure they don’t bother people.”

In 2017, Ms. Santanchè was photographed looking unbothered at her club,
Twiga Beach, as she lounged on a beach bed and inspected the merchandise
of three African peddlers.

Italians the peddlers remained part of the scenery, as incessant and
harmless as the waves lapping on the
shore.</span><span class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Andrew

Francesca Trevisan, the mayor of Scarlino, said her town, which has
about five miles of beaches, some of them secluded nature reserves and
others densely crowded, badly needed the Safe Beaches funds.

In late July, she said, about ten Senegalese peddlers pushed around two
police officers who were loading confiscated counterfeit goods into
their patrol car. Tourists intervened and called more police officers,
who arrested three men.

“We cannot go on like this,” Ms. Trevisan said.

Yet it seems that is exactly what is happening.

Col. Antonio Del Gaizo, an official for the financial police, said that
while some of the peddlers were independent, seeking to save money and
enter the legal job market, many trafficked in counterfeit goods and
operated under the control of organized crime and the Italian Mafia.

“These are people in a state of need,” Colonel Del Gaizo said. “And so
they are exploited.”

On Ostia beach outside Rome, Mustafa Nguer, 30, who arrived in Italy a
few years ago from Senegal, said he did not understand why politicians
and the police were cracking down so hard.

“It’s better to do this than to rob and steal,” he said as he carried a
bag full of apparently counterfeit sneakers, a pair of which dangled by
the laces around his neck. “It’s not that we want this work, walking up
and down the beach every day.”
