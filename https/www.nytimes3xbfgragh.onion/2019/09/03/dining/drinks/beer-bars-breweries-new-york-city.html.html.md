Now that New York City’s beer boom has brought thriving breweries,
taprooms and beer bars to every borough, new places may have to offer a
little something extra to get attention. Some of this fall’s openings
will do just that: a sprawling food-hall bar with a long, global beer
list; a maritime-themed brew pub with a community events space; a
two-story brewery with a cocktail lounge and live music; and a brewery
using a yeast strain found in a Brooklyn park.

Inside the [Market Line](https://marketline.nyc/) food hall and
marketplace on the Lower East Side — a 150,000 square-foot space,
opening in October as part of the Essex Crossing development — [the
Grand Delancey](https://thegranddelancey.com/) is the first New York
City bar from [Neighborhood Restaurant
Group](https://neighborhoodrestaurantgroup.com/), which operates beer
bars in Washington, D.C., including
[ChurchKey](https://churchkeydc.com/). The Grand Delancey will have a
menu of 50 draft beers from local breweries like [Grimm Artisanal
Ales](https://grimmales.com/) in Brooklyn and respected producers like
[Hill Farmstead](https://hillfarmstead.com/) in Vermont. There will also
be British cask ales and European pilsners, lagers and saisons that are
rarely seen on this side of the Atlantic.

“We’re aiming to show the full spectrum of beer flavor,” said Greg
Engert, the group’s beer director and a managing partner.

Each beer will be served at its ideal temperature — 42, 48 or 54 degrees
— in one of a dozen styles of glasses, accentuating aromatics and taste.
Given the large, diverse list, the Grand Delancey’s bar staff will offer
recommendations and steer patrons toward marketplace food pairings.
Customers can bring in food from Market Line vendors, including dim sum
from [Nom Wah](https://nomwah.com/) and sausages from [Schaller &
Weber](https://schallerweber.com/).

“It’s almost like a beer-and-food pairing lab,” Mr. Engert said.

[Blue Point Brewing](https://www.bluepointbrewing.com), from Long
Island, will open the Hull, a brew pub with a nautical look, under the
sustainable-seafood restaurant [Seamore](https://www.seamores.com/)’s in
Dumbo, Brooklyn. Customers will descend stairs to a room meant to evoke
“the intimate feel of the inside of a ship, just not how cramped it
is,” said the general manager, Chris Chou-Messina. The space has high
ceilings and seating for
55.

Guests can order oysters both baked and raw while enjoying a selection
of 12 beers, half of them brewed on the premises and poured fresh from
the tanks. “This is going to be a center for innovation,” said Rob
Capitelli, the Hull’s brewmaster, who plans to make some experimental
beers.

The taproom’s stage will host live music performances, debates, lectures

[Collective Arts Brewing](https://collectiveartsbrewing.com), based near
Toronto, is building a two-story brewery in Gowanus, Brooklyn, to
produce eclectic sour ales, double I.P.A.s and more. The
16,000-square-foot complex, Collective Arts’ first location in United
States, will serve “elevated street food,” said Matt Johnston, a
founder. There will be mixed-use spaces for art shows and D.J. sets;
bands will play in a cocktail lounge featuring Collective Arts’ own gin.
The aim is a “creative hub for Gowanus,” Mr. Johnston said.

On Saturday, [18th Ward
Brewing](https://www.18thwardbrewing.com/)[Company](https://www.18thwardbrewing.com/)
will open across the street from the popular music hall [Brooklyn
Steel](https://www.bowerypresents.com/venues/brooklyn-steel) in East
Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The 2,500-square-foot brewery’s star ingredient
is a strain of native yeast that the brewer Dailey Crafton isolated from
a log in Cooper Park, a few blocks away.

It has “a really nice bubble gum component,” Mr. Crafton said of the
yeast, which he uses to make farmhouse-style ales like Saison No. 1. The
brewery will also offer I.P.A.s and stouts, and plans to keep six
house-brewed beers on tap. Like the yeast, drinking 18th Ward beers will
be a strictly local experience. The brewery is not aiming to distribute
yet, said Jordan Beldner, an owner, but just looking “to have a good
time.”

**Collective Arts Brewing** 519-529 Third Avenue (between 12th and 13th
Streets), Gowanus, Brooklyn,
[collectiveartsbrewing.com](https://collectiveartsbrewing.com/),
December.
