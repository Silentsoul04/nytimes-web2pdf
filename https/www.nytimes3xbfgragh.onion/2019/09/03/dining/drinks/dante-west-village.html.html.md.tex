Dante West Village will swap the original's Italian feel for a Basque
theme.

Four years ago, Linden Pride and his wife, Nathalie Hudson, bought Caffé
Dante, a beloved, century-old Greenwich Village hangout, and reinvented
it as a stylish Italianate cocktail bar and restaurant.

It was a gamble for the couple, who had immigrated a few years earlier
from their native Australia, but the new bar,
\href{http://www.dante-nyc.com/}{Dante}, caught on. In July, it
\href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlaalindahao/2019/07/20/worlds-best-bar-2019-dante-new-york-wins-top-spot-at-the-13th-annual-spirited-awards/\#7c93e13f4ceb}{won
the award} for World's Best Bar at the Tales of the Cocktail convention
in New Orleans.

Now the owners are preparing a second location, and another gamble.
Rather than stick with the successful Italian theme, Dante West Village
--- a bar and restaurant expected to open in October at the corner of
Hudson and Perry Streets --- will take its cues from Spain's Basque
Country.

``A lot of the inspiration comes from those wonderful grills in San
Sebastian,'' Mr. Pride said. ``Like
\href{http://www.kaia-kaipe.com/}{Kaia-Kaipe,} which is right on the
water halfway between San Sebastian and Bilbao, where they literally
pull the fish out of the ocean and then throw it on the grill.''

The chef at Dante West Village will be Angel Fernandez, a native of
Chile who worked at
\href{http://www.rosettarestaurant.com.au/home/ristorante-melbourne/}{Rosetta
Ristorante} in Melbourne, Australia. He moved to New York in February,
expressly to collaborate on the project.

The drinks menu, devised by Mr. Pride and Dante's creative director,
Naren Young, will focus on two internationally popular drinks: the
spritz and the martini.

``We started playing around with the martini'' at Dante, Mr. Pride said.
``We wanted to see how people would respond to different ways of serving
the martini. It was a huge success.''

\href{https://www.foodrepublic.com/2016/12/15/art-throwing-martinis/}{Thrown
martinis}, a style of preparation found in parts of Spain --- in which
the drink is theatrically poured from one vessel to another over and
over again, giving the cocktail a light, aerated texture --- will be a
specialty at Dante West Village.

One custom drink on the menu is the Mediterranean martini, made of gin,
dry vermouth, thyme, sea salt and mastiha, a liqueur derived from the
hardened sap of the mastic tree. It will be served with a selection of
brightly colored Cerignola olives.

``I see the martini as a great classic cocktail, but I see it also as a
great New York cocktail,'' Mr. Pride said.

The Dante team will have more elbow room at the new place than at the
old. The space seats 75, including 16 at the L-shaped bar, and it will
eventually have sidewalk seating. The owners also took over a
neighboring newsstand, demolishing the wall between it and the
restaurant.

When Mr. Pride and Ms. Hudson took over the Caffé Dante space, they
encountered some resistance from neighbors who feared they would spoil a
treasured local institution. Over time, they and the community came to
accept and embrace each other, even as the bar slowly cultivated a
global reputation.

Mr. Pride expects to learn similar lessons this time around. ``No matter
what you plan or say you want to be,'' he said, ``often it's the
customer who dictates what you become and are known for.''
