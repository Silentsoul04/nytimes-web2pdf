``Natural'' has become the attention-grabbing word in the wine world,
referring to wines that are made with minimal intervention, like
chemical additives or commercial yeast. Natural wines will populate the
lists of several restaurants coming this fall, and they're the
specialties at four new wine bars.

Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske Valtierra, who began serving them
six years ago at their restaurant
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/03/12/dining/restaurant-review-contra-on-the-lower-east-side.html?module=inline}{Contra},
and later at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/07/dining/restaurant-review-wildair-on-the-lower-east-side.html}{Wildair},
will sell only natural wines at Peoples, a wine and spirits shop in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/03/dining/food-halls-nyc.html}{the
new Market Line food hall} on the Lower East Side. They'll pour them at
an adjacent wine bar.

``This is coming full-circle for us,'' Mr. Stone said. ``Customers at
Contra and Wildair would ask about where to buy the wines, and we'd have
to send them elsewhere. Now we can sell them.'' Spirits from small
producers will also be sold in the shop; the bar will serve a rotating
menu of snacky bites like charcuterie and croquettes.

Expect some natural sparkling wines, or pét-nats, at the Riddler, a
Manhattan branch of Jen Pelka's Champagne
\href{https://www.theriddlersf.com/}{bar of the same name} in San
Francisco. In addition to more than 100 Champagnes and other sparklers,
it will several natural ones. The food menu includes oysters, French
bistro fare like charcuterie and gougères, and high-low concoctions like
Tater Tot waffles with smoked salmon and caviar. White-wine stemware,
not flutes, will be used in the intimate room, which is done in black
and white with vintage brass accents.

A natural wine bar in Brooklyn Heights, Pips, from the owners of
\href{http://colonienyc.com/}{Colonie} next door, will have mostly bar
seating for a list of what they're calling ``low-intervention wines''
and Italian-style aperitifs. The food, by Jared Braithwaite, the chef in
both places, will be inspired by coastal Italy.

Kindred, from the team behind the East Village bar
\href{http://ruffiannyc.com/}{Ruffian}, will maintain the parent
restaurant's devotion to natural wines, with a focus on the Adriatic
region.

\textbf{Kindred} 342 East Sixth Street, October.

\textbf{Peoples Wine Shop and the Bar at Peoples} Market Line, 88 Essex
Street (Delancey Street), October.

\textbf{Pips} 129 Atlantic Avenue (Henry Street), Brooklyn Heights,
October.

\textbf{The Riddler} 51 Bank Street (West Fourth Street), September.
