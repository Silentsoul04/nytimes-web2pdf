City}\label{new-food-halls-sprout-up-in-new-york-city}}

The Deco, in the garment district, will host outposts of popular shops,
as expansions come to the Chelsea and Essex markets.

New York has become a food-hall town, with perhaps more of these
collections of food and dining stalls than in any other city in the
country. This season, there will be some showy additions, as operators
are increasingly selective as to who gets to set up shop.

Doris Huang has filled her shiny cobalt-and-gold food hall with a
cross-section of options including Huli Huli for Hawaiian fare, like
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020347-huli-huli-chicken}{huli
huli chicken} (but no poke); Papa Poule rotisserie chicken from the
Maman group;
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/29/dining/nansense-food-truck-review.html}{Nansense}
for Afghan specialties;
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/11/dining/little-tong-noodle-shop-review-east-village.html}{Little
Tong Noodle Shop} from Simone Tong (who is also opening a restaurant,
Silver Apricot, this fall); \href{https://www.maniinpastamenu.com/}{Mani
in Pasta} for pizza and Roman items; and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/20/dining/brazilian-food-rockaways-beach-bistro-96.html}{Beach
Bistro 96} with Brazilian bites from Rockaway Beach. The stalls surround
a big gilded bar for wine, beer and cocktails.

The Deco, 231 West 39th Street (between Seventh and Eighth Avenues),
October.

\hypertarget{8sia}{%
\subsection{8SIA}\label{8sia}}

The stalls in this new two-story space all serve Asian food, as the name
implies, with a focus on street food. The bright stands, assembled by
the developer Chi Zhang, are Yaso Noodle Bar, with pan-fried bao, soup
dumplings and noodles from Shanghai; Rice-On! with bowls, rolls and
sushi; Curry 42, for foods from southeast Asia; Debutea, for bubble,
fruit and cheese tea; and upstairs, Bee Patterns for egg bubble waffles
with gelato.

8sia, 220 East 42nd Street (Second Avenue),
September.\emph{{[}}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/03/dining/fall-restaurant-preview-nyc.html}{\emph{Click

\subsection{The Market Line}\label{the-market-line}}

The dozens of bright stalls in the new Essex Market, which opened in
May, are not enough for the enormous Essex Crossing development on the
Lower East Side. This fall, the Market Line, with another 30 vendors of
prepared food and fresh ingredients, including some restaurants, will
open in the lower level. Coming are
\href{https://schallerweber.com/}{Schaller \& Weber} for sausages;
\href{https://www.tortillerianixtamal.com/}{Tortilleria Nixtamal}'s
Mexican foods; Que Chevere for Puerto Rican food; the
\href{https://marketline.nyc/vendors/grand-delancey/}{Grand Delancey
Beer Hall}, where imbibers can order food from other kiosks; and
\href{https://www.essexpearl.com/}{Essex Pearl}, a fish market, with a
restaurant. Many of the tenants are from the Lower East Side and
Chinatown. Rohan Mehra --- a principal of Prusik Group, a developer and
a founder of the market --- said Market Line will complement, not
compete with, the Essex Market upstairs. By 2021, Market Line will
triple in size to make the whole thing one of the largest city markets
in the world.

The Market Line, 115 Delancey Street (Essex Street), October.

\hypertarget{world-artisan-market}{%
\subsection{World Artisan Market}\label{world-artisan-market}}

This food hall in Astoria, Queens, diverges from the usual formula, with
no communal area for a group of dining destinations. Instead, each stall
is self-contained, with its own seating. ``I didn't want that cafeteria
style,'' said Stephen Lysohir, whose company, EJ Stevens Group, is
developing the 16,000-square-foot space. So far, he has signed
Elevenses, a French-Scandinavian bakery; and Sotto La Luna, an Italian
restaurant and gelato stand. He plans to add others, none of which are
chains, to represent regions like Africa, Asia and the Mediterranean. A
2,000-square-foot outdoor seating area is also planned.

World Artisan Market, 34-39 31st Street (35th Avenue), Astoria, Queens,
November.

\hypertarget{the-chelsea-local}{%
\subsection{The Chelsea Local}\label{the-chelsea-local}}

Chelsea Market, one of the city's first food halls, is expanding Chelsea
Local on its lower level. There will be a new store, Black Seed
Appetizing, from \href{https://www.blackseedbagels.com/}{Black Seed
Bagels}, with smoked fish in sandwiches and by the pound, tinned
seafood, salads and pastries. \href{https://pearlriver.com/}{Pearl River
Mart}, which has a large space on Chelsea Market's ground floor, will
open a food outpost on the lower level, selling Asian items, mostly
groceries and frozen food; \href{https://lasdeliciaspatisserie.com/}{Las
Delicias Patisserie}, a gluten-free bakery at the Union Square
Greenmarket, will open its first shop; and
\href{https://www.dicksonsfarmstand.com/}{Dickson's Farmstand Meats}
will move from the ground floor to a much larger space downstairs.

Chelsea Local, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), September.
