# Tastes From Asia, Not Easy to Find in New York. Until Now.

The fall’s new restaurants will serve a variety, from ancient white soba
noodles to an updated twist on disco fries.

It may take some vertical maneuvering to get there: venturing down into
the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station to try sea pineapple, or up
to the third floor of an office building in Koreatown for abomasum, a
cow stomach. But at new restaurants this fall, New Yorkers can try a
number of dishes and ingredients from around Asia that may be otherwise
hard to find in town.

In the first international outpost of [Sarashina
Horii](https://www.sarashina-horii.com/en/), one of Tokyo’s oldest and
[most celebrated
restaurants](https://watch.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/anthony-bourdain-no-reservations/full-episodes/tokyo),
the ninth-generation soba maker Yoshinori Horii will bring white soba
noodles to the Flatiron district. His family founded the restaurant in
1789, when they served soba to the Japanese Imperial Household.

To make white soba, the buckwheat is milled to shuck the exterior of the
seeds using the same technique employed in making sake from rice. The
noodles are smoother than the traditional, chewier soba. Choosing a
location for his first restaurant outside Japan was easy, Mr. Horii
said: “New York is a showcase to the global
world.”

Another East Asian ingredient, sea pineapple, an edible sea squirt, will
be served at Toko, a moody-looking 18-seat underground sushi bar,
accessible through the entrance to the 34th Street subway station at the
northeast corner of 32nd Street and Broadway. “The texture is somewhere
between an oyster or clam and a geoduck, sort of a crunchy, snappy
texture,” said the chef, J. Trent Harris, who formerly worked at
[Shuko](https://www.shukonyc.com/). The restaurant was developed by
Bobby Kwak and Joseph Ko of Baekjeong Korean Barbecue, a franchise with
locations in [New York](https://www.baekjeongnyc.com/) and [Los
Angeles](http://kijung.com/baekjeong-korean-bbq/). Nami Song, a chef who
worked at Bouley, will be in charge of the hot kitchen.

At Toko, the sea pineapple will be prepared as either nigiri or sashimi,
with a simple vinegar-soy-sauce marinade and a twist of citrus. “It has
a little bit of that petrol note that you get from an aged riesling,”
Mr. Harris said. “And, of course, that
salinity.”

Mr. Kwak and Mr. Ko are also opening a New York outpost of the popular
Los Angeles Korean barbecue restaurant, Ahgassi Gopchang, in Manhattan’s
Koreatown. New York’s Ahgassi, which means “young lady” in Korean, will
serve intestine-based dishes. The restaurant’s name draws from a belief
that “for some reason or other in Korea, many women seem to enjoy tripe
or offal more than men,” said Michael Sim, the chef and a partner.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

One offering will be abomasum, the fourth stomach of a cow, which will
be prepared in a two-day process — first, cleaned to banish unsavory
odors, then marinated in spices before it is grilled. “It’s leftover
cuts that they give to poor people or not as privileged people,” Mr. Sim
said. “But ours is different because it’s marinated. It’s like nothing
I’ve ever had
before.”

Thai Diner, in NoLIta, will revamp an American diner classic — disco
fries, normally covered with cheese and gravy — with a housemade
massaman curry with peanuts and coconut milk. “You often have potatoes
served in the curry, so the two go together,” said the chef, [Ann
Redding](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/09/11/dining/the-family-apron.html),
who owns [Uncle
Boons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/07/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-uncle-boons-in-nolita.html)
and [Uncle Boons Sister](https://www.uncleboonssister.com/) with her
husband, Matt Danzer. “The idea is not to do fusion dishes, but to
literally do classic American diner dishes alongside Thai
dishes.”

<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0" data-aria-hidden="true">Kanom krok,
a staple of Thai street food, is hard to make. It’s a bit of a
logistical nightmare,” said Ann Redding, the chef at Thai Diner. “My mom
definitely raised her eyebrow at me when I told her they would be on the
menu.”</span><span class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Emon

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The diner will also offer kanom krok, a street-food staple in Bangkok
that is harder to find in New York. Ms. Redding described them as
“coconut custard cups,” topped with something savory: traditionally
scallion, corn or taro. If you’re extra nice, you might even get the
off-the-menu option: caviar, freshly scooped.

In another fast-casual joint, the financial district sandwich shop [Don
Wagyu](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/25/dining/don-wagyu-sandwich-japan-sando.html)
is using its move to [Bowery Market](http://www.thebowerymarket.com/) to
introduce the Hot Wagyu. The open-faced sandwich will give dry-aged
Wagyu beef a Nashville-hot-chicken twist: It will be brined in
buttermilk and the Japanese spice togarashi before it is heated on the
griddle.

“I thought of it late at night one night, and I just wrote it down on my
phone,” said Corwin Kave, the executive chef. The $26 offering will be
served on a piece of Balthazar bread and topped with a sauce of
fermented chile, ginger and sansho pepper. “It’s my favorite thing on
the menu,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Luxury will also masquerade as a snack at Dhamaka, an Indian restaurant
coming to the Lower East Side. At this newest collaboration from Roni
Mazumdar and the chef Chintan Pandya, the team behind the popular
[Adda](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/20/dining/adda-indian-canteen-review.html)
in Long Island City and
[Rahi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/13/dining/indian-restaurants-manhattan-babu-ji.html)
in Greenwich Village, goat or lamb testicles will be served in kapoora
masala.

Although Indian cuisine does not use stir-frying, Mr. Pandya said it
might be the best shorthand to explain his preparation of the testicles,
which will be served as a snack, tossed with dry curry. Dhamaka will
focus on grilling, a Rajasthani approach that Mr. Mazumdar said is far
removed from curry-centric, Americanized versions of Indian cooking.
“There’s a whole different side of our cuisine, which feeds a quarter
of the planet,” he
said.

From Goa, India, comes [Paisley](http://www.paisleyrestaurantnyc.com/),
the newest restaurant from [Eric
McCarthy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/07/31/dining/25-and-under-a-spicy-indian-spot-that-doesn-t-care-to-fit-in.html),
a veteran chef and former “Chopped” contestant, who has worked at Tulsi
and the Michelin-starred Tamarind. One dish on his menu, pork sorpotel,
is marinated with toddy vinegar, made from the nectar of coconut
flowers, and cashew feni, a strong home-brewed liquor made from
fermented cashew fruit. To make the vinegar, young people climb trees,
cut off the coconut flowers and tie clay pots underneath to catch the
dripping nectar. A month later, chefs drop a piping-hot roof tile into
the pot to turn the nectar into vinegar.

“It’s basically fermented coconut water,” Mr. McCarthy said. “This is
not a commercial process. It’s a homestyle process of making vinegar.
It’s what I learned from my granny.”

“It’s my dream to do this," he added. “I want New Yorkers to come and
experience and taste something very different.”
