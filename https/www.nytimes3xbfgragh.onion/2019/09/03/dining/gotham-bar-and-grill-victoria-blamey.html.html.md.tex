Victoria Blamey, its new chef, is giving the American menu a more
international feel, and lightening up the look.

When Victoria Blamey interviewed in March for the job of executive chef
at \href{https://www.gothambarandgrill.com/}{Gotham Bar and Grill}, a
Greenwich Village fixture for 35 years, she had never eaten there. She
didn't even know the kind of food it served. So she came in for dinner.
The difference from her cooking ``was night and day,'' she said.

Where her style is boldly creative, these dishes --- like miso-marinated
black cod, and goat-cheese ravioli --- were rich and reminiscent of a
former era in fine dining, served on white dishes, on white tablecloths.

``I was more confused than anything,'' she said. ``Our styles were so
far. What I kept saying is, `I think you guys missed a generation.'''

To its many fans, Gotham is a New York institution --- best-known for
its former chef, Alfred Portale, and the tuna tartare and towering
chocolate cakes he popularized in the 1980s and '90s. (Mr. Portale
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/23/dining/gotham-bar-and-grill-chef-victoria-blamey.html}{left
in May} to prepare for the opening of his own restaurant, Portale, but
remains a partner in Gotham.)

But to Ms. Blamey --- an alumna of

who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/31/dining/chumleys-review-bar-west-village.html}{won
plaudits} for her short stint as executive chef of the West Village
speakeasy Chumley's in 2016 and 2017 --- the restaurant is in desperate
need of an update. She took over the kitchen two months ago, and her new
menu will appear on Wednesday.

Since Ms. Blamey, 39, left Chumley's, she has cooked at a few pop-ups,
competed on ``Iron Chef'' and appeared in the Netflix documentary
\href{http://redqueenproductions.com/index.php/portfolio/the-heat/}{``The
Heat: A Kitchen (R)evolution,''} which profiles several female chefs.

``She is passionate, she is driven, she is disciplined and she
represents a contemporary approach,'' said Bret Csencitz, the managing
partner of Gotham Bar and Grill. ``We wanted a new voice.''

Mr. Csencitz and the owners --- Jerry Kretchmer, Jeff Bliss, Rick Rathe
and Robert Rathe --- went looking for a creative, ambitious chef, and
told Ms. Blamey she had full license to update the menu. She has
completely overhauled it. ``I wouldn't be doing justice to myself if we
kept anything on the menu,'' even the signature dishes, she said.

Her approach is more innovative and multicultural. There will be
yellowtail crudo paired with a purée of smoked avocado, fish sauce,
cilantro and milk, and Wagyu beef glazed with a veal jus blended with
tomato water, coriander seed, glucose and lovage. There may also be some
version of
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1013220-corn-and-seafood-chupe}{chupe},
a thick stew from her native Chile.

The bar menu will be more casual, ``with a lot of Chumley's,'' Ms.
Blamey said, including a burger laced with bone marrow.

Then there are smaller adjustments, like cooking pasta to order instead
of before service. As for the vertical plating style Mr. Portale made
famous at the restaurant, ``no one wants to see that right now,'' she
said flatly.

Ms. Blamey is also replacing many of the white plates with colorful
ceramics, and removing the tablecloths from the bar tables. The
brown-hued crown moldings will be painted off-white, to lend an airier
feel. (The fabric-covered hanging lamps will stay.)

``I want to see people being more loose,'' she said. ``I want the bar to
be buzzing with people who are my age, eating oysters or having a
beautiful rillette.''

Ms. Blamey's kitchen staff is a mixture of longtime Gotham employees and
new hires whom she worked with at other restaurants. ``A lot of people
left'' once she started, she said --- perhaps because of her gender, she
speculated, or her desire to make major changes.

She is certain that the restaurant --- which Sam Sifton
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/05/18/dining/reviews/gotham-bar-and-grill-nyc-restaurant-review.html}{awarded
three stars} in 2011, the last time The New York Times reviewed it ---
will draw fresh attention from restaurant critics. That's the only part
of the job she finds slightly intimidating.

``But I can do this,'' she said. ``You bring in younger, ambitious
people, and this is what you get.''
