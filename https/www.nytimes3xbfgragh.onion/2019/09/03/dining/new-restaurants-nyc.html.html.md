# In Fall’s Biggest Openings, Experience Is on the Menu

Seasoned chefs and restaurateurs, many of them women, and a wide array
of cuisines head up our reporter’s list of most-anticipated new
restaurants.

Opening a restaurant takes vision, but also money, patience and luck,
especially in New York, where the competition is fierce and simple
details like getting a gas hookup can become ordeals. Experienced chefs
and restaurateurs are better at it, and this fall they’ll be the ones
setting most of the tempting new tables.

Many of the new places I’m looking forward to most eagerly will have
women running their kitchens, some with familiar names, others worth
discovering, and all with admirable track records.

The one feature that will be absent almost everywhere is tablecloths.

The city has raw bars to spare, but Canal Street Oysters, from the
seasoned restaurateurs Anthony and Tom Martignetti, will be a
blockbuster, in a Beaux-Arts building with seating for 200, including 30
at the central limestone bar. Heading the kitchen will be [Charlene
Santiago](https://www.reynardnyc.com/team-member/charlene-santiago/),
who was at the John Dory Oyster Bar and Reynard. The array of shellfish,
raw and cooked, may include gooseneck barnacles but no lobsters. There’s
a paella, and sandwiches like cod banh mi, along with beers galore and
natural wines, practically a requirement for new restaurants this year.

At 232 Bleecker, on Father Demo Square in the West Village, the
executive chef will be Suzanne Cupps, who is leaving [Untitled at the
Whitney,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/08/05/dining/restaurant-review-untitled-at-the-whitney-in-the-meatpacking-district.html)
where she was the first woman to be executive chef in a Danny Meyer
restaurant. She will have a six-foot wood-burning oven facing a chef’s
counter. An upstate farm owned by [Dig Food
Group](https://www.diginn.com/), the restaurant’s owner, will supply
fresh produce she will feature.

Nearby, Da Toscano will open in the former Perla space, a homecoming for
the chef, Michael Toscano, who was Perla’s executive chef. Mr. Toscano
has been in Charleston, S.C., where he is an owner of [Le
Farfalle](https://charlestonwineandfood.com/participants/michael-toscano/).
Here, he will take advantage of a wood-burning oven to turn out the
hearty regional Italian fare I so admired at Perla; his wife, Caitlin
Toscano, will manage the restaurant.

The chef Leah Cohen, who owns the Southeast Asian restaurant [Pig and
Khao](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/03/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-jeepney-in-the-east-village-pig-and-khao-on-the-lower-east-side.html)
with Benjamin Byruch, sees opportunity in the underserved neighborhood
near Madison Square Garden. Their new Piggyback NYC will serve cha ca la
Vong, the Vietnamese fish classic in a thicket of herbs; charcoal-smoked
rib-eye; and Filipino lumpia spring rolls with Shanghai-style sweet
chile
sauce.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From South America, there will be the very personal interpretation of
Brazilian cooking from Manoella Buffara, and two restaurants
specializing in Nikkei cuisine, which blends Peruvian and Japanese fare
in dishes like raw fish tiradito. [Erik
Ramirez](https://www.pannacooking.com/chefs/erik-ramirez/) of [Llama
Inn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/10/dining/llama-inn-review.html)
in Brooklyn will open Llama San, in a polished, pale-wood West Village
setting with an open kitchen and a Peruvian wall-hanging. “Nikkei
through a New York lens” is how he described food like spicy seafood
stew with mirin and miso.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Brooklyn, the Nikkei chef [Ricardo
Zarate](https://www.ricardomzarate.com/) will bring a spinoff of his Las
Vegas restaurant, [Once](https://www.oncelv.com/) (pronounced on-SEH),
to Carroll Gardens with dishes like Japanese eggplant ceviche, braised
short ribs with pickled miso vegetables and grilled shrimp with yuzu.

Ryan Bartlow worked at
[Frenchette](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/10/dining/frenchette-review-restaurant-tribeca.html)
in New York and
[Alinea](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/04/dining/alinea-restaurant-chicago-grant-achatz.html)
in Chicago, but his experience at
[Akelarre](https://akelarre.net/en/restaurant/) in San Sebastián, Spain,
is what will drive the cooking at his much-delayed restaurant,
Ernesto’s, on the Lower East Side. The restaurant will feature
Basque-inspired food — whole baby fried mullet, fried cod cheeks, hake
in green sauce, and braised rabbit with walnuts, Rioja-style — in an
airy, glass-enclosed setting.

Channeling another part of Southern Europe, Cathédrale will offer
French-Mediterranean pissaladière, bouillabaisse and rotisserie chicken
chasseur by the executive chef Jason Hall, who cooked at [Gotham Bar and
Grill](https://www.gothambarandgrill.com/). The new place, in the Moxy
East Village hotel, has a trim open kitchen glowing with polished
copper, a zigzagging bar and a soaring arched dining room in a space
that reaches deep underground. It’s the most dramatic-looking newcomer
this season, with more than 300 seats; such grandeur is typical of the
owners, [Tao Group Hospitality](https://www.taogroup.com/). The
restaurant’s name is meant in part to evoke the [Fillmore
East](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-fillmore-east-new-york-new-york),
the 1960s music hall nearby that was nicknamed the Church of Rock ‘n’
Roll. At Cathédrale, the Italian artist Edoardo Tresoldi has installed
an ethereal mesh sculpture titled “Fillmore” on the ceiling.

For French food, I’m also excited about the reopening of [Le Veau
d’Or](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/16/dining/frenchette-le-veau-dor.html),
the vintage bauble that is being refreshed by Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson
of Frenchette. Another favorite food group of mine, Middle Eastern fare
will arrive with the opening of Shukette, the latest from Vicki Freeman,
Marc Meyer and Chris Paraskevaides of
[Cookshop](https://www.cookshopny.com/) and Vic’s. Ayesha Nurdjaja, the
chef and a partner, will make use of a charcoal grill.

[Christina
Tosi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/12/dining/christina-tosi-milk-bar.html)’s
Milk Bar chain will establish its flagship in the former John Dory
Oyster Bar, in the Ace Hotel New York. New items will include apple pie
soft-serve with pie-dough crumble and a roll stuffed with eggplant Parm.
The company will also move its cooking classes here from Williamsburg,
Brooklyn. And if I’m eager for the opening of the next [Daily
Provisions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/07/dining/daily-provisions-nyc-restaurant-news.html)
cafe from [Union Square Hospitality Group](https://www.ushgnyc.com/),
it’s because its crullers and an expanded dinner menu will be a
welcome addition to my Upper West Side neighborhood.

When it comes to long experience, it’s hard to compete with [Pastificio
G. Di
Martino](http://www.pastadimartino.com/pastificio/homepage-eng.php),
which has been making excellent dry pasta near Naples, Italy, since
1912. The company is opening a store, a pasta bar and restaurant in the
former Green Table space in Chelsea Market.

Still, there are some genuine newcomers to watch, like Alessandra and
Mario De Benedetti, the first-time restaurateurs opening Il Fiorista.
They recently moved to New York from Northern Italy, where Ms. De
Benedetti was a professor and her husband was in private equity, but
both, now in their 50s, wanted a change of scene where they could work
together. Theirs is a light-filled restaurant with a flower shop in the
front that Ms. De Benedetti will run, with abundant edible flowers
adorning Mediterranean food by the chef, [Garrison
Price](https://www.chefsfeed.com/experts/1497-garrison-price), who was
at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria and Cafe Clover.

**Canal Street Oysters** 380 Canal Street (West Broadway), 646-448-4032,
