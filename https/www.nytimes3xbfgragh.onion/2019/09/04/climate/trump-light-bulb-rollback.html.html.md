The Trump administration plans to significantly weaken federal rules
that would have forced Americans to use much more energy-efficient light
bulbs, a move that could contribute to greenhouse gas emissions that
cause global warming.

The proposed changes would eliminate requirements that effectively meant
that most light bulbs sold in the United States — not only the familiar,
pear-shaped ones, but several other styles as well — must be either LEDs
or fluorescent to meet new efficiency standards.

The rules being weakened, which dated from 2007 and the administration
of President George W. Bush and slated to start in the new year, would
have all but ended the era of the incandescent bulb invented more than a
century ago. Eliminating inefficient bulbs nationwide would save
electricity equivalent to the output of at least 25 large power plants,
enough to power all homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to
an estimate by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Trump administration said the changes would benefit consumers by
keeping prices low and eliminating government regulation.

“The Energy Department flat out got it wrong today,” said Jason Hartke,
president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit coalition of
business and environmental groups. Calling the move an “unforced error,”
he said, “Wasting energy with inefficient light bulbs isn’t just costly
for homes and businesses, it’s terrible for our
climate.”

The actions are the latest by the Trump administration to [weaken a
broad array of rules designed to fight climate
change](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/29/climate/climate-rule-trump-reversing.html).
Last week it announced a far-reaching plan to [cut back on the
regulation of emissions of
methane](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/29/climate/epa-methane-greenhouse-gas.html),
a powerful greenhouse gas. Earlier this year it [proposed freezing
antipollution and fuel-efficiency standards for
cars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/02/climate/trump-auto-emissions-california.html?module=inline),
and [tried to replace the Clean Power
Plan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html?module=inline),
a signature emissions-reduction measure of the Obama administration.

[President Trump has repeatedly dismissed the scientific
consensus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/climate/winter-cold-weather.html)
that climate change is caused by human activity and requires urgent
action to avoid its most dire effects, even as [government scientists
have warned about the
damage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/23/climate/us-climate-report.html)that
global warming is already causing the United States’ economy.

Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the 2007
law requires the department to issue standards “only when doing so would
be economically justified. These standards are not.” She added that the
administration’s action “will ensure that the choice of how to light
homes and businesses is left to the American people, not the federal
government.”

The trade association for companies that make light bulbs applauded the
Energy Department’s decision. In a statement, the National Electrical
Manufacturers Association said Americans are already buying the more
efficient bulbs and the final rule “will not impact the market’s
continuing, rapid adoption of energy-saving lighting.”

The group estimates that by the end of 2019, as much as 84 percent of
“general purpose” light sockets will be filled by LED and compact
fluorescent bulbs.

Rapid technological change in the lowly light bulb has been [one of the
largely unsung success
stories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/03/08/climate/light-bulb-efficiency.html)
in the fight to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

[Energy consumption in American homes had been on the rise for
decades](https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/evidence-of-a-decline-in-electricity-use-by-u-s-households/)[.
But that has reversed significantly in recent
years](https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/evidence-of-a-decline-in-electricity-use-by-u-s-households/),
thanks in part to the growing acceptance of technologies like LED bulbs
and compact fluorescents. Since 2010, energy consumption in American
homes has dropped by 6 percent, according to Lucas Davis, an energy
economist at the Haas School of Business, which is part of the
University of California, Berkeley.

In 2007, Congress passed legislation to phase out inefficient
incandescent and halogen bulbs. As part of that process, the oldest
incandescent technology had already disappeared from standard
pear-shaped bulbs by 2014 in favor of “halogen incandescents,” which
look the same but use less power.

Around that time, some conservative lawmakers and commentators [turned
the transition into a partisan dispute during the Obama
administration](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-to-consider-bill-nixing-light-bulb-restrictions),
warning that the Democratic administration would force people to buy
inferior bulbs. More recently, though, that notion of a partisan divide
has faded, Professor Davis said. “LEDs are being sold in large volumes
in all 50 states,” he said, not just blue states.

LED bulbs show how seemingly modest shifts in technology can have a
profound effect on people’s lives and wallets.

Because of their long life and energy efficiency,[an LED bulb can save
consumers](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money/how-energy-efficient-light)
[an estimated $50 to $100 over its several-year
lifetime](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/noah-horowitz/annual-cost-light-bulb-standards-rollback-12-billion),
while reducing the number of times a year they need to climb a
stepladder or kitchen table to replace burnt-out bulbs. LED bulbs, once
many times more expensive than incandescent bulbs, have plunged in price
and can often be found for [less than
$2](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-LED-Light-Bulb-8-5W-60W-Equivalent-A19-Lamp-E26-Medium-Base-Non-Dimmable-Soft-White-4-Pack/51497369)each.

Two rollbacks were unveiled on Wednesday.

One would eliminate new energy efficiency requirements for pear-shaped
bulbs that were supposed to take effect Jan. 1, 2020. The department [is
proposing a new
rule](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-18941.pdf?utm_source=federalregister.gov&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list)
that would end that requirement, subject to a 60-day comment period.

A second rollback targets rules that, next year, would have required
adding several additional kinds of incandescent and halogen light bulbs
to the energy-efficient group: three-way bulbs; the candle-shaped bulbs
used in chandeliers; the globe-shaped bulbs found in bathroom lighting;
and reflector bulbs used in recessed fixtures and track lighting. Under
the Energy Department’s proposed plan, those requirements will be
eliminated and sales of traditional incandescent bulbs for those
purposes can continue.

The changes are likely to be challenged in court.

California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said he would fight the
administration’s action in court, calling the shift “another dim-witted
move that will waste energy at the expense of our planet.”

Noah Horowitz, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency Standards at
the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, “We will explore all
options, including litigation, to stop this completely misguided and
unlawful action.” He said regulation remains necessary. “Energy-wasting
incandescents and halogens still make up more than a third of new bulb
sales,” he said.
