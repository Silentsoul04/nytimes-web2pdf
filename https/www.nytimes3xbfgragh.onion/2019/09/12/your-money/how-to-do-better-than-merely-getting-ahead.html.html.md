Getting ahead is overrated as a goal. In fact, it might even be just
plain stupid.

The problem with getting ahead is that it’s a zero-sum game. There’s
only one winner. And in this game, it’s possible that even the winners
are losers. How many of us want to be remembered merely as the person
who spent their lives striving to get ahead of everyone else?

So instead of fixating on getting ahead, what if we simply focused on
having enough? Turns out, you’re allowed to do that\!

You don’t have to participate in a game that will constantly pit you
against the competition, which may well amount to everyone else in the
world. Almost inevitably, that casts you as a failure in your own eyes.
You can opt for simple satisfaction instead.

So just for a minute, imagine what it might feel like to be satisfied
with simply having enough. Can you write down how that might change your
priorities? Your daily schedule? Or is there some other way to connect
with that feeling?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The reason the exercise is important is because only you can define the
term. I can’t tell you what enough looks like, except to remind you that
it may not be so easy to sort it out. If you’ve got a spouse or a
business partner or family members who rely on you, talking about it may
be one of the most searching conversations you’ve had in a long time.

What I’m hoping to accomplish with this pile of words is just to
encourage or allow or create space for you to explore this idea a bit.
That’s all.

What might happen if you were to make this shift? Would you work less?
Would you spend less? Would you sleep more? Would you quit your job and
start something new? Would you give more to charity?

Maybe nothing new would happen. But what I can tell you is this: If you
can’t find a way to be satisfied with enough, you may never be satisfied
with anything. There will always be someone else ahead of you, even if
the only person ahead of you is the future self you are constantly
killing yourself to become.

Now tell me, does that sound like how you want to live?
