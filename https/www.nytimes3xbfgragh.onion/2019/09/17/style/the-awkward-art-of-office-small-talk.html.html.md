Every day around the world, [an
estimated](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/jobs/) three billion people
go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their
co-workers once they get there.

Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and
their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that
requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response,
which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not
excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their
office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in
the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building
to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless
wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this
fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow\!

If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that
avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the
risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as
socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes,
even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad
news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare
you or anything.

**[*\[Read our full package, “The Office: An In-Depth Analysis of
Workplace User
Behavior.”\]*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/09/17/style/the-office.html)**

Jamie Terran, a [licensed career coach](http://jamieterran.com/) in New
York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors
builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that
allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because
it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong,
building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing
that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire
people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the
job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive
impression.

But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This
is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second
chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in
the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and
repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and
worry instead about *not* making small talk with your co-workers. See?
Easy switch.

Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make
us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not
being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep
down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the
plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a
login.

Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling.

## Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think

A [2018 study published in Psychological
Science](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/23/smarter-living/how-to-be-more-likeable.html)
showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their
conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.”

Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a
co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think
of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think,
“Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your
desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be
shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or
herself.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Point is, you’re more likable than you think you are, so try not to
judge yourself so harshly. According to Ellie Hearne, founder and C.E.O.
of the leadership communications agency [Pencil or
Ink](https://www.pencilorink.com/), which, among other services, teaches
companies and executives how to have better internal communications,
“people don’t remember what you say — they remember how they felt when
they were with you.”

## A Little Planning Goes a Long Way

If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran
suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can
pull.

“Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to
you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best
strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for
example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to
start.”

Did something weird or interesting happen to you recently? Workshop (in
your mind, at least) that story ahead of time to unveil at your next
office outing.

And definitely remember to ask questions. We’re all ultimately pretty
narcissistic at heart.

## Advance the Dreaded “How Are You?” Loop

The ping-pong of “How are you? Good, how are you?” can feel like a waste
of time and energy, but be the change you wish to see in the world and
break the cycle. Go to your inner Rolodex of topics (see: planning
ahead) and move the short conversation forward by replying *why* you’re
“good.” As in, “I’m good. I just started a book/podcast/TV show and
I’m really enjoying it. Have you heard of it?” Or mention something
office-related, where there’s a shared common experience: “I’m good.
They restocked the cold brew in the kitchen and it’s so strong. Have you
tried it?”

## Don’t Panic, It’s Almost Over

Small talk doesn’t last long. “If you’re a generally anxious person, you
have an out — you’re at work\! You’re not supposed to spend too much
time chatting. After a few moments you can reference a meeting or
project you are supposed to work on,” Ms. Terran advised. A simple
exchange of pleasantries followed by a concise but polite exit (“Have a
good day\!”) is perfectly acceptable.

## You (Occasionally) Have the Right to Remain Silent

If you’re having a bad day and don’t want to talk, that might be best
for everyone involved. Enter
[headphones](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/12/24/fashion/headphones-now-playing-nothing.html).
“It’s fine to take a step back from engaging. Most people know the new
workplace etiquette, à la earbuds in means ‘give me some space,’” Ms.
Hearne said. A simple smile or nod to acknowledge your co-worker will
still go a long way.

I’ll leave you with a warning: There are very few ways to have
successful small talk in the office bathroom. It should go without
saying that attempting to chat with someone while they’re in the
bathroom stall is totally off-limits.

That said, one of the more memorable (in a good way) office chitchats
I’ve ever had happened at the bathroom sink. A co-worker who was
clearly excellent at storing away fun facts and sharing them
appropriately told me about the “[shake and
fold](http://shakeandfold.org/)” method of using a paper towel to
decrease waste.

I have used the method, and used it as a small talk device, ever since.
