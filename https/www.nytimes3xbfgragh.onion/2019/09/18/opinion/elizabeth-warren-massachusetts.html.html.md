ORLEANS, Mass. — I have voted two times for Elizabeth Warren to
represent Massachusetts in the Senate. I would certainly vote for her
for president over Donald Trump. But as the Democratic primary unfolds
and she extends a steady rise in the polls, I keep coming back to a
political vulnerability of which many followers of Massachusetts
politics are aware but others may not be.

The problem is that she has a relatively weak standing in Massachusetts
with non-college-educated working-class voters, and especially white
workers. These voters are critical, especially in the Midwest and in
states crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory like Michigan, Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin.

You might call it the Warren Paradox. Her core message as a politician —
that America has become rigged in favor of the very wealthy, and the
rich get richer as the rest of us get shafted — is very much aimed at
the working class. What’s more, her personal narrative, of her rise from
“the ragged edge of the middle class” in her native Oklahoma, as [she
has put
it](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1133840956158042115?lang=en), to
professional success and acclaim in the fields of education and
government might seem to embody a character trait of grit that appeals
to blue-collar workers.

Yet while all of the major Democratic presidential candidates face
difficulty with this constituency, polls suggest that this is especially
a problem for Ms. Warren. For example, in a Fox
[survey](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-8-15), she drew
33 percent of white, non-college respondents in a matchup against
President Trump, versus 38 percent for Joe Biden and 37 percent for
Bernie Sanders. **** For Democrats to feel fully confident about
nominating Ms. Warren as their standard-bearer, she needs to figure out
this puzzle.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Massachusetts, the Warren Paradox can be glimpsed in towns like
Rockland, population near 18,000, a suburb about 20 miles south of
Boston, overwhelmingly white and working class. In her November 2018
Senate race against a pro-Trump Republican, Ms. Warren won 60 percent of
the vote statewide but only [44
percent](https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/11/06/warren-beats-geoff-diehl)
of the vote in Rockland. By contrast, northwest of Boston, in the
upscale suburb of Lexington, where the median home value is $1.15
million, (compared with $340,000 in Rockland), Ms. Warren took 74
percent of the vote.

On a recent visit to Rockland, I encountered a sentiment that her
policies to address economic hardships might actually penalize those who
have played by the rules. In a conversation in the parking lot of a
McDonald’s, a young mother, after depositing her two children into the
back seat of her car, said she viewed as unfair Ms. Warren’s proposal to
forgive college student loans for most people carrying such debt. Now a
manager at a local restaurant, she said she had attended a technical
institute after high school and duly paid off her loans. “Probably,” she
told me, she would vote for Mr. Trump for delivering on his promise to
create more jobs.

I also came across what certainly sounded like, although it was not
overtly expressed, reluctance to embracing her because she is a woman.
“I can’t even listen to her. I just shut it off” — the television —
“when she comes on,” a man at Uptown’s Finest Barbershop told me.

In part, Ms. Warren is afflicted by an authenticity problem with these
voters. A former Harvard law professor, she is viewed by some, whatever
her declared agenda, as typical of an elite that is out of touch with
the concerns of ordinary working people. Doubts about her genuineness
are nourished by her claim of Native American ancestry — which her
detractors in Massachusetts have long framed as a dubious attempt to
elevate her career prospects over equally qualified white job
candidates. In 2012, Scott Brown, her Republican opponent in her first
Senate race, tried to use this issue against her.

These misgivings feed a conviction that she doesn’t have Rockland’s back
— a belief common to white non-college voters, often held against the
Democratic Party in general. “She’ll tax me,” insisted a 49-year-old
high school graduate who works at a town agency. (Ms. Warren’s proposed
wealth tax targets only households with assets exceeding $50 million.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“She wants to have open borders,” he added, voicing another reason that
some people in Rockland think a President Warren won’t protect them.
(Like a number of the Democratic presidential candidates, Ms. Warren is
in favor of [decriminalizing unauthorized border
crossings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/31/us/border-crossing-decriminalization.html).)
And the sense that Ms. Warren, who has voted in Congress for a ban on
assault weapons, is soft on gun rights also plays into the notion that
she would leave Rockland unprotected. The 49-year-old voted for Mr.
Trump in 2016 and fully plans to do so again in 2020, with the “good
job” the president is doing on the economy. (After speaking to me, he
climbed into a car with a National Rifle Association sticker affixed to
the back windshield.)

As Ms. Warren’s Senate campaigns attest, she is by no means uniformly
unpopular in Rockland or, for that matter, in neighboring communities
with a similar socio-economic profile.

“I love Elizabeth Warren,” said a welder and member of a plumbers union
local, age 68, by phone. “She’s my bulldog. She is 100 percent for us —
for the working man, the exploited person, the underdog.” He is from
Weymouth, next door to Rockland. “If she were a man, they would love
her.” He paused. “Or they would like her more.”

As he explained, places like Rockland, on the South Shore of
Massachusetts, need to be understood as products of “white flight” from
Boston, following court-ordered school busing in the mid-1970s.

Should she win the Democratic nomination, it’s easy to see the
difficulties she will face in gaining the allegiance of the white
working class in a matchup with Mr. Trump. White flight also defines a
number of working-class suburbs in the Midwest, as in the metropolitan
Detroit region.

But even though the Warren Paradox will be a real challenge, she still
has the opportunity to impress potentially unreceptive voters with her
“bulldog” tenacity, as in her visit this year to a small town in West
Virginia to talk about the opioid crisis — a state, 93 percent white,
taken by Mr. Trump in 2016 by nearly 42 points. She has also put gut
economic issues at the centerpiece of her agenda: For instance, her
“[Plan for Economic
Patriotism](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/a-plan-for-economic-patriotism-13b879f4cfc7),”
an industrial-policy tack calling for such steps as “more **** actively
managing” the currency value of the dollar “to promote exports and
domestic manufacturing” and a tenfold increase in government spending on
job apprenticeship programs, [won
praise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUW8kbZyucI) from the Fox News
commentator Tucker Carlson. “It’s just pure old-fashioned economics: how
to preserve good-paying American jobs,” he told his audience, a form of
“economic nationalism.”

And to be sure, while white working-class voters get a great deal of
attention in battleground states like Michigan, if Democrats can
increase turnout among African-American voters in 2020, that would help
counterbalance any weakness among white working-class voters.

As I was reminded in Rockland, the task of beating Mr. Trump doesn’t
require passion for the president’s challenger, whoever that may be. The
president, too, arouses a visceral dislike among some people there. One
man, a Vietnam veteran who works at the American Legion post in
Rockland, screwed up his face at my mention of the president. Among the
things he finds unappealing is Mr. Trump’s disdainful posture toward the
news media. We chatted about the fractious state of American politics at
the Rockland Bar and Grill, as he sipped his Guinness. “If it’s down to
Trump and Warren, it’s definitely Warren,” he declared without
hesitation. Ms. Warren versus Mr. Trump would be a grind, but that, it
might be said, is the story of her life.
