SAN FRANCISCO --- Airbnb said on Thursday that it planned to go public
in 2020, becoming one of the last of a generation of prominent
technology start-ups to aim for the stock market, even as some of its
brethren have struggled since listing their shares.

The online room rental company gave little detail about when in 2020 it
planned to go public, beyond
\href{https://press.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-intention-to-become-a-publicly-traded-company-during-2020/}{a
one-sentence announcement}. On Wednesday, Airbnb reported second-quarter
revenue of more than \$1 billion and said that it had more than seven
million listings in 100,000 cities around the world.

When it goes public, Airbnb, valued by private investors at \$31
billion, will be one of the most highly valued public offerings to hit
the market since this spring, when a rash of hot start-ups, including
Uber,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/29/technology/lyft-stock-price.html}{Lyft},
Slack and Pinterest, listed their shares.

Making a public statement about going public in a particular year is
unusual among technology start-ups, which typically keep their plans
secret. But Airbnb made the move as it explored offering equity to the
``hosts'' who list their homes on its site, according to three people
familiar with the situation, who declined to be named because the plans
were confidential. Under securities law, Airbnb has to unveil its plans
to go public before it can offer shares to the hosts.

Airbnb is considering several nontraditional approaches to its public
offering, including a direct listing, the people said. In a direct
listing, a company lists shares on a public market without raising any
additional capital. The method has gained traction in recent years as
the streaming service Spotify and Slack, the business software company,
have adopted it.

This year, some of the most prominent start-ups --- known as unicorns
because they were valued at \$1 billion and more by private investors
--- have run into trouble as they tried to reach the stock market or
after they went public. The stock prices of the ride-hailing companies
Uber and Lyft have plunged, as has the share price of Slack. All of the
companies, which are unprofitable, had been hugely hyped on their way to
listing their shares.

This week, WeWork, another deeply unprofitable start-up,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/17/business/dealbook/wework-ipo.html}{postponed
its initial public offering} altogether after a cold reception from
investors. The shared office space giant has faced deep skepticism about
its business model and corporate governance.

In the past, public market investors have often overlooked the losses of
hot tech start-ups, as long as they were growing quickly. But many of
the unicorns are maturing, and their growth is beginning to slow. This
has raised questions about whether public market investors are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/28/business/startups-ipo.html}{missing
out on the gains that venture capitalists} have experienced.

Airbnb's public offering will cap off a decade of start-up growth driven
by the spread of mobile phones, cheap cloud computing and gig economy
workers. The company, founded in 2009, has raised more than \$4 billion
in venture funding, according to Crunchbase.
