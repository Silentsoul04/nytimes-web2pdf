Meetings in
U.S.}\label{under-new-rule-chinese-diplomats-must-notify-state-dept-of-meetings-in-us}}

State Department officials said the new measures were ordered in
reciprocity for China's strict limits on the actions of American
diplomats there.

WASHINGTON --- The United States has begun requiring Chinese diplomats
to notify the State Department before any meetings they plan to have
with local or state officials and with educational and research
institutions, the State Department said Wednesday.

The move was a reaction to the Chinese government's rules for American
diplomats in China, a senior State Department official said. American
diplomats are generally required to obtain the permission of Chinese
officials in Beijing before they can travel to official meetings in the
provinces or to visit institutions, the official said.

The new State Department requirement was still less onerous than that
imposed by China. Chinese diplomats are not required to seek permission
for the meetings; they need only to notify the State Department in
advance.

One aim of the new restrictions was to get China to relent on its limits
on the actions of American diplomats, the official said, adding that the
United States had complained to the Chinese government about the
regulations, to no avail.

The new rule, described by State Department officials on the condition
of anonymity, applies to officials working at all Chinese Missions in
the United States and its territories, including at the United Nations.

The policy of reciprocity is sure to add to the growing tensions between
the United States and China.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington
\href{https://twitter.com/ChineseEmbinUS/status/1184597214011822085}{said
Wednesday} that ``the latest restrictions by the US State Department on
Chinese diplomats are in violation of the Vienna Convention. So far, the
Chinese side does not have similar requirements on American diplomats
and consular officers in China.''

President Trump started a trade war that has caused economic damage in
both countries, and negotiators still have not reached agreement to
resolve the dispute, though American officials say the two countries
have reached a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html}{tentative
partial deal}.

American officials say the two nations have entered
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/26/world/asia/united-states-china-conflict.html}{a
new era of great power competition}, and they are trying to put in place
policies to constrain Chinese influence across the globe, which includes
limiting its economic, military and technological footprints.

Some American officials have spoken about the need for American
universities and research institutions to be warier of Chinese
government efforts to steal research and intellectual property. The
F.B.I.
\href{https://www.npr.org/2019/06/28/728659124/fbi-urges-universities-to-monitor-some-chinese-students-and-scholars-in-the-u-s}{has
been asking American university officials} to monitor students or
scholars visiting from certain Chinese state-affiliated research
institutions or companies, NPR reported in June. The F.B.I. is focused
on researchers in the sciences, technology, engineering and math.

The State Department informed the Chinese Embassy of the new rule in the
past week, the official said. It has already received one notification
from Chinese officials under the mandate, the official said, and expects
to receive about 50 notifications a week.
