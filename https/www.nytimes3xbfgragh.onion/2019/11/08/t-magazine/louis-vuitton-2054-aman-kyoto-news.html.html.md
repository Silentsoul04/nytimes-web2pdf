### Louis Vuitton’s Performance Clothes — for Tomorrow

[Virgil
Abloh](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/02/t-magazine/virgil-abloh-off-white-paris-fashion-week.html),
the artistic director of [Louis
Vuitton](https://www.louisvuitton.com/)’s men’s wear, is nothing if
not intellectually nimble. He trained as an architect and has worked as
a D.J., artist, musician and Kanye West whisperer. When it comes to
fashion, his references are equally wide-ranging, and he’s proved as
likely to send trench coats and pleated pants down the runway as mesh
tees and floral harnesses. With his latest capsule collection, he’s
baked versatility into individual pieces. Included in the 14-item line,
called Louis Vuitton 2054 (the year the brand will turn 200), is a shirt
that turns into a pillow, a weekend bag that morphs into a sleeping bag
and a coat that doubles as a backpack. It was, according to Abloh, an
exercise in rethinking the nature of apparel and what the future of
fashion will be. He arrived at his answer — technical and transformable
— after looking at collapsible camping equipment. “I was very much
inspired by the materials and folding ingenuity that exists in that
world of products,” Abloh said, in comments emailed by the brand.
Indeed, folding is an integral component in experiencing these
multifunctional items: The shirt, papery nylon with removable arms and
plexiglass zipper pulls, can be tucked into its own back pocket, and the
sleeping bag rolls out of the side compartment of an oversize lambskin
duffel.

*\[*[*Sign up

*for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors
are noticing and coveting now.\]*

These days, of course, [imagining the
future](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/04/10/t-magazine/humberto-leon-carol-lim.html)
can be a grim undertaking, and technical ware feels imbued with a
sharper survivalist edge. But Abloh seems optimistic. What first appears
as a somber, no-nonsense palette reveals splashes of rainbow-colored
camouflage — a glossy nylon puffer scarf, for instance, is black on one
side and tie-dye-like on the other. The designer also retains faith in
the relationship between man and nature. The muse for the collection was
someone who “actively engages with the outdoors,” he said. That’s not
the sort of client apt to shut themselves away, and why should it be,
given Louis Vuitton’s origins as a luggage company? Though here Abloh
has foregone stacks of trunks to send a different message: For maximum
agility, and for the sake of our planet, it’s best to travel light. —

### Where Form Meets Function

The pair behind the conceptual furniture collective [Green River
Project](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/07/t-magazine/green-river-project-aaron-aujla-ben-bloomstein.html)
met two years ago while working in New York’s art world: Aaron Aujla was
an artist’s assistant and painter, and Benjamin Bloomstein was an art
handler and craftsman. One of their first clients was their friend
[Michael
Bargo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/11/t-magazine/design/michael-bargo-apartment.html),
an interior designer whose 2,000-square-foot Chinatown apartment doubles
as a design gallery. In the main room, there are displays of arresting
and rare midcentury pieces — like a 1950s-era Alexandre Noll wooden
cross sculpture and a Pierre Chareau steel-and-brass side table from the
1920s — that are his only until he sells them.

The loft’s one uninspiring space was, Bargo felt, the generic
contemporary kitchen, so he called Aujla and Bloomstein for help. For
inspiration, the designers looked to the modular color-block kitchen
that [Charlotte
Perriand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/11/14/t-magazine/charlotte-perriand-design-le-corbusier.html)
and [Le
Corbusier](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/08/t-magazine/le-corbusier-japan-modernism.html)
conceived for Unité d’Habitation — a 1940s social-housing project in
Marseille, France — finding themselves particularly drawn to a pair of
chunky wooden handles on an upper cabinet. They hand-carved a 15-piece
series of sculptural handles and pulls from African mahogany, cherry,
ebony and black hyedua — one is fluted like a trumpet, while several
others echo the undulating totems of [Constantin
Brancusi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/22/t-magazine/art/impasse-ronsin-artists-montparnasse-constantin-brancusi.html)
— and affixed a 10-inch set to a fridge that they paneled with black-
and Bauhaus-red-colored Formica. It stands to the side of an
aluminum-edged Douglas-fir island and a pair of wooden bar stools with
crescent-shaped seats, also carved by hand. The kitchen, as well as
free-standing versions of the hardware and two Green River Project
perforated aluminum sconces, will soon go on view at Bargo’s
apartment-cum-gallery. “We want people to experience high-level
craftsmanship on a daily basis in their home,” says Aujla. — AHNNA

### A New Kyoto Hotel, Complete With Its Own Forest

The Aman hotel group has long upheld the Japanese architectural
principle that buildings should be in harmony with their natural
environments, but that thinking is especially evident at [its latest
location](https://www.aman.com/resorts/aman-kyoto) — a secluded
eight-acre garden-within-a-forest at the base of
[Kyoto](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/03/02/travel/36-hours-in-kyoto-japan.html)’s
Mount Hidari Daimonji. “It’s all about the grounds,” says the designer,
Justin Hill, which are accessed via an ancient copper gate and include a
large main lawn, naturally occurring streams and moss-covered stone
walkways surrounded by dense plots of Japanese maple and cedar trees.
The land likely inspired members of the Rinpa school, an Edo-period art
movement that encouraged a resurgence of indigenous techniques and
motifs, and once belonged to a textile collector and amateur landscape
designer. Now, it encompasses 11 slatted stained-cedar pavilions housing
24 rooms and two two-bedroom suites between them, though on a recent
visit, Hill was pleased to find that the pavilions are difficult to
photograph: “They almost disappear into the landscape,” he
says.

Inside, the structures allude to a classic ryokan, with tatami mats,
orb-shaped lanterns, hinoki tubs and tokonoma, or wall niches, here used
to display local pottery. Instead of paper screens (“We wanted to pay
tribute to Japanese design, not mimic it,” says Hill), there are blond
wood wall panels and sliding doors, as well as floor-to-ceiling windows
that offer verdant views. The hotel restaurant serves *kaiseki*,
seasonal multicourse meals, and guests can experience other local
customs by soaking in the open-air onsen or venturing past the garden’s
edge for meditative hikes known as *shinrin-yoku*, or forest bathing. —

### Art Deco Blooms Anew

The Art Deco style — a geometric update of late 19th century Art Nouveau
flourishes, recast through the machine-made polish of European Futurism
— emerged soon after the end of World War I. But it wasn’t until a few
years later, in 1925, that the seminal movement coalesced with the
legendary Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et
Industriels Modernes. [Giorgio
Armani](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/19/t-magazine/giorgio-armani-home-broni-italy.html),
the endlessly entrepreneurial 85-year-old fashion designer whose
Asian-tinged minimalism has made its own mark on the culture over nearly
five decades, references the period often, especially in his Privé
collection of couture-level evening clothes. Thus, it makes elegant
sense that his first *haute joaillerie* collection would nod to the
spare yet bold simplicity and primary colors of Art Deco. These
cascading earrings are made of white gold (common in the 1920s as an
alternative to platinum), coral, diamonds, sapphires and rubies — a
glamorous yet unfussy fusion of the then and now. *Price on request,
(212) 988-9191.* — [NANCY

### The Return of a Futurist Classic

Rudolph](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1997/08/09/arts/paul-rudolph-is-dead-at-78-modernist-architect-of-the-60-s.html),
widely considered a spiritual father of American
[Brutalism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/06/t-magazine/design/brutalist-architecture-revival.html)
— the mid-20th-century movement of raw concrete and obstinate minimalism
— never put a premium on comfort. Instead, Rudolph, whose best-known
projects are Halston’s much-photographed white-on-white Upper East Side
townhouse in Manhattan and Yale’s School of Architecture building (he
was chairman of the department when it was built in 1963), championed
machine-made materials and modularity. Rarely able to find appropriate
furniture, he designed custom pieces. His Rolling chair, created in 1968
for his own Beekman Place apartment, is now for sale by Modulightor, the
retail lighting firm that Rudolph, who died in 1997, co-founded in the
mid-1970s. Made of steel and plexiglass with casters, its parts are
interchangeable with several of his other seats and tables that the
company manufactures. Echoing the uncompromising angularity of earlier
European purists, among them the architects Gerrit Rietveld and [Le
Corbusier](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/le-corbusier),
the armchair eschews quotidian cushiness for transparent provocation.

### Of a Kind: Joseph Altuzarra’s Owls

Four years ago, the Paris-born, New York-based fashion designer [Joseph
Altuzarra](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/02/t-magazine/joseph-altuzarra-paris-fashion-week.html)
received his first good-luck charm from his mother, Karen. Just before
his spring 2016 show, she gave him a small brass owl she found at an
arcade in Florence, Italy. Every show since, she has presented Altuzarra
with another owl. “I used to love the bird as a child and would draw
them constantly,” he says. “My mom says owls remind her of me — they are
always observing the world.”

His collection now consists of 16 miniatures, which Altuzarra’s mother
has found on her travels across Asia, California and Europe, from toy
stores in Paris to a cast-iron merchant in Kyoto, Japan. The 36-year-old
designer keeps them in a small black box on his desk or on a nearby
bookshelf so that “they’re always within view.” In early 2020, Altuzarra
will be featured as a judge alongside [Naomi
Campbell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/07/t-magazine/fashion/naomi-campbell-vfiles-interview.html),
Nicole Richie and his muse [Carine
Roitfeld](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/22/style/carine-roitfeld-perfume.html)
in Amazon Prime Video’s new fashion competition series “Making the Cut.”
