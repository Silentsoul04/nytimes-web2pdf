# Obama Says Average American Doesn’t Want to ‘Tear Down System’

</div>

Former President Barack Obama, in an address to liberal donors, warned
candidates not to go too far left and sought to calm those who were
concerned about the state of the Democratic primary.

WASHINGTON — Former President [Barack
Obama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/us/barack-obama-virtual-commencement-speech-coronavirus.html)
offered an unusual warning to the Democratic primary field on Friday
evening, cautioning the candidates not to move too far to the left in
their policy proposals, even as he sought to reassure a party
establishment worried about the electoral strength of their historically
large primary field.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Speaking before a room of wealthy liberal donors, Mr. Obama urged
Democrats to remember the long, combative slog of his primary campaign
against Hillary Clinton in 2008, arguing that the 16 month battle
ultimately made him a stronger general election candidate.

“For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to
remind you I had a very robust primary,” he told the group of several
hundred donors and organizational leaders in Washington. “I’m confident
that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been
tested.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet, he also raised concerns about some of the liberal ideas being
promoted by some candidates, citing health care and immigration as
issues where the proposals may have gone further than public opinion.

While Mr. Obama did not single out any specific primary candidate or
policy proposal, he cautioned that the universe of voters that could
support a Democratic candidate — Democrats, independents and moderate
Republicans — are not driven by the same views reflected on “certain
left-leaning Twitter feeds” or “the activist wing of our party.”

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have
to be rooted in reality,” Mr. Obama said. “The average American doesn’t
think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The comments marked an extraordinary entrance into the primary contest
by the former president, who has been careful to avoid even the
appearance of influencing the direction of the race.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His remarks offered an implicit critique of Senators Bernie Sanders and
[Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/us/politics/iowa-poll-warren-biden.html?module=inline),
who have urged voters to embrace “political revolution” and “big,
structural change,” as well as proposals once widely considered to be
left to the liberal fringes of the party, including court packing and
decriminalizing illegal border
crossings.

debating whether to stick with Mr. Obama’s architecture for health care
policy or to pursue a single-payer system and offering flashes of direct
criticism over his record on immigration. At the same time, former Vice
President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/us/politics/iowa-poll-warren-biden.html?module=inline)
has made his strong support for Mr. Obama and his accomplishments a

## Who’s Running for President in 2020?

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Acknowledging that candidates must “push past” his achievements, Mr.
Obama urged his party’s candidates not to push too far, as he urged them
to adopt a message that would allow them to compete in all corners of
the country.

“I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to
certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a
bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then
immediately that’s going to activate them,” he said.

The fact that Mr. Obama offered his reassurances at the annual meeting
of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to recommended political
organizations, only underscored the intended audience of his message. In
recent weeks, establishment-aligned Democrats, top donors and some
strategists [have expressed
fears](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/12/us/politics/bloomberg-deval-patrick-2020.html)
that the party lacks a strong enough candidate to defeat President
Trump.

They question whether Mr. Biden has the ability to compete in a
multistate primary campaign, fret about Mr. Sanders’s and Ms. Warren’s
viability in the general election and remain skeptical that [Pete
Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html?module=inline),
the mayor of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white
voters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Their concerns have prompted the late emergence of two experienced
candidates, [Deval
Patrick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/14/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020-president.html?module=inline),
the former governor of Massachusetts and a close friend of Mr. Obama,
and [Michael R.
Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/12/us/politics/bloomberg-deval-patrick-2020.html?module=inline),
both of whom entered the field after nine candidates had already dropped
out.

Those worries are not necessarily shared by voters in early states,
where surveys show that most Democrats have gravitated to a short list
of four candidates and feel the field remains too large.

“If you talk to the voters they don’t feel the need for another
candidate,” said Kathy Sullivan, the former chairwoman of the Democratic
Party in New Hampshire. “We haven’t been sitting around in New Hampshire
saying we need a hero to come and rescue us.”

Since leaving office nearly three years ago, the former president has
mostly remained out of the public fray.

While he’s headlined fund-raising events for Democratic committees, the
former president has [kept a low
profile](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/18/us/politics/obama-2020-democratic-candidates.html?module=inline)
in the presidential race, meeting privately with most of the Democratic
candidates but telling friends and political allies that neither he nor
his wife, Michelle, have plans to endorse anyone and do not see it as
their place to steer the party’s future.

Mr. Obama has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars
like former Representative [Beto
O’Rourke](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/beto-orourke.html)
of Texas and Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Obama had [issued a warm
statement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-announcement.html?module=inline)
about Mr. Biden’s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him
or anyone else.

During his nearly hourlong remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama offered only one
clear endorsement, though not exactly the one many Democratic donors in
the room wanted to hear.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Obama was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who drew national attention
during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year and is
widely considered to be on the shortlist for the vice presidency — no
matter which candidate ultimately wins the nomination.

“I love me some Stacey Abrams,” he
said.
