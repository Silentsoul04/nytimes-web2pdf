\textbf{WHAT COLOR IS NIGHT?}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2019/11/24/books/review/24PictureThis-01/24PictureThis-01-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

\textbf{By Grant Snider}

``Look closer,'' this gentle bedtime book encourages. While nighttime
might seem to be only black and white, there is color to see everywhere:
from ``yellow headlights on a dark country road,'' to ``one last orange
window,'' to the ``pink and purple clouds'' in a child's dream. Snider's
thick and loose ink lines, filled in with digital color, create a
saturated and dreamy nighttime effect. An orthodontist by day and a
cartoonist by night, he clearly understands the promise that lies on the
other side of sunset.

\textbf{HERE AND NOW}

\textbf{By Julia Denos.}

\textbf{Illustrated by E.B. Goodale.}

Being in the moment --- also known as mindfulness --- is a useful
concept for today's frazzled, overscheduled kids. But it's best conveyed
without those adult-friendly buzzwords, as in this lovely and profound
second collaboration (after ``Windows'') from Denos and Goodale. It
starts with the inarguable statement ``Right here, right now, you are
reading this book.'' The pages move outward to call attention to other
events occurring elsewhere: ants building, ideas forming, animals living
and breathing. One breathtaking spread shows an airplane carrying
people, other people sitting in a field, and earthworms, fossils and
rocks below ground.

\textbf{LAYLA'S HAPPINESS}

\textbf{By Mariahadessa Ekere Tallie.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Ashleigh Corrin.}

``What is happiness to you?'' That query drives this marvelous debut, a
poetic accounting of the elements that make up childhood fulfillment,
narrated by a girl named Layla. Her answers: climbing a tree, listening
to her dad tell stories, watching her friend Juan's parents dance salsa
in their garden, visiting the beach and finding a sand dollar. With
Corrin's layered, whimsical illustrations, each page is a snapshot of a
simple moment that adds up to an abundant life, urban yet very much in
tune with nature. The effect is both laid back and meaningful --- an
invitation to answer for yourself.

\textbf{LITTLE LIBRARIES, BIG HEROES}

\textbf{By Miranda Paul.}

\textbf{Illustrated by John Parra.}

This history of the Little Free Library movement emphasizes the hurdles
faced by Todd Bol, an ``ordinary'' person who created the concept after
the death of his mother, a teacher who loved reading: He struggled in
school, and at first the wooden structures full of free books did not
catch on. Parra's (``Frida Kahlo and Her Animalitos'') friendly,
bustling illustrations convey the power of a truly unifying and useful
idea.

\textbf{ANXIOUS CHARLIE TO THE RESCUE}

\textbf{By Terry Milne}

Inspired by Milne's daughter's struggle with anxiety and repetitive
behaviors, this charming tale features a habit-bound dachshund, called
upon to rescue a friend stuck in a pipe. His success makes him so happy,
he dares to vary his routine --- just a little. Little ones controlled
by worries may find a ray of light in this pup's (wisely) small victory.

\textbf{FREEDOM SOUP}

\textbf{By Tami Charles.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Jacqueline Alcántara.}

Haitians ring in the New Year with Freedom Soup, which dates back to the
Haitian Revolution. Charles's narrator makes the ``pumpkiny-garlic''
soup with her grandmother, singing and dancing as she learns the
history: It's eaten to celebrate ``the end of slavery'' and ``the start
of freedom.'' Jazzy illustrations and a recipe add warmth and depth.

\textbf{WHAT IS A REFUGEE?}

Image

Credit...From "What Is a Refugee?"

\textbf{By Elise Gravel}

Any child exposed to the news these days may wonder about refugees, and
a picture book is a great way to learn about them. Gravel's bubbly,
cartoon-style art and plain-spoken explanations help soften the truth's
harsh edges --- starting with the fact that they ``had to flee their
country because they were in danger.'' The whole package makes it easy
to empathize, conveying gently that ``a refugee is a person, just like
you and me.''
