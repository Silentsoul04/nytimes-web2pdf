The Times asked the presidential candidates for their views on codifying
Roe v. Wade, over-the-counter abortion pills and other policies.

The New York Times asked the Democratic presidential candidates to
complete a survey on abortion and contraception. Following are the full
responses we received, unedited except for corrected typos and
punctuation.

Five candidates --- Steve Bullock, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi
Gabbard and Kamala Harris --- did not complete the survey. Where
possible, we determined their positions from published plans,
interviews, debates and forums.

We conducted the survey before Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick
entered the race.

\emph{A spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign gave the following statement
in response to The Times's survey:}

Women's health care rights are under attack all over the country ---
there is an all-out assault on Roe v. Wade and abortion rights, in
addition to efforts to undermine and repeal Obamacare, which greatly
improved and expanded women's health care access. Historically, women
and particularly women of color have been put in a position where they
cannot access health care, in a more extreme way than any other part of
the population. It's a simple proposition for the vice president: Women
are entitled to the exact same health care coverage as men.

Joe Biden firmly believes that women have a constitutional right to
choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and should not be
overturned. A core tenet of Biden's campaign is truth over lies and
science over fiction. No woman looking for information should be lied
to. Period. Women must be able to make their own sensitive and personal
health care decisions with their doctors.

As president, he will protect the progress we've made, codify Roe v.
Wade and guarantee that access to quality, affordable care --- including
reproductive health care --- is a right, not a privilege, for everyone
no matter their race or ZIP code. Biden will repeal the Hyde Amendment
and use executive action to on his first day in office withdraw the
Mexico City ``global gag rule'' and Donald Trump's Title X restrictions.
And, he will build on the Obama-Biden administration's work to fund and
protect Planned Parenthood from baseless attacks.

Vice President Biden has fought for women's right to choose throughout
his career. As a senator, he fought anti-choice Supreme Court justices,
including leading the fight as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to
successfully block the nomination of Judge Robert Bork --- one of only
two potential justices to be rejected by the Senate in the last 50 years
--- because of concerns regarding Bork's position on choice and access
to birth control. Bork's rejection was a pivotal win for the women's
movement that protected Roe v. Wade and paved the way for critical
Supreme Court decisions, including Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt.

Biden is a staunch advocate against anti-choice clinic violence --- he
fought to hold extremists, guilty of violence against doctors and
patients, accountable for their criminal actions.

In addition to continuing the fight against clinic violence, Biden's
Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of
state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an
abortion, such as so-called TRAP laws, parental notification
requirements, mandatory waiting periods and ultrasound requirements.

As president, I'll create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom,
charged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights
and access to reproductive health care across my administration. In
addition, I will fight to pass comprehensive sex education legislation
based on the Real Education for Healthy Youth Act that's inclusive of
all youth and provides information on a range of topics, including
preventing S.T.I.s. I would also fight to pass the MOMMIES Act into law,
which would ensure that all pregnant women have full Medicaid coverage,
extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum women up to a full year after
giving birth, and increase access to doula care.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Creating a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom;
\item
  Ending the ``domestic gag rule'' and expanding and modernizing the
  Title X family planning program;
\item
  Guaranteeing access to employer-covered contraceptive care;
\item
  Undoing Trump's refusal rules that allow people to be denied the
  health care they need;
\item
  Restoring evidence-based guidelines for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention
  Program; and,
\item
  Ending the global gag rule and restoring funding for the United
  Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

First and foremost, this question underscores just how important it is
that we ensure not only that we put a Democrat in the White House, but
also flip the Senate and hold the House in 2020. I will continue to
stand with the more than seven in 10 Americans who support Roe v. Wade
and push Republicans in Congress, whether they're in the majority or
not, to pass legislation that will codify Roe and protect women's
reproductive rights from what would be an extreme finding by the Court.

Yes. And as a man, it's even more incumbent upon me to use my voice and
my platform to help reframe this debate. Women should not have to face
this fight alone. Men need to take responsibility too. We need to
listen, to speak out, and to take action --- not because women are our
mothers, sisters, wives or friends --- because women are people. And all
people deserve to control their own bodies.

Reproductive freedom and the right to access safe, legal abortion care
is core to our values and a central tenet of who we are as a party.
These far-right attacks on women's rights must be understood as an
attack on all of our rights. But we also need to understand who these
attacks on reproductive freedom are designed to control, dehumanize and
criminalize.

Women of color, low-income women, and women who live in rural areas in
states that have restricted and sought to criminalize abortion are
disproportionately affected. They are oftentimes unable to afford to
travel to a different state --- which could also mean missing work and
arranging for child care even while enduring lengthy 72-hour waiting
periods --- in order to get the health care they need. They might not be
able to afford to pack up and leave --- and we won't let them weather
this storm alone. The restriction and attempted criminalization of
abortion doesn't just violate a woman's rights while she is pregnant,
they strip her of the right to plan for her and her family's future.

Democrats must be the party that leads with our values and demonstrate
better leadership. It has never been more important to stand in
solidarity and join the fight to ensure that all women have access to
reproductive health care and abortion rights. James Baldwin once wrote
in a letter to Angela Davis, ``If they take you in the morning, they
will be coming for us that night.'' These far-right attacks on women's
rights must be understood as an attack on all of our rights.

Hyde Amendment and budget: As president, I will first try to repeal the
Hyde Amendment. I am firmly in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment and
ensuring reproductive health care for every woman, no matter the state
where she lives and works, her insurance status, race, ethnicity or
place of birth. It should not be used as a bargaining chip for the
federal budget. I will holistically evaluate every federal budget and my
responsibility to govern in the context of all of my priorities,
especially my commitment to upholding reproductive rights and ending
discriminatory health care.

Over-the-counter (O.T.C.) misoprostol and mifepristone: Medication
abortion is known to be safe and effective and could expand abortion
access, especially for those who live in remote areas, or in states
where routine, private and nonjudgmental abortion care is limited. While
I support the spirit of this policy suggestion and efforts to expand the
availability and accessibility of abortion for all, there are a few
major barriers we must overcome before misoprostol and mifepristone can
be sold O.T.C.

First, a self-administered abortion is illegal in some states, so making
it available over-the-counter could have the unintended consequence of
setting people up for a criminal investigation or even jail. We must
first work on decriminalization efforts. Second, there are currently
several regulatory constraints limiting mifepristone's distribution and
prescription. To overcome these, we will have to work closely with
regulatory bodies such as the F.D.A. to lift these restrictions.

The O.T.C. approach holds great promise, but we also need more research
into the pros and cons and unintended consequences of its use in the
context of the United States. Steps we can take in the interim to
improve access to abortion include expanding access to abortion via
telehealth, eliminating the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
(REMS) warning that ignores decades of evidence indicating that these
medications are safe, and expanding the types of medical professionals
able to prescribe them.

Planned Parenthood funding level: While there is no line item in the
federal budget for Planned Parenthood, they provide critical health care
services for people in Medicaid and other federal health care programs.
I support increasing funding to provide affordable and accessible family
planning and reproductive health care services through Medicaid and
Title X, which Planned Parenthood participates in.

I will use executive action to immediately reverse the damage done by
the current administration to limit access to reproductive health care
services, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Reverse the Trump administration's domestic and global gag rules
  regarding abortion services and the refusal of care rules.
\item
  Ensure that Title X family planning funds only go to grantees that
  provide comprehensive and evidence-based family services and offer the
  full range of comprehensive methods.
\end{itemize}

It is critical to acknowledge that a president alone cannot secure the
constitutional right to privacy affirmed by Roe v. Wade. The vast
majority of Americans support upholding Roe v. Wade, and the principle
that people should have the right to make deeply personal health care
decisions with their doctor. Protecting this fundamental freedom through
legislative action will require that senators and members of Congress
share a respect for personal dignity and autonomy in health care.

If we do not have the majorities necessary in the United States Congress
to strengthen Roe v. Wade and abortion access at the federal level, I
will use the power and influence of the presidency to work with state
legislators.

of viability (roughly 24 weeks)? If so, what
restrictions?}\label{should-there-be-restrictions-on-abortion-after-the-point-of-viability-roughly-24-weeks-if-so-what-restrictions-2}}

The fact is that less than 1 percent of abortions take place after 24
weeks of pregnancy. They often involve heartbreaking circumstances in
which a person's health or life is at risk, or when the fetus has a
congenital condition that is incompatible with life. As I have said
before, people and families in these circumstances are receiving the
most devastating news of their lifetime, and the decisions that are made
about medical care in these moments are not made better, medically or
morally, by government dictating how these decisions are made. I trust
people and their families to make these decisions with the guidance of
their medical providers, who understand the complications and factors
that are unique to every pregnancy.

\subsubsection{Do you believe that abortion should be ``safe, legal and
rare''? Why or why
not?}\label{do-you-believe-that-abortion-should-be-safe-legal-and-rare-why-or-why-not-2}}

Abortion should be safe. Abortion is and should continue to be legal.
And abortion should be available to any person, if they so choose, as
part of a comprehensive health and pregnancy care plan. My
administration will ensure that people permanently have access to safe,
affordable and legal abortion, and guarantee access to the full range of
family planning options --- through Medicare for All Who Want It --- to
prevent unintended pregnancies.

Abortion has been safe and legal in this country for 40 years, despite
continuous efforts to limit access. What we know about the states where
abortion access is restricted is that it doesn't make abortion more
rare, but it makes it less safe and also significantly limits access to
the very preventive reproductive health care that allows people and
families to plan whether or not to become pregnant. The lowest
unintended pregnancy and abortion rates have coincided with wider,
easier access to preventive care associated with the Affordable Care Act
and making contraception available without cost sharing.

This framing is outrageous and completely misleading. It vilifies people
during what could be the most vulnerable time of their lives, when they
have to make excruciatingly difficult decisions. Such harsh, divisive
and patently false language does not have a place in my campaign, nor in
our politics or in our country. I will use language that brings people
together, and offer compassion and support for people facing trying
times.

What makes the Democratic Party strong is its unity around its shared

decisions about their own reproductive health and about their body.

Reproductive rights are essential to freedom in this country. I'm from a
conservative state where many people I love and respect view the issue
differently than I do as a pro-choice person. While some people of faith
have different views, I believe that at the end of the day, this
decision needs to be left to the person who is facing it. I trust them
to make the right decision, and I don't think the government imposing an
answer on her is going to make that decision any better, medically or
morally.

The vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade. In the event the
Supreme Court decides to deeply undermine its own legitimacy by
overturning longstanding settled law, Bernie will use the full extent of
his executive authority to protect a woman's right to abortion. Further,
we will build the grass-roots movement necessary to win back full
control of Congress, and we will codify Roe v. Wade into law and pass
Medicare for All, which will guarantee reproductive care, including
abortions, free at the point of service. It is clear that the vast
majority of Americans support passing Medicare for All, and we will work
with the millions of people across America to ensure this legislation is
passed.

Abortion should be safe, legal and accessible to every person who
chooses it. This is a decision that should be made by women. Right now,
women's rights are under attack, including by fake health clinics funded
by national right-wing groups, so our focus should be on protecting
those rights.

Yes. Abortion is a constitutional right. Yet right now, women in America
are facing a well-financed attack on their rights by far-right groups at
the federal, state and local level. This is unacceptable, and these
attacks don't just hurt women, they hurt everyone. Bernie will work with
grass-roots organizations to fight back against these attacks. And as
president, Bernie will pass Medicare for All and guarantee comprehensive
reproductive and abortion care to every person in this nation. We will
repeal the Hyde Amendment, and we will fight the unprecedented attack
against women's rights that we are seeing today.

People are welcome to their personal views as long as they do not use

has a moral responsibility to protect a woman's right to abortion.
Furthermore, any person Bernie nominates to the Supreme Court must
fundamentally understand the need to protect the rights of everyone, not
just a select few. That means a promise to defend Roe v. Wade and the
constitutional right to an abortion.

must fight back together, and defend a woman's right to control her own

This is a very difficult question. While I am loath to ever get between
a woman and her doctor --- for I believe that is not a proper place for

should only be performed when there is a threat to the life or health of
the mother, or in cases when it is determined that the developing fetus
will not be able to survive outside the womb.

Yes. Abortion is a legal medical procedure, so of course it should be
safe. I believe it should be rare because we should have a society in
which contraception is readily available, women have personal freedom
and autonomy, and all people receive adequate sex education. While I am
glad that abortion is legal and I believe it should be socially
acceptable, from my discussions with women about their deeply personal
experiences, it's clear to me that abortion can be a traumatic
experience for some women. That is why I believe aiming for it to be
``rare'' is good.

Yes, I believe that is a proper role for a president. If I am elected, I
will frequently make the point that the government should not be putting
itself between a woman and her doctor. Women's bodies are their own, and
women must always be the decision makers when it comes to medical
decisions about their bodies. No man --- nor any woman --- in government
should assert power over American women and their bodies.

In some cases, I think it is appropriate for the Democratic Party to

Medicaid and the Indian Health Service are extremely important
institutions that open up access to reproductive health care. In my

direct oversight over both --- which provide critical services. I would
also incentivize the 19 states that have not expanded Medicaid to do so,
to cover reproductive health services for a greater number of people,
and I would encourage all states to limit work requirements as a
condition for coverage or care.

Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans unilaterally changed the Supreme

Reproductive health care helps level the economic playing field. When
people have control over their bodies, they have the opportunity to go
to school, get jobs, create businesses and grow our economy. They can
more reliably plan their economic futures. Reproductive health care
should be available to every person who needs it at a price they can
afford. In the transition to Medicare for All, it is essential that all
forms of private and public health insurance cover this care. Once
implemented, Medicare for All will cover comprehensive reproductive
care, including birth control and abortion.

The overwhelming majority of Americans, including a majority of
Republicans, support Roe v. Wade. I would call on congressional
Republicans to do their job and represent their constituents. I would
use the bully pulpit of the White House to push for reproductive rights

Mitch McConnell can't continue to block the will of the people. I will
push to pass federal legislation that protects access to reproductive
care.

Only 1.3 percent of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later, and the
reasons are heartbreaking. 20-week abortion bans are dangerous and
cruel. They would force women to carry an unviable fetus to term or
force women with severe health complications to stay pregnant with their
lives on the line. The decision whether or not to carry a pregnancy to
term is one of the most personal decisions anyone can make. We must not
allow politicians to make this decision for parents and families just so
they can score cheap political points.

Yes. Infanticide is illegal everywhere in America --- and this narrative
pushed by right-wing, anti-abortion politicians is intentionally
deceptive and not rooted in reality. It is a fact that only 1.3 percent
of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later. And the reasons are often
heartbreaking, like the mother's life is in danger or there is a fetal
anomaly and the pregnancy is not viable. Politicians making claims of
infanticide ought to talk to the people whose lives are on the line and
the doctors who care for them instead of inserting themselves into
personal decisions and treating health care like political theater.

Abortion is health care, and health care is a human right. That means
everyone should be able to get the health care they need. Even if
Republicans manage to overturn Roe v. Wade, wealthy women will still get
abortions. And it will be hardworking women, poor women, women of color,
who will get crushed. The right to choose is fundamentally about the
right to access health care --- and every candidate for president must
stand up and defend that right.

Lawmakers in positions of power, regardless of party affiliation, should

right to a safe and legal abortion. We should stand up to any politician

I lived in a world where abortion was illegal and all I can say is some
women got lucky, some women didn't, but they all went through hell.
We're not going back. Not now and not ever. There are decisions women
should make for themselves. The government should not make these
decisions for them.

Adding context to two answers:

Q: ``If you want to repeal the Hyde Amendment, would it be a budget
dealbreaker? In other words, if Congress passed a budget that included
Hyde but was otherwise agreeable to you, what would you do?''

A: Unsure. It depends on the situation. I have an ambitious agenda --- a
Green New Deal, a Whole Health plan, wealth equality --- and want to
build support for enacting my agenda. At the same time, reproductive
rights are a top priority and I would work vigorously to defend the
right to abortion.

Q: ``Would you preserve federal funding for Planned Parenthood?''

A: Yes, but also increase. Better funding for Planned Parenthood would
help prevent unwanted pregnancies, increase access to reproductive
health for women and men, and provide screening for breast cancer.

I could issue an executive order reversing the Hyde Amendment provisions
of Executive Order 13535 signed by President Barack Obama in 2010
committing to retain the Hyde Amendment (done to win support of the
A.C.A. from anti-choice legislators).

I would expand the Women's Health Protection Act as already sponsored by
42 senators. The Women's Health Protection Act would block states from
banning abortion or holding providers to excessive medical standards,
like requiring abortion providers to be able to admit patients at nearby
hospitals.

Late abortions are done infrequently and for medical reasons. This
decision should be up to the woman and her doctor, not the government.

Yes, I would like to reframe the debate. To me, abortion is a moral
issue, but an issue of private morality. I do not believe the government
has any right to dictate private moral decisions. Moreover, I trust the
moral decision making of the American women. A woman alone can know the
dictates of her own conscience.

The Democratic Party has always been a ``big tent'' of people with
different views. There should not be a purity test or a litmus test for
the Democratic Party. Anyone who wishes to be a Democrat can choose to
be Democrat. The only exception should be the exclusion of someone who
is an avowed purveyor of hate, such as a Nazi or white nationalist.

What matters is what lawmakers do in their official capacity. I believe
strongly that the decision about abortion should be solely that of the
woman. Governments should have no say in what we do in our bedrooms and
have no say in what we do with our bodies.

Nowhere in our Constitution does it state a required number of Supreme
Court justices. Throughout our history, we've had varying sizes serving
on the bench. Andrew would increase the number of Supreme Court justices
if necessary to protect women's rights. He would also push for 18-year
term limits to be added to the Constitution so we don't run into
partisan squabbles every time we pick a new justice. By setting it so
that each president would nominate two justices during their term, we
could make the nominating process more fair.

In the U.S. in 2015, 1.3 percent of abortions take place after the 21st
week, and less than 1 percent take place after the 24th week. If
abortions happen at this late of a stage in a pregnancy, it is almost
always because of extreme circumstances, medical or otherwise. In these
cases, Andrew believes the decision should lie between a woman and her
doctor, not the government.

In a perfect world, only those who are ready for and desire a child
would become pregnant. But that's not the world we live in. Everyone has
a right to bodily integrity, and more needs to be done to ensure that
women have and maintain that right. Additionally, Andrew believes we
should be ensuring that everyone is secure, through programs such as the
Freedom Dividend, to ensure that no one is making these decisions
because of economic insecurity.

As president, Andrew would work to reframe the debate over personal
autonomy. Instead of using inaccurate and loaded terms to discuss what
is an intensely personal medical decision, Andrew would focus on
bringing facts and truth back to the conversation.

In Andrew's view, it is solely up to the woman to make this personal
decision. As a society, we should support mothers in big and small ways
if they do decide to have children. Andrew respects the feelings that
many Americans have on this issue, and appreciates the values one brings
to bear. However, it should always be up to the woman to choose what is
best. Andrew appreciates lawmakers who can distinguish between their own
views and their responsibility as legislators and policymakers.
