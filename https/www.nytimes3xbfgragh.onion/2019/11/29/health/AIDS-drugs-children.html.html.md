# New Strawberry-Flavored H.I.V. Drugs for Babies Are Offered at $1 a Day

Thousands of infants are doomed to early deaths each year, in part
because pediatric medicines come in hard pills or bitter syrups that
need refrigeration.

About 80,000 babies and toddlers die of AIDS each year, mostly in
Africa, in part because their medicines come in hard pills or bitter
syrups that are very difficult for small children to swallow or keep
down.

But on Friday, the Indian generic drug manufacturer Cipla announced a
new, more palatable pediatric formulation. The new drug, called
Quadrimune, comes in strawberry-flavored granules the size of grains of
sugar that can be mixed with milk or sprinkled on baby cereal. Experts
said it could save the lives of thousands of children each year.

“This is excellent news for all children living with H.I.V.,” said
[Winnie
Byanyima](https://twitter.com/Winnie_Byanyima?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor),
the new executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency in
charge of the fight against the disease. “We have been eagerly waiting
for child-friendly medicines that are easy to use and good to taste.”

Cipla [revolutionized the provision of AIDS drugs for adults almost two
decades
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2001/02/07/world/indian-company-offers-to-supply-aids-drugs-at-low-cost-in-africa.html),
pricing them at $1 a day. The new pediatric formulation will likewise be
priced at $1 a day. The announcement by Cipla and the Drugs for
Neglected Diseases Initiative, an offshoot of Doctors Without Borders
that supported the development of the drug, was timed to coincide with
World AIDS Day, which is Sunday.

Despite big advances in the prevention of mother-child transmission of
H.I.V., [about 160,000 children are still born infected each
year](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet), according to
UNAIDS, mostly in the poorest towns and villages of Africa. Almost half
of them die before the age of 2, usually because they have [no access to
drugs](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/may-2019/why-has-uptake-lopinavirritonavir-oral-pellets-children-been-slow)
or cannot tolerate them.

Quadrimune is still under review by the Food and Drug Administration,
and F.D.A. approval almost inevitably leads to rapid certification by
the World Health Organization. The company hopes to get a decision by
May.

Trials in healthy adults showed that the new formulation gets the drugs
into the blood; the four drugs in it were approved in the 1990s and are
used in many combinations.

A [clinical trial in H.I.V.-infected
infants](https://www.dndi.org/2019/media-centre/news-views-stories/news/study-for-a-child-friendly-hiv-treatment-begins-in-uganda/),
run by [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/en/acceuil), the research
arm of Doctors Without Borders, is now underway in Uganda to prove to
African health ministries that children accept the new formulation. Most
of the research costs have been paid by
[UNITAID](https://unitaid.org/#en), a Geneva-based organization set up
by​ France, Norway, Brazil and some other countries ​which imposed
special taxes on airline flights that are dedicated to ​bettering​
global health.

Currently, the most common pediatric drug combination includes a syrup
that is 40 percent alcohol, has a [bitter metallic
taste](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020945s034lbl.pdf)
that lingers for hours and must be transported in cold trucks and then
kept in a refrigerator — something that many poor rural families do not
own.

“Some families try to bury it in wet sand or dirt to keep it cool,” said
[Dr. Bernard
Pécoul](https://www.dndi.org/about-dndi/our-people/leadership/bernard-pecoul/),
executive director of the neglected diseases initiative. “And the
children [are vomiting it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbo2zL9JfG8)
on a regular basis.”

Moreover, each drug must be [squirted into a child’s mouth with a
separate
syringe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pJNJaxZnNs&feature=emb_title),
so a mother must have up to four syringes on hand and clean them for
each subsequent use. Children generally have to take the medicines twice
a day for the first four years of life. When liquid versions are
unavailable, some pills cannot be crushed and mixed in juice; they must
be swallowed whole.

In contrast, Quadrimune contains four H.I.V. drugs: ritonavir,
lopinavir, abacavir and lamivudine. The granules are coated first in a
polymer that doesn’t melt until it reaches the stomach, and then with
sweet, fruity flavoring.

[Dr. Kogie
Naidoo](https://www.fic.nih.gov/News/Examples/Pages/ImprovingHIVAIDS.aspx),
who heads treatment research at [Caprisa](https://www.caprisa.org/), an
AIDS treatment and research group based in Durban, South Africa, who was
not involved in Quadrimune’s development, said the new formulation could
solve many problems she and her colleagues encounter while treating
children.

Cipla, founded in 1935, was [the first generic drug company to offer
H.I.V. drugs in
Africa](https://www.amfar.org/articles/around-the-world/treatasia/older/an-interview-with-cipla-s-yusuf-hamied%E2%80%94indian-drug-maker-leads-the-charge-for-low-cost-aids-drugs/).
In 2001, its chairman, [Yusuf K.
Hamied](https://www.hbs.edu/creating-emerging-markets/interviews/Pages/profile.aspx?profile=yhamied),
[upended the global pharmaceutical industry by offering to supply a
three-drug
cocktail](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2001/02/07/world/indian-company-offers-to-supply-aids-drugs-at-low-cost-in-africa.html)to
Doctors Without Borders for $1 a day.

At the time, multinational drug companies were charging up to $15,000
for their regimens and refusing to lower prices except in secret
negotiations with a few countries and were working to block generic
competitors from the market. An estimated 25 million Africans were then
infected and thousands were dying every day. (The industry was also
suing South Africa’s president, Nelson Mandela, over a law he had signed
authorizing the government to cancel drug patents and award them to
generic makers.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2001, Dr. Hamied said he was losing money at the $350 a year price;
his break-even point was $600, he said, and he offered it to other
buyers for that.

But he said he acceded to requests from AIDS activists for the $1 a day
price to deliver a shock to his Western competitors and because such a
nice round figure was likely to make headlines (a gambit he is clearly
repeating now).

In the decades since, increased generic competition has driven the price
of triple therapy in poor countries to below $100 a year.

“Over the past 20 years, Cipla has pioneered fixed-dose combinations for
children and I do believe our Quadrimune could be a winner,” Dr. Hamied
said in an interview this week.

Because all four drugs in the formulation are older and no longer
patented, Cipla might eventually offer it in wealthy countries too, he
said. But that market is quite small because most pregnant women in the
West are tested for H.I.V. and immediately put on antiretroviral drugs,
which reduces to near zero the chances that they will infect their
babies in the womb, during birth or through breastfeeding.

The $1 a day price is for Quadrimune doses appropriate for children of
between 20 and 30 pounds, he noted, so the cost for newborns would be
even lower.

Paradoxically, treating infants with H.I.V. has actually become harder
in recent years than it was two decades ago.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the early 2000s, Cipla produced Triomune Baby and Triomune Junior,
two pediatric formulations of the world’s first adult three-in-one pill,
introduced in 2001.

But they contained nevirapine, a drug that in those days was often given
to pregnant women to prevent mother-child transmission. As a result,
many babies were born with nevirapine-resistant forms of the virus, and
the efficacy of pediatric Triomune fell by about half, Dr. Pécoul said.

Some nevirapine substitutes that work in adults do not work well in
children, and the combination that does work has the bitter taste.

Nowadays, many pediatric H.I.V. specialists are frustrated that they
cannot prescribe some of the newest drugs, such as tenofovir and
dolutegravir, because there is little or no data on how safe they are in
small children. The major drugmakers have little incentive to test their
products in children because there are so few customers who can pay high
prices.

If a child’s virus develops resistance to any regimen, a new one must be
tried, so more research is needed, said Dr. Naidoo, the AIDS researcher
in Durban.

But by any measure, she said, Cipla’s new, gentler formulation for
children is a major advance: “This is indeed great news for treating
pediatric H.I.V.”
