Like much of his comedy, Ronny Chieng’s contribution to our video series
“[Tell T a
Joke](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/t-magazine/100000006004756/tell-t-a-joke-natasha-lyonne.html)”
highlights the absurdities of American culture with the prickliness of
an immigrant and the timeliness of a news junkie. Born in Malaysia, and
raised between New Hampshire and Singapore, the New York-based comedian
embodies the perspective of the perpetual outsider peering anxiously
through the looking glass. Instead of encouraging him to assimilate,
Chieng says, his international upbringing only prompted him to become
more himself — stereotypes of Asian submission be damned. “As a grumpy
person,” he says, “when someone says that people of your race are not
supposed to be grumpy, it just makes me grumpier.”

This disposition has served him well in Hollywood, where he played the
obnoxious financier Eddie Cheng in “Crazy Rich Asians” (2018), and as a
correspondent on “The Daily Show,” Chieng performs the role of obnoxious
journalist, interrogating cryptocurrency and climate change with the
same slapstick venom he uses to deride deep-dish pizza (“I said I wanted
pizza, not some Italian guy’s dump on a plate.”) At times, his outrage
is fueled by empathy. In 2016, he
[responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX8jZTN0CdU) to a racist Fox
News segment that mocked inhabitants of New York’s Chinatown by
conducting his own on-the-street interviews with Chinatown residents
about American politics, often in Mandarin.

Today, Chieng debuts **** his one-hour stand-up special “[Asian Comedian
Destroys America\!](https://www.netflix.com/title/81070659)” on Netflix.
He sees the title as a meta-commentary on the West, playing on the word
“destroy” as both a term of endearment — *You destroyed that set\!* —
and a nod to yellow peril, or the racist fear, originating at the turn
of the 20th century, that Asian immigrants posed an existential threat
to Western society. “Or maybe I just came up with something funny and
I’m just trying to explain it retroactively,” he admits. “It came from
Netflix telling me I’m not famous enough and I need a title to get
people to click on the icon.*”* Despite the title’s proclamation,
though, Chieng sees the special as a test. “I’m still trying to find out
if I’m funny,” he says. “Like, am I actually good at this or not?”

Onstage in the special, wearing an amused grimace, he explains why
America needs more Asians, and makes the case for an Asian-American
president: “Man or woman, we will fix this,” he says, “in a week.” But
don’t mistake his pontificating for activism. “I’m just trying to write
what I think is funny,” he says. “I’m just trying to have as authentic a
reaction as possible to something.” In the process, Chieng shares
insights about America that only an immigrant could, or as he sneers
onstage: “You’re going to let this \[expletive\] foreigner teach you
about your country?”
