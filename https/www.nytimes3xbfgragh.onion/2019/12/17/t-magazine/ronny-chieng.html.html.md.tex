The comedian, whose Netflix special ``Asian Comedian Destroys America!''

Like much of his comedy, Ronny Chieng's contribution to our video series
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/t-magazine/100000006004756/tell-t-a-joke-natasha-lyonne.html}{Tell
T a Joke}'' highlights the absurdities of American culture with the
prickliness of an immigrant and the timeliness of a news junkie. Born in
Malaysia, and raised between New Hampshire and Singapore, the New
York-based comedian embodies the perspective of the perpetual outsider
peering anxiously through the looking glass. Instead of encouraging him
to assimilate, Chieng says, his international upbringing only prompted
him to become more himself --- stereotypes of Asian submission be
damned. ``As a grumpy person,'' he says, ``when someone says that people
of your race are not supposed to be grumpy, it just makes me grumpier.''

This disposition has served him well in Hollywood, where he played the
obnoxious financier Eddie Cheng in ``Crazy Rich Asians'' (2018), and as
a correspondent on ``The Daily Show,'' Chieng performs the role of
obnoxious journalist, interrogating cryptocurrency and climate change
with the same slapstick venom he uses to deride deep-dish pizza (``I
said I wanted pizza, not some Italian guy's dump on a plate.'') At
times, his outrage is fueled by empathy. In 2016, he
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX8jZTN0CdU}{responded} to a
racist Fox News segment that mocked inhabitants of New York's Chinatown
by conducting his own on-the-street interviews with Chinatown residents
about American politics, often in Mandarin.

Today, Chieng debuts **** his one-hour stand-up special
``\href{https://www.netflix.com/title/81070659}{Asian Comedian Destroys
America!}'' on Netflix. He sees the title as a meta-commentary on the
West, playing on the word ``destroy'' as both a term of endearment ---
\emph{You destroyed that set!} --- and a nod to yellow peril, or the
racist fear, originating at the turn of the 20th century, that Asian
immigrants posed an existential threat to Western society. ``Or maybe I
just came up with something funny and I'm just trying to explain it
retroactively,'' he admits. ``It came from Netflix telling me I'm not
famous enough and I need a title to get people to click on the
icon.\emph{''} Despite the title's proclamation, though, Chieng sees the
special as a test. ``I'm still trying to find out if I'm funny,'' he
says. ``Like, am I actually good at this or not?''

Onstage in the special, wearing an amused grimace, he explains why
America needs more Asians, and makes the case for an Asian-American
president: ``Man or woman, we will fix this,'' he says, ``in a week.''
But don't mistake his pontificating for activism. ``I'm just trying to
write what I think is funny,'' he says. ``I'm just trying to have as
authentic a reaction as possible to something.'' In the process, Chieng
shares insights about America that only an immigrant could, or as he
sneers onstage: ``You're going to let this {[}expletive{]} foreigner
teach you about your country?''
