# What We Learned About the Technology That Times Journalists Use

After three years and more than 130 columns, the smartphone was tops.
There were also some deliberate Luddites among us.

Several years ago, some colleagues and I were chatting about what was
missing from tech journalism. Plenty of news media outlets had written
breathlessly about hot new gadgets and apps. But what were people really
doing with that tech?

That question spawned [Tech We’re
Using](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/tech-we-are-using), a
weekly feature that documented how New York Times journalists used tech
to cover a wide variety of topics, including politics, sports, wars,
natural disasters, food and art.

With the decade coming to a close, we decided to also wrap up the column
after interviews with more than 130 Times reporters, editors and
photographers. Here were our biggest takeaways.

## Indispensable Tech: Encryption Apps and Batteries

Unsurprisingly, the smartphone was the most vital work tool among
journalists. Many reporters relied on smartphones for recording
interviews and turned to A.I.-powered apps like Trint and Rev to
[automatically transcribe
interviews](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/21/technology/personaltech/how-to-turn-an-iphone-into-a-work-only-tool.html)
into notes.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most Times reporters now also rely on some form of encrypted
communication, particularly [messaging
apps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/15/technology/personaltech/messaging-apps-katie-benner.html)
like Signal and WhatsApp or the emailing service ProtonMail, to keep
their sources and conversations confidential.

That is a remarkable shift. Encryption technologies became popular only
a few years ago, after the former government security contractor [Edward
Snowden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/13/books/review-permanent-record-edward-snowden-memoir.html)
revealed the extent of what the United States government was doing to
surveil its own citizens.

Another indispensable tool underlined a type of tech that has not
improved much: batteries. Many reporters, especially national
correspondents who live out of a suitcase, desperately needed phones
with [longer-lasting
batteries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/28/technology/personaltech/tech-tools-shootings-hurricanes.html),
so battery packs were a staple in their arsenal of tools.

## The Most Tech-Enthused Journalists Were Not Tech Reporters

Some of the reporters who were savviest about using tech worked in
politics and investigations. That is because they needed apps to pore
through [documents that were thousands of pages
long](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/18/technology/personaltech/tech-reporter-does-not-use-tech.html),
or software tools to [inspect what was going on under the
hood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/22/technology/personaltech/maximize-online-privacy.html)
of a website’s code. Others needed special apps to hide their identities
with burner phone numbers.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many photographers were also early adopters of new tech. One key
example: drones. [Those were constantly getting
smaller](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/02/technology/personaltech/visual-journalism-drones.html),
and their cameras were improving, which created possibilities for new
types of photography, like overhead shots of houses damaged in a fire.

In contrast, many tech reporters tried to [minimize the amount of tech
they
used](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/18/technology/personaltech/tech-reporter-does-not-use-tech.html).
That could be, in part, a symptom of knowing too much about the
companies they covered and the wide swaths of data those companies
collected.

## Tech Has Changed Everything

Many editors and reporters also talked about how tech had transformed
the industries they cover.

In the world of dining, digital photography and platforms like Instagram
have become the main method that [restaurants use to
communicate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/20/technology/personaltech/what-technology-pete-wells-uses.html)
with patrons. [Rocket
launches](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/22/technology/personaltech/rocket-launches-space-iphone.html)
are now live-streamed online, which let our space reporter watch from
his phone instead of heading to the space station. And in the
entertainment world, video streaming has opened doors to [a wealth of
new
content](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/26/technology/personaltech/for-a-tv-editor-500-new-shows-a-year-require-a-fresh-script.html)
— so much that reporting on movies and TV shows has become an art of
curation.

What’s ahead? If tech has invaded everything, the answer is: even more
transformation.
