\textbf{A BIG BED FOR LITTLE SNOW}

\textbf{By Grace Lin}

The mother and son in Lin's gorgeous winter fable seem to float against
a pure white background, making her soft illustrations look both precise
and ethereal. Little Snow, who wears snowflake pajamas, gets a new
featherbed. Whenever his mother leaves the room, he jumps on it, until
one day it rips, sending feathers flying. A page turn reveals that his
feathers are snowflakes, falling on a twilit city block. In an apartment
building's windows are delightful cameos from other pajama-clad
children: Little Star, from Lin's ``A Big Mooncake for Little Star,''
and Peter from ``The Snowy Day.''

40 pp. Little, Brown. \$18.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)

\textbf{MY WINTER CITY}

\textbf{Written by James Gladstone.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Gary Clement.}

This lovely tribute to urban wintertime is oversize, and Clement's
cheerful watercolor art takes full advantage. Expansive snowy scenes
seem not just stirring but intimate. A kid, his dad and their dog
happily brave a downfall to go sledding across town. In Gladstone's
poetic text, the boy notes the ``windows gone all steamy'' on the bus,
the ``wilderness of footprints, crisscrossing, disappearing'' on the
sidewalks, the ``light powder pillows'' when they make snow angels.
Observant little ones can pore over these pages for a long time,
noticing each well-observed detail of wintertime city life.

40 pp. Groundwood/House of Anansi. \$19.95. (Ages 4 to 8.)

From ``Bear Is Awake!''

\textbf{BEAR IS AWAKE!}

\textbf{An Alphabet Story}

\textbf{BY Hannah E. Harrison}

A girl and a bear star in Harrison's (``My Friend Maggie'') tale that
doubles as an alphabet book, letting even pre-readers follow the
alphabetical story through the buoyant, expressive illustrations. A
``big bear'' wakes up in the middle of winter, leaves her den and shows
up at a ``cozy cabin,'' where a ponytailed girl is annoyed, then
inspired to take the bear into town to figure out how to help the
creature get back to hibernation. (First stop: the library.) The final
page has no words, just a proud look on the girl's face: mission
accomplished.

40 pp. Dial. \$17.99. (Ages 3 to 6.)

From ``I Am Polar Bear.''

\textbf{I AM POLAR BEAR}

\textbf{Written by J. Patrick Lewis.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Miriam Nerlove.}

Modest in size, this brilliant book nonetheless captures the majesty of
the polar bear. Lewis, a former children's poet laureate, has the
creature tell us what he's called in different cultures, from the Inuit
(``I am Nanuk'') to the Sami, who ``refuse to speak my name for fear of
offending me.'' Nerlove's shimmering illustrations hop effortlessly
between styles of dress and the shades of white in the polar bear's fur
and habitat. The devastating ending shows the polar bear adrift on a
shrinking bit of ice, ``losing hold.'' It's wonderful to see a call for
cross-cultural respect that also demonstrates, heartbreakingly, the
interwoven lives of humans and an imposing yet utterly vulnerable
species.

32 pp. Creative Editions. \$18.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)

From ``Snow for Everyone!''

\textbf{SNOW FOR EVERYONE!}

\textbf{Written by Antonie Schneider.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Pei-Yu Chang.}

``It rarely snows in Jerusalem,'' as Schneider's lovely parable notes.
When it does, children of all faiths celebrate. But after one snowfall,
three kids draw lines claiming the snow, and try to get more from one
another when it begins to melt. They consult a rabbi, an imam and a
priest. All agree that like any mystery, it's hard to hold on to, yet
``there is enough snow for everyone.'' Chang's illustrations convey the
gravity and touch of whimsy packed into this hopeful little story.

32 pp. NorthSouth. \$17.95. (Ages 4 to 8.)

From ``Snowy Race.''

\textbf{SNOWY RACE}

\textbf{Written by April Jones Prince.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Christine Davenier.}

A girl gets to ride on her dad's giant snowplow in this delightful
rhyming tale. They race through the heavy snow, but it's not clear where
they're going until they arrive at the airport, where her mother is
waiting. Prince's (``What Do Wheels Do All Day?'') text is intriguingly
spare, letting Davenier's (``The First Thing My Mama Told Me'') softly
exuberant wintertime scenes shine.

40 pp. Margaret Ferguson/Holiday House. \$18.99. (Ages 3 to 6.)

From ``Snow Leopard: Ghost of the Mountain.''

\textbf{SNOW LEOPARD: Ghost of the Mountains}

\textbf{Written by Justin Anderson.}

\textbf{Illustrated by Patrick Benson.}

A zoologist treks through the Himalayas in search of a snow leopard ---
so elusive, she's called ``the gray ghost'' --- in this thrilling and
informative book that fleshes out a quest story with facts. (Did you
know scientists call the marks animals leave ``pee-mails''?) Benson's
pale illustrations perfectly capture the vastness of the landscape and
the incongruous beauty of felines in the snow.

32 pp. Candlewick. \$16.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)

\textbf{WINTERCAKE}

Image

From ``Wintercake.''

\textbf{By Lynne Rae Perkins}

The Newbery medalist Perkins (``Criss Cross'') spins a warm and
thought-provoking tale about making mistakes, making things right and
moving on. It's a snowy night and Thomas, a round, furry brown fellow,
is miserable because he has misplaced the basket of dried fruit he needs
to make wintercake. His bird friend Lucy overhears a dark-furred
creature say he has it. In fact he's on his way to return it to Thomas
--- ``I jumped to conclusions!'' she laments, before they make it up to
the ``noble chap'' by giving him the wintercake. As always, Perkins's
words and illustrations radiate generosity of spirit.

40 pp. Greenwillow/HarperCollins. \$17.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)
