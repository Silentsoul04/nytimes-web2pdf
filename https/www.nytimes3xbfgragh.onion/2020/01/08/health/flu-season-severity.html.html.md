# The Flu Season May Yet Turn Ugly, C.D.C. Warns

</div>

Almost as many people are falling ill as did two years ago, in what was
a particularly severe flu season. But this season’s virus is unusual,
and it’s too early to tell how
dangerous.

The United States may be headed into a bad flu season, according to
figures recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

As of the last week of December, [“widespread” flu activity was
reported](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) by health
departments in 46 states. More ominously, a second measure — the
percentage of patients with flu symptoms visiting medical clinics — shot
up almost to the peak reached at the height of the 2017-18 flu season,
which was [the most severe in a
decade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/26/health/flu-rates-deaths.html).

About[61,000 Americans died of flu that
season](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm), the
C.D.C. said. (The original estimate of 79,000 [was revised
downward](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm#anchor_1574361280230)
last year; the agency said the number changed as more death certificate
information became available.)

This year’s flu vaccine may not be particularly effective against the
strain of the virus now widespread in the United States, experts said.
But even so, it’s worth getting the shot: people who are vaccinated fare
better if struck by the flu than those who are not.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is still too early to know how severe this season will be, said
[Lynnette
Brammer](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/resource-center/partners/flu-fighter-lynnette-brammer.htm),
leader of the agency’s domestic influenza surveillance team.

Although many people are coming down with flu, the two chief indicators
of severity — hospitalizations and deaths — are not yet elevated, she
noted.

Deaths from pneumonia and flu are actually lower than normal at this
time. But reports of hospitalization and death normally lag other
indicators by at least two weeks.

The current season [did begin unusually
early](https://time.com/5746409/early-flu-season-2019-2020/). By late
November, the flu had hit hard in the Deep South, from Texas to Georgia.
The virus then broke out in California and the Rocky Mountain states,
but was not widespread in the Northeast until recently.

That pattern echoes what happened in Australia, where winter runs from
June through August. [Flu came unusually early to the Southern
Hemisphere](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/04/health/flu-australia-america.html)
in 2019. In seasons when Australia has a bad flu season, the Northern
Hemisphere sometimes does, too.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In another important way, however, the United States is not following
Australia’s lead. The A(H3N2) strain of influenza was dominant there
last year, while most American cases this season have been caused by a
very different strain, called B Victoria. (B strains are named for the
cities where they were first isolated.)

B strain flus do not normally arrive until late in the season. But when
they do, “they often impact children more than adults and older adults,”
Ms. Brammer said.

*\[What parents need to know about*[*this flu
season*](https://parenting.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/childrens-health/flu-season-children)*\]*

The C.D.C. tracks the deaths of children individually, rather than
making estimates, as is done for adults. Those over 65 are usually the
group hardest hit by flu. Thus far this season, 27 children have died of
flu — in 2017-18, 187 died — but pediatric deaths don’t normally start
peaking until mid-January.

On the rise now is the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain, which is a descendant of the
pandemic “swine flu” that first appeared in 2009 and then morphed into a
seasonal flu.

H1N1 strains are usually the first to appear. They usually cause fewer
hospitalizations and deaths per capita than B strains or A(H3N2).

Thus far, based on limited testing data, this season’s flu shot[does not
look like a good
match](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2019-2020.htm) for
the B Victoria flu and may not be very effective, the C.D.C. said. But
the shot does still appear to be well matched for the A(H1N1)pdm09
strain.

C.D.C. flu data relies on reports from doctors’ offices, clinics and
hospital emergency rooms about how many patients come in with flu
symptoms.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

An even faster measurement of flu’s spread comes from [Kinsa
Health](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/16/health/smart-thermometers-flu.html),
which collects daily readings of fevers from up to two million users
around the country who own its thermometers. The devices connect to
smartphones and instantly upload readings to the company’s app.

***\[*[*Like the Science Times page on

**[*Science Times newsletter.*](http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU)*\]***

Kinsa readings indicate that flulike activity peaked on Dec. 24 at a
level just below the 2017-18 level — confirming what the C.D.C. found —
and has since dropped by almost a third, said Nita Nehru, a company
spokeswoman.

But even this week’s lower figure “is much higher than is typical of
this time of year,” she added. It may bounce up again soon, now that
students have returned to school from holiday vacations.

The company assumes that fevers lasting three or more days indicate flu
rather than a common cold, said Inder Singh, the company’s founder.

The C.D.C. has not endorsed Kinsa’s methods, but the data does show flu
patterns at least a week or two ahead of reports from medical clinics.

Thus far, almost none of the hundreds of samples tested by the C.D.C.
have been resistant to Tamiflu or any other common antiflu drug. Those
medications do not cure the flu; they only reduce the severity of an
infection, and only if they are taken early.
