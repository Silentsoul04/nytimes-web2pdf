# Val Demings: Impeachment Manager Offers Law Enforcement Experience

</div>

Ms. Demings, a relatively junior member of Congress from Florida who had
been a police chief, has become a respected questioner on both the House
Judiciary and Intelligence
committees.

WASHINGTON — As one of the newer members of the House Intelligence
Committee, Representative Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida, was one
of the last to question Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel,
during the seven-hour hearing in July on his investigation into Russian
interference in the 2016 election.

But it was [a question from Ms.
Demings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/25/us/politics/trump-written-answers-mueller.html?searchResultPosition=1)
about President Trump’s written answers to the inquiry that elicited a
rare and striking concession outside the contents of Mr. Mueller’s
report. When she asked whether the president’s “answers showed that he
wasn’t always being truthful,” Mr. Mueller appeared to agree: “I would
say generally.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is that approach to questioning, coupled with her experience on both
the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, that helped propel Ms.
Demings, in only her second term in Congress, to the role of impeachment
manager nearly six months after that exchange. She participated in both
the public hearings into the allegations that Mr. Trump pressured
Ukraine for assistance in his re-election campaign and the committee
work on the [two articles of
impeachment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html)
that passed the House last month.

“I’ve taken four oaths in my lifetime, two as a law enforcement officer
and two now as a member of Congress,” she said in December. “Each oath
stated that I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”

“I’ve enforced the laws and now I write the laws,” she added. “And I
know that nobody is above the law.”

Ms. Demings, 62, grew up in Jacksonville, Fla., where she shared a
two-room home with her six older siblings and her parents, Elouise, a
maid, and James, a janitor. After attending segregated schools, she
became the first in her family to graduate college, with [a criminology
degree](https://demings.house.gov/about) from Florida State University.

“I believe in the promise of America because I’ve seen the promise of
America,” Ms. Demings said at that December hearing.

She went on to join the Orlando, Fla., Police Department, becoming its
first female chief in 2007. After serving on the force for 27 years, she
retired in 2011. The next year, she narrowly lost a race for the House
of Representatives. In 2014, she passed on a congressional rematch to
run for mayor of Orange County, home to Orlando, before later
withdrawing from that race. In 2016, she won her congressional seat.

Ms. Demings enjoys — in what her congressional biography calls her
“[very limited free time](https://demings.house.gov/about)” — riding
her Harley-Davidson Road King Classic motorcycle.
