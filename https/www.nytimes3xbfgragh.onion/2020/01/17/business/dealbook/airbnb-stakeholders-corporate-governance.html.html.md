## Airbnb moves beyond shareholders

Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s co-founder and C.E.O., spoke exclusively to
Andrew last night about [the company’s announcement
today](https://news.airbnb.com/serving-all-stakeholders) that it will
think about all “stakeholders” when it comes to corporate governance,
not just investors.

**The move is Mr. Chesky’s take** on the [Business Roundtable’s
recommendations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/19/business/business-roundtable-ceos-corporations.html)
last year that companies consider employees, the environment and more in
their business decisions.

• Airbnb is planning to hold a “Stakeholder Day.” It would be like a
traditional annual shareholder meeting — except that everyone from
customers to “hosts” to employees and others will be invited.

• It will also change its compensation program, with factors important
to stakeholders like progress on guest safety taken into account when
bonuses are calculated.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**“I don’t want to be one of those C.E.O.s** to say we’re trying to do
all this great stuff, but then we treat board meetings exactly like
every other board meeting,” Mr. Chesky told Andrew. He added that he
doesn’t think this is particularly radical: “I think this is where the
world is going.”

**The big picture:**

• Airbnb remains under fire on a number of fronts, including battles
with regulators over housing laws, concerns over the safety of its
customers and claims of discrimination by hosts. They’re among the
struggles that surround the company’s [plans to go
public](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/19/technology/airbnb-ipo-2020.html)
this year.

• It’s unclear whether investors, as one of many groups of stakeholders,
will embrace their diminished stature within Airbnb’s universe.

• And it remains to be seen whether the new goals will increase the
company’s valuation in its market debut.

## Microsoft’s ambitious climate goal: going “carbon negative”

The tech giant unveiled a response to climate change yesterday that goes
beyond offsetting carbon emissions. It wants to erase its entire
historical carbon footprint by 2050, a target that no other major
company has set before.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**[What the plan
involves](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/):**

• Becoming “carbon negative” by 2030, which means not only ending the
emission of carbon into the atmosphere, but also removing it.

• Creating a Climate Innovation Fund that will invest $1 billion over
the next four years into developing carbon-removal technology, which
currently isn’t commercially viable.

**It goes further than other environmental pledges** by Fortune 500
companies. Amazon said last year that it aimed to be carbon neutral by
2040. And PepsiCo announced this week that it wanted to [cut its carbon
emissions by 20
percent](https://www.fastcompany.com/90451782/pepsicos-u-s-operations-will-be-powered-by-100-renewable-electricity-this-year)
over the next decade. Climate activists hope that such moves will spur
other corporations to think just as big.

**But there’s reason to be skeptical** of Microsoft’s pledge. Sue Reid
of the environmental nonprofit group Ceres told Reuters that the
economics of carbon removal [remained
murky](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-microsoft/in-climate-push-microsoft-to-erase-its-carbon-footprint-from-atmosphere-idUSKBN1ZF2CG):
“That math is all facing some new uncertainty and vulnerabilities tied
to exacerbated climate change impact,” such as more wildfires, she said.

**Expect this to be a huge topic at the World Economic Forum** in Davos,
Switzerland, next week. Andrew will be on the ground to give you the
inside
scoop.

## Inside Leon Black’s moneymaking machine

Apollo Global Management is one of Wall Street’s biggest private equity
firms, managing over $320 billion in assets. Apollo’s success is due in
large part to the strategies of its founder, Leon Black, who gets his
close-up in this week’s [Bloomberg Businessweek cover
story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-01-16/nobody-makes-money-like-apollo-s-ruthless-founder-leon-black?srnd=businessweek-v2).

**“Black’s aggressive approach** — involving layoffs and slashing
benefits — is also among the most profitable,” Caleb Melby and Heather
Perlberg of Businessweek write. “Apollo’s flagship private equity fund,
which it opened to investors in 2001, has delivered annual returns of 44
percent.”

**Highlights from Mr. Black’s career** include:

• Working with Mike Milken on junk bonds, a term Mr. Black still hates
because competitors came up with it: “We were never accepted by the
Goldmans and the Morgans and the Kidder Peabodys and the First Bostons.”

• Investing where others wouldn’t dare. “Everybody else is running for
the doors, and we’re backing up the trucks,” Mr. Black told
Businessweek.

**But his biggest problem right now** might be his association with
Jeffrey Epstein:

• The depths of Mr. Black’s financial ties to the late financier are
unknown, but he is known to have given $10 million to Mr. Epstein’s
charity and persuaded the financier to invest in a friend’s muffler
company.

• “After Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell a month
later, former Apollo employees joked darkly that his death had made
Black’s life easier.”

## Why banks should give thanks to Trump

President Trump ribbed a top JPMorgan Chase executive this week when he
said her bank should [thank him for its stellar
earnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-15/trump-tells-jpmorgan-executive-to-say-thank-you-mr-president).
He [may have had a
point](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-16/trump-tax-cut-hands-32-billion-windfall-to-america-s-top-banks),
at least when it comes to his tax cuts, writes Yalman Onaran of
Bloomberg.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• Savings for America’s top six banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America,
Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — from the 2017
tax overhaul have now surpassed $32 billion.

• The banks “posted earnings this week showing they saved $18 billion in
2019, more than the prior year, as their average effective tax rate fell
to 18 percent from 20 percent,” Mr. Onaran writes.

• “The six firms posted $120 billion in net income for 2019, inching
past 2018’s mark. They had never surpassed $100 billion before the tax
cuts.”

## Can Alphabet stay in the $1 trillion club?

The parent company of the search giant Google hit $1 trillion in market
value yesterday, the fourth tech company to do so. But Alphabet faces
challenges to stay at that level:

• **Regulation.** [Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT
notes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/16/technology/google-trillion-dollar-market-cap.html)
that “it faces investigations from Congress, state attorneys general and
the Department of Justice,” as well as pressure from other regulators
around the world.

• **New leadership.** Alphabet’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey
Brin, have taken a step back, leaving the company in the hands of Sundar
Pichai, who has been criticized as lacking vision.

• **Shareholder sentiment.** Investors are “debating whether the largest
internet stocks have gotten too pricey,” [Amrith Ramkumar of the WSJ
writes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-becomes-fourth-u-s-company-to-ever-reach-1-trillion-market-value-11579208802).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**And here’s why it could keep climbing**, Mr. Wakabayashi points out:
“Google search is the on-ramp to much of the internet.”

## Revolving door

**Chris Young** is [stepping down as the
chief](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcafee-ceo-chris-young-to-depart-11579217891)
of the cybersecurity company McAfee to become a senior adviser to TPG,
the investment firm. He will be replaced by **Peter Leav** of BMC
Software.

**George Cheeks**, the vice chairman of NBCUniversal Content Studios,
[reportedly
resigned](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcuniversal-executive-george-cheeks-heading-to-cbs-in-senior-role-11579049840)
to take a senior role at CBS.

**James Debney** [stepped down as the
C.E.O.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-15/smith-wesson-maker-replaces-ceo-after-non-financial-misconduct)
of the parent company of the gun maker Smith & Wesson after the board
discovered what it said was nonfinancial misconduct.
