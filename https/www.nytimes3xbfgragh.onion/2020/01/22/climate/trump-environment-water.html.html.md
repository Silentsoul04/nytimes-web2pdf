WASHINGTON — The
[Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-lobbyists-swamp-campaign.html)
administration on Thursday finalized a rule to strip away environmental
protections for streams, wetlands and groundwater, handing a victory to
farmers, fossil fuel producers and real estate developers who said
Obama-era rules had shackled them with onerous and unnecessary burdens.

From Day 1 of his administration, President Trump vowed to repeal
President Barack Obama’s “Waters of the United States” regulation, which
had frustrated rural landowners. His new rule, which will be implemented
in about 60 days, is the latest step in the Trump administration’s push
to [repeal or weaken nearly 100 environmental rules and
laws](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html),
loosening or eliminating rules on climate change, clean air, chemical
pollution, coal mining, oil drilling and endangered species protections.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although Mr. Trump frequently speaks of his desire for the United States
to have “crystal-clean water,” he has called his predecessor’s signature
clean-water regulation “horrible,” “destructive” and “one of the worst
examples of federal” overreach.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last
administration’s disastrous Waters of the United States rule,” he told
the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual convention in Texas on
Sunday, to rousing applause.

“That was a rule that basically took your property away from you,” added
Mr. Trump, whose real estate holdings include more than a dozen golf
courses. (Golf course developers were among the key opponents of the
Obama rule and key backers of the new one.)

His administration had completed the first step of its demise in
September with the [rule’s
repeal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/12/climate/trump-administration-rolls-back-clean-water-protections.html).

Mr. Trump’s replacement, called the “[Navigable Waters Protection
Rule](https://www.epa.gov/nwpr),” finishes the process. It not only
rolls back key portions of the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>2015 rule that had guaranteed protections under the 1972 Clean
Water Act to certain wetlands and streams that run intermittently or run
temporarily underground, but also relieves landowners of the need to
seek permits that the Environmental Protection Agency had considered on
a case-by-case basis before the Obama
rule.

It also gives President Trump a major policy achievement to bring to his
political base while his impeachment trial continues.

“Farmers coalesced against the E.P.A. being able to come onto their
land, and he’s delivering,” said Jessica Flanagain, a Republican
strategist in Lincoln, Neb. “This is bigger news for agricultural
producers than whatever is happening with the sideshow in D.C.,” she
added.

Speaking on<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Thursday at a
conference of the National Association of Home
Builders<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in Las Vegas, Andrew
Wheeler, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
framed the new rule as the rightful return of power from the federal
government to landowners and states.

“It respects the limited powers that the executive branch has been given
under the Constitution and the Clean Water Act to protect navigable
waters,” he said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

The new water rule **** for the first time in decades allow landowners
and property developers to dump pollutants such as pesticides and
fertilizers directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to
destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.

“This will be the biggest loss of clean water protection the country has
ever seen,” said Blan Holman, a lawyer specializing in federal water
policy at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “This puts drinking
water for millions of Americans at risk of contamination from
unregulated pollution. This is not just undoing the Obama rule. This is
stripping away protections that were put in place in the ’70s and ’80s
that Americans have relied on for their health.”

Mr. Holman also said that the new rule exemplifies how the Trump
administration has [dismissed or marginalized scientific
evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html).
Last month, a government advisory board of scientists, many of whom were
handpicked by the Trump administration, [wrote that the proposed water
rule “neglects established
science.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/31/climate/epa-science-panel-trump.html)

But farmers and fossil fuel groups supported the change.

“This is a big win for farmers, and this is the president delivering
what he promised,” said Donald Parrish, senior director of regulatory
affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation, which had lobbied for
years to weaken the Obama administration’s water rules.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Karen Harbert, chief executive officer of the American Gas Association,
said the new rule “would restore the proper balance between federal and
state regulation of our nation’s waters and protect our rivers, streams
and lakes without stifling construction of important infrastructure.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Obama rule protected about 60 percent of the nation’s waterways,
including large bodies of water such as the Chesapeake Bay, Mississippi
River and Puget Sound, and smaller headwaters, wetlands, seasonal
streams and streams that run temporarily underground. It limited the
discharge of pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and industrial
chemicals into those waters.

The new rule, written by the E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers,
will retain federal protections of large bodies of water, as well as
larger rivers and streams that flow into them and wetlands that lie
adjacent to them. But it removes protections for many other waters,
including wetlands that are not adjacent to large bodies of water, some
seasonal streams that flow for only a portion of the year, “ephemeral”
streams that only flow after rainstorms, and groundwater.

Legal experts say that Mr. Trump’s replacement rule would go further
than simply repealing and replacing the 2015 Obama rule — it would also
eliminate protections to smaller headwaters that have been implemented
for decades under the 1972 Clean Water Act.

“This is rolling back federal jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act
further than it’s ever been before,” said Patrick Parenteau, a professor
of environmental law at Vermont Law School. “Waters that have been
protected for almost 50 years will no longer be protected under the
Clean Water Act.”

That could open millions of acres of pristine wetlands to pollution or
destruction, and allow chemicals and other pollutants to be discharged
into smaller headland waters that eventually drain into larger water
bodies, experts in water management said. Wetlands play key roles in
filtering surface water and protecting against floods, while also
providing wildlife habitat.

Ean Thomas Tafoya, a Colorado-based clean water activist with the group
GreenLatinos, said the new rule could harm the quality of the water in
the Colorado River, which supplies water to 17 western states.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are a headwater state,” he said. “This rollback will affect almost
every single stream that flows into the Colorado River.”

Mr. Tafoya said about 90 percent of the streams that supply the Colorado
River run only after rainfall or snowmelt. Under the new Trump water
rule, many of those streams will not qualify for federal pollution
protection. But Mr. Tafoya said pollutants such as chemical pesticides
that end up in those dry stream beds could nonetheless be swept into
larger bodies of water when the streams begin running after the spring
thaw of mountain snow.

“The toxics or poisons that lie dormant will still be there when the
streams are reactivated,” he said. “They will still get into the larger
bodies of water.”

Government scientists, even those appointed by the Trump administration,
say those concerns are justified. The E.P.A.’s Scientific Advisory
Board, a panel of 41 scientists responsible for evaluating the
scientific integrity of the agency’s regulations, concluded that the new
Trump water rule ignores science by “failing to acknowledge watershed
systems.” They found “no scientific justification” for excluding certain
bodies of water from protection under the new regulations, concluding
that pollutants from those smaller and seasonal bodies of water can
still have a significant impact on the health of larger water systems.

Those scientific findings, although they are not reflected in the
administration’s policy, could still play a role in the fate of the new
rule. Several state attorneys general are expected to join with
environmental groups to sue to overturn the Trump water rule, and those
groups are likely to cite those findings as evidence that the rule is
not legally sound.

“The legal standing all has to do with whether you have a rational basis
for what you’re doing,” said Mr. Parenteau. “And when you have experts
saying you’re not adhering to the science, that’s not rational, it’s
arbitrary.”
