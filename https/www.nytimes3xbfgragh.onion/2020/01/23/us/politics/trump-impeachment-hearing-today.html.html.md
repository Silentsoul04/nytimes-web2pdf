trial*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-24)*.*\]

## For Day 2 of their opening arguments, the House impeachment managers focused on the abuse of power charge against Trump.

[The seven House impeachment
managers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/22/us/impeachment-managers.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage),
led by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, resumed
oral arguments on Thursday, with 16 hours and 42 minutes remaining, and
started to build out their legal case that President Trump abused the
power of his office — one of [two articles of impeachment
against](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/12/10/us/politics/articles-impeachment-document-pdf.html)him.

The Democratic-led House also charged Mr. Trump with obstruction of
Congress for preventing current and former Trump administration
officials from testifying during the House inquiry and ignoring requests
for relevant documents. Managers plan to address that charge on Friday.

At the start of Thursday’s session, the Democrats had 16 hours and 42
minutes left to convince Republican senators that Mr. Trump should be
removed from office.

Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, which drafted the articles of impeachment, cited
constitutional law experts who testified last year that Mr. Trump’s
efforts to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine rose to the
level of impeachment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If what we are talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is
impeachable,” Mr. Nadler said, echoing [Michael J.
Gerhardt](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/us/politics/michael-gerhardt.html),
a constitutional law expert who testified in a House hearing in the
fall.

Mr. Schiff delivered the final argument of the day, pushing more
explicitly than ever for Mr. Trump’s removal from office.

Urging senators to re-evaluate the now familiar July phone call between
Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, he asked whether they truly believed that
Mr. Trump would put the nation’s interests before his own.

“You know you can’t trust this president to do what is right for this
country,” he said. “You can trust he will do what’s right for Donald
Trump.”

“If you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed,” Mr.
Schiff concluded. “Because right matters. Because the truth matters.
Otherwise, we are
lost.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## In a trial about the president’s interactions with Ukraine, House managers kept bringing up Russia.

For the second straight day, House impeachment managers repeatedly
referred to Russia, and its influence over the president in particular,
as they presented an argument that Mr. Trump should be removed from
office for a pressure campaign on Ukraine.

“This theory was brought to you by the Kremlin,” Mr. Schiff said at one
point Thursday afternoon as he described to senators a [debunked
conspiracy
theory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-conspiracy.html)
that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked into Democrats’ emails in 2016 with the
goal of helping Hillary Clinton win the election. The House managers
have argued that Mr. Trump’s interest in bolstering that theory played a
central role in his interactions with Ukraine, Russia’s adversary.

“The Russians not only got him to deflect blame from their interference
in our democracy, but they got him to withhold military aid,” Mr. Schiff
said. “Now of course, there was this convergence of interest between the
Kremlin and the president.

“The president wasn’t pushing Kremlin talking points just to do Vladimir
Putin a favor,” he continued. “He was doing it because it helped him.”

Russia, and in particular its role in the 2016 presidential election,
remains a sore subject for many senators. Democrats had once expected
the president to be impeached for his dealings with Russia in 2016, and
Republicans denounced a special counsel inquiry into the matter,
accusing Democrats and senior law enforcement officials of pushing this
narrative because they wanted to undermine Mr. Trump’s victory. The
final report from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, [stopped
short](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/23/us/politics/trump-mueller-obstruction.html)
of concluding whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice and threw to Congress
the fate of his
investigation.

## Democrats devoted part of their case to the Bidens, a decision Trump’s lawyer viewed as a mistake.

The House managers made a strategic decision on Thursday to focus
extensive attention on the actions of former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.

The lengthy presentation — by Representative Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas,
one of the House managers — was aimed at proving that [there was no
basis to Mr. Trump’s
assertions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/22/us/politics/biden-ukraine-trump.html)
that the former vice president and his son did improper things in
Ukraine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Common sense will tell us that this allegation against Joe Biden is
false,” Ms. Garcia told the senators.

But allies of Mr. Trump quickly pounced on the extended discussion about
the Bidens to insist that the impeachment trial should include scrutiny
of their actions, and potentially a move to call them as witnesses.

Mr. Trump’s Republican defenders have long argued that [the president’s
demand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/01/22/us/politics/impeachment-articles-arguments.html)
that Ukraine announce investigations into the Bidens was not improper
because he was merely interested in rooting out corruption in that
country.

At least one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers suggested the Democrats made a
mistake in focusing on the former vice president and his son.

“They have opened the door,” said Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for Mr.
Trump and a member of his impeachment legal defense team. “It’s now
relevant.”

*— Michael D.
Shear*

## Democrats called out one of Trump’s lawyers and a Republican senator for double talk.

Mr. Nadler worked on Thursday to undermine an argument from Mr. Trump’s
defense team that a president can be impeached only for committing an
ordinary crime, and that abuse of power does not qualify. While
constitutional scholars have [disputed that
interpretation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/20/us/politics/trump-impeachment-legal-defense.html)
of the Constitution, Mr. Nadler chose to highlight past statements of
two of Mr. Trump’s most prominent defenders.

Senators were shown a news clip featuring a member of Mr. Trump’s
current defense team, [Alan M.
Dershowitz](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/17/us/politics/alan-dershowitz-trump.html),
from 1998, when President Bill Clinton was facing impeachment. In the
clip, Mr. Dershowitz disputed the idea that a president needed to commit
a “technical crime” to be impeached.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It certainly doesn’t have to be a crime,” Mr. Dershowitz said at the
time. “If you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of
president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our
liberty, you don’t need a technical crime.”

Mr. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, offered a
different view only days ago.

“Without a crime, there can be no impeachment,” [he said Sunday on
CNN](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2001/19/sotu.01.html). Mr.
Dershowitz is expected to make the same argument when he takes to the
Senate floor in the coming days.

The managers also went after Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South
Carolina, with a clip from 1999, when he was an impeachment manager
during Mr. Clinton’s trial.

“It’s just when you’re using your office in a way that hurts people,
you’ve committed a high crime,” Mr. Graham said at the
time.

## Democrats repeatedly showed public clips of Trump to make their case against him.

Impeachment managers used Mr. Trump’s own words against him on Thursday
as they argued that he should be removed from office for abuse of power.

In trying to make the case that some administration officials understood
what the president wanted of Ukraine and “just how wrong it was,” Mr.
Schiff let the defendant do the talking.

At one point, a video clip from October aired in the Senate chamber
showing Mr. Trump answering a reporter’s question about what he really
wanted from Mr. Zelensky.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I would think that, if they were honest about it, they’d start a major
investigation into the Bidens,” Mr. Trump said in the clip. “It’s a very
simple answer.”

In another clip, Mr. Trump referred to the conspiracy theory that
Ukraine interfered with his campaign in 2016.

“There was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election
against us, and we want to get to the bottom it, and it’s very important
that we do,” Mr. Trump said.

“He’s not concerned about actual corruption cases,” Mr. Schiff said of
the clip, “only matters that affect him
personally.”

## Trump woke up in Washington for the first time since his trial started in earnest.

Back from Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic
Forum, Mr. Trump used [Twitter on Thursday
morning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-23/trump-back-in-washington-attacks-democrats-and-their-impeachment-arguments)
to lob insults at Democrats and to quote people on Fox News who lobbed
insults at Democrats.

And while his afternoon is packed with travel, the president found time
[to continue to offer his own
commentary](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1220410391668371457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-28178312941550050575.ampproject.net%2F2001071857360%2Fframe.html)
as Mr. Nadler was addressing the Senate, suggesting that Mr. Trump was,
indeed, watching the proceedings live.

The president left the White House on Thursday afternoon to travel to
Florida for the [Republican National Committee’s winter
meeting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/14/us/politics/trump-doral-rnc.html),
set to be held at one of his family’s properties.
