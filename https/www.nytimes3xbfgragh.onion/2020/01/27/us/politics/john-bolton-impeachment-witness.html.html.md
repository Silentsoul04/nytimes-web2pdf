WASHINGTON — The White House and Senate Republican leaders struggled on
Monday to salvage their plans for a quick acquittal of [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/us/politics/state-of-the-union-address.html)
after a new account by his former national security adviser [John R.
Bolton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/podcasts/the-daily/bolton-impeachment.html)
corroborated a central piece of the impeachment case against him.

The newly disclosed revelations by Mr. Bolton, whose forthcoming book
details how Mr. Trump conditioned military aid for Ukraine on the
country’s willingness to furnish information on his political rivals,
angered key Republicans and reinvigorated a bid to call witnesses. Such
a move would prolong the trial and pose new dangers for the president.

A handful of Republicans appeared to be moving closer to joining
Democrats in a vote to subpoena Mr. Bolton, even as their leaders
insisted that doing so would only delay his inevitable acquittal.

“I think it’s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those
of us who think we should hear from John Bolton,” Senator Mitt Romney,
Republican of Utah, told reporters. He later told Republican colleagues
at a closed-door lunch that calling witnesses would be a wise choice
politically and substantively, according to people familiar with the
discussions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As they opened the second day of their defense, Mr. Trump’s lawyers
largely ignored the revelations from Mr. Bolton, [reported on Sunday by
The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-bolton-book-ukraine.html),
that bolstered the abuse of power case made by the House Democratic
prosecutors.

Instead, the White House team is doubling down on a defense that is
directly contradicted by the account in Mr. Bolton’s book, due out in
March. Mr. Trump’s lawyers told senators that no evidence existed tying
the president’s decision to withhold security aid from Ukraine to his
insistence on the investigations. They say the investigations were
requested out of a concern for corruption in Ukraine.

“Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear
that there was no linkage between security assistance and
investigations,” said Michael Purpura, the deputy White House counsel.

Mr. Trump’s legal team also sought to turn the Democrats’ accusations on
their head.

They defended and played down the role of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
president’s personal lawyer who was at the center of Mr. Trump’s Ukraine
pressure campaign, calling him a “shiny object” Democrats were
brandishing to distract from a weak case. They sought to raise doubts
about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter
Biden, suggesting they were corrupt.

And they continued to argue that Mr. Trump’s actions were far from
impeachable.

Alan M. Dershowitz, a celebrity Harvard law professor, argued that the
Constitution holds that impeachment is for “criminal-like behavior,”
telling senators that the country’s founders “would have explicitly
rejected such vague terms as ‘abuse of power’ and ‘obstruction of
Congress’ as among the enumerated and defined criteria for impeaching
the president.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The theory has been rejected by most constitutional scholars.

As evening set in, Mr. Dershowitz made the legal team’s only reference
to Mr. Bolton, telling senators that the description of Mr. Trump’s
actions in his manuscript “would not constitute an impeachable offense.”

He added, “Let me repeat: Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if
true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power, or an impeachable
offense.”

Behind closed doors, Republicans were singularly focused on the former
national security adviser’s account, which stoked turmoil in their ranks
and opened cracks in their near monolithic support for the White House
strategy of denying witnesses and rushing toward a final verdict, almost
certain to be an
acquittal.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: A Times investigation reveals a firsthand account from John
    Bolton directly linking President Trump to the quid pro quo at the
    center of the impeachment. Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt on what
    that could mean for the final phase of the Senate trial.
    
    It’s Tuesday, January 28.
    
    Mike, Maggie, remind us when the discussion of John Bolton as a
    possible witness in the impeachment process starts.

  - michael schmidt  
    So John Bolton left the White House in early September. Trump said
    he was fired. Bolton said he resigned. A week later, we learn about
    the whistleblower’s complaint, and at that point, questions start to
    percolate. Why did Bolton resign, and what does he know? And in the
    coming weeks, as the House impeachment investigators summon White
    House officials to answer questions, we start to get different
    slivers —

  - archived recording  
    Bolton’s former aide, that’s Fiona Hill, testified yesterday before
    House impeachment investigators.

michael schmidt

— of Bolton’s concerns —

  - archived recording  
    Bolton reportedly called Giuliani, President Trump’s personal
    attorney this — “a hand grenade.”

michael schmidt

— and preoccupations with what was going on inside the White House.

  - archived recording  
    This is something that Fiona Hill said when she was talking about
    John Bolton, the former national security adviser.

michael schmidt

We don’t have a full picture, but we’re hearing things, like Bolton
saying —

  - archived recording  
    Basically he said, you go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of
    any drug deal that Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European
    Union, and Mick Mulvaney are cooking up.

michael schmidt

— I didn’t want to participate in this drug deal that these
administration officials were doing.

  - archived recording  
    The term “drug deal” here refers to the Ukraine probe that they were
    trying to initiate.

michael barbaro

Right, and that was his way of referring to this pressure campaign
against Ukraine to start investigations into Democratic rivals.

michael schmidt

Correct. So we’re learning these different things, but we’re not hearing
from Bolton.

  - archived recording  
    Let me read it one more time. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr.
    Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I
    conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in
    connection with Vice President —”

michael schmidt

And one of the problems with the impeachment investigation —

  - archived recording  
    We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and
    you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding.

michael schmidt

— was that the House was only really talking to people who were sort of
outside the president’s inner ring.

  - archived recording  
    Ambassador, you weren’t on the call, were you? You didn’t listen in
    on President Trump’s call and President Zelensky’s call?

  - archived recording (william b. taylor jr.)  
    I did not.

  - archived recording  
    You’ve never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney?

  - archived recording (william b. taylor jr.)  
    I never did.

  - archived recording  
    You never met the president?

  - archived recording (william b. taylor jr.)  
    That’s correct.

  - archived recording  
    This is what I can’t believe, and you’re their star witness. You’re
    their first witness.

michael schmidt

A few of the witnesses dealt with the president directly, but many of
them were simply relaying what was going on inside the White House.

michael barbaro

So Bolton becomes an even more tantalizing figure. He’s in the center of
juicy tidbits coming out of the inquiry. He may be on poor terms with
the president. It all seems to make him a perfect witness.

michael schmidt

He’s someone who Republicans trust. He has a long history in the
Republican Party, and we were hearing then that he had these concerns.
So what was it that he saw? What was it that he could add? He was in the
room with the president. What did the president tell him?

michael barbaro

So Maggie, what efforts are made by House impeachment investigators to
get Bolton to testify, to get him to just spill the beans?

maggie haberman

They asked him, back in I believe it was October, to come testify
voluntarily. He said no, and he had been ordered by the White House not
to take part, but the House decided not to submit a subpoena to try to
force him to testify, because —

michael barbaro

Why not?

maggie haberman

Because they were concerned that it was going to be a protracted legal
battle. They were very consumed with trying to wrap this all up quickly.
In hindsight, a lot of Democrats say, at least privately, they think
that that was a mistake. They think that they should have actually tried
to get him to come there.

michael barbaro

Right. So he does not end up testifying before the House.

maggie haberman

No. Bolton never spoke before the House and didn’t indicate that he
really wanted to at the time. He just said that he would not cooperate
with this request for testimony. So they sent over the articles of
impeachment without having a witness like Bolton, somebody who had a
direct conversation with the president, where the withheld military aid
for Ukraine was tied to the president’s desires for investigations.
There were just people who were speculating on motives or had heard
things secondhand, but there was no one with a firsthand interaction
with the president.

michael barbaro

O.K. So that brings us to November.

maggie haberman

Right, and so we get to November, and John Bolton is starting to make
noises, like he has something to say and he’s willing to share it. And
we learn on November 10, that one place he might be planning to share it
is in a book that he’s planning to write about his time in the White
House.

michael schmidt

So it was a pretty odd situation. You had House investigators that
wanted Bolton to talk. Bolton sort of signaling that he has something to
say. And then the news that he’s writing a book that you presume is
going to have some Ukraine details in it. So who’s going to get to that
information?

michael barbaro

Right. So in this situation, what do you two do as reporters to try to
figure out what he knows and maybe what he’s put in this book?

maggie haberman

So the House inquiry is over, but there’s all this secrecy around this
book. We knew it was coming. We had heard Simon & Schuster would be
putting it out. They wouldn’t even confirm that. We were scratching
around with people who might know. And as we were trying to do this,
Bolton then says, on January 6 — after not complying with the House
efforts to get him to testify — he says that he would be willing to
testify in the Senate, if there is a subpoena. It seemed like he was
trying to do a dance, where he was trying not to make Senate Republicans
angry at him, when he’s worked with them for years. And he needs them to
back him, as he’s embarking on this post-White House life and trying to
sell a book. But also trying to look like he was doing the right thing
and not just making it about the book. And it was really hard to
decipher what his motives were.

michael schmidt

As reporters, there is nothing that galvanizes us like a high-profile
public figure in a major story saying, I have important information, but
I’m not going to tell. And he’s essentially out there doing that —
putting the bait for reporters to try and get to the bottom of what’s in
the book.

maggie haberman

So we did what we normally do when we are handed some kind of bait,
which is we continued to try to figure out what was there and what was
in it. And whether it would include some damaging information about the
president. Or whether it would include some exculpatory information and
would be something that the president’s folks could even point to and
say it would help him. We just, we didn’t know, but we kept scratching.

michael barbaro

Right. If the one great unanswered question was what Bolton knew, then
the most obvious thing is to find out what is inside the book.

maggie haberman

That’s right, and we kept scratching and looking, and then we found out
what was in the book, and it was quite damaging to the president.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

  - archived recording 1  
    Brand new reaction this morning from a bombshell New York Times
    report on John Bolton’s upcoming book.

  - archived recording 2  
    A trial that seemed to be on a steady and speedy path to certain
    acquittal has been hit by a seismic shock.

  - archived recording 3  
    Startling new report could upend the impeachment trial. According to
    The New York Times, former —

michael barbaro

So what did you learn was actually in this book?

maggie haberman

The biggest thing that is in there is that Bolton writes about a
conversation that he claims to have had with President Trump in August
of 2019, where he pushed the issue of this withheld military aid with
the president. And the president suggested he didn’t want to end the aid
freeze until Ukraine turned over materials that he wanted in connection
with investigations into Democrats, who he thought had harmed him in
2016.

michael barbaro

So Bolton is having a conversation — he recounts in this book — with
President Trump in which Bolton says, hey, Mr. President, I want to talk
about this financial freeze on military aid to Ukraine, presumably in
the context of Bolton wanting to end it.

maggie haberman

Bolton pushed this conversation with the president, because he, along
with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, had been
trying to get the president for weeks to end the freeze and turn the aid
over, arguing that it was necessary for Ukraine to defend itself against
Russia. And so Bolton raised this issue to test where the president was,
and the president met him back by saying he didn’t want to end this
freeze until materials that he wanted were turned over in relation to
investigations into Democrats he thought had damaged him.

michael barbaro

Wow. Democrats, including Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

Democrats, including Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

michael barbaro

So Bolton is confirming in this account that President Trump articulated
— correct me if I’m wrong — a clear quid pro quo that explained why he
was holding up the security aid to Ukraine. That it was in return for
Ukraine investigating his Democratic rivals, like Joe Biden, and that of
course is the central claim of the articles of impeachment. And what
Bolton seems to be saying here is that that central claim is accurate,
and there’s now a firsthand account of it from the mouth of the
president himself.

michael schmidt

But you say confirms. This is the first time that we’re hearing anyone
say this. This is the first time that someone who was in the room, who
spoke directly to the president, says, yeah, the president didn’t want
to release the money until he got the fruits of the investigations. This
is new ground, and it’s significant, because the president’s lawyers
have time and time again argued on the Senate floor —

  - archived recording (michael purpura)  
    — that there was no connection between security assistance and
    investigations.

michael schmidt

— that the aid and the investigations were not linked.

  - archived recording (michael purpura)  
    — the pause on security assistance was distinct and unrelated to
    investigations.

michael barbaro

So this directly contradicts the way the president’s own lawyers talk
about the impeachment.

maggie haberman

Correct, or at least it undercuts their main argument, which is that
there was not a connection between what the president wanted and
releasing this aid.

michael barbaro

Am I right, Mike and Maggie, that this is as close to a smoking gun as
it gets in a case like this?

michael schmidt

Maybe, but throughout the Trump presidency, we’ve learned similarly
explosive disclosures, and the president has been able to weather them
politically. So yeah, in a normal time, would the news of the
president’s most recent national security adviser directly implicating
him in a question that is at the center of an impeachment hearing be a
smoking gun? Sure, but Trump has shown an ability to endure things like
this that gives me reticence to say, yeah, that’s a smoking gun. Because
when you say smoking gun, built into that is an assumption that the end
would be near.

maggie haberman

I’m with Mike on that. I think that we are a ways away from knowing what
this means. And as our colleague Peter Baker wrote today, it could end
up being like when the “Access Hollywood” tape came out in 2016 in the
campaign. And the big prediction was that this was going to be the end
of Donald Trump, this was going to be the end of his campaign, and it
obviously did not go that way. So we just don’t know yet.

michael barbaro

Well, what has been the reaction to this reporting, especially in the
Senate, where the trial is well underway and where the question of
calling witnesses is very much still alive?

michael schmidt

So we’re coming into the home stretch of the trial. And the question of
whether Bolton will testify has still not been resolved.

michael barbaro

Right.

michael schmidt

The story comes out, and there’s increased pressure on Senate
Republicans, those moderate ones who may be willing to go along with the
Democrats. How much does this story move them?

michael barbaro

And Maggie, what’s the answer?

maggie haberman

So far, we are seeing the same moderates who have said they want
witnesses before still say they want to hear from Bolton. So that’s Mitt
Romney.

  - archived recording  
    Four of you need to say yes. Do you think there are four votes?

  - archived recording (mitt romney)  
    I think it’s increasingly likely that the other Republicans will
    join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton. And
    whether there are other witnesses and documents, well, that’s
    another matter. But I think John Bolton’s relevance to our decision
    has become increasingly clear.

maggie haberman

Susan Collins of Maine is another person who has said this is another
factor that points to why there should be witnesses. But two other
possible votes for witnesses, one is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Andother
is Lamar Alexander, who the White House is watching very closely to see
what he’ll do. They have been more circumspect about whether they think
our story changes anything. And so far, Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell is trying to tell everybody to stay cool and just see how this
plays out.

michael barbaro

I mean, there will be people hearing this — hearing that the national
security adviser to the president observed him saying something that
directly implicates him in this impeachment case — and will ask, why
would any deliberative body sworn in as jurors not want to hear from
that person? What would be the justification for not hearing from Bolton
in this moment?

maggie haberman

So one thing that has come up from the senators in the last several
hours is they’re saying, if this was so important to hear from Bolton,
why didn’t the House subpoena him?

  - archived recording (john barrasso)  
    There’s nothing new here that John Bolton didn’t know before the
    House managers rested their case and stopped calling witnesses, and
    they never chose to call John Bolton.

maggie haberman

And you’re going to hear that, I think increasingly, if you don’t see a
move toward witnesses. That’s going to be an argument that senators are
going to point to.

michael barbaro

You missed your chance.

maggie haberman

Why are we doing your work for you? That part was in the House.

michael schmidt

And at another level, the reason why these senators are not going along
with calling Bolton is that Trump doesn’t want that to happen. And they
have been in lockstep with Trump for most of this.

michael barbaro

So the justification is keep the president happy.

maggie haberman

I think the justification is you have a lot of senators who are facing
elections in their own states, and the base likes Trump. And in some
states, like Lamar Alexander’s state, they want him to be loyal to
Trump. And so those are the concerns that they’re measuring, — is do
they let themselves be looked back on in history as turning away from
evidence, which some people will say they did. Or do they say, voters
don’t really want me casting that vote, and they decide to stick with
the president’s desires.

michael barbaro

So how has all of this actually landed inside the White House?

maggie haberman

Well, the White House as a whole wasn’t happy about hearing about this.
But for at least some of them, it wasn’t a surprise, because the White
House had been given a draft of this manuscript about 3.5 weeks ago from
John Bolton for a standard review process to look at classified
information and whether there is any in the book.

michael schmidt

So that means at least some folks in the White House have had a sense of
what Bolton would testify to in the impeachment investigation.

michael barbaro

If he testified.

maggie haberman

Correct.

michael barbaro

Wait. So does that mean that the president’s lawyers, including those
who are currently defending him in the Senate trial, that they knew what
John Bolton had written and knew what John Bolton had experienced, and
then continued to make a case to the public that is quite contradictory
to what Bolton is saying happened in this book?

michael schmidt

We don’t know the extent to which the manuscript, or the details about
it, were circulated. But what we do know is that in the past several
weeks, there has been a concerted effort by the president to stop Bolton
from testifying. He’s made public statements about this.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    The problem with John is that it’s a national security problem. You
    can’t have somebody who’s at national security. And if you think
    about it, John, he knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think
    about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a
    certain leader and it’s not very positive, and then I have to deal
    on behalf of the country? It’s going to be very hard. It’s going to
    make the job very hard. He knows other things, and I don’t know if
    we left on the best of terms. I would say, probably not. And so you
    don’t like people testifying when they didn’t leave on good terms.
    And that was due to me, not due to him. And so we’ll see what
    happens.

michael schmidt

And he has said it privately to aides.

michael barbaro

So my final question is, if John Bolton has something to say — and it
feels like he does — and the world wants to hear it, senators want to
hear it, House impeachment managers want to hear it, we all want to hear
it. And it feels like he has an obligation to the Democratic process to
say it, why doesn’t he just find a way to say it? Go on Fox. Go on CNN.
Have a news conference. Why hasn’t he taken any of those opportunities?

maggie haberman

It’s a great question, and there’s nothing preventing him from doing so.
If he wanted to issue some kind of a statement or say something publicly
that didn’t violate executive privilege with the president, he could do
that. He has yet to do any of that, and it’s not really clear why.

michael schmidt

But you know what, if John Bolton went on television right now and said
everything he would testify to, unless he was subpoenaed to appear at
that trial or if the comments from him were put into evidence, then it
couldn’t be considered by the lawmakers. This is a trial, where evidence
is brought forward. And if there is not enough votes to bring that
evidence in, then it doesn’t matter whether he stands out on the highest
point in town and says everything he knows. It only matters whether it’s
entered into the record in the Senate.

Maggie and Mike, thank you.

Thank you.

Thanks for having us.

On Monday, a lawyer for the White House, Patrick Philbin, tried to tamp
down talk of calling Bolton as a witness, saying that calling such a
witness would be an effort to, quote, “redo” the House impeachment
inquiry and would set a dangerous precedent for future impeachment
trials. The record that the House Democrats collected during that
process, Philbin said, shows that the president did nothing wrong. In a
tweet, the president denied Bolton’s account of their conversation about
Ukraine, writing, quote, “If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell
a book.”

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. On Monday, as it sought to
contain the coronavirus, the Chinese government broadened its quarantine
to more than 50 million people and said that it would spend at least $9
billion to stop the outbreak. The U.S. government said it was organizing
an evacuation of American citizens out of the epicenter of the illness
in Wuhan. And the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson said it would
begin developing a potential vaccine against the virus, joining several
government agencies seeking to do the same. As of Monday night, the
coronavirus had infected nearly 3,000 people and killed more than 80.
That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader,
sought to calm his colleagues at the private lunch, telling them to
“take a deep breath” and not to leap to conclusions about how to
proceed.

But according to people familiar with Mr. McConnell’s thinking, he was
angry at having been blindsided by the White House about Mr. Bolton’s
manuscript, which aides there have had since late December. The leader
put out a statement saying that he “did not have any advance notice” of
Mr. Bolton’s account.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just before the trial got underway on Monday, Senator Patrick J. Toomey,
Republican of Pennsylvania, told colleagues that he might be willing to
support calling witnesses as long as the roster would include someone
friendlier to Mr. Trump’s case, like Hunter Biden, according to people
familiar with the gathering who were not authorized to discuss it. The
idea appeared to be gaining broader currency among Republicans.

“My expectation is that were there to be testimony from Mr. Bolton,
there would be testimony for someone on the defense side as well,” Mr.
Romney said.

So far, only Mr. Romney had publicly committed to voting in favor of new
witnesses.

But even Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and
usually a reliable Trump ally, said that Mr. Bolton “may be a relevant
witness” and that he would like to see a copy of Mr. Bolton’s
manuscript.

At the White House, Mr. Trump raged throughout the morning at Mr.
Bolton, accusing him of lying. Hosting Israeli leaders, the president
told reporters that he had not seen the manuscript of the former
adviser’s book but disputed its claims as “false.”

In a series of early-morning tweets hours before the trial resumed, the
president accused Mr. Bolton of telling stories “only to sell a book”
and defended his actions toward Ukraine as perfectly appropriate.

“I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to
investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,” [President Trump
wrote just after
midnight](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1221663763138588672).

But Mr. Trump later complained to associates that the presentations from
his defense team were boring.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the session progressed, Mr. Trump’s lawyers began their promised
assault on Mr. Biden and his son, asserting that Mr. Trump demanded
investigations of them because there was significant evidence that they
were corrupt.

They methodically sought to undermine the case that House managers
delivered over more than 22 hours of arguments last week. They argued
that Mr. Trump said nothing wrong on a July 25 call with the president
of Ukraine, never sought to leverage an Oval Office meeting, and did
more to support Ukraine against Russian aggression than previous
presidents.

“The managers have not met their burden, and these articles of
impeachment must be rejected,” Eric Herschmann, one of the president’s
lawyers, told
senators.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a somewhat improbable echo of the last presidential impeachment
trial, Ken Starr, who relentlessly pursued President Bill Clinton for
lying about an extramarital affair with a young aide, appeared before
the Senate to defend Mr. Trump. He argued that the president committed
no impeachable offense and urged senators to “restore our constitutional
and historical traditions,” in which impeachment was rare.

“Like war, impeachment is hell,” Mr. Starr told senators, casting
himself as a skeptic of the constitutional remedy that he
enthusiastically pursued 21 years ago. “Or at least, presidential
impeachment is hell.”

While it is not clear that Republicans will vote to call additional
witnesses when they vote on the issue this week, the revelations from
Mr. Bolton appeared to shift the dynamic that had taken hold at the end
of last week’s arguments, when it appeared unlikely that Democrats would
win the support of the four Republicans they need to force the issue.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday, Democrats said they were newly optimistic that the momentum
of the trial was pushing toward a vote for witnesses and documents, and
they worked to increase the pressure on hesitant Republicans to embrace
the moves.

“It boils down to one thing: we have a witness with firsthand evidence
of the president’s actions for which he is on trial,” said Senator Chuck
Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “He is ready and willing to
testify. How can Senate Republicans not vote to call that witness and
request his documents?”

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who had previously indicated
she would most likely support additional witnesses, said the details in
Mr. Bolton’s book “strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a
number of conversations among my colleagues.” Senator Lisa Murkowski,
Republican of Alaska, said she was “curious” about what Mr. Bolton would
say, but gave no hint of how she would vote on the
matter.

But Republican leaders played down the significance of Mr. Bolton’s
account.

“The best I can tell from what’s reported in The New York Times, it is
nothing different from what we have already heard,” Senator John Cornyn,
Republican of Texas, said on Fox News.

Mr. Herschmann and Pam Bondi, another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, delved
deeply into Hunter Biden’s work on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian
energy company, at the time his father was vice president, suggesting it
was improper for him to hold the post while his father served. Ms. Bondi
also noted that the elder Mr. Biden had called for the removal of the
prosecutor who had looked into Burisma.

“What we are saying is that there was a basis to talk about this, to
raise this issue,” Ms. Bondi said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But it was United States policy at the time that the prosecutor, who was
widely regarded as corrupt, should be removed, and there was no evidence
at the time of his firing that the prosecutor was actively pursuing an
investigation.

In a statement on Monday, Andrew Bates, the Biden campaign’s
rapid-response director, said: “Here on Planet Earth, the conspiracy
theory that Bondi repeated has been conclusively
refuted.”

Later, Jane Raskin, one of the president’s lawyers, called Mr. Giuliani
a “colorful distraction” in the case, arguing that the House impeachment
investigators did not subpoena him to testify because they did not think
he would back up their claims that he was executing a shadow foreign
policy.

“In this trial, in this moment, Mr. Giuliani is just a minor player —
that shiny object designed to distract you,” Ms. Raskin said.

Mr. Giuliani defied a House subpoena for documents. Legal experts
suggest he would have refused to disclose any of his conversations with
Mr. Trump on the basis of attorney-client privilege even if called to
testify. And he would surely have been a difficult witness, given his
often erratic performance in televised interviews.
