# How to Avoid the Coronavirus? Wash Your Hands

I covered the SARS outbreak as a reporter in China, and I saw that
common sense is the best defense against viral illness.

Americans are watching with alarm as a new [coronavirus spreads in
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/29/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html)
and [cases pop up in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps.html).
They are barraged with information about what kinds of masks are best to
prevent viral spread. Students are [handing out
masks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/01/25/0ca57a5e-3ed7-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html)
in Seattle. Masks [have run
out](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Local-drug-stores-out-of-face-masks-after-potential-case-of-Coronavirus-detected-567279461.html)
in Brazos County, Tex.

Hang on.

I’ve worked as an emergency room physician. And as a New York Times
correspondent in China, I covered the [SARS
outbreak](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) in 2002 and 2003
during which a novel coronavirus first detected in Guangdong sickened
more than 8,000 people and killed more than 800. My two children
attended elementary school in Beijing throughout the outbreak.

Here are my main takeaways from that experience for ordinary people on
the ground:

1\. Wash your hands frequently.

2\. Don’t go to the office when you are sick. Don’t send your kids to
school or day care when they are ill, either.

Notice I didn’t say anything about masks. Having a mask with you as a
precaution makes sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak, as I was
when out reporting in the field during those months. But wearing it
constantly is another matter. I donned a mask when visiting hospitals
where SARS patients had been housed. I wore it in the markets where wild
animals that were the suspected source of the outbreak were being
butchered, blood droplets flying. I wore it in crowded enclosed spaces
that I couldn’t avoid, like airplanes and trains, as I traveled to
cities involved in the outbreak, like Guangzhou and Hong Kong. You never
know if the guy coughing and sneezing two rows ahead of you is ill or
just has an allergy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But outdoors, infections don’t spread well through the air. Those photos
of people walking down streets in China wearing masks are dramatic but
uninformed. And remember if a mask has, perchance, intercepted viruses
that would have otherwise ended up in your body, then the mask is
contaminated. So, in theory, to be protected maybe you should use a new
one for each outing.

The simple masks are better than nothing, but not all that effective,
since they don’t seal well. For anyone tempted to go out and buy the
gold standard, N95 respirators, note that they are uncomfortable.
Breathing is more work. It’s hard to talk to people. On one long flight
at the height of the outbreak, on which my few fellow passengers were
mostly epidemiologists trying to solve the SARS puzzle, many of us
(including me) wore our masks for the first couple of hours on the
flight. Then the food and beverage carts came.

Though viruses spread through droplets in the air, a bigger worry to me
was always transmission via what doctors call “fomites,” infected items.
A virus gets on a surface — a shoe or a doorknob or a tissue, for
example. You touch the surface and then next touch your face or rub your
nose. It’s a great way to acquire illness. So after walking in the
animal markets, I removed my shoes carefully and did not take them into
the hotel room. And of course I washed my hands immediately.

Remember, by all indications SARS, [which killed about 10
percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/how-the-new-coronavirus-differs-from-sars-measles-and-ebola/2020/01/23/aac6bb06-3e1b-11ea-b90d-5652806c3b3a_story.html)
of those infected, was a deadlier virus than the new coronavirus
circulating now. So keep things in perspective.

Faced with SARS, many foreigners chose to leave Beijing or at least to
send their children back to the United States. Our family stayed, kids
included. We wanted them with us and didn’t want them to miss school,
especially during what would be their final year in China. But equally
important in making the decision was that the risk of getting SARS on an
airplane or in the airport seemed greater than being smart and careful
while staying put in Beijing.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And we were: I stopped taking my kids to indoor playgrounds or crowded
malls or delicious but densely packed neighborhood Beijing restaurants.
Out of an abundance of caution we canceled a family vacation to Cambodia
— though my fear was less about catching SARS on the flight than that
one of the kids would have a fever from an ear infection upon our return
at a border screening, and would be stuck in a prolonged quarantine in
China. We instead took a vacation within China, where we carried masks
with us but didn’t use them except on a short domestic flight.

In time, during the SARS outbreak, the government shut down theaters and
schools in Beijing, as it is doing now in many Chinese cities because
these viruses are more easily transmitted in such crowded places.

But there was also a lot of irrational behavior: Entering a village on
the way to a hike near the Great Wall, our car was stopped by locals who
had set up a roadblock to check the temperature of all passengers. They
used an oral thermometer that was only minimally cleaned after each use.
What a great way to spread a virus.

The International School of Beijing, where my children were students,
was one of the few in the capital — perhaps the only one — that stayed
open throughout the SARS outbreak, though the classes were emptier,
since so many kids had departed to their home countries. It was a
studied but brave move, since a parent at the school had gotten SARS at
the very beginning of the outbreak on a flight back from Hong Kong. She
recovered fine, but it was close to home and families were scared.

The school instituted a bunch of simple precautionary policies: a stern
note to parents reminding them not to send a child to school who was
sick and warning them that students would be screened for fevers with
ear thermometers at the school door. There was no sharing of food at
lunch. The teacher led the kids in frequent hand washing throughout the
day at classroom sinks, while singing a prolonged “hand washing song” to
ensure they did more than a cursory pass under the faucet with water
only.

If a family left Beijing and came back, the child would have to stay at
home for an extended period before returning to class to make sure they
hadn’t caught SARS elsewhere.

With those precautions in place, I observed something of a public health
miracle: Not only did no child get SARS, but it seemed no student was
sick with anything at all for months on end. No stomach bugs. No common
colds. Attendance was more or less perfect.

The World Health Organization [declared the SARS outbreak
contained](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/world-health-organization-declares-sars-contained-worldwide)
in July 2003. But, oh, that those habits persisted. The best first-line
defenses against SARS or the new coronavirus or most any virus at all
are the ones that Grandma and common sense taught us, after all.
