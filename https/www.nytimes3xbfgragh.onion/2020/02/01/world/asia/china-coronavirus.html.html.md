WUHAN, China — A [mysterious

had stricken seven patients at a hospital, and a doctor [tried to
warn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/27/world/asia/27china-coronavirus-health.html)
his medical school classmates. “Quarantined in the emergency
department,” the doctor, Li Wenliang, wrote in an online chat group on
Dec. 30, referring to patients.

and ultimately killed nearly 800 people. “Is SARS coming again?”

In the middle of the night, officials from the health authority in the
central city of Wuhan summoned Dr. Li, demanding to know why he had
[shared the
information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html).

The government’s initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to

avoid public alarm and political embarrassment.

A reconstruction of the crucial seven weeks between the appearance of

based on two dozen interviews with Wuhan residents, doctors and
officials, on government statements and on Chinese media reports, points
to decisions that delayed a concerted public health offensive.

In those weeks, the authorities silenced doctors and others for raising
red flags. They played down the dangers to the public, leaving the
city’s 11 million residents unaware they should protect themselves.
They closed a food market where the virus was believed to have started,
but didn’t broadly curb the wildlife trade.

Their reluctance to go public, in part, played to political motivations
as local officials prepared for their annual congresses in January. Even
as cases climbed, officials declared repeatedly that there had likely
been no more infections.

By not moving aggressively to warn the public and medical professionals,
public health experts say, the Chinese government lost one of its best
chances to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic.

“This was an issue of inaction,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow
for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China.
“There was no action in Wuhan from the local health department to alert
people to the threat.”

The first case, the details of which are limited and the specific date
unknown, was in early December. By the time the authorities galvanized
into action on Jan. 20, the disease had grown into a formidable
threat.

That same day, Wuhan’s health commission, its hand forced by those
“rumors,” announced that 27 people were suffering from pneumonia of an
unknown cause. Its statement said there was no need to be alarmed.

“The disease is preventable and controllable,”
the[statement](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989)

Dr. Li, an ophthalmologist, went back to work after being reprimanded.

already been infected with the coronavirus, probably by her daughter.

## Hazmat Suits and Disinfectants

Hu Xiaohu, who sold processed pork in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale
Market, sensed by late December that something was amiss. Workers were
coming down with nagging fevers. No one knew why but, Mr. Hu said,
several **** were in hospital quarantine.

The market occupies much of a block in a newer part of the city, sitting
incongruously near apartment buildings and shops catering to the growing
middle class. It is a warren of stalls selling meats, poultry and fish,
as well as more exotic fare, including live reptiles and wild game that
some in China prize as delicacies. According to a report by the city’s
center for disease control, sanitation was dismal, with poor ventilation
and garbage piled on wet floors.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In hospitals, doctors and nurses were puzzled to see a cluster of
patients with symptoms of a viral pneumonia that did not respond to the
usual treatments. They soon noticed that many patients had one thing in
common: They worked in Huanan market.

On Jan. 1, police officers showed up at the market, along with public
health officials, and shut it down. Local officials issued a notice that
the market was undergoing an environmental and hygienic cleanup related
to the pneumonia outbreak. That morning, workers in hazmat suits moved
in, washing out stalls and spraying disinfectants.

It was, for the public, the first visible government response to contain
the disease. The day before, on Dec. 31, national authorities had
alerted the World Health Organization’s office in Beijing of an
outbreak.

City officials struck optimistic notes in their announcements. They
suggested they had stopped the virus at its source. The cluster of
illnesses was limited. There was no evidence the virus spread between
humans.

“Projecting optimism and confidence, if you don’t have the data, is a
very dangerous strategy,” said Alexandra Phelan, a faculty research
instructor in the department of microbiology and immunology at
Georgetown University.

“It undermines the legitimacy of the government in messaging,” she
added. “And public health is dependent on public trust.”

Nine days after the market closed, a man who shopped there regularly
became the first fatality of the disease, according to a report by the
Wuhan Health Commission, the agency that oversees public health and
sanitation. The 61-year-old, identified by his last name, Zeng, already
had chronic liver disease and a tumor in his abdomen, and had checked
into Wuhan Puren Hospital with a raging fever and difficulty breathing.

The authorities disclosed the man’s death two days after it happened.
They did not mention a crucial detail in understanding the course of the
epidemic. Mr. Zeng’s wife [had developed
symptoms](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30183-5/fulltext)

## The Race to Identify a Killer

About 20 miles from the market, scientists at the Wuhan Institute of
Virology were studying samples from the patients checking into the
city’s hospitals. One of the scientists, Zheng-Li Shi, was part of the
team that tracked down the origins of the SARS virus, which emerged in
the southern province of Guangdong in 2002.

As the public remained largely in the dark about the virus, she and her
colleagues quickly pieced together that the new outbreak was related to
SARS. The genetic composition suggested a common initial host: bats. The
SARS epidemic began when a coronavirus jumped from bats to Asian palm
civets, a catlike creature that is legally raised and consumed. It was
likely that this new coronavirus had followed a similar path — possibly
somewhere in or on the way to the Huanan market or another market like
it.

Around the same time, Dr. Li and other medical professionals in Wuhan
started trying to provide warnings to colleagues and others when the
government did not. Lu Xiaohong, the head of gastroenterology at City
Hospital No. 5, told [China Youth
Daily](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IzzCnz4Yr2jEIYZePiu_ow) that she had
heard by Dec. 25 that the disease was spreading among medical workers —
a full three weeks before the authorities would acknowledge the fact.
She did not go public with her concerns, but privately warned a school
near another market.

By the first week of January, the emergency ward in Hospital No. 5 was
filling; the cases included members of the same family, making it clear
that the disease was spreading through human contact, which the
government had said was not likely.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No one realized, the doctor said, that it was as serious as it would
become until it was too late to stop it.

“I realized that we had underestimated the enemy,” she said.

At the Institute of Virology, Dr. Shi and her colleagues isolated the
genetic sequence and the viral strain during the first week of January.
They used samples from seven of the first patients, six of them vendors
at the market.

On Jan. 7, the institute’s scientists gave the new coronavirus its
identity and began referring to it by the technical shorthand 2019-nCoV.
Four days later, the team shared the virus’s genetic makeup in a public
database for scientists everywhere to use.

That allowed scientists around the world to study the virus and swiftly
share their findings. As the scientific community moved quickly to
devise a test for exposure, political leaders remained reluctant to
act.

## ‘Politics Is Always No. 1’

As the virus spread in early January, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang,
was touting futuristic health care plans for the city.

It was China’s political season, when officials gather for annual
meetings of People’s Congresses — the Communist Party-run legislatures
that discuss and praise policies. It is not a time for bad news.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When Mr. Zhou [delivered his annual
report](http://www.whtv.com.cn/p/19064.html) to the city’s People’s
Congress on Jan. 7 against a backdrop of bright red national flags, he
promised the city top-class medical schools, a [World Health
Expo](https://www.hbwhexpo.com/), and a futuristic industry park for
medical companies. Not once did he or any other city or provincial
leader publicly mention the viral
outbreak.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“Stressing politics is always No. 1,” the governor of Hubei, Wang
Xiaodong, told officials on Jan. 17, citing Mr. Xi’s precepts of
top-down obedience. “Political issues are at any time the most
fundamental major issues.”

Shortly after, Wuhan went ahead with a massive annual potluck banquet
for [40,000 families from a city
precinct](https://news.sina.com.cn/s/2020-01-21/doc-iihnzhha3843904.shtml),
which critics later [cited as
evidence](https://www.dwnews.com/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/60165812/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E8%BF%98%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%BE%E5%8A%9E%E4%B8%87%E5%AE%B6%E5%AE%B4%E5%B8%82%E9%95%BF%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94)
that local leaders took the virus far too lightly.

As the congress was taking place, the health commission’s daily updates
on the outbreak [said
again](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011109036) and
again that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of
human transmission and no infection of medical workers.

“We knew this was not the case\!” said a complaint later filed with the
National Health Commission on a government website. The anonymous author
said he was a doctor in Wuhan and described a surge in unusual chest
illnesses beginning Jan. 12.

Officials told doctors at a top city hospital “don’t use the words viral
pneumonia on the image reports,” according to the complaint, which has
since been removed. People were complacent, “thinking that if the
official reports had nothing, then we were exaggerating,” the doctor
explained.

Even those stricken felt lulled into complacency.

When Dong Guanghe developed a fever on Jan. 8 in Wuhan, his family was
not alarmed, his daughter said. He was treated in the hospital and sent
home. Then, 10 days later, Mr. Dong’s wife fell ill with similar
symptoms.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The news said nothing about the severity of the epidemic,” said the
daughter, Dong Mingjing. “I thought that my dad had a common cold.”

The government’s efforts to minimize public disclosure persuaded more
than just untrained citizens.

“If there are no new cases in the next few days, the outbreak is over,”
Guan Yi, a respected professor of infectious diseases at the University
of Hong Kong, said [on
Jan. 15](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-china.html).

The World Health Organization’s statements during this period echoed the
reassuring words of Chinese officials.

It had spread. Thailand reported the first confirmed case outside China
on Jan.
13.

## A City Besieged

The first deaths and the spread of the disease abroad appeared to grab
the attention of the top authorities in Beijing. The national government
dispatched Zhong Nanshan, a renowned and now-semiretired epidemiologist
who was instrumental in the fight against SARS, to Wuhan to assess the
situation.

He arrived on Jan. 18, just as the tone of local officials was shifting
markedly. A health conference in Hubei Province that day called on
medical workers to make the disease a priority. An internal document
from Wuhan Union Hospital warned its employees that the coronavirus
could be spread through saliva.

On Jan. 20, more than a month after the first symptoms spread, the
current of anxiety that had been steadily gaining strength exploded into
public. Dr. Zhong announced in an interview on state television that
there was no doubt that the coronavirus spread with human contact.
Worse, one patient had infected at least 14 medical personnel.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Xi, fresh from a state visit to Myanmar, made his first public
statement about the outbreak, issuing a brief set of instructions.

It was only with the order from Mr. Xi that the bureaucracy leapt into
action. At that point the death toll was three; in the next 11 days, it
would rise above 200.

In Wuhan, the city banned tour groups from visiting. Residents began
pulling on masks.

Guan Yi, the Hong Kong expert who had earlier voiced optimism that the
outbreak could level off, was now alarmed. He dropped by one of the
city’s other food markets and was shocked by the complacency, he said.
**** He told city officials that the epidemic was “already beyond
control” and would leave. “I hurriedly booked a departure,” Dr. Guan
told Caixin, a Chinese news organization.

Two days later, the city announced that it was shutting itself down, a
move that could only have been approved by Beijing.

In Wuhan, many residents said they did not grasp the gravity of the
epidemic until the lockdown. The mass alarm that officials feared at the
start became a reality, heightened by the previous paucity of
information.

Crowds of people crushed the airport and train stations to get out
before the deadline fell on the morning of Jan. 23. Hospitals were
packed with people desperate to know if they, too, were infected.

“We didn’t wear masks at work. That would have frightened off
customers,” Yu Haiyan, a waitress from rural Hubei, said of the days
before the shutdown. “When they closed off Wuhan, only then did I think,
‘Oh, this is really serious, this is not some average virus.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, later took responsibility for the delay in
reporting the scale of the epidemic, but said he was hampered by the
national law on infectious diseases.
That[law](http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=221cc4a42d25144cbdfb&lib=law)
allows provincial governments to declare an epidemic only after
receiving central government approval. “After I receive information, I
can only release it when I’m authorized,” he
said.

</div>

The official reflex for suppressing discomforting information now
appears to be cracking, as officials at various levels seek to shift
blame for the government’s response.

With the crisis worsening, Dr. Li’s efforts are no longer viewed as
reckless. [A
commentary](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ETgXN6HInzlC8cxzhDdU9g) on the
social media account of the Supreme People’s Court criticized the police
for investigating people for circulating rumors.

“It might have been a better way to prevent and control the new
coronavirus today if the public had believed the ‘rumor’ then and
started to wear masks and carry out sanitary measures and avoid the wild
animal market,” the commentary said.

Dr. Li is 34 and has a child. He and his wife are expecting a second in
the summer. He is now recovering from the virus in the hospital where he
worked. In an interview via text messages, he said he felt aggrieved by
the police actions.

“If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier,”
he said, “I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more
openness and
transparency.”
