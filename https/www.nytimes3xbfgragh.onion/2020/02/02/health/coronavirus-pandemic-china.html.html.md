<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [Wuhan
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-clusters.html)
spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the
globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease
experts.

The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or
more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the
extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by
[China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-clusters.html)
and other countries, including the United States.

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however,
so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause.
But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted
between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly
transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS,
scientists have found.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a
pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”

In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared
from about 50 in China to more than [17,000 in at least 23 countries;
there have been more than 360
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html).

But various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of
cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as
that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists
saw when SARS and MERS emerged.

When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months,
only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since
2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the
world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and
MERS now kills about one of three.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [1918 “Spanish
flu”](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/1/05-0979_article) killed
only about 2.5 percent of its victims — but because it infected so many
people and medical care was much cruder then, an estimated 50 million
died, perhaps even more.

By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009
killed[about 285,000](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(12\)70121-4/fulltext),
fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality
rate, estimated at .02 percent.

The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been
running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests
are done and more mild cases are found.

In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about
Armageddon in Mexico,” Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in
pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz State.) “But it turned out to not
be that severe.”

An accurate estimate of the virus’s lethality will not be possible until
certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people
have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family
members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are
more dangerous than others.

Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds
completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous.
Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which
will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.

Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing
or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast
the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather
warms.

“This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly
alarmed,” said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000
deaths in each million people.”

Other experts were more cautious.

Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health
Organization, said in [an interview with STAT
News](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/01/top-who-official-says-not-too-late-to-stop-coronavirus-outbreak/)
on Saturday that there was “evidence to suggest this virus can still be
contained” and that the world needed to “keep trying.”

Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman
School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being
transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing
samples.

But life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets
are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks
and washing their hands, Dr. Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed
down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.

It’s unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese
laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported
test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an
undercount.

But Dr. Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day,
which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count.
“You can’t possibly do quality control at that rate,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Anecdotal reports from China, and [one published study from
Germany](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-reports-first-case-of-coronavirus-spread-by-asymptomatic-person/),
indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass
it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much
harder, scientists said.

Epidemiological modeling released Friday by the [European Center for
Disease
Prevention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/10/world/europe/coronavirus-europe.html)
and Control estimated that 75 percent of infected people reaching
[Europe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/10/world/europe/coronavirus-europe.html)
from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and
therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers,
coughs and breathing difficulties.

But if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and
actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be
higher than 75
percent.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Still, asymptomatic carriers “are not normally major drivers of
epidemics,” Dr. Fauci said. Most people get ill from someone they know
to be sick — a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.

The virus’s most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More
than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling
or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and
other countries where the virus has been found.

If anyone on the continent has the virus now, “I’m not sure the
diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch,
head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the W.H.O. on the outbreak.

South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria
and some other countries have asked the W.H.O. for the genetic materials
and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take
time.

At least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined,
according to [an article published Friday in The South China Morning
Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3048310/china-coronavirus-african-nations-quarantine-symptomatic-passengers).
They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for
testing.

At the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in
countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William
Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center.

“Every doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,” he said. “Any patient
with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. ‘Have you
been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?’ If the answer
is yes, they’ll be put in isolation right away.”

Assuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries
besides China may be affected — and the urgency to find ways to halt the
virus and prevent deaths will
grow.

It is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather
warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold,
dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also
peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn
camels.

Four mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation’s common
colds, which also peak in winter.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

But even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in
the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those
that began in 1918 and 2009.

By that time, some remedies might be on hand, although they will need
rigorous testing and perhaps political pressure to make them available
and affordable.

In China, several [antiviral drugs are being
prescribed](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/can-anti-hiv-combination-or-other-existing-drugs-outwit-new-coronavirus).
A common combination is pills containing lopinavir and ritonavir with
infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune
system.

In the United States, the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for
H.I.V. therapy, and it is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen
generic makers produce the drugs at rock-bottom prices for use against
H.I.V. in Africa, and their products are W.H.O.-approved.

Another option may be [an experimental drug,
remdesivir](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/company-statements/gilead-sciences-statement-on-the-company-ongoing-response-to-the-2019-new-coronavirus),
on which the patent is held by Gilead. The drug has not yet been
approved for use against any disease. Nonetheless, there is some
evidence that it works against coronaviruses, and Gilead has donated
doses to China.

Several American companies are [working on a
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html),
using various combinations of their own funds, taxpayer money and
foundation grants.

Although modern gene-chemistry techniques have made it possible to build
vaccine candidates within just days, medical ethics require that they
then be carefully tested on animals and small numbers of healthy humans
for safety and effectiveness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That aspect of the process cannot be sped up, because dangerous side
effects may take time to appear and because human immune systems need
time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine is working.

Whether or not what is being tried in China will be acceptable elsewhere
will depend on how rigorously Chinese doctors run their clinical trials.

“In God we trust,” Dr. Schaffner said. “All others must provide data.”
