TOKYO — Hidden away in her cabin, Masako Ishida reckons she doesn’t face
much risk from the coronavirus that has stalked her cruise ship, forcing
an onboard quarantine of 3,700 passengers and crew members in the port
city of Yokohama.

Ms. Ishida, 61, is trying to see the bright side as she faces two long
weeks stuck inside the ship. She has a window to gaze out of, unlike
some passengers. She, like her two traveling companions — her husband
and her mother, both in their 80s — is healthy and not in need of any
medications.

By no means, though, is this going to be easy.

After the virus struck, confusion came quickly. Ms. Ishida said she
first learned that her two-week cruise might be extended not from the
crew, but from an article she read online on Monday. That report said a
man from Hong Kong who had disembarked from the ship, the Diamond
Princess, in his home city on Jan. 25 had tested positive for the virus.

When she asked some crew members about it, they confirmed the news, she
said. But it took a while for other passengers to learn that they might
have been exposed to the virus, which has killed hundreds in China.

The Diamond Princess, which has 13 decks and in normal times offers
entertainment like movies under the stars and live musical productions,
arrived in Yokohama on Monday night and stayed at anchor for two days
while the authorities decided what to do.

Japanese health workers have begun screening 273 people who displayed
symptoms or came into contact with the infected man. So far, 20 of them,
including passengers from Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and the United
States, have been found to be infected. They were being taken to
hospitals.

All 3,700 people on board received an initial health screening. Ms.
Ishida said the authorities who performed it didn’t seem to take it very
seriously.

When they first took her husband’s temperature, she said, the reading
was 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit, well below a normal
temperature of 98.6.

Ms. Ishida asked them to retake it. The second reading was 35 degrees
Celsius, or 95 Fahrenheit.

“They didn’t put the thermometer into our ears properly,” Ms. Ishida
said.

She has also felt the chaos of the sudden quarantine at mealtimes.
Breakfast, delivered by staff members in goggles and masks, didn’t
arrive until almost 2 p.m. Then lunch came right on its
heels.

Nevertheless, the crew members are “serving guests with a smile,” Ms.

The ship is steaming back out to sea so it can empty its bilge and
supplement its water supplies, its owner, Princess Cruises, said on its
website. It will return to port on Thursday to take on food and other
supplies as it carries on with the two-week quarantine, which covers the
incubation period of the coronavirus.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Now, instead of taking a dip in the freshwater pools or going on a
“Chocolate Journey,” Ms. Ishida and her family are whiling away their
time playing games on their tablets, reading, watching movies and
speaking to family and friends using the ship’s now-free Wi-Fi.

Judging by social media, other passengers trapped on board have had more
difficult moments.

In a [Facebook
video](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/david.abel.75/videos/10220590641298141/),
David Abel, a passenger from Britain, said on Wednesday morning that he
was concerned about how the quarantine might affect his diabetes, saying
that he had not eaten in many hours and was fearful that he could fall
into a coma.

The problem was resolved, he said, after staff members aboard the ship
responded to a flood of emails expressing concern about his condition.

Earlier that morning, he had been more optimistic. As an announcement
about the quarantine came over a loudspeaker, Mr. Abel said that the
passengers would be confined to their cabins and that he was looking
forward to the free time.

“Most of my day will be spent writing and researching and so on,” he
said, adding, “What my bar bill is going to be, goodness only knows.”

For Ms. Ishida, her biggest worry is about the toll that being stranded
on board for such a long time will take on her family.

Still, things could be worse. The last time she went on a cruise, she
said, everyone caught the flu.
