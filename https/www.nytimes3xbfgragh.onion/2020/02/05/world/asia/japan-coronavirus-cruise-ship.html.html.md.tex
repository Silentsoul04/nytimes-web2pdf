Breakfast?}\label{trapped-on-a-cruise-ship-by-the-coronavirus-when-is-breakfast}}

A two-week quarantine has left Masako Ishida and hundreds of others
dealing with inconveniences and trying to figure out how to pass the
time.

TOKYO --- Hidden away in her cabin, Masako Ishida reckons she doesn't
face much risk from the coronavirus that has stalked her cruise ship,
forcing an onboard quarantine of 3,700 passengers and crew members in
the port city of Yokohama.

Ms. Ishida, 61, is trying to see the bright side as she faces two long
weeks stuck inside the ship. She has a window to gaze out of, unlike
some passengers. She, like her two traveling companions --- her husband
and her mother, both in their 80s --- is healthy and not in need of any
medications.

By no means, though, is this going to be easy.

After the virus struck, confusion came quickly. Ms. Ishida said she
first learned that her two-week cruise might be extended not from the
crew, but from an article she read online on Monday. That report said a
man from Hong Kong who had disembarked from the ship, the Diamond
Princess, in his home city on Jan. 25 had tested positive for the virus.

When she asked some crew members about it, they confirmed the news, she
said. But it took a while for other passengers to learn that they might
have been exposed to the virus, which has killed hundreds in China.

``There wasn't much information,'' Ms. Ishida said from the ship on
Wednesday during a call via Facebook.

The Diamond Princess, which has 13 decks and in normal times offers
entertainment like movies under the stars and live musical productions,
arrived in Yokohama on Monday night and stayed at anchor for two days
while the authorities decided what to do.

Japanese health workers have begun screening 273 people who displayed
symptoms or came into contact with the infected man. So far, 20 of them,
including passengers from Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and the United
States, have been found to be infected. They were being taken to
hospitals.

All 3,700 people on board received an initial health screening. Ms.
Ishida said the authorities who performed it didn't seem to take it very
seriously.

When they first took her husband's temperature, she said, the reading
was 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit, well below a normal
temperature of 98.6.

Ms. Ishida asked them to retake it. The second reading was 35 degrees
Celsius, or 95 Fahrenheit.

``They didn't put the thermometer into our ears properly,'' Ms. Ishida
said.

She has also felt the chaos of the sudden quarantine at mealtimes.
Breakfast, delivered by staff members in goggles and masks, didn't
arrive until almost 2 p.m. Then lunch came right on its heels.

Nevertheless, the crew members are ``serving guests with a smile,'' Ms.
Ishida said. ``That's giving us some peace of mind.''

The ship is steaming back out to sea so it can empty its bilge and
supplement its water supplies, its owner, Princess Cruises, said on its
website. It will return to port on Thursday to take on food and other
supplies as it carries on with the two-week quarantine, which covers the
incubation period of the coronavirus.

Ms. Ishida and her family enjoy cruises and had been especially looking
forward to relaxing aboard the Diamond Princess as it wended its way
from Yokohama to Kagoshima, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa.

    its recommendation of six feet} on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

Now, instead of taking a dip in the freshwater pools or going on a
``Chocolate Journey,'' Ms. Ishida and her family are whiling away their
time playing games on their tablets, reading, watching movies and
speaking to family and friends using the ship's now-free Wi-Fi.

Judging by social media, other passengers trapped on board have had more
difficult moments.

In a
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/david.abel.75/videos/10220590641298141/}{Facebook
video}, David Abel, a passenger from Britain, said on Wednesday morning
that he was concerned about how the quarantine might affect his
diabetes, saying that he had not eaten in many hours and was fearful
that he could fall into a coma.

The problem was resolved, he said, after staff members aboard the ship
responded to a flood of emails expressing concern about his condition.

Earlier that morning, he had been more optimistic. As an announcement
about the quarantine came over a loudspeaker, Mr. Abel said that the
passengers would be confined to their cabins and that he was looking
forward to the free time.

``Most of my day will be spent writing and researching and so on,'' he
said, adding, ``What my bar bill is going to be, goodness only knows.''

For Ms. Ishida, her biggest worry is about the toll that being stranded
on board for such a long time will take on her family.

Still, things could be worse. The last time she went on a cruise, she
said, everyone caught the flu.
