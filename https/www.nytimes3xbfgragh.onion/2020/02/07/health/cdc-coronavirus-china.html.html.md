# C.D.C. and W.H.O. Offers to Help China Have Been Ignored for Weeks

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For more than a month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
has been offering to send a team of experts to China to observe its
coronavirus outbreak and help if it can.

Normally, teams from the agency’s [Epidemic Intelligence
Service](https://www.cdc.gov/eis/index.html) can be in the air within 24
hours.

But no invitation has come — and no one can publicly explain why.

The World Health Organization, which made a similar offer about two
weeks ago, appears to be facing the same cold shoulder, though a
spokeswoman said it is just “sorting out arrangements.”

Current and former public health officials and diplomats, speaking
anonymously for fear of upsetting diplomatic relations, said they
believe the reluctance comes from China’s top leaders, who do not want
the world to think they need outside help.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2003, China was badly stung by criticism of its response to SARS,
another coronavirus epidemic; it has also been embroiled in a trade war
with the United States for more than a year.

Some experts also say that outsiders could discover aspects of the
outbreak that are embarrassing to China: for example, the country has
not revealed how many of its doctors and nurses have died fighting the
disease.

But China does need help, experts argue.

In private phone calls and texts, some Chinese colleagues have indicated
that they are overwhelmed and would welcome not just extra hands, but
specialized expertise in a couple of
fields.

Also, C.D.C. officials have said that they hope to learn more about the
new coronavirus from their Chinese counterparts to improve the American
response if the virus starts to spread widely here.

On Friday, Alex M. Azar II, secretary of health and human services, said
at a news briefing that he had recently reiterated the offer of a team
to his Chinese counterpart, Dr. Ma Xiaowei.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked what the holdup was, he answered: “It’s up to the Chinese. We
continue to expect fully that President Xi will accept our offer. We're
ready and willing and able to go.”

On Jan. 29, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general,
returned from a brief trip to China full of praise for President Xi
Jinping and the country’s extraordinarily aggressive response, which has
nearly walled off Hubei Province from the rest of the country and the
world.

China [had “agreed to a mission of international
experts”](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-script-ncov-rresser-unog-29jan2020.pdf?sfvrsn=a7158807_4)
to better understand disease transmission and clinical severity, Dr.
Michael Ryan, the W.H.O’s emergency response chief, said at the time.

Asked if that team would include American experts, Dr. Tedros replied
that “best would be a bilateral arrangement.”

On Thursday, a W.H.O. spokeswoman said that there was no delay in the
organization’s own mission to China.

“Our understanding is that the mission is on,” Marcia Poole, the
spokeswoman, said. But she could not say when the team would leave or
who would be on it.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a matter of sorting out the arrangements,” she added, noting that
Dr. Ryan had said a team would “need representation from North and
South, East and West, with relevant areas of expertise.”

The United States has offered Dr. Tedros 13 specialists who are ready to
go, Mr. Azar said.

The two fields in which China appears to need outside help, experts
said, are molecular virology and
epidemiology.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The first involves sequencing the virus’s genome and manipulating it to
refine diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccine candidates.

The second involves figuring out basic questions like who gets infected
and who does not, how long the incubation period is, why some victims
die, how many other people each victim infects and how commonly hospital
outbreaks are occurring.

“This isn’t rocket science, it’s basic stuff — but it’s been five weeks
and we still don’t know the answers,” one expert said.

It would be very useful, for example, to have a blood test for
antibodies. That would make it possible to see how many infected people
had recovered, which would make it clearer as to how lethal the virus is
— and how widespread.

A major epidemiological failure by China is that the Wuhan authorities
appear to have closed and disinfected the seafood market that was the
outbreak’s early focus without swabbing individual animals and their
cages and without drawing blood from everyone working there. That would
have provided a wealth of information about which animal might have been
the source of the coronavirus and which people had become infected but
survived.

Asked what had happened to the animals — whether they had been burned or
buried, for instance, one expert said: “No one can tell me that. I don’t
think they know.”

China has greatly improved its ability to fight disease since it was
embarrassed by SARS, and its scientists now frequently publish in major
medical journals.

Many of them trained at the American C.D.C. and have friends there.

“We have a decade-long relationship,” Mr. Azar said Friday. “It’s not an
accident that it’s called the Chinese C.D.C.”

Experts raised a related concern: China’s scientists are given large
rewards for publishing in prestigious journals. That creates an
incentive to hold back samples and data until publication. Although the
American C.D.C. has in the past sometimes had fraught relations with
other countries because it used their samples and published analyses of
them without giving credit they felt was due, its first priority was
still to issue epidemic warnings if they were needed and then to publish
later.

“In an epidemic, you don’t want information held back,” one expert said.
“You want transparency.”
