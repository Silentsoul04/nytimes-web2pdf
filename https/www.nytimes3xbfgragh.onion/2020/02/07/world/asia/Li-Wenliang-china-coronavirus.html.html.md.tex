The death of a Chinese doctor who was silenced by the police for being
one of the first to warn about the coronavirus set off an outpouring of
grief and anger on social media. The New York Times interviewed him last
week.

The doctor who was among the first
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html}{to
warn about the coronavirus outbreak} in late December --- only to be
silenced by the police ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/world/asia/Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html}{died
Friday} after becoming infected with the virus, the hospital treating
him reported.

The death of the 34-year-old doctor, Li Wenliang, set off an outpouring
of grief and anger on social media, with commenters on social media
demanding an apology from the authorities to Dr. Li and his family.

Last week, Elsie Chen, a Times researcher working with our
correspondents Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers, interviewed Dr. Li.
He caught the virus from a patient and was hospitalized when Ms. Chen
interviewed him on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, via the WeChat social media
platform.

Here are some edited and condensed excerpts from the interview.

\textbf{When did you first realize that this new virus was highly
contagious? It seemed that you hadn't taken any precautions when you
were infected.}

I knew it when the patient I came in contact with infected her family,
and I was infected right afterward. Thus I discovered it was highly
contagious. The patient had no symptoms, so I got careless.

\textbf{On Dec. 31, when you told people in the WeChat group about the
SARS-like virus, did you do so because you had seen the high risk of
human-to-human transmission?}

I suspected that, and it's always better to be cautious and take
protective measures.

\textbf{Why were you so suspicious at that point? Had you already
received any news or heard anything?}

Because there were already patients being treated under quarantine.

\textbf{Was that at the end of December?}

Yes.

\textbf{Were there other doctors who shared the information and reminded
others to protect themselves from this mysterious pneumonia?}

There were discussions among our colleagues.

\textbf{What was everybody talking about? How did they evaluate the
situation at that point?}

It was that SARS might come back. We needed to be ready for it mentally.
Take protective measures.

\textbf{Looking back at what has happened, do you think the situation
would be very different now if the Wuhan government hadn't stopped you
from warning others and sharing the information? Do you think it would
have been better if the information had been more public and
transparent, for the public and for doctors?}

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I
think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and
transparency.

\textbf{How did you feel when the police accused you of spreading
rumors?}

The police believed this virus was not confirmed to be SARS. They
believed I was spreading rumors. They asked me to acknowledge that I was
at fault.

I felt I was being wronged, but I had to accept it. Obviously I had been
acting out of good will. I felt very sad seeing so many people losing
their loved ones.

\textbf{Why did you decide to become a doctor? What made you proud to be
one? Can you say anything about your family?}

I thought it was a very stable job. Lately, patient-doctor relationships
have soured. I am happy as long as my patients are satisfied with their
treatment.

My older child is 4 years and 10 months old. The younger one is still
unborn, due in June. I miss my family. I talk to them by video.

\textbf{How long will it take you to recover? What do you plan to do
afterward?}

I started coughing on Jan. 10. It will take me another 15 days or so to
recover. I will join medical workers in fighting the epidemic. That's
where my responsibilities lie.
