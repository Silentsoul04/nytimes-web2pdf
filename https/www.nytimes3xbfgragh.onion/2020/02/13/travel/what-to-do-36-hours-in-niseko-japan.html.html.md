# 36 Hours in Niseko

</div>

Sublime skiing, snowboarding and “snow-surfing” are only part of the
story in this Japanese resort. Culinary adventures abound, local whiskey
flows and hot springs are the perfect après-ski option.

Niseko — where the powder is voluminous, après ski happens in onsens
(hot springs), and culinary adventures abound — is a popular destination
for international travelers. Japow, the nickname for the average 600
inches of powder that arrives from Siberia each winter, is what puts the
resort so firmly on the map with skiers and snowboarders. On the north
island of Hokkaido, Niseko includes four main separate, but linked,
resorts (collectively called [Niseko United](http://niseko.ne.jp)).
Beyond the slopes, the island is renowned for world-class seafood,
produce and beef as well as beer, whiskey and even some sake. Its
excellent restaurants, from simple noodle bars and laid-back izakayas
(Japanese pubs) to fine dining at the Michelin-starred
[Kamimura](http://www.kamimura-niseko.com), spotlight the island’s
bounty. Though often called the Aspen of Asia — and, indeed, Niseko is
undergoing a similar luxury building boom — this Japanese resort is
forging its own identity, from design to food to culture and wellness
scenes.

## Friday

### 1\) 1:30 p.m. Artful dining

Perched on the side of a cliff in the Hanazono area,
[Somoza](http://Somoza.jp), a serene gallery and artful restaurant, is
housed in a renovated wood kominka (historic farmhouse). A typical
thatched roof has been replaced with steel, but its traditional shape
still evokes a samurai helmet. Head downstairs to its main gallery where
an ongoing exhibition, “Hokkaido Through the Ages,” presents a history
lesson while showcasing artifacts from the founder and designer Shouya
Grigg’s personal collection. There’s pottery from the island’s ancient
Jomon period (from about 10,000 B.C. to 300 B.C.); and a carved kabuto
sword stand with deer antlers and other works by the Ainu, people only
recently recognized by the government as Japan’s indigenous inhabitants.
On the main level are handmade ceramics from Japanese artisans and Mr.
Grigg’s minimalist black-and-white photographs of snow, trees, mountains
and abstract patterns inspired by nature. (Somoza will open an
additional adjacent art gallery this spring.)

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Somoza serves some of the most creatively delicious food — inspired
takes on Japanese cuisine with Italian influences — in Niseko. Its
changing seasonal menus focus on local ingredients, such as duck breast
with Kutchan potato, crab and sea urchin consommé, or salmon smoked
on-site, all served on beautiful ceramics. Lunch is about 5,000 yen, or
about $46. (Also, ask about the restaurant’s matcha tea ceremony.) Sit
by its glass windows and gaze onto silver birch, oak and ezo red pine
trees. The restaurant offers free transportation from Hanazono for
lunch.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### 2\) 5 p.m. Snow-surfing

West of downtown Hirafu village is
[Gentemstick](http://www.Gentemstick.com), the groovy shop of the local
legend Taro Tamai, the father of Japanese “snow-surfing.” This Zen-like
approach brings snowboarding back to its roots, with the rider using
body movements and techniques from surfing to follow the terrain of the
mountain. Lining the walls like sculptures are colorful surf boards from
Mr. Tamai’s personal collection, and handcrafted snowboards made with
bamboo and other woods (88,000 to 162,000 yen). With good surf breaks a
short drive away, some locals even ski in the morning, then surf in the
afternoon. Purchase a beanie or T-shirt, then head upstairs to the
shop’s cozy cafe, art gallery and yoga studio.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

### 3\) 6 p.m. Strolling through Hirafu

Hirafu village is Niseko’s cultural heartbeat, brimming with bars and
restaurants, food trucks, coffee spots like the [Mountain Kiosk
Coffee](https://www.mountainkioskcoffee.com/) stand, ski shops, condos,
boutique hotels and luxury chalets. Drop into [Powder Art
Gallery](http://www.powderart.net) for contemporary works by emerging
artists from Tokyo, Europe and New York. Stop at [Niseko
Taproom](http://nisekotaproom.com) for local craft beers like Obihiro
Kurouto or fruity Onuma Snowdrop I.P.A. Enjoy Hirafu’s organic funkiness
before a new massive town center development, called Aruku-zaka Street,
comes in the next few years.

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### 4\) 7:30 p.m. Dinner on a stick

Yakitori — meat, seafood or vegetables on skewers — is popular
throughout Japan, and [Bang Bang](http://nisekobangbang.com) is a Niseko
institution. Reserve bar seats and watch chefs grill over a special
charcoal called binchotan, made from oak and valued for its high, clean
heat that enhances textures and flavors. From gizzards and heart to neck
and feet, almost every part of the chicken’s here, with crispy skin a
standout. So are Hokkaido Wagyu beef skewers, Hokkaido crabs and Akkeshi
Kakiemon oysters (about 10,000 yen). If you can’t get a reservation,
Bang 2 — next door, its more casual eatery — now offers the same menu.

### 5\) 9:30 p.m. Whiskey nights

Down a dimly lit Hirafu side street, people stand in line to pass
through an old-fashioned red refrigerator door (an Instagram favorite)
plastered with stickers. Dubbed The Fridge, [Bar
Gyu+](http://gyubar.com), with its cozy speakeasy ambience and candlelit
wooden tables, is famous for its old and rare Japanese single-malts, a
selection that changes every season. Ask what’s behind the bar for
off-the-menu pourings of sought-after whiskeys like Karuizawa or Hanyu,
and expect to pay almost 22,000 yen ($201) for some shots. Sip as a D.J.
spins vinyl, mostly jazz tunes. Still want to dance? A short walk away
is the fun new [Powder Room](http://www.powderroomniseko.com/), an
upscale club with quality wines and cocktails that feels more Hong Kong
than
Niseko.

## Saturday

### 6\) 8 a.m. Fuel up

In central Hirafu, [Green Farm Deli &
Cafe](http://www.greenfarmcafe.com) roasts its own coffee beans. Fuel up
for the slopes over hearty pork hash with poached eggs, or an egg wrap,
all from local ingredients, alongside your latte or cappuccino.
Breakfast, about 2,000 yen.

### 7\) 9 a.m. Four mountains

One pass offers access to Annupuri, Niseko Village, Grand Hirafu and
Hanazono; one day costs 8,000 yen if bought
[online](https://www.niseko.ne.jp/en/online-liftpass/). (Niseko also
participates in the global [Mountain
Collective](http://mountaincollective.com) and [Ikon
Pass](http://ikonpass.com), season-long lift passes to top worldwide
resorts, including Niseko United.) Venture out with [an
instructor](https://www.gosnowniseko.com/) to guide you around the
mountains for an overview, or to get tips for powder. Niseko’s slopes
offer lots of variety, from beginners to advanced, with the highest
elevation only 3,937 feet. Intrepid skiers can go from one resort to the
next, beginning at Hanazono and ending at Annupuri. (A free bus can also
take you to each base.) At the top of the Niseko gondola, ski to the
sleek wooden [Lookout
Cafe](http://www.niseko-village.com/en/thevillage/on-mountain.html) and
tuck into a bowl of simple seafood ramen (about 2,000 yen). Trekking up
and skiing down the crater of Mount Yotei — a volcano, resembling a
smaller Mount Fuji, that looms over Niseko — belongs on your adrenaline
bucket list (guide required; contact [Rising Sun
Guides](http://risingsunguides.com/)).

### 8\) 2:30 p.m. Après ski ritual

With Japan’s volcanic landscape, there are ample onsens (geothermal hot
springs) in Niseko; taking to the waters at a public bathhouse is both
an essential ritual of Japanese culture and part of the ski experience.
Join the locals at [Yugokorotei](http://www.niseko-annupurionsen.com),
in a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) in Annupuri. Know the Japanese
[etiquette](http://www.jnto.org.au/experience/onsen/onsen-etiquette),
such as bringing your own little “modesty towel” and soap to cleanse
thoroughly before dipping, naked (no bathing suits allowed), into a
communal outdoor pool. Like most onsen, this one is separated by gender.
The outdoor pool, under a wood pergola and surrounded by snow and
boulders, features mineral water pumped from the base of Mount Annupuri.
It may be cold outside, but you’re relaxing your body and soul in about
130 degree Fahrenheit, mineral-rich bubbling water. Folding and placing
the towel on your head is a custom. Cost: 1,000 yen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### 9\) 6 p.m. The art of noodles

Begin at [Karabina,](https://www.karabinaniseko.com/) an izakaya
occupying a small wooden hut at Annupuri’s base (note: this is the last
season the restaurant will be open at this location). Shoes off, walk up
a few steps to a cozy alcove, sit around a wood-burning stove and sip a
local sake. Then walk a stone’s throw away down a pathway to another
rustic wood dwelling, [Rakuichi](http://www.rakuichisoba.com). Helmed by
Tatsuru Rai, known for his artisan, local buckwheat noodles, this soba
master was celebrated on Anthony Bourdain’s “No Reservations,” and ever
since it’s been a hard reservation to get. His wife, Midori, greets
diners as they don slippers and sit at a no-frills, 12-seat wooden
counter with views of the master at work on a ball of dough. Dinner
comes kaiseki-style, a Japanese haute cuisine tasting menu that changes
with the seasons. Nine simple dishes with bright flavors are presented
on pretty Japanese ceramic plates and lacquer bowls. Order a Hokkaido
sake to accompany, for instance, sashimi of sea urchin, toro tuna,
smoked scallop and Mr. Rai’s hand-cut soba noodles. Select either cold
with tempura vegetables, or hot with duck (an additional 800 yen).
Finish with dessert. (Dinner is about 12,000 yen.)

### 10\) 9:30 p.m. Niseko noir

Stop at [Toshiro’s](http://toshiros-bar.com) for a cocktail created by
its bespectacled namesake proprietor and mixologist, celebrated for
concoctions like Penicillin, a mix of whiskey, ginger and citrus, with a
smoky spin (1,600 yen). Or try a ginger gimlet and a smoked old
fashioned with local whiskey. More than 400 bottles sit behind the bar;
select a tasting flight, from 3,600 to 45,000
yen.

## Sunday

### 11\) 10 a.m. Shrines and temples

Grab a coffee at the Mountain Kiosk Coffee stand or one of the trucks in
Hirafu and head to the non-touristy town of Kutchan (about six miles
from Hirafu and 20 minutes by cab) where you’ll find the [Daibutsuji
Buddhist temple](http://visitniseko.tourismbuilder.com), featuring a
prayer room with a gold-painted ceiling depicting a dragon shielding a
Buddhist elder from a tiger (no charge, book in advance). Be mindful
that temples and shrines are places of worship for local residents, as
well as places to protect sacred objects. Other area shrines:
Kutchan-jinja, where red, green and yellow flags line the simple wood
interior; and in Niseko Town stands the small Kaributo-jinja.

### 12\) 1 p.m. Swirl and other milk treats

Hokkaido, Japan’s top dairy-producing region, is recognized for offering
the best milk in the country. [Milk
Kobo](http://www.niseko-takahashi.jp/milkkobo), next to the Takahashi
working dairy farm in Niseko Village, is noted for hand-milking its
cows, and its popular cafe and shop makes desserts and cheeses from the
milk. Knock back a banana yogurt drink, which is packaged in a cute
little bottle with cows on its label. Don’t miss the cheese tarts and
cream puffs.

-----

## Lodging

At the nine-room boutique [Kimamaya](http://kimamaya.com) in Hirafu,
European alpine design meets Japanese aesthetics. Feel at home sitting
around the living-room fireplace, sipping a glass of Burgundy from the
owner’s private vineyard. An adjacent restaurant, [The
Barn,](http://www.nisekobarn.com/) inspired by Hokkaido farm
architecture, serves Western and Japanese breakfasts, and for dinner,
French-Japanese food using local ingredients; it’s worth eating here
even if staying elsewhere. There’s a small spa and two stone soaking
tubs. Rates: 22,400 to 55,440 yen for doubles; lofts are 41,440 to
94,080 yen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nestled in a picturesque forest, the stunning 15-room
[Zaborin](http://zaborin.com/en/) fuses a traditional ryokan experience
with contemporary luxury. Guests relax in Japanese house pajamas, and
dinner is an 11-course kaiseki meal of beautifully presented plates,
with many foraged local ingredients. Rooms feature indoor and outdoor
onsens. Rates start at 75,000 yen.

If you chose the Airbnb route, try to find a property in the vibrant
Hirafu area. Here you can easily walk to restaurants and shops, and are
near public transportation. Expect to pay around $155 and up for a one
bedroom.
