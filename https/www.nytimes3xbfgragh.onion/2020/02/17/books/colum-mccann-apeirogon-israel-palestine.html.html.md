“I’m a bit of a magpie,” Colum McCann said, sheepishly gesturing around
his office at Hunter College.

He has taught creative writing there for 13 years, and in that time has
appointed his space with plenty of mementos: old family photographs, a
self-portrait his daughter drew in neon crayon, a framed poster of what
he said were among his friend [Frank
McCourt](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/07/20/books/20mccourt.html)’s
last words to him. (“So, Frank, what will you confess?\!\!” McCann
asked. “Pride springing from virtue. But not from virginity\!”) But the
keepsake he was looking for during an interview earlier this month,
which he can’t believe he’s lost, is a napkin.

McCann remembers what it said: “Harness the power of your grief.” It was
given to him by two fathers whose lives radically altered his own, and
who became the central characters in his latest novel, “Apeirogon,” out
next week from Random House.

The book is a fictionalized account of the men, one Israeli, one
Palestinian, whose daughters were killed near Jerusalem 10 years apart.
Rami Elhanan, who is Israeli, lost his teenager Smadar to a suicide
bombing that occurred while she was shopping with friends in 1997. Abir,
the 10-year-old daughter of Bassam Aramin, who is Palestinian, was
[fatally shot by an Israeli
soldier](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/09/movies/afterward-review.html)
in 2007. An apeirogon is a shape with an infinite but countable number
of sides, and over the course of the book’s 1,001 chapters — a nod to
“One Thousand and One Nights” — McCann delves into the two men’s
lives, sometimes writing in their voices.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Aramin and Elhanan met in 2005 through [Combatants for
Peace](https://cfpeace.org/), an organization that aims to end the
occupation of Palestine, and they have become close friends. They are
now involved in the [Parents Circle - Families
Forum](https://www.theparentscircle.org/en/pcff-home-page-en/), an
organization for Israelis and Palestinians who have lost family members
in the conflict.

McCann met the men in 2015, when he first visited the region with his
storytelling nonprofit, [Narrative 4](https://narrative4.com/). He had
been interested in Israel and Palestine’s history since talking with
George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who helped broker peace
negotiations in Ireland and the Middle East, and who appeared in
McCann’s continent- and century-spanning 2013 novel
“[TransAtlantic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/06/23/books/review/transatlantic-by-colum-mccann.html).”

“If anything dilates my nostrils, it’s the sense of some sort of
difficulty,” McCann said. “I knew I was completely ignorant of what was
going on there, and I thought I’d like to try and explore.”

He wound up spending a week in the region. “I was sort of priding myself
on the fact of being able to deal with everything — I’ve seen Northern
Ireland, I’ve done this before,” said McCann, who grew up in Dublin
during the Troubles. He listened to Elhanan and Aramin speak in Beit
Jala, a Palestinian town, and sobbed as they told their stories.

Lisa Consiglio, a co-founder of Narrative 4 who has known McCann for
years, was also there. Hearing them, she said, was a “shock to our
system that had already been shocked very much.” She had never seen
McCann so visibly moved. “Subconsciously, I think I knew he had a book
at that moment,” she said.

McCann left knowing he wanted to write about the conflict. He returned
several times over the next four years to conduct research and
interviews for “Apeirogon.”

The book has generated pre-publication interest: Steven Spielberg’s
company, Amblin Partners, [bought the movie
rights](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amblin-nabs-israeli-palestinian-friendship-novel-apeirogon-1278792),
and an Arabic version of the novel is in the
works.

“Apeirogon,” like other books by McCann, interweaves real people with
imagined conversations, scenes and other details of their lives.
McCann’s National Book Award-winning novel, “[Let the Great World
Spin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/08/02/books/review/Mahler-t.html),”
for example, uses the high-wire artist Philippe Petit as a launching
point, while another of his novels,
“[Dancer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/01/19/books/a-story-with-legs.html),”
imagines the life of the ballet dancer [Rudolf
Nureyev](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1993/01/07/arts/rudolf-nureyev-charismatic-dancer-who-gave-fire-to-ballet-s-image-dies-at-54.html).

But for McCann, the moral stakes of “Apeirogon” felt higher. “Nureyev
can look after himself, and the memory of Nureyev can look after
itself,” the writer said. “With Rami and Bassam, it’s so much closer
to the edge, closer to the bone. If you get it wrong … they can’t
necessarily recover in the same way that a really, truly, public figure
could. Oh, I was terrified.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a moment when the publishing industry is grappling with which stories
are told and by whom, it is a striking choice. “We’re in this territory
of the real is the imagined and the imagined is real,” McCann said of
this project. “I think people wouldn’t have trusted it as much if it
wasn’t real.”

Elhanan’s and Aramin’s stories are well documented; their grief has
entered public consciousness. They’ve been the subject of films, and
have traveled the world talking about their loss and their conviction
that “we can’t build a state on the ruins of our kids,” as Aramin said
in an interview. Both have found salvation in the work, a way, Elhanan
said, also in an interview, to “give meaning to my life and meaning to
my loss.”

Neither man hesitated when McCann approached them about his idea. They
trusted him as an artist, they said, recognizing that the book, even as
a work of fiction, would amplify their message.

“In our first meeting, Colum was crying like a little kid,” Elhanan, 70,
said. “His ability to show emotion shows that he’s a really fine man
with heart — it’s the basic of all basics, the ability to show emotion
and to show
compassion.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

McCann’s background also helped, Aramin, 56, said, because many
Palestinians often feel a sense of solidarity with the Irish. “We have
the same history of conflict.”

“Apeirogon” can make for excruciating reading. McCann devotes sections
to “the mushroom effect,” or how the heads of suicide bombers are nearly
always separated from their torsos, and the damage that rubber bullets
cause. Readers are in the ambulance with Aramin and his critically
injured daughter, waiting two hours and 18 minutes for traffic to clear
to reach another hospital. When Elhanan remembers the sound of the
rollers in the morgue, readers can imagine it, too.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

McCann’s fictionalization of such wrenching stories is likely to raise
questions among readers, particularly in a story that unfolds in a
charged political conflict where virtually every fact is up for debate.
(One example: Israeli authorities initially suggested that Aramin’s
daughter was killed by Palestinians throwing stones; [an Israeli judge
later ruled in civil
court](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/26/israel-pay-family-compensation-palestinian-girl)
that she had been shot dead by an Israeli soldier.)

“It’s very difficult to talk about your pain or to read about your
pain,” Aramin said. Both he and Elhanan have been reading it slowly.

Yet neither father asked McCann to change anything.

“I told him from the beginning, ‘It’s your book, not mine,’” Elhanan
said. “It’s accurate, it’s emotional, but I don’t consider it to be my
story.”

He knows that it may invite criticism, he added, “but the worst already
happened. I have nothing to fear.”
