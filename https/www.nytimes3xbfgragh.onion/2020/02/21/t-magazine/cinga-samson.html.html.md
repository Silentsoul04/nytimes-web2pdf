# An Artist Who Doesn’t Want to Feed Western Fantasies About Africa

</div>

Cinga Samson’s surreal canvases engage obliquely with his identity, but
stand alone as testaments to his finely honed craft.

In the South African artist [Cinga
Samson](https://www.perrotin.com/artists/cinga_samson/488)’s “Ivory”
series of paintings — five lush, ethereal, figurative canvases made in
2018 — a young black man in jeans and an ornate gold-colored **** jacket
stands in the middle of the 4-by-3 foot compositions, reveling amid
tropical ferns, twisting vines **** and bird-of-paradise plants against
a moody backdrop of rocks and sea. In each painting, the setting is
surreal but the figure’s stance is coolly elegant; his eyes, pupil-less
white orbs, suggest an inner reverie. Seemingly unconcerned with the
viewer, he projects a strong presence, at once inviting and enigmatic,
joyful and antagonistic. This is a world that belongs, unequivocally, to
him.

That sense of quiet confidence suffuses many of Samson’s paintings, 28
of which will be on view at the Perrotin gallery in New York this month
in the artist’s first United States solo show. “I want to create works
that aren’t begging you to look at them,” he says. “Works that don’t
need affirmation.” From his bright studio in a former industrial
building in Cape Town’s cosmopolitan Woodstock neighborhood, Samson, 33,
is refining an aesthetic sensibility that extols his identity as a young
African, but also deliberately withholds something from the viewer. “The
paintings hold their ground,” he says. “If ever you get too close, you
start to approach danger.”

This restraint stems in part from Samson’s frustration with
expectations, particularly in the West, that as a South African artist,
his work must engage with issues of race, poverty and corruption in an
explicit, easily digestible way. He is ** of course interested in
reckoning with what’s important to him — spirituality, nature,
sensuality, what it means to be a man — but on his own terms, in his own
language and beyond a straightforwardly activist message. This
perspective crystallized after Samson turned 30, he says, when he found
himself confronting the fact of his limited time on earth. Rather than
fight against structural problems he couldn’t fix, he decided instead to
celebrate life and his own potential. “I want to push into the future,
not be marginalized under the politics of this moment,” he says. “I
don’t want to be an artist that feeds Western fantasies about what
Africa is.”

Some of Samson’s newest pieces, large-format paintings of black men and
women gathered as if for a ceremony by a rocky shoreline, play with
notions of the supernatural while also subverting stereotypical
portrayals of African spirituality. The works emerged from a family
story about Samson’s aunt, who is said to have come back from the dead
after drowning, as well as a Xhosa belief that long-departed forebears
sometimes appear by rivers. But while the figures in the paintings are
intended to evoke people “from another realm,” Samson says, rather than
resorting to clichéd depictions of ancestors (wizened elders draped in
skins, for example), he renders them as youthful visitors who wear jeans
and play with inflatable pool toys. And while the scenes conjure an
ancient, dreamlike ritual, **** their controlled palette of bright blue,
brown and gray feels almost futuristic. In the background of one of the
works, a stark cityscape calls to mind contemporary Cape Town and its
ongoing water
shortages.

Born in 1986 and raised in townships and villages in the Mthatha area of
the Eastern Cape, a region of rolling hills and wide vistas, Samson
identified a connection with art early on. “I realized I could draw
[Snoop
Dogg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/snoop-dogg),
[Tupac](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/tupac-shakur)
and
[Mandela](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/nelson-mandela)
better than my friends,” he recalls. In his early 20s, he joined
Isibane, a collective of artists in Cape Town from whom he gleaned
support, resources and what he describes as “a manual for being an
artist.” Working for nearly four years at the group’s studio, under the
guidance of older painters, he forged a vision of his own, as well as an
unwavering devotion to the task of making art itself. “You can’t be
drinking, buying good clothes, looking good,” he remembers his mentors
counseling. “If you don’t have art materials, what kind of an artist are
you?” Some 15 years later, that ethic continues to define Samson’s
practice, which he approaches with an almost ascetic intensity. Though
he keeps a house “as a formality,” he says, he rarely leaves the studio;
his purpose, as he sees it, is to hone his “gift,” stretching his
capabilities as far as he can. Indeed, having shown regularly in Cape
Town galleries over the past decade, as well as in Berlin, Oaxaca, the
Minneapolis Institute of Art and New York’s Armory Show, Samson is
proving himself to be a **** vital emerging figure in contemporary
painting.

Though he’s wary of shouldering the burden of politics, Samson’s
commitment to excellence lends his work a powerful charge. “In all my
art books, African artists are in the last chapter, if at all,” he says,
and while he has been deeply influenced by a range of Western greats —
[Alberto
Giacometti](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/alberto-giacometti),
[Egon
Schiele](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/egon-schiele),
[Francis
Bacon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/francis-bacon)
and [Louise
Bourgeois](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/louise-bourgeois)
among them — he emphasizes the need for African artists to have their
own masters to reference. Part of what animates his practice is a belief
that sheer virtuosity is an antidote to pity and marginalization. “I
want you to look at my work and think, ‘That’s exquisite, that’s
incredible, I am blown away — and I know it is completely African,’
without feeling that it is lacking,” he says, adding, with a smile:
“It’s that [Serena
Williams](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/serena-williams)
excellence, which, if you deny it, you know you’re just **** evil.”

“Amadoda Akafani, Afana Ngeentshebe Zodwa (men are different, though
they look alike)” is on view from Feb. 22 to April 11 at Perrotin
gallery, 130 Orchard Street, New York,
