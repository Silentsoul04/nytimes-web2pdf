Outbreak}\label{shaved-heads-adult-diapers-life-as-a-nurse-in-the-coronavirus-outbreak}}

For many female health workers on the front line in China, even things
like menstruation have become an occupational hazard.

Zhang Wendan and her family were celebrating the Lunar New Year when the
27-year-old nurse got a notice from the hospital: report back to work
and join the battle to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

Ms. Zhang lives in Huanggang, in Hubei Province, where the virus
originated. Two days earlier officials had sealed off her city in a
desperate attempt to stop it from spreading. Her mother quietly cried
while Ms. Zhang and her fiancé went to her room to pack for her trip.

The experience at the hospital, Ms. Zhang says, has been harrowing,
especially as a woman.

Like all of her colleagues, Ms. Zhang grew accustomed to wearing
sweat-soaked clothes under her suit. She accepted that there weren't
enough masks to go around for staff. She took care not to tug on the
seams of her protective suit, having learned the hard way that it will
unravel. But she has also cut off all of her hair and had to have
uncomfortable conversations with her superiors about menstruation.

For personal hygiene and convenience, Ms. Zhang had her hair cut short
during her 30 days in the quarantine zone of the hospital. Chinese state
media \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Htr2SdoP0k}{has called
female medical workers} who shave their heads ``the most beautiful
warriors'' fighting the outbreak. At the grocery store, ``someone called
me `handsome!''' Ms. Zhang said. The hospital paid for the haircut.

The most difficult moment for Ms. Zhang came when her superiors ---
almost all men --- told her and her female colleagues that they ``lacked
the spirit of devotion'' and discipline after they sought help getting
pads and tampons.

Ms. Zhang has had to examine patients through misted goggles while
wearing a stiff protection suit.

Only supplies cleared by the authorities can make it into the city, so
getting these products had become difficult for many women. As the days
wore on, she said she felt her spirit was ``breaking down slowly.''

It took a group of volunteers to take notice and send some 2,000 adult
diapers to the hospital to accommodate its 500 female workers.

Ms. Zhang said the hospital's response to the original request hit a raw
nerve for her and so many women who say it's difficult to find time in
the day just to go to the bathroom, let alone deal with menstruation
while wearing a poorly made full-body protective suit. And this was not
the first time that medical professionals on the front line had
complained about their working conditions.

In Hubei Province nurses and doctors have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/14/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctors.html}{pleaded
for more masks}, thousands of health workers have been among recent
confirmed cases of infection and several
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html}{have
died}.

``I worry about being infected, I miss home,'' Ms. Zhang said. Now that
her assignment on the front line has ended, she is waiting out her own
14-day quarantine at a nearby hotel before she returns home to her
family.

When this is all over, she said she looks forward to seeing her family
again, taking a nice long bath and eating meals cooked by her mother,
who on three occasions during the assignment made her meals including
dishes of potatoes, carrots, lamb kebabs, scrambled eggs with chili and
even rib soup. Ms. Zhang picked them up from the sidewalk outside her
family home while her mother watched from a safe distance.

She also looks forward to her wedding, at which she says she plans to
wear a wig. She has put down a deposit for a dress but hasn't picked one
out yet. She tries to be upbeat, especially when she talks to her
fiancé. Their wedding day is scheduled for April 24.

``I hope I will not have to delay it,'' she said.

Wang Yiwei contributed research from Beijing.
