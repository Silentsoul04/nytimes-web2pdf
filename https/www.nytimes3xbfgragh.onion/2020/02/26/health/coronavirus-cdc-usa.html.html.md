A person in
[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/california-coronavirus-cruise-ship.html)
who was not exposed to anyone known to be infected with the coronavirus,
and had not traveled to countries in which the
[virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/california-coronavirus-cruise-ship.html)
is circulating, has tested positive for the infection.

It may be the first case of community spread in the United States, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

“At this point, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” the C.D.C. statement
said. “The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and
picked up by astute clinicians.”

The case was announced shortly after President Trump concluded a news
briefing in which he said that aggressive public health containment
measures and travel entry restrictions had successfully limited the
spread of coronavirus in the United States.

It brings the number of cases in the country to 60, including the 45
cases among Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan, China — the
epicenter of the outbreak — and the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which
was overwhelmed by the virus after it docked in Japan.

Until now, public health officials have been able to trace all of the
infections in the country to a recent trip abroad or a known patient,
and to identify the sources of exposure.

Though C.D.C. officials said it was possible the patient was exposed to
a returning traveler who was infected, the new case appears to be one of
community spread — one in which the source of infection is unknown.

“The thing that would immediately make all of us uneasy is if this
person has no direct contact with someone who comes from an affected
country,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist
at Vanderbilt University.

“That would suggest there are other undetected cases out there, and we
have already started some low-grade transmission.”

Public health officials said the infected individual was a resident of
Solano County, Calif., and was receiving medical care in Sacramento
County, but they have not disclosed any other information to protect the
patient’s privacy.

Doctors in the patient’s community may want to expand testing for the
coronavirus among their patients in order to identify other infected
individuals there, Dr. Schaffner said.

“Physicians are going to want to start testing everybody with a fever
and a cough,” he said. “They’re going to want to do that and the
patients are going to want to do that.”

Right now, however, testing capacity is limited in the United States.

The C.D.C. developed a diagnostic test and distributed testing kits to
local health departments around the country.

But the kits were flawed, and the agency must manufacture new ones.
Although a dozen states are capable of testing for coronavirus
infection, confirmatory tests must still be done by the C.D.C., a
process that can take days.
