# ‘He Hasn’t Been Here’: Why Joe Biden Lags in Super Tuesday States

</div>

Joseph R. Biden Jr. is counting on a victory in South Carolina to revive
his candidacy. But a daunting challenge awaits next week in states where
he has limited resources.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

LOS ANGELES — On the day before in-person early voting was to begin
across California’s most populous county, there was no sign of life at
[Joseph R. Biden
Jr.’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
campaign office in East Los Angeles last Friday. A metal gate out front
was padlocked shut, with a missed-delivery notice from the Postal
Service wedged into it.

In a strip mall a mile away, a campaign office for Senator [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
was humming with activity. Field organizers were busy calling
supporters, and every so often the ding of a bell signaled that another
volunteer was on board.

Mr. Biden is counting on a win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday
to help position him as the leading moderate challenger to Mr. Sanders,
after three straight losses shredded Mr. Biden’s status as the onetime
front-runner. But even if he succeeds in South Carolina, his lack of
resources and thin campaign organization in California and other states
that vote next week on [Super
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/super-tuesday-03-03)
present a daunting challenge to a candidacy already on precarious
footing.

Interviews with party leaders in half a dozen Super Tuesday states
suggest that the same vulnerabilities that plagued Mr. Biden beginning
in Iowa — subpar organization, limited outreach to local Democrats and a
late start to campaigning — are holding him back in the states that next
week will dole out a third of the total delegates in the Democratic
primary.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden’s on-the-ground operations, these Democrats said, are easily
dwarfed by those of Mr. Sanders and [Michael R.
Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html),
the moderate former mayor of New York who has plainly cut into Mr.
Biden’s standing in some of these states even as he faces his own
mounting challenges in the race.

“Arkansas was, in my opinion, going to be a default Biden state,” said
Michael John Gray, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas. “He
hasn’t been here. Of all the campaigns, the least organized in Arkansas
is Biden.”

Other candidates like Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, are already campaigning
in Super Tuesday states, holding events that excite supporters and
generate news media coverage. But Mr. Biden has planted himself
elsewhere, after his fourth-place finish in Iowa and fifth-place New
Hampshire result threw even his expected firewall of South Carolina into
doubt.

He devoted last week to Nevada, where he pulled off the second-place
finish that he was aiming for, and this week he is scheduled to be in
South Carolina every day before Saturday’s primary, which he says he
will win. Aside from fund-raising, he has not campaigned in a Super
Tuesday state in over a month, though he is planning to visit North
Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, Texas and California between Saturday and
Tuesday.

After the disastrous first two contests, the Biden campaign also moved
staff members from Super Tuesday states to Nevada and South Carolina to
provide extra manpower there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Bernie has a ground game because he naturally has a ground game; his
whole campaign is a grass-roots campaign,” said Gilberto Hinojosa, the
Democratic Party chairman in Texas, the second-biggest delegate prize on
the Super Tuesday map. “Bloomberg has funded a ground game. Elizabeth
Warren has a ground game because she started organizing in Texas a long
time
ago.”

  - astead herndon  
    Hello.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Hello. How are you?

  - astead herndon  
    I’m doing well. How are you?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Very good. Thank you.

  - astead herndon  
    It’s a beautiful church. And I’m not even inside yet, and I already
    know. My name’s Astead. I’m a reporter.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Hi.

  - astead herndon  
    And I’m glad to meet you.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Good to see you. You know what makes a beautiful church, though?

  - astead herndon  
    What makes it?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Beautiful people.

  - \[laughter\]

astead herndon

From The New York Times, this is “The Field.” I’m Astead Herndon in
South Carolina.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    How many people fit in here?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    In here, we can fit about 1,400.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Wow.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Now, when I built this, I didn’t have a congregation like that. But
    this area doesn’t have anything. And because it doesn’t, you had to
    build something, not for the present but for the future. Build for
    where you want it to go, as opposed to where it is.

  - astead herndon  
    Do politicians come?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah, they come around.

  - astead herndon  
    Mm-hm.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Why do you think so many politicians come to churches in South
    Carolina?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    It is the place where you can impact the most people at any given
    point in time.

  - annie brown  
    With black people?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah, black people. Black people generally go to church.

  - \[singing\]

  - archived recording  
    Let us stand for the call to worship. (SINGING) Praise Him.
    
    Praise Him.

astead herndon

In South Carolina, more than 65 percent of the Democratic electorate is
made up of black voters. And it’s the first primary that really
represents a test of how these candidates can do among black voters
nationally.

  - archived recording  
    We have someone here today that we know. We’ve seen him. We know his
    record. He served with someone we really cared about.

astead herndon

And no candidate has staked more of their campaign on the black vote —

  - archived recording (david mack)  
    Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Joe
    Biden.

astead herndon

— than Joe Biden.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Reverend Dr. Holt, thank you for inviting me into God’s house today.
    I really appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

astead herndon

And as Joe Biden has experienced these early defeats in Iowa and New
Hampshire and Nevada, he’s been saying to voters, just wait till the
black vote shows up. Wait till I get to South Carolina.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Look, this is an incredible opportunity. I want you to know,
    although I’ve had overwhelming support from the community my whole
    career, I don’t expect anything. I’m here to earn. I’m here to earn
    your vote. I’m here to earn your support.

astead herndon

As he’s experienced these results in the early states, it’s added a real
sense of pressure on South Carolina. And if Biden doesn’t win, and win
decisively, it could completely erode his chances at the Democratic
nomination.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I don’t expect anything, but I know one thing. And this is real. The
    African-American community in South Carolina can make a judgment
    about who the next president on this stage is going to be. No, no.
    That’s not exaggeration. Literally, literally, you’re able to do
    this. Because when the African-American community decides, we’re
    going to move into Super Tuesday as they call it, where there’s
    significant African-American vote. You have —

astead herndon

The question is, is Biden right about his overwhelming support from
black voters? And if he’s not, and that vote splits across candidates,
what does that mean for the Democratic primary?

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    But folks, the vote is in your hands. Not a joke. You can control
    this outcome. I’m going to do everything in my power to earn your
    respect, earn your vote.

  - astead herndon  
    I was telling them earlier that my father’s a COGIC pastor.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Oh yeah, COGIC?

  - astead herndon  
    Yeah, yeah.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    And for us lay people, what does that mean?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Church of God in Christ.

  - astead herndon  
    Just a different Pentecostal denomination.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Both apostolic, so he’s my surrogate brother.

  - \[laughter\]

  - annie brown  
    You’re both going to heaven.

  - astead herndon  
    Yeah, yeah.

  - annie brown  
    Is that right?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    No, no, no, no — we’re both already there.

  - astead herndon  
    Yeah, right, right.

  - \[laughter\]

astead herndon

A few days ago, about two hours away from the church where Biden spoke,
I went with producers Clare Toeniskoetter and Annie Brown to Temple of
Faith Bible Way Church —

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    If you want to just sit —

  - astead herndon  
    Can I sit over here? OK, no problem.

astead herndon

— to meet Bishop Ted Myers.

  - astead herndon  
    Um, I wanted to hear just about you and how you view the primary and
    what’s going on here, but also just about your life. So how long
    have you been in South Carolina?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Life. I’ve lived here all my life. This is home. So there’s a lot of
    history that goes into that.

  - astead herndon  
    What year — when were you born? What were year were you born?

\[music\]

  - bishop theodore myers  
    ‘44, 1944.

  - astead herndon  
    OK.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Mm-hm.

  - astead herndon  
    What was it like growing up in Lower Richland in the, what, ‘50s,
    ‘60s?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Well, it was basically a black community. When I went to school, I
    had to walk about five miles to go to school as a kid. And we had to
    walk on dirt roads. So when it rained, it would be like muddy and
    dirty. But you had to walk those roads if you wanted to go to
    school.

  - astead herndon  
    What was your family structure like, brothers and sisters? How many
    — how big was your family?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    We had a nice little baseball team. \[LAUGHTER\] We had a family of
    12.

  - astead herndon  
    OK.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah.

  - annie brown  
    12 kids.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    12 kids. I’m the third child. I had a brother, who was between me
    and my sister. And when he was about two years old, he became ill.
    And my father, because we didn’t have doctors close by, my father
    had to take him in his arms and walk him to a doctor, because it was
    about 10 miles away. And while he was going, my brother died in his
    arms. And so he had to bring that baby back home in his arms to my
    mother. I’m not sure he ever got over that.

  - astead herndon  
    So 10 miles so the closest doctor, five-mile walk on the dirt road
    to school, is that because Lower Richland is black?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Listen, we didn’t have those services because, you know, we didn’t
    count. We had a lack of transportation, public transportation.
    Parents didn’t have access to jobs. We weren’t real people. We were
    just part of the environment.

  - astead herndon  
    When’s the first time you voted?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Oh, I voted when I was 18. As soon as I was able to register, I
    registered, OK? I knew that if the voting rights was ever there, I
    didn’t have any other choice. There was nothing, because it sent us
    a message to the entire population, that we, too, have a right to be
    a part of this. And I was voting, OK? ‘64, I voted for Johnson.

  - astead herndon  
    Have you voted in every presidential ever since?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    In ‘68?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah, I voted for Humphrey in ‘68.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    ‘72?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I voted for McGovern. I thought that he would have been — could have
    served as a tremendous president.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Jimmy Carter?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah.

  - astead herndon  
    Did you back Bill Clinton?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah.

astead herndon

Bishop Myers has always voted. And year after year, cycle after cycle,
the candidate that he chooses has gone on to become the Democratic
nominee.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Gore?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Kerry?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah.

astead herndon

That’s not because he’s some political psychic. Year after year, black
voters, the most loyal constituency of the Democratic Party, have
largely coalesced around a singular Democratic candidate and helped
propel that individual to the party’s nomination.

  - astead herndon  
    Obama versus Hillary, who did you support?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Now, you know.

  - astead herndon  
    I don’t know.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    With me, I was excited. I was excited for him.

  - astead herndon  
    Bernie or Hillary?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Hillary. Hillary.

astead herndon

So it started to become conventional wisdom. Whoever black people vote
for, that candidate will be the Democratic nominee.

  - astead herndon  
    This time around, how did you —

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Uh —

  - \[laughter\]

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    When did you start to notice Joe Biden?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I hadn’t heard about Joe Biden before, but when Obama chose him to
    be his V.P. I figured, if Obama chose him, he didn’t have to.

astead herndon

Bishop Myers says he just had a good feeling about Biden.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    He has depth about what he’s saying, and he speaks to that from his
    heart. That’s the kind of person he is. He feels people. He’s
    touchable. You can reach Joe. I think he understands where you are.
    None of us want to see our children leave here before we do. Biden
    had to see his son die and realize that that’s going to alter him,
    you know?

astead herndon

This is something Biden talks about all the time. In 2015, he lost his
son Beau to brain cancer at just 46 years old. And this wasn’t the first
time that Biden had lost family members. In the early 1970s, right after
he had won his Senate seat, his wife and one-year-old daughter were
killed in a car crash.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I have had it happen to me, so I know the pain.

  - annie brown  
    Had what happen to you?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I have lost two sons.
    
    It takes, it takes something special to deal with it. A father
    losing a son. And I’m sure he had close ties with his son — what you
    gonna think? Joe Biden has had a lot of hits. That man is good to be
    able to stand. But I think that Biden has been able to pull some
    strength from that. I really believe in a connection. I can feel
    him.

\[music\]

astead herndon

It was just a month after Joe Biden lost his son that a terrible tragedy
happened in South Carolina. A white supremacist walked into a
predominantly African-American church and opened fire and killed nine
people.

As vice president, Joe Biden flies down to South Carolina, goes to the
church —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I wish I could say something that would ease the pain of the
    families and of the church.

astead herndon

— and speaks with the congregation about grief.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    But I know from experience, and I was reminded of it again 29 days
    ago, that no words can mend a broken heart, no music can fill the
    gaping void. At least in my experience, only faith, only faith. And
    sometimes, as all the preachers in here know, sometimes even faith
    leaves you just for a second. Sometimes, you doubt.

astead herndon

It’s a powerful moment, where he relates his personal story to their
tragedy. And it’s an example of what many black South Carolinians say
about Joe Biden. That he’s been there, that they know him and that they
trust him.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    We had a meeting, and he was there, pastors and certain church
    leaders. And we had a breakfast meeting with him.

astead herndon

And when Bishop Myers got the chance to meet the vice president in
person, it sealed his affection for him. Biden lived up to the hype.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    And it was quite impressive, because he was talking then about some
    of the problems that we have and how we could overcome. Plain talk,
    no foolishness. He just laid it all out.

  - astead herndon  
    And you liked him when you met him?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Oh, yeah. And I thought then that if ever he became a candidate
    again, that would be the time to vote him in. That would be.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    You thought that at that moment?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah. I thought that he was the man for the job.

astead herndon

And that seemed to be true for many South Carolinians. From the moment
Biden got into the race, it seemed as if the black vote was his, and his
to lose.

  - astead herndon  
    Is that the front?

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    I think this is the front.

  - astead herndon  
    Hi, how are you?

  - bernice scott  
    I told y’all, I’ve been screaming. Y’all came to the front door.

  - astead herndon  
    I’m sorry. I couldn’t hear you.

  - bernice scott  
    That’s all right. I’m over here.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Come to the wrong door?

  - bernice scott  
    Y’all here now, so I might as well let y’all in on this side.

  - astead herndon  
    Are you Bernice?

  - bernice scott  
    Yes, I am.

  - astead herndon  
    It is nice to meet you. Astead. We’re from The New York Times.

  - bernice scott  
    Bernice. Yeah, yeah, come on in.

  - annie brown  
    Thank you.

  - astead herndon  
    Thank you so much.

  - bernice scott  
    That’s why I know y’all are strangers. Y’all came to the door.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Should we take our shoes off? Or?

  - bernice scott  
    Oh, please. No.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    OK. They’re wet, it’s raining\!

  - \[laughter\]

astead herndon

Last Monday morning, Claire, Annie and I went to meet a woman named
Bernice Scott. She’s a longtime local political figure, the former head
of the Richland City Council, and the head of a volunteer group that’s
supporting Joe Biden.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Can I ask you what your shirt says?

astead herndon

They call themselves —

  - bernice scott  
    Yeah, it’s the “Reckoning Crew.” The Reckoning Crew.

astead herndon

— the Reckoning Crew.

  - annie brown  
    Hi. Are y’all excited about Saturday?

  - reckoning crew member 1  
    Yes,

  - reckoning crew member 2  
    Oh, yes, we are.

  - reckoning crew member 3  
    \[INAUDIBLE\] Victory for the V, yeah. Vice President Biden will
    win.

astead herndon

The group had gotten together to go door knocking for Biden.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    How do you — when you door-knock, what do you say?

  - bernice scott  
    I’m Bernice Scott. I’m your neighbor. I’ve worked in this community
    all my life. I’m out campaigning for Joe Biden. Would you please
    look at him and what do you think about him? Oh, yeah, I’m for Joe
    Biden\! OK, let’s do it. Meet you at the poll. You can go early.

astead herndon

It was also clear that they felt as if their work was done.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    How many doors? Like, how often are people for Joe versus not for
    Joe when you’re knocking on doors?

  - bernice scott  
    I haven’t ran into anybody yet not for Joe.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Zero? Zero people?

  - bernice scott  
    Zero.

  - reckoning crew member  
    I haven’t. I haven’t run into anyone —

astead herndon

Whether or not this has been true for the Reckoning Crew, the evidence
tells us there has been some drift away from Biden across the state.
Some has come from billionaire Tom Steyer, the businessman who’s
invested a lot of time and money in the state, and some has come from
Bernie Sanders, who has experienced some success in the early states and
is benefiting from name recognition from his last presidential run.
Biden still has a healthy lead, but these two candidates have put some
pressure on Biden in South Carolina. The latest polling tells us while
Biden is at around 35 percent, Sanders is at 20 and Steyer is at 14. But
these women are confident that the vote is still there.

  - astead herndon  
    What would be success for Joe Biden in South Carolina? On Saturday,
    when we get the votes. If he was supposed to win by 30, by 40 —

  - reckoning crew member  
    But who said that? The news media.

  - astead herndon  
    Joe Biden’s team said that he would have a big firewall in the
    state, that he would show his strength. If he only wins by a little,
    is that success?

  - reckoning crew member  
    A win is a win. It’s like getting to heaven or going to hell.
    There’s no choice there. You either go to heaven or go to hell.

  - astead herndon  
    It doesn’t matter the margins, it doesn’t matter if he squeaks it
    out?

  - reckoning crew member  
    He can squeak, peak, whatever he want to do, as long as he win.

astead herndon

But margins do matter, particularly in South Carolina. In 2008, Barack
Obama won the South Carolina primary by around 30 points. In 2016,
Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina primary by around 50 points. And
for both those candidates, it kicked off a firewall of delegates that
they would amass through black voters in the South and lead them to the
nomination. Joe Biden has bet on a similar firewall, but if he doesn’t
get those same margins — can’t replicate what Clinton and Obama did —
then even a slight win in South Carolina might be the beginning of the
end for his candidacy.

  - helen spearman  
    Yesterday, I went to church and I prayed about it, and I think, you
    know, that he really is going to win. And he’s going to win by more
    percentage than what they’re predicting. You know, I spoke to some
    people after church yesterday and um —

  - annie brown  
    So you think that the polls are wrong?

  - helen spearman  
    In my spirit, yes, I feel they are. You know, so because they had me
    all hyped up by Hillary, I had bought me a dress to wear to the
    inaugural ball, and I ain’t wore it yet.

  - \[laughter\]

  - annie brown  
    You haven’t worn it yet?

  - helen spearman  
    So I think they’re wrong. I really do.

  - annie brown  
    Do you think you’ll wear it on Saturday?

  - helen spearman  
    I might put it on and go out, because I’ll be working at the poll. I
    might put it on and go out there.

astead herndon

But we are aware of at least one woman that Bernice Scott knows who’s
left the Biden camp and gone elsewhere.

  - annie brown  
    We’re going to speak later today with a woman, Dalhi Myers.

  - bernice scott  
    \[GASPING\]

  - annie brown  
    What’s that?

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Why’d you react that way?

  - annie brown  
    Yeah.

  - bernice scott  
    Let me tell you, I — cut that off for a second.

  - annie brown  
    Oh, OK.

  - dalhi myers  
    You look familiar.

  - astead herndon  
    Astead. It’s nice to meet you. How’s it going?

  - dalhi myers  
    Lovely to meet you. I’m Dalhi Myers.

astead herndon

So across town, we meet up with Dalhi Myers.

  - dalhi myers  
    I am a council person on the Richland County Council, District 10.

astead herndon

Who actually took Bernice Scott’s seat on the Richland County Council.

  - dalhi myers  
    I was very clear on what it took to win.

astead herndon

Dalhi says she ran an outside the box, anti-establishment, upstart
political campaign.

  - dalhi myers  
    Because I’d had to do it against a machine.

astead herndon

And the machine she describes is Bernice. Which partially explains why
we got that reaction when we said we were talking to Dalhi. But only
partially.

  - dalhi myers  
    I’m as capitalist as they come. I mean, I drive an overpriced car. I
    live in an overpriced house. I buy overpriced clothes. And I spend
    too much on where I eat, OK?

astead herndon

Dalhi considers herself conservative within the Democratic Party.

  - dalhi myers  
    I’m a pro-life Democrat, but I do believe the party’s position on
    abortion is right.

astead herndon

And so like Bernice, her choice was Joe Biden early on.

  - dalhi myers  
    And I think everybody in my family thought that. I mean, we just
    thought he could fundamentally win. And I thought he could pull
    together enough of a coalition of Democrats, moderates and
    disaffected Republicans to win. It was a “who can win? I think it’s
    Joe Biden.”

  - astead herndon  
    I mean, in some ways, that’s what the campaign is, the message that
    it’s giving to its supporters is, right? Like it’s —

  - dalhi myers  
    Yes.

  - astead herndon  
    I mean —

  - dalhi myers  
    And I now disagree with that message. I used to agree with it. I
    used to think that that was the way to win. But I guess I kind of
    woke up and realized, who wins an election saying, “I’ll take you
    backwards“?

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    \[APPLAUSE\] There are three basic reasons why I’m running for
    president of the United States. The first is to restore the soul of
    the nation. And the second is to rebuild the backbone of this
    nation. And the third is to unify this nation. We always do better
    when we act as one America.

  - dalhi myers  
    I knew in my gut that was not a campaign that was targeted to win.
    There was just nothing inspirational about it. There was no “here is
    the case for my candidacy.” It was “let’s drive this car looking in
    the rearview mirror.” Who drives that way?

astead herndon

She goes from being a Biden volunteer to giving up on him.

  - dalhi myers  
    If you can’t motivate me to go vote for you, and I want to vote for
    you, how are you going to get people who are not inclined to go vote
    to go vote for you? I mean, if I’m sitting here going, “Well, I can
    sit that one out,” and I’m going to vote, how do you get people that
    you need to motivate to go and vote? And that’s what I saw.

astead herndon

So Dalhi went looking for a new option.

  - dalhi myers  
    About a year ago, the Sanders campaign, and most other campaigns,
    reached out to me and asked me to come and sit with the candidate,
    do a small meet-and-greet. That’s what they were doing in South
    Carolina. All of them were. It wasn’t unusual. And I said, yeah,
    I’ll come. But I teased them and said Bernie Sanders is never
    going to be my candidate. Just, he does not fit anything that is of
    interest to me. And on top of it all, just the aesthetics don’t
    work. He doesn’t brush his hair. Y’all don’t make him use gel. But I
    went and literally sat through the first introduction with a good
    friend of mine, Courtney \[INAUDIBLE\] and I just sat there
    laughing. I was like, Courtney, really? Seriously?

  - annie brown  
    What were you laughing at?

  - dalhi myers  
    Everybody was so gung-ho. I mean, it was just this room packed full
    of people, and they were rabidly cheering for Bernie. And I just
    thought it was entertaining. I really did. I didn’t take it
    seriously. I did not give it much credence. And afterwards, I
    watched, I guess —

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    Thank you, Michigan\! \[CHEERING\] Thank you, Pittsburgh\!
    \[CHEERING\] Thank you, Denver\! \[CHEERING\]

  - dalhi myers  
    10, 15 Sanders rallies.

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    Thank you, Santa Ana\! \[CHEERING\] Greenville, thank you very much.
    \[CHEERING\]
    
    We were told that it was going to rain, and there’d be a small
    turnout. Looks like that’s not the case. \[CHEERING\]

  - dalhi myers  
    And I just thought, nobody’s got this kind of fire and passion.
    Nobody.

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    Let me thank all the people outside in a second overflow room. It’s
    a great turnout. Thank you very much. \[CHEERING\] Not only is this
    a large crowd, you are a loud crowd\! \[CHEERING\] This is a hell of
    a turnout. That’s what this is. \[CHEERING\]

  - dalhi myers  
    10,000 people. Who does that?

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    We’re 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

  - dalhi myers  
    Who does that?

astead herndon

Of course, Sanders has always had this type of energy. It’s been one of
his hallmarks. But what Dalhi started to think was that maybe this race
isn’t about persuading moderate Republicans to vote for a Democrat over
President Trump.

  - dalhi myers  
    His approval rating is at 90 percent with the Republican Party. And
    so I’m not convinced that those same people are going to overnight
    on election day, all of a sudden, not approve of Trump enough to
    vote for a Democrat — they’re not voting for a Democrat. And so we
    have to inspire enough Democrats to go to the polls and vote. And
    that’s part of why I switched.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Have you ever voted for a candidate who felt more off with your
    policy goals?

  - dalhi myers  
    Mm-mm.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    End of the day, what’s more important to you, electability or
    policies?

  - dalhi myers  
    Electability is policies.
    
    The Democratic Party is not the party of black people. It is a
    coalition party. So you have to be able to get groups of all people
    to vote for you across the Democratic Party. Black people, white
    people, Hispanics, Asians. So if you can’t get whole swaths of this
    party to vote for you, how ever will we win?

astead herndon

Dalhi represents a transition from the Biden view of electability to a
Sanders vision, an anti-establishment vision. She went from thinking
that the candidate she chooses has to appeal to moderate Republicans, to
embracing the Sanders framework of how you beat Trump — by motivating a
cross-section of voters across races and generations. In doing that, it
takes Bernie Sanders from being the least electable candidate to the
only one who can build that type of coalition.

  - dalhi myers  
    Ultraconservative people like me who are voting for Bernie Sanders.
    I mean, that’s shock of all shocks. All of my friends are like,
    Dalhi, really? Seriously? When did you decide that this made sense?
    And so they are surprised, and they’ve known me all my life. But I
    think there’s enough diversity in the black community to still
    surprise people. I think people have, for far too long, thought that
    all black people were this monolithic think block, sort of like the
    Borg from “Star Trek,” you know? We are all the same, and there’s,
    you know, these connected wires, making us all think the same way.
    But that is not true.

  - astead herndon  
    I mean, just to keep on this point, it feels like a unique thing of
    this primary, is that unlike Obama or Clinton, it seems likely that
    there will not be a runaway winner with black voters.

  - dalhi myers  
    Right.

  - astead herndon  
    But it also makes the group’s voting power, or determinative power,
    less in the primary. Right? Like if the person wins by a small
    plurality, that doesn’t mean the same as when Biden — when Clinton
    won by 60 or when Obama won by 70. Isn’t there some irony there?
    Like, isn’t it like — it seems as if you’re advocating for a new
    form of politics, but at the same time, the community, the state you
    represent, might matter less because of that.

  - dalhi myers  
    So if we turn that around, we could say that it matters more,
    because it reveals that you are looking at this group in the wrong
    way. And this group has decided that there are pieces here, there,
    there and there that it likes. We’re very much a diverse group
    within the party. So the group could send a message, just not one
    unified message, right? It could send the message that the old way
    of doing things, where you can run in South Carolina and pass out a
    bunch of dollar bills and think that that’s the end of it, or feed
    people a chicken sandwich or a fish fry —

  - astead herndon  
    Or go to church.

  - dalhi myers  
    Or go to church. That’s absolutely true. My church, you can’t do
    that. But I do think the old way of speaking to people, reaching
    people, and sort of lemming-like, sending them off to do a thing, it
    doesn’t work.

  - astead herndon  
    How’s your convincing efforts with your family going?

  - dalhi myers  
    I think I’m winning.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Oh\! Uh, Dalhi Myers is, of course, my daughter. And I’m her proud
    father. And she owes me for that.

  - \[laughter\]

astead herndon

This, again, is Bishop Myers —

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I think that Joe Biden is an honest person, open person. But I don’t
    think that he is as — I don’t think that he is as forceful on issues
    as he has been in the past.

astead herndon

— who has undergone his own sort of transformation in the last couple of
weeks.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    That luster is just not there. It has not been exciting. It may just
    be that he wants to kind of be that moderate voice, that voice of
    moderation. And we don’t need a voice of moderation right now. We
    need someone who can scream — loud. Do something, in light of what
    is happening to the country and to us brown people, you know?
    They’re saying, let’s go back to normal. Let’s get back to — What
    is normal? Normal got us to where we are. Shoot, if I’m normal, that
    means that you’ve got your foot on my neck, and I’m stuck here
    screaming, help, help\! And you’re saying, it’s all right. I’ll be
    here next week.

Now, Dalhi hasn’t convinced her father to vote for Bernie Sanders. He’s
of his own generation and is looking at this political moment with his
own lens.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I just, I just knew that if it was not Joe, who would it be? And I
    just waited for the chips to fall. I guess I was kind of wavering,
    looking at the field, and then I met Tom.

  - archived recording (commercial voice-over)  
    South Carolina has a chance to make history, but we have to get this
    right. The status quo just won’t do.

astead herndon

Tom Steyer. Billionaire businessman who has pumped advertising dollars
and organizing staff throughout the state of South Carolina.

  - archived recording (commercial voice-over)  
    That’s why South Carolinians are choosing Tom Steyer. He’s fought
    for —

astead herndon

He specifically has been trying to woo older black voters, who might be
feeling a little nervous about Joe Biden’s candidacy.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    Do you remember when you first heard Tom Steyer’s name? Did you see
    commercials?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Uh-huh.

  - clare toeniskoetter  
    That’s one thing people talk about with Tom Steyer — that it’s his
    money, that he’s kind of bought these votes.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Well, no way. I never want anyone to ever say that money could buy
    my vote. My vote is too expensive. He really — I mean, he had a
    plan. Joe doesn’t have a plan, or he doesn’t bring forth this plan.
    I think he thought that he did not have to do that. And that’s what
    hurt.

astead herndon

What’s significant about people like Bishop Myers turning away from
Biden’s candidacy is that it shows that it’s not just younger voters who
are looking for something a little different. The black vote seems to be
splintering across demographics.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Guys, it’s been a pleasure meeting you.

  - annie brown  
    Such a pleasure. Thank you.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    My joy.

  - astead herndon  
    Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

    Thank you.

    All right.

    Hello\!

  - astead herndon  
    Hi, how are you, Bishop?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I’m fine.

astead herndon

A few days after we talked to Bishop Myers, we got word that he was
planning to vote early.

  - astead herndon  
    We know we keep bothering you. We gotta get an answer.

astead herndon

But he was second-guessing his vote for Tom Steyer.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    You gotta get an answer?

  - astead herndon  
    Yeah, did you vote?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    Yeah, I voted.

  - astead herndon  
    All right, so drum roll. How did it end up?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    \[LAUGHING\] Well, I’ll tell you like this. I really had a searching
    of the soul in there, and a few things really got me where I’m at
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

astead herndon

Two things have happened since we had last spoke. In the Democratic
debate, candidates universally went after Bernie Sanders, putting him on
the defensive. And the most important political figure in South
Carolina, Congressman Jim Clyburn, he endorsed Joe Biden.

  - bishop theodore myers  
    The piling on of Sanders, the possibility of Steyer not doing much,
    and I looked at Jim Clyburn having come out for Joe Biden, and I did
    not want to give Bernie a bad send-off in South Carolina. So I voted
    for Joe.

  - astead herndon  
    So you voted for what?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I voted for Joe.

  - astead herndon  
    You voted for Joe?

  - bishop theodore myers  
    No, I’m just joking.

  - \[laughter\]

  - astead herndon  
    I was like, wait, what? What a plot twist\!

  - \[laughter\]

  - bishop theodore myers  
    I voted for Bernie.

  - astead herndon  
    Oh, wow\!

astead herndon

Even though Tom Steyer was still his favorite candidate, he felt as if
voting for him would be a throwaway.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Certainly, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has a long list of
congressional endorsers. He enjoys widespread name recognition and a
reservoir of good will within the party. His rivals have [many
vulnerabilities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/25/us/politics/south-carolina-debate-recap.html)
that are increasingly [being
litigated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/us/politics/bloomberg-nevada-debate.html)
in the national spotlight, and a decisive victory in South Carolina, his
allies hope, could catapult him into a strong showing on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he picked up [the
endorsement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/south-carolina-debate-primary-02-26#jim-clyburn-endorsement)
of Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the most
influential Democrat in the state, giving him a boost in the final days
before Saturday’s primary.

Yet a number of Democratic state chairmen and other party leaders said
in the last week that outreach from Mr. Biden continued to be light.
Some said they had not heard from Mr. Biden personally — a contrast with
Mr. Bloomberg — and Mary Mancini, the chairwoman of the Tennessee
Democratic Party, said on Monday that she had not heard from Mr. Biden’s
senior staff, either. She said Mr. Biden had a “natural constituency” in
the state, but added, “Biden might be taking those voters for granted.”

Anthony Daniels, the state House minority leader in Alabama, said,
“Whoever was guarding the hen house in Alabama obviously didn’t do
their job in making sure a certain level of engagement was where it
needed to be.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of Mr. Biden’s biggest problems is that he is sorely outmatched when
it comes to money. He entered February with [just over $7 million on
hand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/02/21/us/politics/democratic-fundraising-numbers-february.html),
less than half of what Mr. Sanders had, and he cannot keep pace with Mr.
Bloomberg and another billionaire in the race, [Tom
Steyer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/tom-steyer.html).

That financial disadvantage has ramifications both for television
advertising and for staffing: Multiple North Carolina Democrats, for
example, said they knew of only one Biden campaign staff member in the
state. Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign, by comparison, said it had more than
125 staff members there. The Biden team said it had a staff “in the
double digits” in North Carolina.

In California, Mr. Bloomberg has 24 offices and more than 300 staff
members, while Mr. Sanders has 23 offices and just over 100 staff
members, according to their campaigns. The Biden office in East Los
Angeles is the only one in the state, and his campaign declined to say
how many staff members it had on the ground.

“Could he do more if he had more money? Absolutely,” said Hilda L.
Solis, a Biden supporter who served as labor secretary during President
Barack Obama’s administration and is now a Los Angeles County
supervisor. But she noted that Mr. Biden had the advantage of already
being widely
known.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden has also been conspicuously absent from the airwaves in Super
Tuesday states. His campaign announced on Wednesday that it would run
television, radio and digital ads in some of those states, but described
the ad campaign as only a “six-figure” effort. In comparison, Mr.
Bloomberg has spent $184 million on television ads in Super Tuesday
states, Mr. Steyer has spent $37 million and Mr. Sanders has spent $14
million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.

“It’s to the point where you can ask a 14-year-old who’s running for
president, they’re going to say ‘Bloomberg,’” said Mr. Gray, the
Arkansas Democratic chairman.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even one of Mr. Biden’s national co-chairs, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los
Angeles, has taken notice of the onslaught of Bloomberg ads. “I don’t
think there’s a game I can play on my phone or a clip I can watch
without there being an ad not just from him but from Tom Steyer as
well,” he told reporters while campaigning for Mr. Biden in Nevada
this month.

“That said, there’s a deeper connection that’s more emotional about Joe
Biden,” Mr. Garcetti added. “That’s worth in itself millions and
millions of dollars.”

In next week’s contests, Mr. Biden’s team is focusing on congressional
districts that play to his strengths, and where many other candidates
are likely to struggle to reach the 15 percent threshold to receive
delegates.

The Biden campaign is hoping for particularly strong performances in
districts with many voters of color, like Alabama’s Seventh
Congressional District, a majority black district represented in the
House by Terri A. Sewell, and North Carolina’s First Congressional
District, which also has a large black population and is represented by
G. K. Butterfield.

Both Ms. Sewell and Mr. Butterfield have endorsed Mr.
Biden.

In California, in addition to Mr. Garcetti and Ms. Solis, his supporters
include Senator Dianne Feinstein, the mayors of Sacramento and Long
Beach, and several members of the state’s congressional delegation.

But an impressive list of endorsements does not necessarily translate
into votes, as was apparent in Iowa, where Mr. Biden had the backing of
former Gov. Tom Vilsack as well as two of the state’s three Democratic
House members and yet still performed poorly.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden’s East Los Angeles office, located in a county with a
population exceeding 10 million, was only barely more active during a
return visit over the weekend. The padlocked gate was eventually
unlocked, but when an event for volunteers got underway on Saturday,
only a handful of people had shown up.

Inside the campaign office, seven large round tables were surrounded by
chairs, and it was not hard to get a seat. There were fewer people
making phone calls than there were tables.

Thomas Kaplan reported from Los Angeles, and Katie Glueck from
Charleston,
S.C.
