\section{`He Hasn't Been Here': Why Joe Biden Lags in Super Tuesday
States}\label{he-hasnt-been-here-why-joe-biden-lags-in-super-tuesday-states}}

Joseph R. Biden Jr. is counting on a victory in South Carolina to revive
his candidacy. But a daunting challenge awaits next week in states where
he has limited resources.

LOS ANGELES --- On the day before in-person early voting was to begin
across California's most populous county, there was no sign of life at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.'s} campaign office in East Los Angeles last Friday. A metal
gate out front was padlocked shut, with a missed-delivery notice from
the Postal Service wedged into it.

In a strip mall a mile away, a campaign office for Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} was humming with activity. Field organizers were busy calling
supporters, and every so often the ding of a bell signaled that another
volunteer was on board.

Mr. Biden is counting on a win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday
to help position him as the leading moderate challenger to Mr. Sanders,
after three straight losses shredded Mr. Biden's status as the onetime
front-runner. But even if he succeeds in South Carolina, his lack of
resources and thin campaign organization in California and other states
that vote next week on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/super-tuesday-03-03}{Super
Tuesday} present a daunting challenge to a candidacy already on
precarious footing.

Interviews with party leaders in half a dozen Super Tuesday states
suggest that the same vulnerabilities that plagued Mr. Biden beginning
in Iowa --- subpar organization, limited outreach to local Democrats and
a late start to campaigning --- are holding him back in the states that
next week will dole out a third of the total delegates in the Democratic
primary.

Mr. Biden's on-the-ground operations, these Democrats said, are easily
dwarfed by those of Mr. Sanders and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html}{Michael
R. Bloomberg}, the moderate former mayor of New York who has plainly cut
into Mr. Biden's standing in some of these states even as he faces his
own mounting challenges in the race.

``Arkansas was, in my opinion, going to be a default Biden state,'' said
Michael John Gray, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas.
``He hasn't been here. Of all the campaigns, the least organized in
Arkansas is Biden.''

Other candidates like Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, are already campaigning
in Super Tuesday states, holding events that excite supporters and
generate news media coverage. But Mr. Biden has planted himself
elsewhere, after his fourth-place finish in Iowa and fifth-place New
Hampshire result threw even his expected firewall of South Carolina into
doubt.

He devoted last week to Nevada, where he pulled off the second-place
finish that he was aiming for, and this week he is scheduled to be in
South Carolina every day before Saturday's primary, which he says he
will win. Aside from fund-raising, he has not campaigned in a Super
Tuesday state in over a month, though he is planning to visit North
Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, Texas and California between Saturday and
Tuesday.

After the disastrous first two contests, the Biden campaign also moved
staff members from Super Tuesday states to Nevada and South Carolina to
provide extra manpower there.

``Bernie has a ground game because he naturally has a ground game; his
whole campaign is a grass-roots campaign,'' said Gilberto Hinojosa, the
Democratic Party chairman in Texas, the second-biggest delegate prize on
the Super Tuesday map. ``Bloomberg has funded a ground game. Elizabeth
Warren has a ground game because she started organizing in Texas a long
time ago.''

  Hello. How are you?
\item
  astead herndon\\
  I'm doing well. How are you?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Very good. Thank you.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  It's a beautiful church. And I'm not even inside yet, and I already
  know. My name's Astead. I'm a reporter.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Hi.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  And I'm glad to meet you.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Good to see you. You know what makes a beautiful church, though?

  What makes it?

From The New York Times, this is ``The Field.'' I'm Astead Herndon in
South Carolina.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  How many people fit in here?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  In here, we can fit about 1,400.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Wow.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Now, when I built this, I didn't have a congregation like that. But
  this area doesn't have anything. And because it doesn't, you had to
  build something, not for the present but for the future. Build for
  where you want it to go, as opposed to where it is.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Do politicians come?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah, they come around.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Why do you think so many politicians come to churches in South
  Carolina?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  It is the place where you can impact the most people at any given
  point in time.
\item
  annie brown\\
  With black people?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah, black people. Black people generally go to church.

In South Carolina, more than 65 percent of the Democratic electorate is
made up of black voters. And it's the first primary that really
represents a test of how these candidates can do among black voters
nationally.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  We have someone here today that we know. We've seen him. We know his
  record. He served with someone we really cared about.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

And no candidate has staked more of their campaign on the black vote ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (david mack)\\
  Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Joe
  Biden.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

--- than Joe Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Reverend Dr. Holt, thank you for inviting me into God's house today. I
  really appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

And as Joe Biden has experienced these early defeats in Iowa and New
Hampshire and Nevada, he's been saying to voters, just wait till the
black vote shows up. Wait till I get to South Carolina.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Look, this is an incredible opportunity. I want you to know, although
  I've had overwhelming support from the community my whole career, I
  don't expect anything. I'm here to earn. I'm here to earn your vote.
  I'm here to earn your support.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

As he's experienced these results in the early states, it's added a real
sense of pressure on South Carolina. And if Biden doesn't win, and win
decisively, it could completely erode his chances at the Democratic
nomination.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I don't expect anything, but I know one thing. And this is real. The
  African-American community in South Carolina can make a judgment about
  who the next president on this stage is going to be. No, no. That's
  not exaggeration. Literally, literally, you're able to do this.
  Because when the African-American community decides, we're going to
  move into Super Tuesday as they call it, where there's significant
  African-American vote. You have ---
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

The question is, is Biden right about his overwhelming support from
black voters? And if he's not, and that vote splits across candidates,
what does that mean for the Democratic primary?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  But folks, the vote is in your hands. Not a joke. You can control this
  outcome. I'm going to do everything in my power to earn your respect,
  earn your vote.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  I was telling them earlier that my father's a COGIC pastor.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Oh yeah, COGIC?
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Yeah, yeah.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  And for us lay people, what does that mean?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Church of God in Christ.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Just a different Pentecostal denomination.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Both apostolic, so he's my surrogate brother.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  annie brown\\
  You're both going to heaven.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Yeah, yeah.
\item
  annie brown\\
  Is that right?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  No, no, no, no --- we're both already there.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Yeah, right, right.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

A few days ago, about two hours away from the church where Biden spoke,
I went with producers Clare Toeniskoetter and Annie Brown to Temple of
Faith Bible Way Church ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  If you want to just sit ---
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Can I sit over here? OK, no problem.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

--- to meet Bishop Ted Myers.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Um, I wanted to hear just about you and how you view the primary and
  what's going on here, but also just about your life. So how long have
  you been in South Carolina?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Life. I've lived here all my life. This is home. So there's a lot of
  history that goes into that.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  What year --- when were you born? What were year were you born?
\end{itemize}

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  `44, 1944.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  OK.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  What was it like growing up in Lower Richland in the, what, `50s,
  `60s?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Well, it was basically a black community. When I went to school, I had
  to walk about five miles to go to school as a kid. And we had to walk
  on dirt roads. So when it rained, it would be like muddy and dirty.
  But you had to walk those roads if you wanted to go to school.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  What was your family structure like, brothers and sisters? How many
  --- how big was your family?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  We had a nice little baseball team. {[}LAUGHTER{]} We had a family of
  12.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  OK.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah.
\item
  annie brown\\
  12 kids.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  12 kids. I'm the third child. I had a brother, who was between me and
  my sister. And when he was about two years old, he became ill. And my
  father, because we didn't have doctors close by, my father had to take
  him in his arms and walk him to a doctor, because it was about 10
  miles away. And while he was going, my brother died in his arms. And
  so he had to bring that baby back home in his arms to my mother. I'm
  not sure he ever got over that.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  So 10 miles so the closest doctor, five-mile walk on the dirt road to
  school, is that because Lower Richland is black?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Listen, we didn't have those services because, you know, we didn't
  count. We had a lack of transportation, public transportation. Parents
  didn't have access to jobs. We weren't real people. We were just part
  of the environment.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  When's the first time you voted?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Oh, I voted when I was 18. As soon as I was able to register, I
  registered, OK? I knew that if the voting rights was ever there, I
  didn't have any other choice. There was nothing, because it sent us a
  message to the entire population, that we, too, have a right to be a
  part of this. And I was voting, OK? `64, I voted for Johnson.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Have you voted in every presidential ever since?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  In `68?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah, I voted for Humphrey in `68.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  `72?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I voted for McGovern. I thought that he would have been --- could have
  served as a tremendous president.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Jimmy Carter?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Did you back Bill Clinton?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Bishop Myers has always voted. And year after year, cycle after cycle,
the candidate that he chooses has gone on to become the Democratic
nominee.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Gore?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Kerry?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

That's not because he's some political psychic. Year after year, black
voters, the most loyal constituency of the Democratic Party, have
largely coalesced around a singular Democratic candidate and helped
propel that individual to the party's nomination.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Obama versus Hillary, who did you support?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Now, you know.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  I don't know.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  With me, I was excited. I was excited for him.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Bernie or Hillary?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Hillary. Hillary.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

So it started to become conventional wisdom. Whoever black people vote
for, that candidate will be the Democratic nominee.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  astead herndon\\
  This time around, how did you ---
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Uh ---
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  When did you start to notice Joe Biden?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I hadn't heard about Joe Biden before, but when Obama chose him to be
  his V.P. I figured, if Obama chose him, he didn't have to.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Bishop Myers says he just had a good feeling about Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  He has depth about what he's saying, and he speaks to that from his
  heart. That's the kind of person he is. He feels people. He's
  touchable. You can reach Joe. I think he understands where you are.
  None of us want to see our children leave here before we do. Biden had
  to see his son die and realize that that's going to alter him, you
  know?
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

This is something Biden talks about all the time. In 2015, he lost his
son Beau to brain cancer at just 46 years old. And this wasn't the first
time that Biden had lost family members. In the early 1970s, right after
he had won his Senate seat, his wife and one-year-old daughter were
killed in a car crash.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I have had it happen to me, so I know the pain.
\item
  annie brown\\
  Had what happen to you?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I have lost two sons.

  It takes, it takes something special to deal with it. A father losing
  a son. And I'm sure he had close ties with his son --- what you gonna
  think? Joe Biden has had a lot of hits. That man is good to be able to
  stand. But I think that Biden has been able to pull some strength from
  that. I really believe in a connection. I can feel him.
\end{itemize}

{[}music{]}

astead herndon

It was just a month after Joe Biden lost his son that a terrible tragedy
happened in South Carolina. A white supremacist walked into a
predominantly African-American church and opened fire and killed nine
people.

As vice president, Joe Biden flies down to South Carolina, goes to the
church ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I wish I could say something that would ease the pain of the families
  and of the church.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

--- and speaks with the congregation about grief.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  But I know from experience, and I was reminded of it again 29 days
  ago, that no words can mend a broken heart, no music can fill the
  gaping void. At least in my experience, only faith, only faith. And
  sometimes, as all the preachers in here know, sometimes even faith
  leaves you just for a second. Sometimes, you doubt.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

It's a powerful moment, where he relates his personal story to their
tragedy. And it's an example of what many black South Carolinians say
about Joe Biden. That he's been there, that they know him and that they
trust him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  We had a meeting, and he was there, pastors and certain church
  leaders. And we had a breakfast meeting with him.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

And when Bishop Myers got the chance to meet the vice president in
person, it sealed his affection for him. Biden lived up to the hype.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  And it was quite impressive, because he was talking then about some of
  the problems that we have and how we could overcome. Plain talk, no
  foolishness. He just laid it all out.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  And you liked him when you met him?
\item

  Oh, yeah. And I thought then that if ever he became a candidate again,
  that would be the time to vote him in. That would be.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  You thought that at that moment?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Yeah. I thought that he was the man for the job.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

And that seemed to be true for many South Carolinians. From the moment
Biden got into the race, it seemed as if the black vote was his, and his
to lose.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Is that the front?
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  I think this is the front.
\item

  I told y'all, I've been screaming. Y'all came to the front door.

Last Monday morning, Claire, Annie and I went to meet a woman named
Bernice Scott. She's a longtime local political figure, the former head
of the Richland City Council, and the head of a volunteer group that's
supporting Joe Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Can I ask you what your shirt says?
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

They call themselves ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bernice scott\\
  Yeah, it's the ``Reckoning Crew.'' The Reckoning Crew.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

--- the Reckoning Crew.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  annie brown\\
  Hi. Are y'all excited about Saturday?
\item
  reckoning crew member 1\\
  Yes,
\item
  reckoning crew member 2\\
  Oh, yes, we are.
\item
  reckoning crew member 3\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]} Victory for the V, yeah. Vice President Biden will
  win.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

The group had gotten together to go door knocking for Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  How do you --- when you door-knock, what do you say?
\item
  bernice scott\\
  I'm Bernice Scott. I'm your neighbor. I've worked in this community
  all my life. I'm out campaigning for Joe Biden. Would you please look
  at him and what do you think about him? Oh, yeah, I'm for Joe Biden!
  OK, let's do it. Meet you at the poll. You can go early.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

It was also clear that they felt as if their work was done.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  How many doors? Like, how often are people for Joe versus not for Joe
  when you're knocking on doors?
\item
  bernice scott\\
  I haven't ran into anybody yet not for Joe.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Zero? Zero people?
\item
  bernice scott\\
  Zero.
\item
  reckoning crew member\\
  I haven't. I haven't run into anyone ---
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Whether or not this has been true for the Reckoning Crew, the evidence
tells us there has been some drift away from Biden across the state.
Some has come from billionaire Tom Steyer, the businessman who's
invested a lot of time and money in the state, and some has come from
Bernie Sanders, who has experienced some success in the early states and
is benefiting from name recognition from his last presidential run.
Biden still has a healthy lead, but these two candidates have put some
pressure on Biden in South Carolina. The latest polling tells us while
Biden is at around 35 percent, Sanders is at 20 and Steyer is at 14. But
these women are confident that the vote is still there.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  astead herndon\\
  What would be success for Joe Biden in South Carolina? On Saturday,
  when we get the votes. If he was supposed to win by 30, by 40 ---
\item
  reckoning crew member\\
  But who said that? The news media.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Joe Biden's team said that he would have a big firewall in the state,
  that he would show his strength. If he only wins by a little, is that
  success?
\item
  reckoning crew member\\
  A win is a win. It's like getting to heaven or going to hell. There's
  no choice there. You either go to heaven or go to hell.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  It doesn't matter the margins, it doesn't matter if he squeaks it out?
\item
  reckoning crew member\\
  He can squeak, peak, whatever he want to do, as long as he win.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

But margins do matter, particularly in South Carolina. In 2008, Barack
Obama won the South Carolina primary by around 30 points. In 2016,
Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina primary by around 50 points. And
for both those candidates, it kicked off a firewall of delegates that
they would amass through black voters in the South and lead them to the
nomination. Joe Biden has bet on a similar firewall, but if he doesn't
get those same margins --- can't replicate what Clinton and Obama did
--- then even a slight win in South Carolina might be the beginning of
the end for his candidacy.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  helen spearman\\
  Yesterday, I went to church and I prayed about it, and I think, you
  know, that he really is going to win. And he's going to win by more
  percentage than what they're predicting. You know, I spoke to some
  people after church yesterday and um ---
\item
  annie brown\\
  So you think that the polls are wrong?
\item
  helen spearman\\
  In my spirit, yes, I feel they are. You know, so because they had me
  all hyped up by Hillary, I had bought me a dress to wear to the
  inaugural ball, and I ain't wore it yet.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  annie brown\\
  You haven't worn it yet?
\item
  helen spearman\\
  So I think they're wrong. I really do.
\item
  annie brown\\
  Do you think you'll wear it on Saturday?
\item
  helen spearman\\
  I might put it on and go out, because I'll be working at the poll. I
  might put it on and go out there.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

But we are aware of at least one woman that Bernice Scott knows who's
left the Biden camp and gone elsewhere.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  annie brown\\
  We're going to speak later today with a woman, Dalhi Myers.
\item
  bernice scott\\
  {[}GASPING{]}
\item
  annie brown\\
  What's that?
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Why'd you react that way?
\item
  annie brown\\
  Yeah.
\item
  bernice scott\\
  Let me tell you, I --- cut that off for a second.
\item
  annie brown\\
  Oh, OK.
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  You look familiar.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Astead. It's nice to meet you. How's it going?
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Lovely to meet you. I'm Dalhi Myers.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

So across town, we meet up with Dalhi Myers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  I am a council person on the Richland County Council, District 10.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Who actually took Bernice Scott's seat on the Richland County Council.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  I was very clear on what it took to win.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Dalhi says she ran an outside the box, anti-establishment, upstart
political campaign.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Because I'd had to do it against a machine.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

And the machine she describes is Bernice. Which partially explains why
we got that reaction when we said we were talking to Dalhi. But only
partially.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  I'm as capitalist as they come. I mean, I drive an overpriced car. I
  live in an overpriced house. I buy overpriced clothes. And I spend too
  much on where I eat, OK?
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Dalhi considers herself conservative within the Democratic Party.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  I'm a pro-life Democrat, but I do believe the party's position on
  abortion is right.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

And so like Bernice, her choice was Joe Biden early on.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  And I think everybody in my family thought that. I mean, we just
  thought he could fundamentally win. And I thought he could pull
  together enough of a coalition of Democrats, moderates and disaffected
  Republicans to win. It was a ``who can win? I think it's Joe Biden.''
\item
  astead herndon\\
  I mean, in some ways, that's what the campaign is, the message that
  it's giving to its supporters is, right? Like it's ---
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Yes.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  I mean ---
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  And I now disagree with that message. I used to agree with it. I used
  to think that that was the way to win. But I guess I kind of woke up
  and realized, who wins an election saying, ``I'll take you
  backwards``?
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  {[}APPLAUSE{]} There are three basic reasons why I'm running for
  president of the United States. The first is to restore the soul of
  the nation. And the second is to rebuild the backbone of this nation.
  And the third is to unify this nation. We always do better when we act
  as one America.
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  I knew in my gut that was not a campaign that was targeted to win.
  There was just nothing inspirational about it. There was no ``here is
  the case for my candidacy.'' It was ``let's drive this car looking in
  the rearview mirror.'' Who drives that way?
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

She goes from being a Biden volunteer to giving up on him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  If you can't motivate me to go vote for you, and I want to vote for
  you, how are you going to get people who are not inclined to go vote
  to go vote for you? I mean, if I'm sitting here going, ``Well, I can
  sit that one out,'' and I'm going to vote, how do you get people that
  you need to motivate to go and vote? And that's what I saw.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

So Dalhi went looking for a new option.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  About a year ago, the Sanders campaign, and most other campaigns,
  reached out to me and asked me to come and sit with the candidate, do
  a small meet-and-greet. That's what they were doing in South Carolina.
  All of them were. It wasn't unusual. And I said, yeah, I'll come. But
  I teased them and said Bernie Sanders is never going to be my
  candidate. Just, he does not fit anything that is of interest to me.
  And on top of it all, just the aesthetics don't work. He doesn't brush
  his hair. Y'all don't make him use gel. But I went and literally sat
  through the first introduction with a good friend of mine, Courtney
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]} and I just sat there laughing. I was like, Courtney,
  really? Seriously?
\item
  annie brown\\
  What were you laughing at?
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Everybody was so gung-ho. I mean, it was just this room packed full of
  people, and they were rabidly cheering for Bernie. And I just thought
  it was entertaining. I really did. I didn't take it seriously. I did
  not give it much credence. And afterwards, I watched, I guess ---
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  Thank you, Michigan! {[}CHEERING{]} Thank you, Pittsburgh!
  {[}CHEERING{]} Thank you, Denver! {[}CHEERING{]}
\item

\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  Thank you, Santa Ana! {[}CHEERING{]} Greenville, thank you very much.
  {[}CHEERING{]}

  We were told that it was going to rain, and there'd be a small
  turnout. Looks like that's not the case. {[}CHEERING{]}
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  And I just thought, nobody's got this kind of fire and passion.
  Nobody.
\item

  great turnout. Thank you very much. {[}CHEERING{]} Not only is this a
  large crowd, you are a loud crowd! {[}CHEERING{]} This is a hell of a

\item
  dalhi myers\\
  10,000 people. Who does that?
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  We're 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Who does that?
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Of course, Sanders has always had this type of energy. It's been one of
his hallmarks. But what Dalhi started to think was that maybe this race
isn't about persuading moderate Republicans to vote for a Democrat over
President Trump.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  His approval rating is at 90 percent with the Republican Party. And so
  I'm not convinced that those same people are going to overnight on
  election day, all of a sudden, not approve of Trump enough to vote for
  a Democrat --- they're not voting for a Democrat. And so we have to
  inspire enough Democrats to go to the polls and vote. And that's part
  of why I switched.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Have you ever voted for a candidate who felt more off with your policy
  goals?
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Mm-mm.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  End of the day, what's more important to you, electability or
  policies?
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Electability is policies.

  The Democratic Party is not the party of black people. It is a
  coalition party. So you have to be able to get groups of all people to
  vote for you across the Democratic Party. Black people, white people,
  Hispanics, Asians. So if you can't get whole swaths of this party to
  vote for you, how ever will we win?
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Dalhi represents a transition from the Biden view of electability to a
Sanders vision, an anti-establishment vision. She went from thinking
that the candidate she chooses has to appeal to moderate Republicans, to
embracing the Sanders framework of how you beat Trump --- by motivating
a cross-section of voters across races and generations. In doing that,
it takes Bernie Sanders from being the least electable candidate to the
only one who can build that type of coalition.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Ultraconservative people like me who are voting for Bernie Sanders. I
  mean, that's shock of all shocks. All of my friends are like, Dalhi,
  really? Seriously? When did you decide that this made sense? And so
  they are surprised, and they've known me all my life. But I think
  there's enough diversity in the black community to still surprise
  people. I think people have, for far too long, thought that all black
  people were this monolithic think block, sort of like the Borg from
  ``Star Trek,'' you know? We are all the same, and there's, you know,
  these connected wires, making us all think the same way. But that is
  not true.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  I mean, just to keep on this point, it feels like a unique thing of
  this primary, is that unlike Obama or Clinton, it seems likely that
  there will not be a runaway winner with black voters.
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Right.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  But it also makes the group's voting power, or determinative power,
  less in the primary. Right? Like if the person wins by a small
  plurality, that doesn't mean the same as when Biden --- when Clinton
  won by 60 or when Obama won by 70. Isn't there some irony there? Like,
  isn't it like --- it seems as if you're advocating for a new form of
  politics, but at the same time, the community, the state you
  represent, might matter less because of that.
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  So if we turn that around, we could say that it matters more, because
  it reveals that you are looking at this group in the wrong way. And
  this group has decided that there are pieces here, there, there and
  there that it likes. We're very much a diverse group within the party.
  So the group could send a message, just not one unified message,
  right? It could send the message that the old way of doing things,
  where you can run in South Carolina and pass out a bunch of dollar
  bills and think that that's the end of it, or feed people a chicken
  sandwich or a fish fry ---
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Or go to church.
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  Or go to church. That's absolutely true. My church, you can't do that.
  But I do think the old way of speaking to people, reaching people, and
  sort of lemming-like, sending them off to do a thing, it doesn't work.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  How's your convincing efforts with your family going?
\item
  dalhi myers\\
  I think I'm winning.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Oh! Uh, Dalhi Myers is, of course, my daughter. And I'm her proud
  father. And she owes me for that.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

This, again, is Bishop Myers ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I think that Joe Biden is an honest person, open person. But I don't
  think that he is as --- I don't think that he is as forceful on issues
  as he has been in the past.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

--- who has undergone his own sort of transformation in the last couple
of weeks.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  That luster is just not there. It has not been exciting. It may just
  be that he wants to kind of be that moderate voice, that voice of
  moderation. And we don't need a voice of moderation right now. We need
  someone who can scream --- loud. Do something, in light of what is
  happening to the country and to us brown people, you know? They're
  saying, let's go back to normal. Let's get back to --- What is normal?
  Normal got us to where we are. Shoot, if I'm normal, that means that
  you've got your foot on my neck, and I'm stuck here screaming, help,
  help! And you're saying, it's all right. I'll be here next week.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Now, Dalhi hasn't convinced her father to vote for Bernie Sanders. He's
of his own generation and is looking at this political moment with his
own lens.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I just, I just knew that if it was not Joe, who would it be? And I
  just waited for the chips to fall. I guess I was kind of wavering,
  looking at the field, and then I met Tom.

He specifically has been trying to woo older black voters, who might be
feeling a little nervous about Joe Biden's candidacy.

\begin{itemize}

  Do you remember when you first heard Tom Steyer's name? Did you see
  commercials?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Uh-huh.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  That's one thing people talk about with Tom Steyer --- that it's his
  money, that he's kind of bought these votes.
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  Well, no way. I never want anyone to ever say that money could buy my
  vote. My vote is too expensive. He really --- I mean, he had a plan.
  Joe doesn't have a plan, or he doesn't bring forth this plan. I think
  he thought that he did not have to do that. And that's what hurt.
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

What's significant about people like Bishop Myers turning away from
Biden's candidacy is that it shows that it's not just younger voters who
are looking for something a little different. The black vote seems to be
splintering across demographics.

\begin{itemize}

astead herndon

Two things have happened since we had last spoke. In the Democratic
debate, candidates universally went after Bernie Sanders, putting him on
the defensive. And the most important political figure in South
Carolina, Congressman Jim Clyburn, he endorsed Joe Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  The piling on of Sanders, the possibility of Steyer not doing much,
  and I looked at Jim Clyburn having come out for Joe Biden, and I did
  not want to give Bernie a bad send-off in South Carolina. So I voted
  for Joe.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  So you voted for what?
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I voted for Joe.
\item

  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  bishop theodore myers\\
  I voted for Bernie.
\item
  astead herndon\\
  Oh, wow!
\end{itemize}

astead herndon

Even though Tom Steyer was still his favorite candidate, he felt as if
voting for him would be a throwaway.

Certainly, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has a long list of
congressional endorsers. He enjoys widespread name recognition and a
reservoir of good will within the party. His rivals have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/25/us/politics/south-carolina-debate-recap.html}{many
vulnerabilities} that are increasingly
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/us/politics/bloomberg-nevada-debate.html}{being
litigated} in the national spotlight, and a decisive victory in South
Carolina, his allies hope, could catapult him into a strong showing on
Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he picked up
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/south-carolina-debate-primary-02-26\#jim-clyburn-endorsement}{the
endorsement} of Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the
most influential Democrat in the state, giving him a boost in the final
days before Saturday's primary.

Yet a number of Democratic state chairmen and other party leaders said
in the last week that outreach from Mr. Biden continued to be light.
Some said they had not heard from Mr. Biden personally --- a contrast
with Mr. Bloomberg --- and Mary Mancini, the chairwoman of the Tennessee
Democratic Party, said on Monday that she had not heard from Mr. Biden's
senior staff, either. She said Mr. Biden had a ``natural constituency''
in the state, but added, ``Biden might be taking those voters for
granted.''

Anthony Daniels, the state House minority leader in Alabama, said,
``Whoever was guarding the hen house in Alabama obviously didn't do
their job in making sure a certain level of engagement was where it
needed to be.''

One of Mr. Biden's biggest problems is that he is sorely outmatched when
it comes to money. He entered February with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/02/21/us/politics/democratic-fundraising-numbers-february.html}{just
over \$7 million on hand}, less than half of what Mr. Sanders had, and
he cannot keep pace with Mr. Bloomberg and another billionaire in the
race,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/tom-steyer.html}{Tom
Steyer}.

That financial disadvantage has ramifications both for television
advertising and for staffing: Multiple North Carolina Democrats, for
example, said they knew of only one Biden campaign staff member in the
state. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, by comparison, said it had more than
125 staff members there. The Biden team said it had a staff ``in the
double digits'' in North Carolina.

In California, Mr. Bloomberg has 24 offices and more than 300 staff
members, while Mr. Sanders has 23 offices and just over 100 staff
members, according to their campaigns. The Biden office in East Los
Angeles is the only one in the state, and his campaign declined to say
how many staff members it had on the ground.

``Could he do more if he had more money? Absolutely,'' said Hilda L.
Solis, a Biden supporter who served as labor secretary during President
Barack Obama's administration and is now a Los Angeles County
supervisor. But she noted that Mr. Biden had the advantage of already
being widely known.

Mr. Biden has also been conspicuously absent from the airwaves in Super
Tuesday states. His campaign announced on Wednesday that it would run
television, radio and digital ads in some of those states, but described
the ad campaign as only a ``six-figure'' effort. In comparison, Mr.
Bloomberg has spent \$184 million on television ads in Super Tuesday
states, Mr. Steyer has spent \$37 million and Mr. Sanders has spent \$14
million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.

``It's to the point where you can ask a 14-year-old who's running for
president, they're going to say `Bloomberg,''' said Mr. Gray, the
Arkansas Democratic chairman.

Even one of Mr. Biden's national co-chairs, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los
Angeles, has taken notice of the onslaught of Bloomberg ads. ``I don't
think there's a game I can play on my phone or a clip I can watch
without there being an ad not just from him but from Tom Steyer as
well,'' he told reporters while campaigning for Mr. Biden in Nevada this
month.

``That said, there's a deeper connection that's more emotional about Joe
Biden,'' Mr. Garcetti added. ``That's worth in itself millions and
millions of dollars.''

In next week's contests, Mr. Biden's team is focusing on congressional
districts that play to his strengths, and where many other candidates
are likely to struggle to reach the 15 percent threshold to receive
delegates.

The Biden campaign is hoping for particularly strong performances in
districts with many voters of color, like Alabama's Seventh
Congressional District, a majority black district represented in the
House by Terri A. Sewell, and North Carolina's First Congressional
District, which also has a large black population and is represented by
G. K. Butterfield.

Both Ms. Sewell and Mr. Butterfield have endorsed Mr. Biden.

In California, in addition to Mr. Garcetti and Ms. Solis, his supporters
include Senator Dianne Feinstein, the mayors of Sacramento and Long
Beach, and several members of the state's congressional delegation.

But an impressive list of endorsements does not necessarily translate
into votes, as was apparent in Iowa, where Mr. Biden had the backing of
former Gov. Tom Vilsack as well as two of the state's three Democratic
House members and yet still performed poorly.

Mr. Biden's East Los Angeles office, located in a county with a
population exceeding 10 million, was only barely more active during a
return visit over the weekend. The padlocked gate was eventually
unlocked, but when an event for volunteers got underway on Saturday,
only a handful of people had shown up.

Inside the campaign office, seven large round tables were surrounded by
chairs, and it was not hard to get a seat. There were fewer people
making phone calls than there were tables.

Thomas Kaplan reported from Los Angeles, and Katie Glueck from
Charleston, S.C.
