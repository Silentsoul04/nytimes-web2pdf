Already in deep distress, the patient was rushed last week to a hospital
in Northern California, severely ill and unable to breathe on her own.

Doctors at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, near
Sacramento, provided the woman with critical care but also considered an
unlikely diagnosis: infection with the coronavirus.

Hospital administrators said they immediately requested diagnostic
testing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the
procedure was not carried out because the case did not qualify under
strict federal criteria: She had not traveled to China and had not been
in contact with anyone known to be infected.

The announcement on Wednesday that the woman was indeed infected left
health officials in California searching for people she may have exposed
to the virus and testing the medical workers who have treated her. The
case has raised difficult questions about whom to test and whether the
nation is prepared to keep the virus under
control.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The California woman’s case may also offer the first indication that the
virus has spread beyond Americans who traveled outside the country, or
had contact with someone who had.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Even before the announcement on Wednesday, frustration had been mounting
among health providers and medical experts that the agency was testing
too few Americans, which may slow preparations for an outbreak and may
obscure the scope of infections.

“I think the diagnostic issue is the single most important thing that
keeps me up at night right now,” said Lauren Sauer, director of
operations at the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness
and Response in Baltimore.

broadened its testing criteria, adding to the number of Americans who
qualify.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

home.

Officials are bracing for a larger outbreak in Northern California.
“There’s almost assuredly going to be a significant number of people
testing positive,” said Dr. Peter L. Beilenson, the director of
Sacramento County’s Department of Health Services.

The case has heightened concerns about the nation’s ability to test
large numbers of people. Only the C.D.C. performs the tests that confirm
a novel coronavirus diagnosis, a process that often takes days.

The C.D.C. had distributed diagnostic testing kits to state health
departments, but they turned out to be flawed. Replacement kits have not
yet been distributed.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

Ms. Sauer said Johns Hopkins had treated several patients who did not
fit the testing criteria, and for whom it requested coronavirus testing.
In all but one case, the hospital was able to persuade the C.D.C. to run
a test, or eventually identify another cause for the patient’s illness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C. is “pretty much the only place we can access testing,” she
added, and the agency has been unwilling to grapple with cases that do
not fit its criteria.

“The idea that we would have to really fight to get that test done, when
C.D.C. is saying they have capacity, is alarming.” Ms. Sauer said. “It
is a challenge when the most important piece of information — does this
person have this disease, yes or no — is not accessible, and there’s no
timeline for improved accessibility.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

After the diagnosis in California, the C.D.C. has pledged to greatly
expand the state’s ability to test patients for the coronavirus,
officials said.

“Testing protocols have been a point of frustration for many of us,”
Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference on Thursday. California had
just 200 testing kits left, he added.

The governor said Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C.,
promised that state physicians would have a much greater ability to test
patients who were showing symptoms, a change the governor said “can’t
happen soon
enough.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

The C.D.C. has committed to sending a team to California to help track
people and make sure they are contacted by health officials about their
possible exposure, Mr. Newsom said.

“They are being interviewed — points of contact, family members and
others,” he said.

Experts said they were perplexed by the C.D.C.’s inability to fix the
test’s flaws.

“The obvious observation is that many countries are capable of testing
rather widely,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease
specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “Why
can’t we?”

The C.D.C. operates two laboratories that test for the coronavirus and
can handle approximately 400 specimens per day. Agency officials say
there is no testing backlog, but it is unclear whether the labs will be
able to keep up with demand if the need — and eligibility — increases
testing substantially.

Under the new federal criteria, people with respiratory symptoms who
traveled to Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea should be tested — not
just those who traveled in China. So should severely ill patients with
acute lower respiratory symptoms who are hospitalized and in whom other
diagnoses have been ruled out.

A criticism of the new criteria, however, is that doctors will have to
wait until someone is extremely ill to test for the virus if that person
did not travel to the affected regions or have contact with a known
case.

“If we could identify these people earlier who don’t specifically meet
one of the two criteria, or some sort of broader travel criteria, we
could get them tested,” Ms. Sauer said. “You have to wait until
someone’s really sick to push that test now, even with this new
criteria.

Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said he planned to appeal to Vice President Mike Pence —
whom President Trump named to lead federal preparations — “to order the
C.D.C. to develop a rapid point of care test” that hospitals could use
to screen patients.

In the meantime, Mr. Raske said, the Wadsworth Center, New York’s public
health reference laboratory, should be certified to do these tests.

If more community-acquired infections turn up, and the disease cannot be
contained, the strategy will have to become one of mitigation, said Dr.
Neil Fishman, associate chief medical officer for the University of
Pennsylvania Health System.

“That’s a little difficult to do when you don’t have a readily available
test, and when the turnaround time for the test can be days instead of
hours,” he said.

Thomas Fuller contributed reporting from Solano County, Calif., Nicholas
Bogel-Burroughs from New York and Michael D. Shear from Washington, D.C.
