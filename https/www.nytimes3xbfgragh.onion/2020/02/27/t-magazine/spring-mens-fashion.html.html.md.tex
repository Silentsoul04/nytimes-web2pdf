Off-Road}\label{spring-fashion-classic-tailoring-goes-off-road}}

Polished men's wear --- from spare suiting to colorful trench coats ---
gets remade with the rebellious spirit of motocross.

Earlier this year, the designer Virgil Abloh --- a hallowed name in
streetwear who was appointed artistic director of Louis Vuitton's men's
line in 2018 --- tried something new (for him): suiting. Down the
fashion house's fall 2020 men's runway came elegant overcoats and
shorter jackets pieced together from puzzle-like segments; the models
wove through oversize props, like a pair of scissors, a pencil and a
spool of thread, as if Abloh hoped to animate the very craft that
brought those garments out of his atelier. Throughout the fashion world,
men's tailoring is anything but stuffy or staid these days, despite its
sometimes conservative reputation. In checks and tartans, it can be

with soft, boxy silhouettes, it can be
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/10/t-magazine/mens-fall-fashion.html}{easy};
and --- paired with transparent blouses, ruffle details and velvet trim
**** --- it can
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/05/t-magazine/fall-fashion-androgyny.html}{subvert
gender lines}. Or, as the stylist Jacob K and the photographer
Kristin-Lee Moolman propose here, when paired with motocross gloves,
jerseys and socks (and perhaps even an actual motorbike), it can be
sporty and rebellious.
