# When Is Super Tuesday and What Is It Exactly?

</div>

Super Tuesday is Tuesday, March 3. It is the most important day on the
Democratic primary calendar because there are so many delegates up for
grabs.

When exactly is [Super
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/super-tuesday),
what makes it so “Super” and how did we even get to a place where we
have a day with that title?

Here’s what you need to know:

## When is Super Tuesday?

Tuesday, March 3.

## What is Super Tuesday?

Super Tuesday is the closest thing we have to a national primary. On
March 3, 14 states will hold primaries, as will Democrats Abroad. The
American Samoa Democratic caucuses are also set to take place.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of the states that will vote on Super Tuesday, like California and
Texas, have enormous troves of delegates available for the taking. (For
a full list of states that will vote that day, you can view [our 2020
election
calendar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html).)
All together, there will be 1,357 delegates to the national convention
at stake — about a third of the total available — and the most offered
up on any single day of the primary.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And if you add the 155 delegates allocated from the early voting states
— Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — by the time Super
Tuesday has ended, almost 40 percent of the total delegate allocation
will be spoken
for.

If one candidate opens a wide delegate lead, it could prove
mathematically difficult for others to climb back into contention. As
such, what happens on Super Tuesday could very well decide the race — or
come very close to doing so. At the very least, the results that come
out of Super Tuesday could winnow the field.

For a specific look at what is at stake for each major candidate on
Super Tuesday, have a look at our handy guide.

## How did we get a ‘Super Tuesday?’

If you look at our [presidential primary election
calendar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html),
you’ll notice that several of the Democratic primary contests are being
held on Tuesdays. Technically speaking, we vote in presidential general
elections on that day of the week in November because of [a law that
dates back to
the 1800s](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-2/c28s2ch1.pdf).
And the reason that we settled on Tuesday had to do with the fact that
at the time, America was mostly a religious and agrarian society.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sundays were a day of rest and worship and were therefore not good for
voting. Wednesdays were often market day — the day for selling crops.
And for many farmers, voting in town required travel time, so Mondays
and Thursdays would not work. Thus Tuesdays ended up being one of the
best and only options.

“Super Tuesday,” however, is a fairly recent political development. [Our
archives contain a reference to “super-Tuesday” as early
as 1976](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1976/05/09/76390315.html?pageNumber=136),
in a political article that seems to suggest that at least three states
voted in the Democratic primary that year on June 8. [Later
articles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1982/05/02/magazine/the-party-that-lost-its-way.html)
refer to a “Super Tuesday” in the Democratic primary of 1980, when on
June 3, eight states voted. [One article explained its genesis this
way](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1983/06/17/us/briefing-will-tuesday-be-super.html):

> In 1980, Carter-Mondale campaign strategists, wanting to give
> President Carter a chance to make a quick rebound should he lose the
> New Hampshire primary to his Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M.
> Kennedy, arranged to move up the dates of three Southern state
> primaries to one week behind the New Hampshire contest. Thus “Super
> Tuesday” was created in the South, with voters in Georgia, Alabama and
> Florida expressing their Presidential preference the same day.

But what several articles call the “first” official Super Tuesday came
on March 13, 1984, [when nine
states](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1984/03/14/052064.html?pageNumber=37)
— Washington, Nevada, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Alabama, Georgia and Florida — American Samoa and Democrats abroad all
voted. It was “the largest single harvest of convention delegates of the
campaign,” [The Times
noted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1984/03/14/us/hart-takes-massachusetts-florida-and-rhode-island-mondale-is-strong-in-south.html),
adding that 511 delegates were at stake.

That delegate trove would continue to grow over the years in a tradition
that would persist.
