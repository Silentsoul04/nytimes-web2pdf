# Pence Will Control All Coronavirus Messaging From Health Officials

The White House’s attempt to impose a more disciplined approach to

WASHINGTON — The White House moved on Thursday to tighten control of
coronavirus messaging by government health officials and scientists,
directing them to coordinate all statements and public appearances with
the office of Vice President Mike Pence, according to several officials
familiar with the new approach.

But on a day that the White House sought to display a more disciplined
strategy to the administration’s communications about the virus, Mr.
Trump used an evening event honoring African-American History Month to
rail against the news media, claiming it is overstating the threat, and
to congratulate himself for keeping the number of cases low.

“I think it’s an incredible achievement what our country’s done,” Mr.
Trump said, noting that he had moved quickly [to ban travel from
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html)
after the emergence of the virus. Even though a total of 60 people
infected with the coronavirus are in the United States, he ignored all
but the 15 who did not initially contract it overseas.

“Fifteen people is almost, I would say, a miracle,” the president
bragged.

The comments came just a few hours after Mr. Pence convened a meeting of
the coronavirus task force composed of some of the nation’s top public
health officials. The vice president made it clear that they would
report to him.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m leading the task force,” Mr. Pence told reporters at the Department
of Health and Human Services, even as he promised to rely on the
guidance of experts.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump announced Wednesday evening that Mr. Pence [would coordinate
the government’s
response](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html)
to the public health threat while playing down the immediate danger from
the virus that is [spreading rapidly across the
globe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps.html).

Officials insist Mr. Pence’s goal is not to control what experts and
other officials say, but to make sure their efforts are coordinated,
after days of confusion with various administration officials making
contradictory statements on television.

But the attempt to demonstrate a unified administration voice was
undercut early in the day, when Mr. Pence said that he had selected Dr.
[Deborah L.
Birx](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-deborah-birx.html),
the director of the United States effort to combat H.I.V. and AIDS, to
serve as the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House,
enlisting an experienced scientist and physician to address the
potential spread of the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The announcements of the roles of the vice president and Dr. Birx were
intended to show that Mr. Trump and those around him are taking
seriously the potential threat to the health of Americans. Aides said
the president wanted governors and members of Congress to have a single
point person to communicate with, eliminating any jockeying for power in
a decentralized
situation.

But Dr. Birx is now the third person to have been designated as the
administration’s primary coronavirus official, along with Mr. Pence and
Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services.

Mr. Trump said Wednesday that “Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike
will report back to me.” Mr. Pence said it would be Dr. Birx. Mr. Azar,
for his part, remains the chairman of the government’s coronavirus task
force.

The vice president’s move to control the messaging about coronavirus
appeared to be aimed at preventing the kind of conflicting statements
that have plagued the administration’s response.

The latest instance occurred Thursday evening, when the president said
that the virus could get worse or better in the days and weeks ahead,
but that nobody knows, contradicting Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the
country’s leading experts on viruses and the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

At the meeting with Mr. Pence on Thursday, Dr. Fauci described the
seriousness of the public health threat facing Americans, saying that
“this virus has adapted extremely well to human species” and noting
that it appeared to have a higher mortality rate than influenza.

The new White House approach came as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention acknowledged Thursday that a California woman with
coronavirus was [made to wait days before she was
tested](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/health/coronavirus-testing-california.html)
for an infection because of the agency’s restrictive criteria.

And despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to calm jittery investors, stock markets
plunged again Thursday. The S\&P 500 fell 4.4 percent, the worst
single-day slide for the market since August 2011 and leaving it 10
percent lower than it was a week earlier.

The president’s decision to appoint Mr. Pence to lead the coronavirus
response came after several days in which his aides grappled with
whether to name a “coronavirus czar.”

Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was pleased with Mr. Azar’s
performance, calling the team that he has led “totally brilliant.” But
White House aides, led by Mick Mulvaney, the president’s acting chief of
staff, had debated for days whether the administration needed a point
person to be the face of the
response.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The decision to put Mr. Pence in charge was made on Wednesday after the
president told some people that the vice president did not “have
anything else to do,” according to people familiar with Mr. Trump’s
comments.

Dr. Birx has spent more than three decades working on H.I.V./AIDS
immunology, vaccine research and global health, according to the White
House, which said in a statement that she would “bring her infectious
disease, immunologic, vaccine research and interagency coordinating
capacity to this position.”

The president’s selection of Mr. Pence — and the decision to name Dr.
Birx as the coordinator for the response — further erodes Mr. Azar’s
traditional role as the nation’s top health official in charge of
directing the government’s response to a medical crisis. Mr. Trump has
told people that he considers Mr. Azar to be too “alarmist” about the
virus.

Mr. Azar denied reports that he had not been consulted about the
decision to bring in Mr. Pence before the president’s announcement
Wednesday evening. He told lawmakers on Thursday during a House Ways and
Means Committee hearing that when he was informed of Mr. Pence’s
selection, “I said, quote, ‘that’s
genius.’”

Officials also announced that Mr. Pence was expanding the coronavirus
task force to include “key administration officials,” including Dr.
Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, as well as the president’s top two
economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic
Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. The task force is
made up of more than a dozen top administration officials and cabinet
secretaries.

An administration official said Thursday night that Mr. Pence had
discussed the coronavirus with several governors, including Andrew
Cuomo, Democrat of New York; Greg Abbott, Republican of Texas; Larry
Hogan, Republican of Maryland; Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska;
Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington; and Gavin Newsom, Democrat of
California.

The decision to bring in Mr. Pence was not without controversy.

Critics of the vice president pointed to Mr. Pence’s record on public
health when he was the governor of Indiana as evidence that he was not
the right person to lead the government’s response to a health crisis.
Democrats noted that Mr. Pence was blamed for [aggravating a severe AIDS
outbreak](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/06/us/rural-indiana-struggles-to-contend-with-hiv-outbreak.html)
among intravenous drug users when he opposed calls for a clean needle
exchange program on the grounds it would encourage more drug use.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that she had told Mr. Pence directly
that she questioned his new role given that as governor, he had
“slashed” the public health budget in Indiana.

“I spoke with the vice president this morning, made some of these
concerns known to him,” she said. “We have always had a very candid
relationship and I expressed to him the concern that I had of his being
in this position.”
