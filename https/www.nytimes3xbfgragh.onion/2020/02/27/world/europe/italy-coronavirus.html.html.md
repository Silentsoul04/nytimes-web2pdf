MILAN — On the sixth floor of a skyscraper, two dozen epidemiologists
and public health experts form the nerve center of the effort to contain
[a coronavirus
outbreak](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/world/coronavirus-news.html)
in Italy that has alarmed Europe and put the wealthy Lombardy region at
the center of global concern.

They work the phones, pore over digital maps and study computer screens.
They update databases with confirmed cases. They track those whom
infected people might have had contact with. They coordinate with
hospitals and laboratories to verify test results, sometimes for people
with no symptoms.

But their efforts have also fueled a political and scientific quarrel
that may prove important to how Italy and other countries confront the
virus: How much is too much when it comes to containment efforts?

It’s not every day that Italy is accused of being overly efficient, but
[Lombardy’s
response](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/24/world/europe/24coronavirus-milan-italy.html)
has, unusually, been criticized for its vigor at a time when most
governments are worried about being accused of doing too little.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Much of that criticism has come from rival Italian officials at the
national level, no doubt concerned about Italy’s blighted image — and
their own — as the number of cases in the country has spiked to 650,
with 17 deaths.

Cases possibly linked to Lombardy have appeared in Austria, Switzerland,
and [the Canary
Islands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/25/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-hotel-canary.html)
of Spain, adding to the impression that the region is the European
source in a new stage of global contagion.

*\[Read:* [*‘The face of the coronavirus’: A Hong Kong student shunned
in
Italy*](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-italy-racism.html)*.\]*

“Italy is a safe place,’’ [Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/29/world/europe/italy-conte-government-salvini.html),
a rival of Lombardy politicians who has himself faced intense criticism
for the government’s handling of the virus, asserted defensively this
week, “maybe safer than others.”

There is no doubt that Italy is confronting a significant outbreak. But
beneath the political squabbling is a deeper dispute over whether
Lombardy’s response has made the problem appear worse than it is.

With coronavirus spreading more widely, political leaders across the
world are coming under greater pressure, with many trying to tamp down
anxiety that is damaging stock markets, tourism and businesses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some leaders are lashing out. On Wednesday, President Trump [accused
journalists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html)
of making the situation “look as bad as possible.”

As a result, the dispute in Lombardy has taken on dimensions in
politics, epidemiology and crisis communications that are likely to have
consequences in any broader outbreak.

At its heart, the debate centers on testing.

The central government argues that other regions within Italy and other
countries have respected global guidelines by focusing tests on people
showing symptoms of the
virus.

But according to the Health Ministry, Lombardy has also carried out swab
tests on people who are more likely to have come into contact with
infected people, even if they have no symptoms themselves.

Experts at the World Health Organization and Italy’s Health Ministry
said in interviews that it was possible that Lombardy had created an
inflated perception of the threat by including in case totals people who
tested positive for the virus but who had not gotten sick. But many
scientists say that attempting to track even mild cases of the virus is
essential to containing its spread.

On Thursday, after insisting that their comprehensive approach to
testing was the right one, Lombardy said it would now conform with
national and international guidelines and test only people showing
symptoms.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the numbers tallied in Lombardy’s approach have already made Italy a
focus of international concern.

Not everyone who contracts the virus gets sick, a fact that is proving a
quandary for scientists and officials trying to formulate a measured
response.

Walter Ricciardi, an Italian member of the executive council of the
World Health Organization who was recently named councilor of the
Italian Health Ministry, said that only a small percentage of people who
contracted the virus were infected by people showing no symptoms who did
not know they were carriers, he said.

Richard Pebody, another expert at the World Health Organization, said
the organization did not consider [asymptomatic
transmission](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic.html?algo=top_conversion&fellback=false&imp_id=190061349&imp_id=162979776&action=click&module=Most%20Popular&pgtype=Homepage)
a significant factor in the outbreak.

But as the epidemic spreads uncertainty is growing. Other experts have
raised concerns that carriers without symptoms could be spreading the
virus, and the W.H.O. was under pressure to revise its guidelines, which
it was expected to do on Thursday.

The Italian Health Ministry said that counting asymptomatic cases only
served to cause
alarm.

Of the 650 cases diagnosed in Italy, 403 were in Lombardy, according to
regional officials. Of those cases, Lombardy officials said on Thursday,
216 had been treated in a hospital, with 41 requiring intensive care.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That means that 187 of those who tested positive for the virus exhibited
only mild symptoms or none at all. In addition, at least 37 of those who
did are now healthy and have been discharged.

But other top Italian medical officials warned that while it was
possible that asymptomatic people might be less contagious, because, for
instance, they cough less, very little is known about the new virus and
how it behaves.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“Evidence is lacking,” said Giovanni Rezza, the head of epidemiology at
the leading scientific organization of Italy’s National Health Service.

Lombardy officials said they preferred to know who had the virus.

“Either you hide problems under a carpet, or you lift the carpet and you
clean the floor,” Attilio Fontana, the region’s president, said in an
interview in his office, with views over a foggy and eerily quiet Milan,
29 floors above the virus hunters.

Mr. Fontana is a leading member of the League party, led by the
nationalist [Matteo
Salvini](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/26/world/europe/italy-election-Salvini.html),
who has not been shy about leveraging the crisis to pursue his aim of
bringing down Mr. Conte’s government. Mr. Salvini has argued in recent
days that Mr. Conte had fumbled the response to the crisis and needed to
be replaced.

Mr. Fontana said he disagreed with Mr. Conte’s “way of dealing with the
crisis.” The region’s tests were necessary, he argued, suggesting that
if other places tested as rigorously, they would find more cases, too.

“I don’t exclude that even in your country if they did a serious and
attentive epidemiologic analysis they would find more than what the
actual infected are,” he said, referring to the United States. Numbers
were high in Italy, he added, “because we do a lot of
checks.”

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control is currently

traveled to China or had contact with someone who tested positive for
the virus.

The uncertainty surrounding the virus has opened fertile ground for
political sniping, as politicians engaged in power struggles to shift
blame.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an

        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with

Mr. Conte, the prime minister, had questioned Lombardy’s approach in an
effort to project a sense of control.

He infuriated regional officials by blaming a Lombardy hospital for the
virus’s spread and saying on Tuesday that “exaggerated’’ swab tests
‘‘would end up dramatizing the emergency.”

Lombardy officials had defended their methods.

“We don’t understand what he is talking about,” Mr. Fontana said.

In turn, he criticized Mr. Conte, saying that the prime minister should
have listened to a proposal, made in early February, that schoolchildren
returning from China stay at home for 14 days.

“They told us it was a racist behavior and they did not want to put in
place this little precaution,” Mr. Fontana said.

Experts have speculated that the coronavirus outbreak in Lombardy could
be attributed to the [region’s close business ties with
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/24/world/europe/24coronavirus-milan-italy.html)
or its densely packed population.

In search of Italy’s “patient zero,” Mr. Fontana said officials were
pursuing “an Italian citizen with Chinese origins” who visited China
around January.

He said that person then came into contact with someone who then “went
to Codogno” — one of the Lombardy towns on lockdown. That second person
is thought to have had contact with a 38-year-old Italian man, who
remains in intensive
care.

In Milan’s central train station this week, people were eager to leave
the city.

Donatella Monti and her children waited for a train back to Rome, all of
them wearing masks bought in a hardware store.

Ms. Monti said that many in Lombardy seemed unfazed by the outbreak, but
that her pediatrician back south advised her to keep her young daughter
away from school for 10 days. “I’ll go to school with my mask on\!” her
daughter protested.

In Mr. Fontana’s office, his aides quipped that the masks “didn’t do a
thing” to stop the virus and that the Milanese only wore masks during
carnival.

But late Wednesday, Mr. Fontana [posted a video on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/fontanaufficiale/videos/191575302125882/)
in which he explained that one of his aides had tested positive for the
virus.

The governor said that he himself had tested negative, but that he would
nonetheless “live in a sort of auto isolation” for the next two weeks,
avoiding public events and news conferences and wearing a mask in the
office.

“So when you see me in the coming days, I will be like this,” he said,
pulling a green mask over his face. “Don’t be scared. It’s always
me.”
