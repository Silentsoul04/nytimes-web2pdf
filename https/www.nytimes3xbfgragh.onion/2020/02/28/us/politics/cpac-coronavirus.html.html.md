WASHINGTON — President Trump complained on Friday that Democrats and the
news media were trying to scare Americans about the coronavirus to score
political points against him but asserted that the outbreak had been
relatively limited because of his action to stem infections.

“They’re doing everything they can to instill fear in people, and I
think it’s ridiculous,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to CNN and
other news outlets. “And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it
should be done, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by
saying a lot of untruths.”

Speaking on the White House lawn before heading to South Carolina for a
campaign rally, the president said the spread of the virus had been
limited in the United States because of his order limiting travel from
China.

“We haven’t lost anybody yet, and hopefully we can keep that intact,” he
said. “There’ve been no deaths in the United States at all. A lot of
that’s attributable to the fact that we closed the border very early.
Otherwise it could be a very different story.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Some people are giving us credit for that and some people aren’t,” Mr.

political. It’s
politics.”

Addressing the tumbling stock markets barely a half-hour after they
finished their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, the president
attributed investor unease to uncertainty about the virus but also fear
of Democratic presidential candidates. “After we win, you’ll see a rise
in the stock market like you haven’t seen before,” he said.

Mr. Trump spoke hours after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief
of staff, likewise blamed the news media for exaggerating the
seriousness of coronavirus because “they think this will bring down the
president, that’s what this is all about.”

Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual
gathering of conservative activists, Mr. Mulvaney played down concerns
about the virus that is [spreading around the
globe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
and
[panicking](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html)
investors.

Mr. Mulvaney said the administration took “extraordinary steps four or
five weeks ago,” to prevent the spread of the virus when it declared a
rare public health emergency and [barred entry by most foreign citizens
who had recently visited
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Why didn’t you hear about it?” Mr. Mulvaney said of travel restrictions
that were

[covered](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-reports-first-coronavirus-cases-as-china-allies-limit-ties-11580467046)
in the

[media](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51338899). “What was still going
on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that’s all the press wanted to
talk about.”

The news media has been covering the global spread of coronavirus [for
months](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/world/coronavirus-timeline.html).

But Mr. Mulvaney claimed that the news media was too preoccupied
covering impeachment, he said, “because they thought it would bring down
the president.”

The media’s focus switched to the coronavirus for the same reason, he
continued.

“The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they
think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” he
added. “That’s what this is all about it.”

Following [the president’s
lead](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1233256774964273152),
Mr. Mulvaney also brushed off concerns over the virus; there have been
60 cases identified in the United
States.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“The flu kills people,” he said. “This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS, it’s
not MERS. It’s not a death sentence, it’s not the same as the Ebola
crisis.”

Mr. Mulvaney also criticized the news media for generally not wanting to
portray Mr. Trump in a positive light. But he chose a bizarre example,
claiming it refuses to cover what he described as Mr. Trump’s loving
relationship with his 13-year-old son, Barron.

He said Mr. Trump is in frequent contact with his youngest son, calling
to check in on him and let him know of his whereabouts. But, Mr.
Mulvaney said, “the press would never show you that because it doesn’t
fit that image of him, the press wants him to be this terrible monster.”

Mr. Mulvaney’s decision to discuss Barron Trump was curious, especially
when Melania Trump, the first lady, and senior White House officials
have gone to great lengths to make sure he enjoys the privacy afforded
to other children of presidents growing up in the uncomfortable
spotlight of the White House. The White House press corps has generally
agreed to grant Barron Trump the same privacy.

“He’s huge, but he’s still very young,” Mr. Mulvaney said of Barron, who
is sometimes seen boarding Air Force One with his parents, but who often
departs the plane after his father to avoid being photographed. “He was
10 or something like that when the president was elected.”

Mr. Mulvaney, who was interviewed onstage by Stephen Moore, whose
expected [nomination by the president to the Federal Reserve Board was
withdrawn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/02/business/stephen-moore-fed.html)
over concerns about his treatment of women, also asserted that Mr. Trump
did not sleep on the overnight plane trip home from India or during the
day before his news conference on coronavirus Wednesday night.

“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it
as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.
