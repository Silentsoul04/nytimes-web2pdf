The president seeks to reassure the public while blaming the media and
Democrats for trying to score points by exaggerating the threat of the
outbreak.

WASHINGTON --- President Trump complained on Friday that Democrats and
the news media were trying to scare Americans about the coronavirus to
score political points against him but asserted that the outbreak had
been relatively limited because of his action to stem infections.

``They're doing everything they can to instill fear in people, and I
think it's ridiculous,'' Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to CNN and
other news outlets. ``And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it
should be done, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by
saying a lot of untruths.''

Speaking on the White House lawn before heading to South Carolina for a
campaign rally, the president said the spread of the virus had been
limited in the United States because of his order limiting travel from
China.

``We haven't lost anybody yet, and hopefully we can keep that intact,''
he said. ``There've been no deaths in the United States at all. A lot of
that's attributable to the fact that we closed the border very early.
Otherwise it could be a very different story.''

``Some people are giving us credit for that and some people aren't,''
Mr. Trump added. ``But the only ones who aren't, they don't mean it.
It's political. It's politics.''

Addressing the tumbling stock markets barely a half-hour after they
finished their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, the president
attributed investor unease to uncertainty about the virus but also fear
of Democratic presidential candidates. ``After we win, you'll see a rise
in the stock market like you haven't seen before,'' he said.

Mr. Trump spoke hours after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief
of staff, likewise blamed the news media for exaggerating the
seriousness of coronavirus because ``they think this will bring down the
president, that's what this is all about.''

Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual
gathering of conservative activists, Mr. Mulvaney played down concerns
about the virus that is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{spreading
around the globe} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html}{panicking}
investors.

Mr. Mulvaney said the administration took ``extraordinary steps four or
five weeks ago,'' to prevent the spread of the virus when it declared a
rare public health emergency and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html}{barred
entry by most foreign citizens who had recently visited China}.

``Why didn't you hear about it?'' Mr. Mulvaney said of travel
restrictions that were
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/01/31/trump-weighs-tighter-china-travel-restrictions-response-coronavirus/}{widely}
\href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-reports-first-coronavirus-cases-as-china-allies-limit-ties-11580467046}{covered}
in the
\href{https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-31/white-house-orders-health-emergency-over-coronavirus}{news}
\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51338899}{media}. ``What was still
going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that's all the press
wanted to talk about.''

The news media has been covering the global spread of coronavirus
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/world/coronavirus-timeline.html}{for
months}.

But Mr. Mulvaney claimed that the news media was too preoccupied
covering impeachment, he said, ``because they thought it would bring
down the president.''

The media's focus switched to the coronavirus for the same reason, he
continued.

``The reason you're seeing so much attention to it today is that they
think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,'' he
added. ``That's what this is all about it.''

Following
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1233256774964273152}{the
president's lead}, Mr. Mulvaney also brushed off concerns over the
virus; there have been 60 cases identified in the United States.

    its recommendation of six feet} on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

``The flu kills people,'' he said. ``This is not Ebola. It's not SARS,
it's not MERS. It's not a death sentence, it's not the same as the Ebola
crisis.''

Mr. Mulvaney also criticized the news media for generally not wanting to
portray Mr. Trump in a positive light. But he chose a bizarre example,
claiming it refuses to cover what he described as Mr. Trump's loving
relationship with his 13-year-old son, Barron.

He said Mr. Trump is in frequent contact with his youngest son, calling
to check in on him and let him know of his whereabouts. But, Mr.
Mulvaney said, ``the press would never show you that because it doesn't
fit that image of him, the press wants him to be this terrible
monster.''

Mr. Mulvaney's decision to discuss Barron Trump was curious, especially
when Melania Trump, the first lady, and senior White House officials
have gone to great lengths to make sure he enjoys the privacy afforded
to other children of presidents growing up in the uncomfortable
spotlight of the White House. The White House press corps has generally
agreed to grant Barron Trump the same privacy.

``He's huge, but he's still very young,'' Mr. Mulvaney said of Barron,
who is sometimes seen boarding Air Force One with his parents, but who
often departs the plane after his father to avoid being photographed.
``He was 10 or something like that when the president was elected.''

Mr. Mulvaney, who was interviewed onstage by Stephen Moore, whose
expected
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/02/business/stephen-moore-fed.html}{nomination
by the president to the Federal Reserve Board was withdrawn} over
concerns about his treatment of women, also asserted that Mr. Trump did
not sleep on the overnight plane trip home from India or during the day
before his news conference on coronavirus Wednesday night.

``He said, `I've only got eight years, I'm going to get as much out of
it as I can,''' Mr. Mulvaney said.
