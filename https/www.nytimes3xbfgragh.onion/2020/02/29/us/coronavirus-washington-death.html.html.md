SEATTLE — Concerns about the coronavirus intensified across the Pacific
Northwest on Saturday, after a person from the Seattle area died and as
two new cases emerged inside a nursing care center in Kirkland, Wash.,
where dozens of other people were reported to be feeling sick.

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington declared a state of emergency, and said
officials were considering canceling sporting events, closing schools
and taking any other steps needed to slow the spread of the virus. “If —
and this is a big if — there is a social distancing strategy that
becomes necessary, the emergency declaration would give us some legal
authority,” Mr. Inslee said.

At two schools that have had ties to cases, in Oregon and in Washington,
officials announced that they were shuttering buildings for several
days, and ordering deep cleanings.

And in Kirkland, where a health care worker in her 40s at the Life Care
Center, a long-term nursing home, and a resident of the center, in her
70s, were reported on Saturday to have tested positive for the virus,
health officials expressed alarm at the possibility of more cases. Among
288 residents and workers at Life Care, more than 50 people — 25 health
workers and 27 residents — have shown symptoms of respiratory illness or
have been hospitalized for pneumonia, local health officials said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are
many older people,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Public
Health in Seattle and King County. A team of federal health workers was
dispatched to Kirkland to assist local workers, and many more
coronavirus tests were expected to be conducted in the coming days.

Older people are much more likely to face serious illness if infected
with the coronavirus. They are also much more likely to die. An
[analysis of Chinese
patients](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130)
found that nearly 15 percent of infected people over age 80 died; of
those in their 70s, 8 percent
died.

On Saturday afternoon, workers in plastic protective gear and masks
could be seen rolling a patient, also in a mask, to an ambulance outside
the nursing home, a low slung building on a side street tucked among
small condo complexes, and surrounded by pine trees. Officials said that
testing for the virus was being conducted at an area hospital, and that
it was not open for visits from patients’ family members or vendors as a
precaution.

Nancy Butner, the northwest divisional vice president for Life Care
Centers of America, said that many of the residents were showing only
respiratory symptoms that were not necessarily tied to the coronavirus.
In an interview, she said that residents were mostly staying in their
rooms, and that despite public health officials’ warnings of a possible
“outbreak” at the nursing home, the mood inside was relaxed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are encouraging people to remain in their rooms,” she said. “We have
the equipment and supplies to take care of them, and people are doing
what they need to do.”

Chad Bergevin, who lives opposite the center, said he had learned of the
situation in a text message from a neighbor. “It was like, ‘Wow, this is
literally less than a football field away from my house,’” he said,
adding that he was surprised to see people still seeming to come and go
near the center. “I’m sorry, if it were me, I’d have the place on
lockdown,” he said.

The indications of a possible spread, and the involvement of a nursing
home marked a new, urgent phase in the response to the virus in the
United States, where 70 cases have been reported, and until Saturday,
none had been fatal. Most of the cases could be explained by overseas
travel or contact with someone who had been ill. This week, though, new
cases, [in California, Oregon and
Washington](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/28/us/coronavirus-solano-county.html),
were the first in the United States in which the cause was mysterious
and unknown — a sign, experts warned, that the virus, which has killed
more than 2,800 people worldwide and has sickened more than 86,000
others, might now be spreading in the United States.

In the Northwest, especially, health officials were putting in place new
precautions given the new cases. They were already discussing the
possibility that they might recommend cancellations of public events.
They began warning that life in the coming weeks may undergo dramatic
change.

By Saturday, 10 people have been treated in Washington State, including
the first case of coronavirus that was diagnosed in the United States, a
man in his 30s who had traveled in China and has since recovered;
several patients were treated at a Spokane area hospital after returning
from a cruise ship in Japan; and the first known coronavirus fatality in
the United States, a man in his 50s whose death was announced Saturday.

In announcing the death at a news conference, President Trump said the
victim was a “wonderful woman” in her 50s, but local officials later
said the patient had been a man in his 50s. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention later said that the patient was, in fact, a man,
and that the agency had incorrectly described the patient as a woman.

Few details were known about the man who died, except that he had
underlying health conditions and had been a patient at a hospital in
Kirkland. He was not known to have traveled abroad, or to have had
contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus, adding to
[growing signs that the coronavirus may be
spreading](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/28/us/coronavirus-solano-county.html)
in the United States. He also had no known connection to the nursing
home, officials said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new cases added to the fears of some residents. Noelle Salazar, an
author in Bothell, Wash., was recovering from a surgery, and realized
that she had been in the same hospital as the man who
died.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“We weren’t in the same section, but it’s not comforting,” she said
while recuperating at home. “I’m a little on edge right now for sure.”

Like many Americans, she has begun to take extra precautions in recent
days: She wiped down her shopping cart at a grocery store for the first
time, bought extra vitamins and nonperishable food and canceled a
Pilates class to avoid getting too close to others.

Around the region, it was clear that residents were bracing. At a
big-box store north of Seattle on early Saturday, checkout lines were
unusually long, snaking down aisles with carts loaded with all sorts of
supplies.

In Oregon, a state that until Friday had not reported any cases of the
coronavirus, officials say an employee of Forest Hills Elementary School
in Lake Oswego, a suburb of Portland, appeared to have contracted the
virus more than a week ago. The school would be closed for several days,
and was being cleaned, but parents said they were uncertain and scared.

Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said that she expected more cases, and that
her state might take more aggressive action if the outbreak got more
severe. But, in the meantime, she said people did not need to take
drastic action.

“I’m wanting to convey to Oregonians, and frankly folks on the entire
West Coast: stay calm, continue on your daily lives and follow public
health precautions,” Ms. Brown said.

Dr. Dean Sidelinger, Oregon’s state health officer, said a broader
closure of schools was an option the state could pursue at some point.
“If we do notice spread in our community or multiple cases, that is
certainly something we would consider on a case-by-case basis,” Dr.
Sidelinger said.

Back at the school in Lake Oswego, parents were weighing how to go
forward.

“I really don’t know how to process it at this point,” said Danielle
Gaustad, a mother of three children, ages 3, 5 and 18. Her 5-year-old,
who attends Forest Hills Elementary, had pneumonia several weeks ago,
and her 3-year-old has severe asthma. “When people don’t understand an
illness, and clearly no one understands coronavirus at this point,
everybody gets scared,” Ms. Gaustad said.

Though the school has said it intends to reopen in a few days, Ms.
Gaustad said she would not allow her children to go back to school this
week. “I don’t know when I will, honestly,” she said. “It’s scary.”

Mike Baker reported from Seattle, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York
and Karen Weise from Kirkland, Wash. Knvul Sheikh contributed reporting
from New York, Claire Cain Miller from Lake Oswego, Ore., and Mitch
Smith from Chicago.
