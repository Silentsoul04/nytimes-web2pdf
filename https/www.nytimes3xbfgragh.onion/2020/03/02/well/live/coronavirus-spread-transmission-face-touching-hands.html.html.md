It’s a quirk of human nature that we touch our eyes, noses and mouths

Want to improve your chance of staying healthy? Stop touching your
face\!

One of the more difficult challenges in public health has been to teach
people to wash their hands frequently and to stop touching the facial
mucous membranes — the eyes, nose and mouth, all entry portals for the
new coronavirus and many other germs.

“Scratching the nose, rubbing your eyes, leaning on your chin and your
fingers go next to your mouth — there’s multiple ways we do it,” said
Dr. Nancy C. Elder, a professor of family medicine at Oregon Health and
Science University in Portland [who has studied face
touching](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808112) among doctors
and clinic staff members. “Everybody touches their face, and it’s a
difficult habit to break.”

As communities prepare for the spread of coronavirus around the globe,
the primary advice from health officials is for people to wash their
hands. But a number of health researchers say the public health message
also should include a more forceful warning about face touching.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The C.D.C. and W.H.O. still say something like ‘avoid' touching your
eyes, nose and mouth,” said Dr. William P. Sawyer, a family physician in
Sharonville, Ohio, and creator of
[HenrytheHand.com](https://www.henrythehand.com/), which promotes hand
and face hygiene. “The advice should be ‘absolutely do not touch them\!’
If you never touch your facial mucous membranes, you’re less likely to
be sick again from any viral respiratory infection.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To understand why hand hygiene and face touching can make a meaningful
difference during a pandemic, consider how a virus can spread. An
infected person rides in an elevator, touching buttons both outside and
inside the elevator or maybe sneezing during the ride. When that person
leaves, microscopic droplets containing the virus stay behind. The next
people who press the same buttons or touch a surface pick up the virus
on their hands, then scratch their noses or rub their eyes.

“Eyes, nose, mouth — all those mucous membranes are the portal into the
body for a virus like Covid-19 or SARS,” said Mary-Louise McLaws,
professor of epidemiology, health care infection and infectious diseases
control at the University of New South Wales in Sydney,
Australia.

**“**I was in a conference yesterday watching people, and in just about
two minutes I counted a dozen times that I saw someone touching mucous
membranes,” Dr. McLaws said. “It is a very common practice. We rub our
eyes, scratch our nose, touch our mouth — the general community needs to
be aware of how often they are touching their face.”

Dr. McLaws was the senior author of a [2015
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637115) on face touching
that documented the alarming number of times we do it. While medical
students attended a lecture, the researchers filmed them and counted the
number of times they touched any part of their faces. Over the course of
an hour, students touched their faces, on average, 23 times. Nearly half
of the touches were to the eyes, nose or mouth — what infectious disease
researchers call “the T-zone.”

“I was really surprised,” Dr. McLaws said. “By touching your mucous
membranes, you’re giving a virus 11 opportunities every hour if you’ve
touched something infectious.”

The risk of picking up a virus by hand-to-face contact depends on a
number of factors, including the type of virus, whether the surface was
nonporous, how long ago the virus was left behind, how much time the
infected person spent in the area and the temperature and humidity
levels.

The [World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)
notes that while we don’t know how long the new coronavirus survives on
surfaces, it seems to behave like other coronaviruses — which is
unsettling news. A recent study from the [Journal of Hospital
Infection](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701\(20\)30046-3/fulltext)
found that similar coronaviruses have been shown to survive on surfaces
for as long as nine days under ideal conditions. That’s far longer than
the flu virus, which typically can survive under ideal conditions only
up to [24 hours on hard
surfaces](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/infections/how-long-do-bacteria-and-viruses-live-outside-the-body/).
[Public Health
England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings)
says that, based on studies of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS,
“the risk of picking up a live virus from a contaminated surface”
under real-life conditions “is likely to be reduced significantly after
72 hours.”

In general, a virus will survive the longest on nonporous surfaces made
of metal and plastics — including door knobs, counters and railings. A
virus will die sooner on fabrics or tissues. Once on your hand, a virus
begins to lose potency, but it will probably live long enough for you to
touch your face. Although more study is needed of coronavirus, [in one
study of rhinovirus,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1658033) which
causes the common cold, a small dose of virus was placed on a
participant’s finger. An hour later, about 40 percent of the virus was
still viable. After three hours, 16 percent could still be
detected.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

We also know from the 2003 epidemic of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus
than the one currently spreading, that the virus was often transmitted
from surface contact. In one Hong Kong hotel, an [infected
doctor](https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/) who checked into his
room on the ninth floor before going to the hospital for treatment left
a trail of virus that infected at least seven people who also had rooms
on the ninth floor, who then went on to spread the disease elsewhere.
The doctor, who died from the infection, was later identified as a
“super spreader” [linked to
about 4,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/hong-kong-hotel-hosted-super-spreader-in-the-2003-sars-outbreak.html)cases
of SARS that occurred during the epidemic.

The good news is that frequent hand washing can make a meaningful
difference in lowering your risk. During the SARS epidemic, hand-washing
reduced the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent. But after washing
your hands, you must still be mindful about face touching, Dr. Sawyer
said.

“Your hands are only clean until the next surface you touch,” he said.
“When you reach for the door knob or hand railing, you’ve
recontaminated your hand with something. If you touch your mucous
membranes, then you could inoculate yourself inadvertently with that
organism. If there is one behavior change that could prevent infection,
it’s do not touch your T-zone.”

But it’s not easy to stop face touching. In fact, many people say that
the more they think about it, the more their eyes twitch and their nose
itches. [A number of
memes](https://mashable.com/article/coronavirus-prevention-dont-touch-your-face/)
have emerged on social media from people who say that ever since the
warnings about coronavirus, they can’t stop touching their own faces.

Only [humans and a few
primates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6427652) (gorillas,
orangutans and chimpanzees) are known to touch their faces with little
or no awareness of the habit. (Most animals touch their faces only to
groom or swat away a pest.) [German
researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530432) analyzed the
brain’s electrical activity before and after spontaneous face touching,
and their findings suggested that we touch our faces as a way to relieve
stress and manage our emotions.

To break the face-touching habit, try using a tissue if you need to
scratch your nose or rub your eyes. Wearing makeup may reduce face
touching, since it may make you more mindful of not smudging it. [One
study](https://search.proquest.com/openview/e2c136dc5c05115cdf9e55cb5133bc46/1?cbl=2040555&amp;pq-origsite=gscholar)
found that women touched their faces far less when they wore makeup.
Another solution: Try to identify triggers for face touching, like dry
skin or itchy eyes, and use moisturizers or eye drops to treat those
conditions so you are less likely to rub or scratch your face.

It also may help to wear glasses to create a barrier to touching your
eyes. Gloves or mittens can also make you more mindful of not touching
your face (and can make it more difficult to put your finger in your
nose or your eye). Although gloves, too, can become contaminated,
viruses don’t live as long on fabric or leather.

Given that face touching is a long-ingrained habit, it makes sense to
remain vigilant about frequent hand washing and wipe down your desk,
phones and community surfaces. Carry hand sanitizer and use it often.
The more mindful you are about regular hand washing, the more mindful
you will be about your hands and what they are touching.
