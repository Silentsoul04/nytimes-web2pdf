</div>

Robinhood remained down part of Tuesday as the markets bounced around,
leaving customers angry and nursing big
losses.

SAN FRANCISCO — Robinhood has become a Silicon Valley darling by
presenting itself as a tech-savvy alternative to traditional stock
trading platforms. But this week, with the [financial markets in
chaos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/business/stock-market-coronavirus.html),
the start-up’s technology failed at the most crucial moment.

On Monday and Tuesday, as global markets rebounded after a sell-off last
week and then sank again, Robinhood’s trading platform went offline,
leaving many customers to watch their portfolios drop in value without
being able to do anything about them.

[Robinhood has attracted millions of
millennials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html)
to trade on its platform, largely by eliminating trading fees and making
stock trading as easy as ordering food online. This week, many of those
same customers said they wanted to get their money out of Robinhood as
quickly as possible.

“For me, the moment they get up I am going to try to get out and switch
out to someone else,” said Robert Kaufman, 30, an information technology
worker in San Diego.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kaufman said he had put $900 in savings into Robinhood two weeks ago
when he opened an account. By trading risky options, he had increased
his portfolio to $2,600 last Friday. But on Monday, much of that
disappeared with Robinhood’s outage. Like many customers, Mr. Kaufman
said he could not reach the company; even emails to the support desk
bounced back undelivered.

By noon on Tuesday, trading appeared to be back up and running. “We
realize we let our customers down, and we’re committed to improving
their experience,” said Jack Randall, a spokesman for Robinhood. He said
the start-up would look at compensating customers on a case-by-case
basis.

Until this week, Robinhood, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., had
been regarded as one of the most successful financial technology
start-ups. The company had raised around $1 billion from venture capital
firms such as Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates, privately
valuing the start-up at around $7.6 billion, according to CB Insights.
The company does not charge trading fees, but it sells its customers’
trades to high-frequency trading firms, a practice known as payment for
order flow.

Robinhood’s lack of trading fees has roiled older competitors like
E-Trade and Charles Schwab, putting pressure on the brokerage industry.
In recent months, E-Trade announced that it was [selling itself to
Morgan
Stanley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/business/morgan-stanley-etrade.html)
and Schwab has said it will [buy TD
Ameritrade.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/25/business/dealbook/charles-schwab-td-ameritrade.html)

But many of those rivals have also copied Robinhood’s trademark move by
eliminating the fees charged when customers trade stocks and options.
This week, social media platforms like Reddit, where Robinhood customers
gather to discuss their trades, have been filled with people talking
about where they should move their money and whether they should file a
class-action lawsuit against the start-up.

“This is a huge black eye for them, and they really need to do something
to earn back the trust of their clients,” said Ben Carlson, the director
of institutional asset management at
[Ritholtz](https://ritholtzwealth.com/) Wealth Management in New York
and the author of the blog [A Wealth of Common
Sense](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/). “I can’t recall another time
when an entire platform was down all day like this.”

During the market turbulence, other trading firms that cater to small
investors have also experienced difficulties. The website for the mutual
fund giant Vanguard experienced “sporadic unavailability” on Friday
because of heavy trading volumes, a spokesman said. TD Ameritrade also
said trade confirmations were slow to process on Friday.  
  
But none were down as long as Robinhood, which has made it particularly
easy to buy and sell not only traditional stocks but also riskier
investment products like cryptocurrencies and options, a contract that
makes it possible to bet on stocks going up or down.

Many Robinhood customers nursing losses on Monday, when markets rose,
had bought options contracts to bet that the markets would fall. When
markets instead surged, they were unable to get out of the contracts
because the app was down.

Taylor Dalton, 29, said he had recently decided to invest roughly $8,000
in stocks and option contracts through Robinhood, including “put”
contracts on airline stocks, which would give him the opportunity to
profit if their shares declined.

“Yesterday, I had plans to close out all of my options and take a
profit,” said Mr. Dalton, who co-owns a cupcake and coffee bar
franchise. “Now I am in the red,” he added, referring to his gains that
have been erased, “and I am not sure what to do.”

As for Robinhood, he said, “I am definitely never using them again.”

Nathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, and Tara Siegel Bernard
from New York.
