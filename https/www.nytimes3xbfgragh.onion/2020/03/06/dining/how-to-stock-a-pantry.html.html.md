Having a [well-stocked
pantry](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/56-how-to-stock-a-modern-pantry)
is always a good idea, whether you’re looking to throw together pasta
with anchovies when there’s nothing in the fridge, or you want to avoid
going grocery shopping when the weather is vile.

It’s also true that a well-stocked pantry can provide a sense of safety
and control when the news is frightful and the future uncertain. Not
only can shelves filled with bags of rice, cans of beans and bins of
garlic give us a sense of order, they’re also the beginning of [many
excellent
meals](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/68861692-nyt-cooking/13993006-pantry-recipes).

The question is, what should you buy? Here are some of my personal
strategies for buying wisely and eating well.

**Pasta:** It’s nice to have both long, thin pasta (like spaghetti or
linguine) and short, textured pasta (like fusilli or orecchiette) on
hand. Having both keeps meals from getting repetitive. And if you’re a
boxed mac and cheese fan, stocking a couple of those is never a bad
idea.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Rice:** Brown, white, long-grain, short-grain, I always have them all
around, plus Arborio for rice pudding and risotto. (To make a perfect
pot of rice, check out our [How to Make
Rice](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/49-how-to-make-rice)
guide.)

**Stocks and Broths:** Whether meat- or vegetable-based, boxed broths
are essential for
[soups](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/40-how-to-make-soup),
stews, and make the base of pan sauces. And they won’t take up valuable
freezer space.

**Beans:** [Home-cooked dried
beans](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/21-how-to-cook-beans)
taste better than canned beans; canned beans are more convenient and
faster than the dried kind. It’s always good practice to have both.

**Cured Meats:** Cured meats keep for weeks in the fridge, and a chunk
of smoked ham or salami in your bean pot adds so much flavor. But don’t
forget the bacon.

*\[For more suggestions, check out our*[*How to Stock a Modern
Pantry*](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/56-how-to-stock-a-modern-pantry)
*guide.\]*

**Eggs:** They’re a welcome addition to so many dishes — and, of course,
stand on their own. Not to mention, they keep for a long time in the
fridge.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Frozen Fruits and Veggies:** Use the fruit in smoothies, and the
vegetables in soups, stir-fries and stews. I’m partial to frozen
spinach, artichokes, kale, corn, peas and lima beans. As for fruit, I
like blueberries, mixed berries, peach, mango and cherries. (I also like
to throw ripe bananas into the freezer, to extend their lives a little.)

**Canned Fish:** Anchovies, sardines, tuna and salmon are the building
blocks of many of my favorite meals. [Anchovy
toast](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9S6nDElI2B/) is a staple at my
house.

**Tahini and Peanut Butter:** For hummus, for sauces, for salad
dressing, for cookies, for sandwiches, for snacking. To mix things up,
try using peanut butter in your [salad
dressings](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1012747-peanut-noodles-with-shrimp),
and tahini on your jam sandwiches. Almond and cashew butters are also
great pantry additions, if you prefer.

**Parmesan and Other Hard Cheeses:** These kinds of cheeses last for
months in the fridge if you buy blocks rather than pre-grated. Or store
the pre-grated kind in the freezer. You can also buy some cheese sealed
in wax, which increases how long you can store them. Cream cheese is
also important, for bagels and otherwise.

**Olive Oil, Vinegar, Lemons:** I can’t cook without them.

**Nuts and Dried Fruit:** For snacking and baking.

**Flour, Sugar, Yeast**: For baking projects.

**Butter:** It will keep for weeks in the fridge and longer in the
freezer.

**Garlic, Onions and Shallots:** No pantry is complete without them.

**Root Vegetables:** Potatoes, sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, parsnips,
turnips, radishes. Radishes and turnips are excellent in salads and last
for weeks in the produce drawer. If they get soft, soak them in a bowl
of ice water until they firm up. Consider ginger for stir-fries and
making into tea.

**Celery:** Use the leaves as an herb and the stalks in salads. Or stuff
them with peanut butter or tahini for snacks.

**Scallions:** If you leave the roots on and put scallions in a
container of water on the counter, you can cut off the green tops, and
they will grow back three or four times. My mom taught me this trick.

**Spices:** If can’t remember when the last time you bought new spices
was, consider buying some the next time you’re at the store: Fresh
spices have so much more flavor than old ones.
