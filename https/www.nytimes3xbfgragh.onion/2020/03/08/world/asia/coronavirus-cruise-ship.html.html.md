# Failures on the Diamond Princess Shadow Another Cruise Ship Outbreak

</div>

An alert about a coronavirus infection sat in an unmonitored inbox. A
cruise doctor saw “no point” in disinfecting the ship. And Japan
disregarded medical guidelines to contain an outbreak.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The email to Princess Cruises was peppered with typos and awkward
grammar, but the warning was unmistakable. An 80-year-old passenger had
[tested positive for the new
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-is-coronavirus.html)
after getting off the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong.

“Would kindly inform the ship related parties and do the necessary
disinfection,” Princess’s port representative wrote on Feb. 1, relaying
a warning from Hong Kong health officials. “Many thanks\!”

Nothing happened. Princess says it believes the alert sat unread in
unmonitored inboxes. Grant Tarling, the company’s top doctor and the
person in charge of responding [to
outbreaks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cost.html),
said he hadn’t learned about the infection until the following day —
after being alerted to a post on social media.

The fumbled alert was just the beginning of [a broader
breakdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/17/world/asia/japan-cruise-ship-coronavirus.html)
by both the company and [the Japanese
authorities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-clusters.html)
who quarantined the ship in Yokohama. Hobbled by confusion and mistakes,
they played down the risk of infection, ignored best medical practice
for evacuating passengers, and activated only low-level protocols for
dealing with outbreaks. Ultimately, [eight people died and more than 700
were
infected,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/22/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html?searchResultPosition=3)
including some government officials.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, those failures have taken on fresh urgency as Princess and Dr.
Tarling deal with yet another coronavirus cluster, on [a cruise
ship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/california-coronavirus-cruise-ship.html)
that has been turned away from port in San Francisco. A passenger who
recently got off the cruise died of the virus last week, and 21 people
have since tested positive.

Thousands of passengers have been told to stay in their rooms as the
cruise company and the American authorities have scrambled to figure out
a plan. The ship is expected to dock in Oakland, Calif., on Monday and
passengers will be quarantined onshore.

In conversations onboard, passengers have been asking, “Will we become
another Diamond Princess?” said Bill Pearce, a 54-year-old from
Lafayette, Calif.

“Whatever’s the quickest way to get home, I’m all for it. I’d rather not
be on the ship,” he said. “Not being able to walk more than six feet in
any direction — it’s like being in a jail cell.”

The crisis on the Diamond Princess exposes the vulnerabilities in the
patchwork of international agreements, national laws and corporate
policies governing the health and safety of the $150 billion cruise
industry that carries 30 million passengers a year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the infection was confirmed, company officials incorrectly assumed
that the immediate risk was minimal because the sick passenger had
disembarked. Health authorities recommended action immediately. “We
advise thorough environmental cleansing and disinfection of the cruise,”
Albert Lam, an epidemiologist for the Hong Kong government, wrote to the
company on Feb. 2.

The company says it stepped up cleaning the next day. But it initiated
only the lowest-level protocols for outbreaks. “There’s no point in
going and start cleaning the ship when we really didn’t know what, if
any, risk there was onboard,” Dr. Tarling said in an interview.

When the Japanese authorities boarded the vessel, they, too, ignored
medical guidelines, by leaving potentially exposed passengers onboard
during testing rather than taking them ashore as recommended.

The Japanese government and company still disagree on who was — or
should have been — in charge. So the responsibilities for quarantining
nearly 2,700 passengers fell mostly to about 1,000 low-paid ship workers
who were given inadequate safety gear and guidance.

Dr. Tarling, the chief medical officer for Princess’s parent company,
Carnival Corporation, oversaw the response from California. He was
unaware of the working conditions onboard. He said crew members had
followed the protocols for a person “in quarantine or isolation in a
hospital.”

In reality, a crew member often wore the same pair of gloves to deliver
food to dozens of cabins at a time, door-to-door and face-to-face with
passengers, a potential source of infection. They also collected dirty
dishes and used linens without full protective gear.

An outbreak of a new virus aboard a crowded ship unquestionably
presented high-stakes difficulties. Princess says it did the best job
possible in the face of unprecedented challenges.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in a series of interviews, company officials offered contradictory
and changing accounts about their response. In the end, nearly 48 hours
elapsed between the alert on Feb. 1 and the captain’s announcement to
the ship on Feb. 3 that a passenger had been infected, giving the virus
time to spread.

Princess officials could not point to the social media post, or the
platform, that they say tipped them off. They said it took Dr. Tarling
until the night of Feb. 2 to confirm that a former passenger had tested
positive.

Company emails show that he knew by that morning. In an email to a Hong
Kong doctor, he listed the patient’s name, his hospital wing, his
traveling companions and the date of the diagnosis.

The subject line of his email began: “Confirmed Coronavirus Case.”

## A Late Response

Containment procedures for an outbreak unfold on a continuum.

Basic precautions might include encouraging handwashing, eliminating
self-service at buffets and increasing cleaning. More serious matters
might prompt crews to discourage handshaking, disinfect the ship or
cancel social events. Outbreaks of highly infectious diseases like Ebola
have their own stringent protocols.

The response aboard the Diamond Princess reflected concern, but not a
major one. The buffets remained open as usual. Onboard celebrations,
opera performances and goodbye parties continued.

“We immediately increased our already robust sanitation protocols,”
Gennaro Arma, the ship’s captain, said in response to questions
submitted through Princess. He said the crew had increased the number of
hand sanitizers, rotated the buffet utensils more frequently and stepped
up cleaning.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Passengers aboard the Diamond Princess say they noticed few ship-wide
changes after the announcement of the infected passenger. But some crew
members began giving out their own more cautious advice, making some
passengers suspicious that the risks were higher than the company was
letting on. At the end of a trivia game, for example, a worker told
passengers not to hand back their pencils.

“He said, ‘Hold onto your pencils and you can consider yourself a
winner,’” said Carol Montgomery, 67, a retired administrative assistant
from San Clemente, Calif.

The crew member also advised them to avoid handrails. “It was like he
was trying to tell us something,” Ms. Montgomery
said.

## Underestimating Contagion

Underpinning the company’s approach was an optimistic, but ultimately
inaccurate, belief that perhaps danger had been averted.

The 80-year-old infected passenger had reported no symptoms to the
medical staff while onboard. And he had disembarked more than a week
earlier, along with his daughter and their two traveling companions.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“They were off the ship,” Dr. Tarling said. “There’s nothing to believe
that we have to put face masks on every single guest.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Tarling also did not order the crew to begin what is known as
contact-tracing, the painstaking task of questioning everybody and
identifying who had been in contact with the infected passenger.
[Infectious disease experts
say](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/operational-considerations-for-managing-covid-19-cases-outbreak-on-board-ships)
that the process should begin immediately and that anyone who was in
close contact should be isolated.

Dr. Tarling said Japanese health officials planned to do the contact
tracing in a matter of hours, when the ship arrived in Yokohama on Feb.
3. Until then, he said, he considered only the elderly man and his
traveling party to be “close contacts.”

That is a narrow interpretation. The [World Health Organization’s
definition](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/operational-considerations-for-managing-covid-19-cases-outbreak-on-board-ships)
covers dining partners, anyone who had face-to-face contact with the
patient — and certainly passengers who had shared a tour bus with him
days earlier.

No restrictions were placed on passengers until around 11 p.m., when
Japanese medical teams boarded the ship and ordered everyone to their
cabins.

Two days later, when the first lab results came back, Japan reported
that 10 people had tested positive.

“We were as surprised as the Japanese were that actually there were more
positive samples on the ship,” Dr. Tarling
said.

## ‘Not Recommended’

Halfway around the world, in the Greek port city of Volos, an
epidemiologist named Christos Hadjichristodoulou has been studying
cruise ship outbreaks for nearly two decades. He served as a science
adviser in the lead-up to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, which used
a fleet of ships to ease the hotel crunch.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By happenstance, [on the very
day](https://www.gac.com/491364/siteassets/about-gac/coronavirus/eu-interim-advice_2019-ncov_maritime_4_2_2020_f.pdf)
that the Diamond Princess pulled into Yokohama, Dr. Hadjichristodoulou
and a team of European experts released new recommendations for cruise
ships.

The guidelines did not have the force of law. But experts said they were
among the first protocols — if not the first — written specifically for
the industry about the new coronavirus.

Those guidelines said that close contacts of a confirmed case [should be
evacuated and quarantined on
shore](https://www.healthygateways.eu/Portals/0/plcdocs/Flow_chart_Ships_3_2_2020.pdf),
a step that is now supposed to happen with the ship off California’s
coast after several days of waiting. On the Diamond Princess, that would
have meant removing many, if not all, of the 273 people selected for the
first round of
testing.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Instead, the Japanese government asked them to stay in their rooms while
awaiting test results. In practice, passengers still moved about and ate
at buffets.

When the first batch of positive results were reported on the morning of
Feb. 5, the Japanese authorities ordered a ship-wide quarantine.
Confirmed cases would be evacuated to hospitals, but everyone else would
remain aboard, isolated in their cabins.

“The approach they followed is not recommended for many reasons,” Dr.
Hadjichristodoulou said. He would not criticize decisions made under
pressure, but said it was clear the virus would spread. “We expected
this,” he said.

Japanese health officials say that some local authorities feared
allowing potentially infected passengers ashore. And the country could
not immediately quarantine a large number of people. “It’s easy to say
that they should be moved to an onshore facility,” said Dr. Yasuyuki
Sahara, a senior assistant minister in Japan’s health ministry. “But in
reality it is not so easy.”

Dr. Hadjichristodoulou, who also [leads a
team](http://apps.who.int/whocc/Detail.aspx?cc_ref=GRE-27&cc_code=gre)
of World Health Organization advisers, said he had contacted the
agency’s offices in Lyon, France, and offered to organize a group of
experts to board the ship to advise. He said the offer was declined.

A W.H.O. spokesman said he would not discuss the group’s internal
discussions. Dr. Sahara said the ministry had no record of the offer.

One W.H.O. consultant from the Manila office provided advice in the
health ministry’s Tokyo office but never boarded the
ship.

## ‘No Drilling for Something Like This’

Quarantining thousands of people is a huge operation requiring far more
gear and supplies than any cruise ship carries. Confining people in
shared rooms has its own challenges, as does feeding them and keeping
them entertained so they won’t be tempted to leave their cabins.

Japan’s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said in a parliamentary
session that the responsibility should not have fallen solely on Japan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Japan is not the only state that is obliged to conduct measures to
prevent the expansion of infection,” Mr. Motegi said. He suggested
international law was unclear as to whether both the country where the
ship was officially licensed — Britain — and the cruise operator should
share the burden.

Princess said it had followed Japan’s lead from the moment its health
officials boarded the ship. “When we have other outbreaks like
norovirus, we send our teams to the ship,” Dr. Tarling said. “Here,
we’re sort of taking direction and seeing how we can best make it
work.”

That responsibility [fell to the
crew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/10/business/coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html).
Cruise jobs are notorious for long hours and low pay. A supervisory
kitchen worker for Princess, for example, made $1,949 a month and was
expected to work up to 13 hours a day, seven days a week, for six months
straight, according to a 2017 contract.

Those crew members drill for many eventualities, said Iain Hay, whose
company, Anchor Hygiene, conducts training for cruise companies. “But,”
he said, “there was no drilling for something like this.”

On the Diamond Princess, crew members delivered three meals a day to
close to 1,500 staterooms. Early in the quarantine, they served food on
china. While crew members wore masks and gloves, they risked spreading —
or contracting — the virus whenever they opened state room doors and
passed in trays of food.

“I’d give them a coffee cup and they’d give me back an apple,” said
Melanie Haering, 58, whose husband, John, was hospitalized with the
virus. “It was an exchange like that — even though your hand is gloved,
your hand has still been soiled from the cabin next door.”

Even after switching to paper and plastic, crew members still delivered
meals into rooms rather than leaving them on the floor outside, as Dr.
Tarling believed happened. Passengers who were evacuated to military
bases in California and Texas said workers there left food outside.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Experts say the crew was not equipped to carry out the quarantine, so
lapses were inevitable. “Look at how infectious-disease teams operate
anywhere in the world. That is their job,” said Dr. Kate Bunyan, a
former medical director for Carnival U.K. “They are not waiters in their
day jobs.”

But if anyone from Princess objected to the quarantine, nobody is saying
so. Dr. Tarling said it was the best option available.

The concern now is focused on the other Princess cruise thousands of
miles away. On Wednesday, a passenger in California died from the
coronavirus after completing a 10-day cruise to Mexico aboard that ship,
the Grand Princess.

For days, the ship has idled off the coast as Princess and American
officials have tried to figure out what to do. After shifting plans and
significant uncertainty, they have decided to dock in Oakland, where
sick passengers will be taken to hospitals in the state and others will
be sent to quarantine facilities around the country.

Once again, Dr. Tarling is helping manage the crisis. Asked whether he
wished he had done anything differently to contain the outbreak on the
Diamond Princess, he could not point to a single decision that he would
change.

“I believe our initial response was actually pretty good,” he
said.
