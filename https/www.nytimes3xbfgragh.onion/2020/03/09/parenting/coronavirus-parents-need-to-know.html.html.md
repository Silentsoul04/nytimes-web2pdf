As coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, we’re working to
answer [the questions on many parents’
minds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/parenting-kids-coronavirus).
This is a fast-moving situation, so some information may be outdated.
For the latest updates, [read The New York Times’s live coronavirus
coverage
here](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus).

*This article was last updated on March 26.*

Schools across the country have closed in response to the new
coronavirus and many parents have questions about how to go about their
daily lives while managing their children, whose personal boundaries and
hygiene levels are not always ideal.

Because the situation is evolving rapidly and the virus is new, the
advice may continue to change as we learn more. “We’re not seeing much
in the way of serious illness among children,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez,
M.D., Ph.D., the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine.

On March 18, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released
[new preliminary
data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w&referringSource=articleShare)
on the outcomes of the first 4,226 Americans infected with the new
coronavirus, finding no fatalities or admissions to intensive care units
among those under 19.

Researchers from China published [a
study](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf)
online in the journal Pediatrics in March, which examined more than
2,000 children under 18 who either had or were suspected of having
Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The researchers
found that while the majority of children in the study had either no
symptoms, mild symptoms or moderate symptoms, [nearly 6 percent became
more seriously
ill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-childen.html)—
particularly those under 5. However, it’s unclear if the children with
more serious symptoms were sick with Covid-19 or with another
respiratory virus, said Dr. Sean O’Leary, M.D., an executive member of
the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, this study “confirms what we have been suspecting, that it’s
almost certainly less severe in children, but it’s not zero,” he said,
agreeing that it was prudent for many schools to close. “We’re in the
midst of something that no one alive has really experienced before,” he
said.

With that in mind, here are some answers to common questions.

## Can I still take my child to public places?

The situation is changing by the hour, so your best bet is to regularly
check your state and local public health department websites for
recommendations, Dr. O’Leary
said.

But as of now, the general advice is to practice [social
distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/community/index.html),
Dr. Hotez said, which means sticking close to home and avoiding large
groups of people. On March 16, the Trump administration announced new
guidelines to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which
included closing schools that were still open and avoiding bars, food
courts, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people.

You can’t be sure that popular public spaces like playgrounds are
risk-free — the virus is estimated to survive on metal, glass and
plastic surfaces for anywhere [from 2 hours to nine
days](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html).
New York City, for example, does not regularly clean outdoor furniture
and play equipment, said Meghan Lalor, director of media relations at
the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. “We have not yet
committed to changing our standard operations due to coronavirus, but we
will continue to monitor the situation as it develops,” she said. On
March 17, all New York City “recreation centers and nature centers are
closed to the public until further notice,” Lalor said, though city
parks and playgrounds remain open.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At this point, some communities are closing their playgrounds;
considering school is out and we don’t want children congregating all
together, Dr. O’Leary said playgrounds are “probably not the safest
place right now.” For city dwellers, he recommended going to big,
wide-open parks when available, where kids can stay practice physical
distancing and not touch equipment. Remember there are other options for
solo outdoor play, like riding on a scooter or a bike. There are also
options for indoor movement — for example, there are kids’ yoga videos
all over YouTube that you and your family can enjoy together.

As always, encourage hand washing when children come in from outside and
before and after meals. Kids [should sing “Happy Birthday”
twice](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) to
know how long to wash their hands, and then make sure they are drying
them thoroughly. There’s some evidence that paper towels are [more
hygienic than hand dryers in public
bathrooms](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/17/smarter-living/using-public-bathrooms.html).
Hand washing is also more effective than hand sanitizer, though hand
sanitizer can be used when hand washing is not an option.

## Can we see other families at all?

“We’re really encouraging zero play dates at this point,” said Dr.
O’Leary.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Theoretically, he
said, it might be feasible for your child to play outside with one other
child if they can keep six feet apart, but the reality is that keeping
younger kids from touching their friends is nearly impossible. If you
have an older child who you know can absolutely stay six feet apart from
his pals in a wide open space, it’s fine for them to play, but monitor
them closely. Always make sure they are washing hands vigorously when
they come inside.

## The store is out of hand sanitizer. Should I make my own?

Recipes for homemade hand sanitizer are circulating online, but none of
the experts I spoke to recommended making your own, even if stores have
run out. Many popular brands of hand sanitizer, like Purell or Highmark,
have established concentrations of alcohol, generally [between 60 and 95
percent](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html),
said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease
specialist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, which
helps ensure their effectiveness. Additionally, she said, “we have
experience using it in hospitals, and we know how effective it is.” The
same evidence base for homemade recipes doesn’t exist yet.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

If you are using store-bought hand sanitizer, make sure that it’s at
least 60 percent alcohol and that it fully dries before you or your
child touch anything — otherwise it won’t work as well. Also keep in
mind that hand sanitizers are not as effective when used on “visibly
dirty or greasy” hands, according to the
C.D.C.

## My child has mild cold or flu symptoms. Should I take him to the hospital?

No. [Coronavirus symptoms can
include](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/COVID19-symptoms.pdf)
fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If your child has other
symptoms, like mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call
your pediatrician first before going anywhere. “We want people who are
not critically ill to stay out of the hospital,” Dr. Madan said.

If your child develops more severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing,
an inability to eat or drink or a change in behavior, you should visit a
doctor, Dr. Madan said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## If my child is very sick, will she be able to get tested?

Unless your child has a history of direct contact with someone who has
tested positive for the virus, a history of travel to affected areas or
is sick enough to be hospitalized, it is unlikely she will be tested.

“Availability of testing depends on where you are,” Dr. O’Leary said.
“Even in the best case scenario, you can’t test everyone because there
aren’t enough test kits at this point.” Older and higher-risk patients
are being prioritized for testing because they tend to develop the most
severe symptoms after infection.

If your child does get tested, it’s unclear how quickly her results will
come back — and the time frame will most likely depend on where you are,
which lab is testing her and how long she’s been sick. “It’s all over
the map,” Dr. O’Leary said. Anecdotally, he has heard about results
taking anywhere from a few hours to seven days, depending on the state
and the level of
demand.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.

        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

A greater number of labs will be able to provide testing in the coming
days, according to Dr. O’Leary. But because there may also be increased
demand, it’s unclear whether that will speed up testing time overall.

## Should I take my child to her scheduled well visit?

If you have a newborn, toddler or young child who is still receiving
immunizations, it is important to take her to her well visit, as long as
you can do it safely, [according to new guidance released
from](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/covid-19-clinical-guidance-q-a/)the
A.A.P. on March 18. “We don’t want those kids to miss their vaccines,”
Dr. O’Leary said. “Then we’ll have unprotected infants,” who will be
susceptible to other diseases. Your child’s first newborn visit to a
pediatrician is particularly important, Dr. O’Leary said, as your doctor
will want to check her weight, test for jaundice and help troubleshoot
any breastfeeding issues.

If your child is older and has received all of her immunizations, the
A.A.P. recommends that you consider postponing your well visit for the
near term. The organization also has tips for doctors to help keep their
patients, parents and staff safe during their visits, including keeping
well visits in the morning and restricting visits for kids who are sick
to the afternoon. It also urges doctors to see kids who are sick in
different facilities, rooms or floors, and to increase the use of
telemedicine.

## Is it safe to take my child on public transportation?

It is not recommended. New York City has [urged commuters of all ages to
avoid getting on packed subway
cars](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/stop-the-spread-poster.pdf)
and to walk or bike to work, if possible. New York City Mayor Bill de
Blasio said he had no plans to shut down the subway.

## What if my child has a compromised immune system?

Because there isn’t much information yet about how children react to
this virus, it’s tough to say if there are any additional measures folks
should take beyond the isolation already recommended for the general
population, Dr. Hotez said. But Dr. Madan said that parents of children
who have compromised immune systems should be taking it “day by day.” If
your child has asthma, [available evidence suggests they are not at
increased risk for the
virus](https://parenting.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/parent-life/coronavirus-asthma-kids),
but that may change as we learn
more.

## Should my family be taking any extra hygienic measures beyond hand washing?

You can wash bedsheets and towels more often. Jolie Kerr, a cleaning
expert and frequent New York Times contributor, said that you could also
wash stuffed animals more often ([here’s
how](https://parenting.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/childrens-health/clean-stuffed-animals))
and clean hard toys with antibacterial wipes regularly — particularly
after outdoor use.

## Should Grandma still come visit?

Older adults, especially those who have compromised immune systems, seem
to be the most vulnerable to the new coronavirus. Some areas are calling
for<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>extreme measures: For
example, California [called for people over 65 to stay in their
homes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/us/coronavirus-newsom-california-seniors-restaurants-bars.html),
while New York state [is asking those over 70 to stay
indoors](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-signs-new-york-state-pause-executive-order).<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>

If possible, grandparents should not visit their grandchildren right
now. “It appears that children and young adults are an important vector
for coronavirus, because they may be infectious even if they don’t have
symptoms,” Dr. Cynthia R. Ambler, M.D., a pediatrician at Northwestern
Medicine in Chicago told Hallie Levine [in a piece for the Times
addressing the safety of
grandparents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/parenting/grandparents-visit-safety-coronavirus.html).
If grandparents are the primary caretakers of children, kids and
grandparents alike should [wash
hands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands-coronavirus.html)
even more carefully and regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

## Are newborns more susceptible to coronavirus?

There is little data specifically on newborns at this time, Dr. O’Leary
said. Though [a small
study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2763787)
published on March 25 in JAMA Pediatrics — which assessed the outcomes
of nearly three dozen babies who were born to mothers with Covid-19 in
Wuhan, China — provided some initial comfort. As Apoorva Mandavilli
noted in [her piece for The
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/03/health/coronavirus-pregnant-women-babies.html),
“Of 33 newborns born at the Wuhan Children’s Hospital, only three had
any signs of the virus, and even their symptoms were mild, the
researchers reported.” The study authors did not know for certain what
the source of the infection was in the infants who tested positive.

In general. Dr. O’Leary recommended taking the usual hygienic
precautions you would with infants, who are particularly vulnerable to
other respiratory viruses, like respiratory syncytial virus (R.S.V.) and
the influenza virus: Wash your hands before handling an infant, and
avoid taking your infant to crowded
places.
