SAN FRANCISCO — Livia De Felice, who owns two vacation rental properties
and manages four others across Italy, has seen all of her bookings for
March canceled, leaving her “extremely worried,” she said.

Austin Mao, who hosts 2,000 guests a month in his Las Vegas network of
mansions, has slashed prices on the properties by 10 percent and plans
to keep cutting as visitors dwindle.

And Tracey Northcott and her husband, who manage 12 vacation apartments
in Tokyo, said the occupancy rate had gone from 80 percent to zero since
January.

“I’ve got to keep paying my mortgage somehow,” said Ms. Northcott, who
employs three full-time and five part-time cleaners and administrators
and has started dipping into her retirement savings to pay the bills.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. De Felice, Mr. Mao and Ms. Northcott are part of a network of people
behind seven million rental listings on Airbnb, the home-sharing and
rental site, who are now feeling the brunt of the coronavirus fallout.
With travel screeching to a halt in many places to limit the outbreak’s
spread, the problems facing Airbnb and other online travel sites, such
as Booking.com and VRBO, have rapidly escalated.

The toll that the virus is taking on the $688 billion online travel
industry is shared by airlines and big hotel chains. But unlike the
Marriotts and Hiltons or [carriers like United and
JetBlue](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/business/coronavirus-airline-industry.html),
many online travel sites are underpinned by listings from individual
homeowners and smaller hotel operators, who typically have fewer
resources to withstand a prolonged slump.

The pain is already widespread. Booking.com, which has 6.3 million
listings for “alternative accommodations,” including apartments and
vacation homes, pulled its financial forecast on Monday. The company
said worsening conditions made it impossible to “reliably quantify” the
impact of the virus on its business, which also sells hotel stays and
plane tickets.

“The world has changed, and we have to adjust,” Glenn Fogel,
Booking.com’s chief executive, said in a recent interview, adding that
his company had also pulled back on advertising.

Expedia Group, which owns VRBO, Hotels.com and more than a dozen other
travel sites, has said it expected a $30 million to $40 million hit to
operating profit in the first quarter. The company recently laid off 12
percent of its work force, or more than 3,000 employees, which it said
was part of a previously planned restructuring.

“It truly is an unknown,” Barry Diller, Expedia’s chairman, said of the
coronavirus on an investor call last month. “All we’re trying to do is
separate what we absolutely believe is the effect of the virus from our
ongoing business, so we can prepare ourselves and make that ongoing
business as strong as possible when this thing is over.”

One of the hardest hit may be Airbnb, where millions of hosts have
listed their properties for short stays since the company was founded in
2008. (Airbnb takes a cut of their fee.) Over the years, Airbnb hosts
have become increasingly sophisticated, with mini-economies springing up
to cater to the hosts’ needs for cleaning and management of the
properties. Competitors like Booking.com followed by moving into rentals
of vacation
homes.

Now Airbnb finds itself on strategically tricky ground.

The San Francisco company, valued at $31 billion by private investors,
said in September that it [planned to go public this
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/19/technology/airbnb-ipo-2020.html)
— even though the initial public offering market for high-profile,
money-losing start-ups [has been
rocky](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/26/business/tech-ipo-market.html).
Airbnb has indicated that it planned to go public via an unusual method
known as a direct listing, where no new shares are sold. And it is under
pressure to complete a listing this year because some of its current and
former employees’ shares in the company [will otherwise
expire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/20/technology/airbnb-employees-ipo-payouts.html).

The offering may now be in question. Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman,
would only refer to the company’s previous announcement that it planned
to go public this year. But stock market volatility and a big blow to
business from the virus may make it unthinkable for any company to go
public soon.

Last week, Brian Chesky, [Airbnb’s chief
executive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/12/business/brian-chesky-of-airbnb-on-scratching-the-itch-to-create.html),
sent an email to employees outlining the company’s response to the
virus. In the message, he said Airbnb would grant some refunds to
customers and establish a $10 million fund to support Chinese rental
operators while tourism to the country, where the outbreak started, has
halted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Airbnb was born during a global crisis,” Mr. Chesky wrote, referring to
the [2008 financial
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/19/news/19iht-19oxan-CRISIS.16311607.html)
and without mentioning the company’s I.P.O. plans. “It didn’t stop us
then, and it won’t stop us
now.”

Airbnb faces other coronavirus fallout, including a sponsorship of the
Tokyo Olympics this summer that may be in peril [if the event is
canceled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/sports/olympics/coronavirus-tokyo.html).
The International Olympic Committee has said it is fully committed to
holding the games, and will follow the advice of the World Health
Organization.

Most of all, Airbnb is dealing with a potential decline in revenue
because travelers are canceling stays with their hosts.

Jasper Ribbers, who runs a company called Get Paid for Your Pad in
Sofia, Bulgaria, that provides coaching for Airbnb hosts, has advised
those in regions affected by the virus to reduce nightly prices, cut
costs and seek alternative uses for their spaces, like finding long-term
renters.

“Some hosts are doing events or letting local artists use the apartments
for photo shoots,” he said.

Mr. Mao, the Airbnb host in Las Vegas, began cutting prices on his
properties last month and said he would continue doing so as bookings
slowed. Each of his homes had been bringing around $10,000 a month, with
fixed costs of just $3,500. While he saw only a slight dip in bookings
in early March, he said, he expects that to deepen as fear of the
coronavirus intensifies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Mao said he also had stopped work at a construction business he
runs, where he employs 10 people who renovate homes for renting.

“I believe this is a harbinger of the next great recession, so I think
it’s risky to expand,” he
said.

In Tokyo, Ms. Northcott, who has been an Airbnb host for eight years,
said she had been trying to find other work for her cleaners, who are
paid by the job. Her business, Tokyo Family Stays, lost around $2,000
worth of bookings in January, $10,000 in February, $25,000 so far in
March and $40,000 for April, which is normally the biggest month of the
year.

If the virus spreads, she and her husband may try to find corporate
jobs, she said.

“It seems that it is always the small businesses who are left to figure
things out for themselves,” she said.

Mr. Papas declined to disclose details on the costs of Airbnb’s
virus-related cancellations. The company has let people traveling to and
from China, South Korea and parts of Italy cancel their bookings with
full refunds. It said it was individually evaluating other situations,
including people whose flights were canceled or who were restricted from
traveling.

On Tuesday, Airbnb announced a program called More Flexible
Reservations, which will allow hosts to more easily offer refunds to
guests. Service fees on trips booked now through June 1 that do not fall
under the company’s extenuating-circumstances policy will also be
refundable with travel coupons for a future journey.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some customers who booked trips before the new program took effect are
unhappy. Dr. Peter Shields, a cancer researcher at Ohio State
University, booked a two-week trip to Japan for this month with nearly
$10,000 of reservations at two Airbnbs for his family. After the
outbreak worsened and his employer restricted foreign travel, he
canceled.

But because Japan does not fall under Airbnb’s extenuating-circumstances
policy, Dr. Shields struggled to secure refunds. He tussled with
Airbnb’s customer support, emailed Mr. Chesky directly and filed a
Better Business Bureau complaint. He was eventually refunded for one
reservation and 70 percent of the other — but was then told that the
first one had been done by mistake.

“The answer I’m getting is: You’re out of luck,” he said.

Airbnb said 60 percent of its reservations had policies that allowed for
half or full refunds. It added of Dr. Shields, “We apologize for this
error and have taken action to address this matter and help ensure these
kinds of issues don’t happen again in the future.”

In his memo to employees, Mr. Chesky tried to stay optimistic.

“Travel always bounces back,” he wrote. “It is one of the most resilient
industries in the world.”
