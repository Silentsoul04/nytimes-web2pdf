WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday night issued several
pages of tips for navigating the coronavirus, organizing a set of
recommendations for schools, businesses, homes and offices into a
document that resembles easy-on-the-eye restaurant food-safety charts.

The simple behaviors recommended in the guidelines — like washing hands,
managing air flow, protecting food and carving out private space in a
home — show how federal health officials believe the virus could
influence everyday life.

“These are really simple, low-tech things,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
and a key member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force,
said at a White House news briefing. “There’s nothing in there that’s
complicated. But it’s just stated in a way that’s clear, that people can
understand.”

After the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence [posted images of the
guidelines](https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1237170982512664576)
on Twitter. They are expected to also be published on
[Coronavirus.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html),
a federal hub of virus information where the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention has already posted similar advice.

Here is what the guidelines recommend.

## How to navigate the office

Stay home if you or family members who live with you are sick. Several
top health officials have repeatedly urged Americans to not risk going
to work if they come down with symptoms that might indicate an
infection.

Use the usual electronic means of work life, like email, to remind
yourself to wash your hands. Devise ways to remember to not touch your
face. And avoid shaking hands — “noncontact methods of greeting” are
preferable.

Instead of in-person meetings, the guidelines suggest teleconferencing.
If meetings are held in person, they should be in open, well-ventilated
rooms. Open windows will help.

The [World Health Organization
warns](https://www.who.int/sustainable-development/health-sector/health-risks/airborne-diseases/en/)
that “poorly ventilated buildings affect air quality and can contribute
to the spread of disease,” and that in health facilities with a high
concentration of infectious patients, poor ventilation worsens the risk
of transmission.

## How to divide a home

Divvy up your home to account for the elderly or those with underlying
conditions that make them particularly susceptible to infection. Make a
“protected space” for those at risk, and give the sick their own
rooms, where the door should be kept closed. Only one person should care
for the ill.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

## How to keep a school safe

Schools should avoid mixing ages and consider adjusting or postponing
in-school and extracurricular gatherings that intermingle classes and
grades. Classes should be held outdoors, if possible, or anywhere well
ventilated.

Students should limit sharing food, and cafeteria workers should
practice strict hygiene. Schools should screen cafeteria workers and
those they come in contact with.

## How to protect a business

Businesses should limit attendance at large gatherings and use online
transactions for events, avoiding the kind of close contact that occurs
at box offices. The advice follows news of several large event
cancellations, including the South by Southwest festival in Austin,
Texas, a major professional tennis tournament in California and a health
conference where President Trump was scheduled to speak.

Businesses should promote “tap and pay” machines that cut down on the
use of cash, a notorious [germ-carrying
material](https://time.com/4918626/money-germs-microbes-dirty/).

Drivers for ride-sharing services and taxis should keep their windows
open and regularly disinfect surfaces. Uber [has
said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/tech/uber-coronavirus-sick-leave/index.html)
it will offer drivers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are infected
with the coronavirus or are quarantined.
