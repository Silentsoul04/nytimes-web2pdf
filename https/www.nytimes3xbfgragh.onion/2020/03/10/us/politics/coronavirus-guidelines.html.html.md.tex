WASHINGTON --- The Trump administration on Monday night issued several
pages of tips for navigating the coronavirus, organizing a set of
recommendations for schools, businesses, homes and offices into a
document that resembles easy-on-the-eye restaurant food-safety charts.

The simple behaviors recommended in the guidelines --- like washing
hands, managing air flow, protecting food and carving out private space
in a home --- show how federal health officials believe the virus could
influence everyday life.

``These are really simple, low-tech things,'' Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
and a key member of the Trump administration's coronavirus task force,
said at a White House news briefing. ``There's nothing in there that's
complicated. But it's just stated in a way that's clear, that people can
understand.''

After the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence
\href{https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1237170982512664576}{posted
images of the guidelines} on Twitter. They are expected to also be
published on
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html}{Coronavirus.gov},
a federal hub of virus information where the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention has already posted similar advice.

Here is what the guidelines recommend.

Stay home if you or family members who live with you are sick. Several
top health officials have repeatedly urged Americans to not risk going
to work if they come down with symptoms that might indicate an
infection.

Use the usual electronic means of work life, like email, to remind
yourself to wash your hands. Devise ways to remember to not touch your
face. And avoid shaking hands --- ``noncontact methods of greeting'' are
preferable.

Instead of in-person meetings, the guidelines suggest teleconferencing.
If meetings are held in person, they should be in open, well-ventilated
rooms. Open windows will help.

The
\href{https://www.who.int/sustainable-development/health-sector/health-risks/airborne-diseases/en/}{World
Health Organization warns} that ``poorly ventilated buildings affect air
quality and can contribute to the spread of disease,'' and that in
health facilities with a high concentration of infectious patients, poor
ventilation worsens the risk of transmission.

\hypertarget{how-to-divide-a-home}{%
\subsection{How to divide a home}\label{how-to-divide-a-home}}

Divvy up your home to account for the elderly or those with underlying
conditions that make them particularly susceptible to infection. Make a
``protected space'' for those at risk, and give the sick their own
rooms, where the door should be kept closed. Only one person should care
for the ill.

Healthy people in your home should act as if they could be a risk to the
vulnerable, washing their hands frequently before interacting with them.

    some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed
    sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and
    received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many

    sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus
    from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which
    can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
    stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
    University of Leicester.

    its recommendation of six feet}~on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the

Schools should avoid mixing ages and consider adjusting or postponing
in-school and extracurricular gatherings that intermingle classes and
grades. Classes should be held outdoors, if possible, or anywhere well
ventilated.

Students should limit sharing food, and cafeteria workers should
practice strict hygiene. Schools should screen cafeteria workers and
those they come in contact with.

Businesses should limit attendance at large gatherings and use online
transactions for events, avoiding the kind of close contact that occurs
at box offices. The advice follows news of several large event
cancellations, including the South by Southwest festival in Austin,
Texas, a major professional tennis tournament in California and a health
conference where President Trump was scheduled to speak.

Businesses should promote ``tap and pay'' machines that cut down on the
use of cash, a notorious

Drivers for ride-sharing services and taxis should keep their windows
open and regularly disinfect surfaces. Uber

said} it will offer drivers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are
infected with the coronavirus or are quarantined.
