The man had recently traveled, including a brief stop in Tokyo. He had a
fever and cough about a week ago, but was now feeling fine.

He called the virtual medical line set up by Rush University Medical
Center in Chicago recently to help screen patients for coronavirus.

“He said all the right buzzwords: cough, fever, fatigue,” said Dr. Meeta
Shah, an emergency room physician at Rush.

After talking with him, Dr. Shah did not think he needed to be admitted
but referred him to the city’s health department.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rush and other large hospitals across the country are quickly expanding
the use of telemedicine to safely screen and treat patients for
coronavirus, and to try to contain the spread of infection while
offering remote services.

“This is a kind of turning point for virtual health,” Dr. Shah said.
“We’re actually seeing how it can be used in a public health
crisis.”

While the notion of seeing a doctor via your computer or cellphone is
hardly new, telemedicine has yet to take off widely in the United
States. Health insurance plans do typically offer people the option of
talking to a nurse or doctor online as an alternative to heading to an
emergency room or urgent care center, but most people don’t make use of
it. Now doctors, hospital networks and clinics are rethinking how the
technology can be used, to keep the worried well calm and away from
clinical care while steering the most at risk to the proper
treatment.

“The use of telemedicine is going to be critical for management of this
pandemic,” said Dr. Stephen Parodi, an infectious disease specialist and
executive with The Permanente Medical Group, the doctors’ group
associated with Kaiser Permanente, one of the leaders in the use of
virtual visits for its patients.

Telemedicine got an additional boost [under the $8.3 billion emergency
funding measure from
Congress](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/04/us/politics/coronavirus-emergency-aid-congress.html),
which loosened restrictions on its use to treat people covered under the
federal Medicare program. At a news conference on Monday, Seema Verma,
the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
praised the government’s efforts to expand the use of telemedicine under
Medicare, the federal program for people 65 and older.

In a meeting on Tuesday at the White House with President Trump, private
health insurers also said they would pay for the virtual visits for
people who may have coronavirus to improve access to care for their
customers.

By using their phone or computer, patients will be able to get guidance
about whether they need to be seen or tested instead of showing up
unannounced at the emergency room or doctor’s office. Patients,
particularly those who would be at high risk for a serious illness if
they were infected, can also opt to substitute a trip to a doctor’s
office with a virtual visit when it is a routine check in with a
specialist or a primary care doctor. That way they can avoid crowded
waiting rooms and potential infection.

When Rush admitted a student last week who was believed to have the
virus, the hospital was able to prepare for his arrival by clearing the
ambulance bay of people and vehicles to protect patients and hospital
staff from possible infection. Taken to an isolation room, he was
examined by Dr. Paul Casey, an emergency room physician, and a nurse,
both in protective gear.

An infectious disease specialist was consulted over an iPad. The
patient, who did have the virus, was released last Friday, and Rush was
able to avoid the fate of other hospitals in the United States, [where
patients with Covid-19 led to the widespread quarantine of health care
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/us/coronavirus-nurses.html).

“When the news of coronavirus broke last month, we saw the opportunity,”
Dr. Casey said.

Health systems are racing to adapt and even develop virtual services
that can serve as their front line for patients. “Telehealth is being
rediscovered,” said Dr. Peter Antall, the chief medical officer for
AmWell, a company based in Boston that is working with health systems
across the country. “Everybody recognizes this is an all hands on deck
moment,” he said. “We need to scale up wherever we can.”

Other systems are also readying their telemedicine offerings. “The
Covid-19 outbreak is going to serve as an impetus,” said Dr. Shabana
Khan, the director of telepsychiatry at NYU Langone Health. “We have no
choice.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Patients concerned about the coronavirus are being directed to NYU’s
virtual urgent care, which they can gain access to via their phone or a
computer.

“Our volumes are showing they are hearing that message loud and clear,”
said Dr. Paul A. Testa, an emergency medicine doctor who is the system’s
chief medical information officer.

NYU is also encouraging its doctors who are self-quarantined because of
recent travel to see patients using video, as well as directing patients
who are particularly vulnerable because of existing medical conditions
to consider a virtual visit instead of heading to a doctor’s
office.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

But Dr. Testa emphasized that patients who need to be seen in person
should not hesitate to seek care. “We’re not discouraging anybody from
coming in,” he said.

Virtual care has its limits, of course, and many of the start-ups and
others promoting their offerings may not be fully equipped to handle
patients who might have the virus. At Zoom+Care, a chain of clinics in
Oregon and Washington, consumers are being encouraged to use the
company’s online chat feature so that their risks can be assessed.

“We’re being very explicit at Zoom+Care that we can’t test you for
Covid-19,” said Dr. Mark Zeitzer, who is the clinics’ medical director
of acute care services. Instead, people may be told to self-quarantine
and keep a careful eye on their symptoms.

But the idea of using telemedicine to prevent further spread of the
virus is being adopted quickly. At Intermountain Healthcare, the Utah
system that cared for an infected patient at its Salt Lake City
hospital, the concern over a potential measles outbreak last year led
executives to consider how to better protect the community from
infectious diseases.

“When coronavirus hit the streets, we took the measles work-flow and
expanded on it,” said Kerry Palakanis, a nurse practitioner who is the
executive director of Intermountain’s initiative, Connect Care.

The system is also thinking about how it can use the same technology to
deliver home health care, particularly for patients who are at high risk
because of chronic medical conditions or have Covid-19 but can be
treated safely at home. People at home could be equipped to take their
blood pressure or test their blood sugars, and a doctor or nurse could
be available over video.

By monitoring more patients virtually, Intermountain will be able to
limit the potential exposure of nurses who conduct home visits. “Those
nurses are traveling out throughout the community,” Dr. Palakanis said.

Telemedicine companies say they are getting an increase in the number of
calls, both from those who want to know more about what they can do to
minimize their risk of catching coronavirus and those with worrisome
symptoms. “We see the whole spectrum of patients,” said Dr. Kristin
Dean, medical director for Doctor On Demand, a company whose service is
offered to customers of some of the major health insurance companies.

In evaluating whether patients may be safely monitored at home, doctors
take into account people’s medical history and the severity of their
symptoms, she said.

“The patients have been appreciative of that switch,” said Dr. Parodi of
Permanente. “Many of them don’t want to come in and be exposed in a
clinic or office setting.”
