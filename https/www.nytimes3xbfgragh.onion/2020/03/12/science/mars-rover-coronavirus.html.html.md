A European-Russian mission to put a rover on Mars and look for signs of
life there has been postponed, to 2022.

Most parts of the mission including the rocket and the rover, named
Rosalind Franklin, are ready. But not enough time remains before the
launch opportunity in July to complete tests of the parachutes, fix
issues with an electronics module and finish the spacecraft’s software.

“We could launch, but that would mean we are not doing all the tests,”
Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency, said
during a news conference on Thursday morning where the decision was
announced. “We cannot really cut corners.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The coronavirus pandemic played a role in the decision. Dimitry Rogozin,
head of Russia’s space agency, said that “force majeure circumstances
related to exacerbation of the epidemiological situation in Europe”
would leave mission staff from both countries unable to travel.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Woerner and Mr. Rogozin discussed the status of the mission by
teleconference before deciding on the delay; because of the pandemic,
Dr. Woerner canceled plans to meet in person with Mr. Rogozin in Moscow.

“This is a very tough decision, but it’s, I’m sure, the right one,” Dr.
Woerner said.

The positions of Mars and Earth line up every 26 months, allowing a
relatively quick trip. Missing that alignment means that the mission
will stay on the ground until the next opportunity between August and
October
2022.

The ExoMars program has persisted through more than a decade of starts
and stops and shifts in plans. Originally, it was a collaboration
between the European Space Agency and NASA, with NASA providing the
rockets and the landing system, similar to what was used to put NASA’s
Curiosity rover on Martian ground in 2012.

But in February 2012, the Obama administration pulled out of the plans,
partly to pay for delays and cost overruns with [the James Webb Space
Telescope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/27/science/webb-telescope-nasa.html).
The Europeans then turned to Russia. The first half of the ExoMars
program, the Trace Gas Orbiter, launched in March 2016 on a Russian
Proton rocket. It [entered orbit around Mars seven months
later](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/20/science/esa-mars-lander.html)
and continues to operate.

after a sensor error caused the spacecraft to jettison its parachute too
early because it thought it was already on the ground instead of still
two miles in the air.

The ExoMars rover, which will use a different landing system, was
originally scheduled to launch in 2018, but that launch window was
missed because of delays in the completion of the spacecraft and the
instruments.

Some NASA Mars missions have also missed launch windows. Curiosity was
to have launched in 2009 but was pushed back two years because of
problems with electrical motors. Problems with a key instrument on [Mars
InSight delayed its launch to 2018
from 2016](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/10/science/nasa-reschedules-mars-insight-mission-for-may-2018.html).
Both eventually landed on Mars successfully.

The thin atmosphere of Mars makes landing particularly tricky, requiring
careful testing of parachutes and other systems used to reach the
surface. There is not enough air to provide much drag on the spacecraft
as it speeds to the ground, although what’s there still generates
friction that heats the exterior of a spacecraft to thousands of
degrees.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

in 2016 — failed. A number of Soviet landing attempts in the 1970s also
failed. Only NASA has been able to successfully operate robotic
spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

Last year, the parachutes for the ExoMars mission — one that is 50 feet
wide to deploy at supersonic speeds in the Martian atmosphere, and a
second, 120-foot-wide one that would billow out at subsonic speeds —
failed in tests.

With NASA’s help, the problems with the ExoMars parachutes were
diagnosed and additional tests are planned for this month.

The spacecraft will be put in storage once it is completed later this
year. No changes will be made to the spacecraft or the instruments, Dr.
Woerner said.

Other missions to Mars scheduled to launch this year appear to be on
track: [a NASA rover,
Perseverance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/science/mars-2020-rover-name.html),
[a Chinese
rover](https://www.space.com/coronavirus-china-mars-mission.html) and
[an orbiter from the United Arab
Emirates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/15/science/mars-united-arab-emirates.html)
called
Hope.
