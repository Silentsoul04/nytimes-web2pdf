A European-Russian mission to put a rover on Mars and look for signs of
life there has been postponed, to 2022.

Most parts of the mission including the rocket and the rover, named
Rosalind Franklin, are ready. But not enough time remains before the
launch opportunity in July to complete tests of the parachutes, fix
issues with an electronics module and finish the spacecraft's software.

``We could launch, but that would mean we are not doing all the tests,''
Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency, said
during a news conference on Thursday morning where the decision was
announced. ``We cannot really cut corners.''

The coronavirus pandemic played a role in the decision. Dimitry Rogozin,
head of Russia's space agency, said that ``force majeure circumstances
related to exacerbation of the epidemiological situation in Europe''
would leave mission staff from both countries unable to travel.

Dr. Woerner and Mr. Rogozin discussed the status of the mission by
teleconference before deciding on the delay; because of the pandemic,
Dr. Woerner canceled plans to meet in person with Mr. Rogozin in Moscow.

``This is a very tough decision, but it's, I'm sure, the right one,''
Dr. Woerner said.

The positions of Mars and Earth line up every 26 months, allowing a
relatively quick trip. Missing that alignment means that the mission
will stay on the ground until the next opportunity between August and
October 2022.

The ExoMars program has persisted through more than a decade of starts
and stops and shifts in plans. Originally, it was a collaboration
between the European Space Agency and NASA, with NASA providing the
rockets and the landing system, similar to what was used to put NASA's
Curiosity rover on Martian ground in 2012.

But in February 2012, the Obama administration pulled out of the plans,
partly to pay for delays and cost overruns with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/27/science/webb-telescope-nasa.html}{the
James Webb Space Telescope}. The Europeans then turned to Russia. The
first half of the ExoMars program, the Trace Gas Orbiter, launched in
March 2016 on a Russian Proton rocket. It
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/20/science/esa-mars-lander.html}{entered
orbit around Mars seven months later} and continues to operate.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/21/science/space/no-signal-from-mars-lander-but-european-officials-declare-mission-a-success.html}{But
the accompanying lander, Schiaparelli, crashed} after a sensor error
caused the spacecraft to jettison its parachute too early because it
thought it was already on the ground instead of still two miles in the
air.

The ExoMars rover, which will use a different landing system, was
originally scheduled to launch in 2018, but that launch window was
missed because of delays in the completion of the spacecraft and the
instruments.

Some NASA Mars missions have also missed launch windows. Curiosity was
to have launched in 2009 but was pushed back two years because of
problems with electrical motors. Problems with a key instrument on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/10/science/nasa-reschedules-mars-insight-mission-for-may-2018.html}{Mars
InSight delayed its launch to 2018 from 2016}. Both eventually landed on
Mars successfully.

The thin atmosphere of Mars makes landing particularly tricky, requiring
careful testing of parachutes and other systems used to reach the
surface. There is not enough air to provide much drag on the spacecraft
as it speeds to the ground, although what's there still generates
friction that heats the exterior of a spacecraft to thousands of
degrees.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

Two earlier European landers --- the Beagle 2 in 2003 and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/21/science/space/no-signal-from-mars-lander-but-european-officials-declare-mission-a-success.html}{Schiaparelli}
in 2016 --- failed. A number of Soviet landing attempts in the 1970s
also failed. Only NASA has been able to successfully operate robotic
spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

Last year, the parachutes for the ExoMars mission --- one that is 50
feet wide to deploy at supersonic speeds in the Martian atmosphere, and
a second, 120-foot-wide one that would billow out at subsonic speeds ---
failed in tests.

With NASA's help, the problems with the ExoMars parachutes were
diagnosed and additional tests are planned for this month.

The spacecraft will be put in storage once it is completed later this
year. No changes will be made to the spacecraft or the instruments, Dr.
Woerner said.

Other missions to Mars scheduled to launch this year appear to be on
track:
