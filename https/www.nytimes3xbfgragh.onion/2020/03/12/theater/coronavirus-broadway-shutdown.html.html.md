The adage is synonymous with
[Broadway](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/theater/broadway-coronavirus.html)
itself: the show must go on.

And for decades, through wars and recessions and all forms of darkness,
Broadway, the heart of America’s theater industry and an economic
lifeblood for many artists, has kept its curtains up and its footlights
on.

But on Thursday, facing a widening
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/theater/broadway-coronavirus.html)
pandemic and new limitations on large gatherings, the industry said it
was suspending all plays and musicals for 32 days, effective
immediately.

“The idea that our venerable, majestic houses are dark, and that there
will be no lights on Broadway — I’m romanticizing, but that’s the
heartbeat of the city, and to think that they’ve been forced into
darkness is shocking,” said Patti LuPone, a beloved Broadway titan who
has won two Tony Awards and has been performing in previews for a
revival of “Company.” “I’m shocked that they took this tack, but also
grateful they did, just to keep us healthy.”

The shutdown — longer than those prompted in recent decades by strikes
and snowstorms and even the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — will
inevitably cost tens of millions of dollars for investors and artists
and associated businesses, and will likely trigger the collapse of some
plays and musicals that will be unable to survive the delays and losses.

The move came as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio enacted
new restrictions to try to stop the spread of the virus, which in the
city has infected nearly 100 people, a number expected to grow.

City and state officials banned most gatherings of more than 500 people,
and required smaller venues to cut their capacity by half; they also
limited nursing home visits. Mr. de Blasio declared a state of
emergency, empowering him to take measures like implementing a curfew or
limiting traffic should conditions worsen.

Public schools, however, were remaining open. The governor noted many
children’s resistance to the virus, while the mayor expressed worry
about the disruptions that school closings would create.

The shuttering of theaters, which the Broadway League said would
continue through April 12, followed a flood of cultural closings around
the country and around the world.

Earlier on Thursday, several of New York’s largest and most prestigious
cultural institutions — including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic —
announced that [they would temporarily shut
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/12/arts/design/met-museum-opera-carnegie-hall-close-coronavirus.html).
At the same time, Live Nation Entertainment and AEG Presents, the
corporate giants that dominate the concert industry, [suspended all
North American
tour](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/arts/music/coronavirus-coachella-postponed.html)
engagements.

In Asia and Europe, many performance spaces had already closed; in the
United States, venues from the [5th Avenue
Theater](https://www.5thavenue.org/) in Seattle to the [Center Theater
Group](https://www.centertheatregroup.org/) in Los Angeles to the
[Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedy-center.org/) in Washington scrapped
shows.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The theater industry had been hoping to avoid mass closings, taking
steps to reduce the risk of infection by adding hand sanitizer
dispensers, more frequently cleaning seats, barring backstage visits and
stage door interactions and even soda refills in used cups.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Broadway has a lot of risk factors — many of its shows attract an
older audience, and older people seem to be particularly susceptible to
the coronavirus; it depends heavily on tourism, which is plunging as a
result of the pandemic; and its theaters, lovely as they are, pack
patrons into tight quarters, making the now-recommended social
distancing essentially impossible.

As public health officials increasingly warned about the riskiness of
large gatherings, and after a part-time usher [was diagnosed with the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/11/theater/broadway-show-usher-coronavirus.html),
the drumbeat for closing grew louder.

Actors’ Equity Association, a labor union representing 51,000 performers
and stage managers around the country, was becoming more and more
concerned.

“There’s no such thing as social distancing for actors — our jobs
sometimes require that we go to work and kiss our colleagues eight times
a week,” said the actress [Kate
Shindle,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/05/theater/union-boss-and-former-miss-america-hits-the-road-in-fun-home.html)
who is the president of Equity. “Although nobody wanted to close the
theaters, at the same time people were starting to be scared to work,
and with good reason.”

And theater producers, facing dwindling advance sales and concern for
audiences and employees, came to agree.

“Over the last 48 hours, watching everything escalate and the ground
keep shifting, the Broadway League has done the responsible thing,” said
Sue Frost, a lead producer of the musical [“Come From
Away,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/12/theater/come-from-away-review.html)
which had been set to celebrate its third anniversary Thursday night.
“We’ve got to protect our employees and our audiences, and if this is
what we have to do, this is what we have to
do.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The industry wanted either Mr. Cuomo or Mr. de Blasio to order a
closing, because of a widespread understanding that the shows’ insurance
policies would provide coverage only if a closing were
government-mandated.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo obliged, ordering [an end to all
gatherings of more than 500
people](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/during-novel-coronavirus-briefing-governor-cuomo-announces-new-mass-gatherings-regulations).
That encompassed all 41 Broadway theaters — by definition, Broadway
theaters must have more than 500 seats, and most have more than 1,000.

Mr. Cuomo said the Broadway restriction would go into effect at 5 p.m.
on Thursday, forcing a temporary end to the runs of all 31 plays and
musicals currently in progress, from crowd favorites like “Hamilton” and
“The Lion King” to new musicals like
“[Six](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/theater/six-broadway.html),”
which had been scheduled to open Thursday night. Signs went up at many
theaters with information about refunds (often automatic for those who
bought with credit cards from official theater sites) and exchanges.

Mr. de Blasio, speaking at his own briefing, said the restriction was
necessary but difficult. “That’s really, really painful for the many,
many people who work in that field, let alone so many New Yorkers and
people all over the country who really look forward to these events,
these concerts, these sports events, and it’s really going to be kind of
a hole in our lives and it’s painful,” he said. “It’s not something we
would ever want to do but it’s something we have to do.”

Broadway theaters did not close for the 1918 flu pandemic. But in more
recent years they have shut down for labor disruptions,
[storms](https://nyti.ms/1NtiI84), and, on Sept. 11, terrorist attacks.
Most of the closings were short (Broadway, urged to reopen by city
officials, was back in business two days after the 2001 attacks), but
many theaters were shut for 19 days by [a stagehands’
strike](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/11/29/theater/29broadway.html)
in 2007 and 25 days for [a musicians’
strike](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1975/10/13/archives/musicians-and-producers-ratify-a-3year-pact-musicians-and-producers.html)
in 1975.

The suspension was announced while one Broadway matinee, for the
long-running “The Phantom of the Opera,” was being performed. (Another
matinee scheduled Thursday afternoon, for [“Moulin
Rouge\!”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/25/theater/moulin-rouge-review.html?searchResultPosition=2),
had been canceled because a cast member was feeling sick and the company
had become alarmed.)

Inside the lobby of the Majestic Theater, where “Phantom” has been
running since 1988, workers sat sullenly, knowing that the performance
would be their last until April. Jim McIntosh, a Broadway bartender,
served his last drink at the matinee, and said he had mixed feelings.
“Even though it hurts me financially, it’s kind of a relief,” he said.
“It’s better to be safe than sorry.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The suspension comes at a difficult time for Broadway, which had 16
openings scheduled between Thursday (“Six”) and April 23 (“Take Me
Out”). The latter date is currently the deadline for shows to open to
be eligible for the June 7 Tony Awards. With the suspension of
performances, industry officials acknowledge that the deadline and the
date of the awards ceremony might have to change.

Given the length of the shutdown, some shows might opt to cut their
losses and never open; industry officials said they also expected that
some running shows — those already experiencing box office weakness —
would close rather than try to weather a shutdown and reopen.

The cancellations will invariably be disappointing for tourists and
locals who rely on Broadway for inspiration, entertainment, and
artistry. On Thursday afternoon, two visitors from Brazil, Mariana
Marinho and Barbara Anderaos, popped into the Broadhurst Theater to ask
about tickets for “[Jagged Little Pill](https://nyti.ms/34UocKB),” the
musical built around Alanis Morissette’s songs. Ms. Marinho, 36, had
loved Ms. Morissette’s music since she was a teenager, and the friends
had over a week left to explore New York culture.

As they inquired about seating and ticket prices, a box office employee
broke the news to them: No Broadway shows until April 12.

“I have never seen a Broadway show, so I thought maybe this was my
chance,” Ms. Marinho said. “I guess not.”
