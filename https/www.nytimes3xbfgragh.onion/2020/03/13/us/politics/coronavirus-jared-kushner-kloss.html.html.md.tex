Dr. Kurt Kloss, whose daughter, the model Karlie Kloss, is married to
Mr. Kushner's brother, solicited suggestions from a medical Facebook
group.

One night this week an urgent appeal went out to a Facebook group of
emergency room doctors. ``If you were in charge of the Federal response
to the Pandemic what would your recommendations be?'' asked Dr. Kurt
Kloss, a physician based in New York.

The question was hardly theoretical. ``I have direct channel,'' he
added, ``to person now in charge at White House and have been asked for
recommendations.''

That person, he said, is Jared Kushner, a top adviser to President Trump
who has become increasingly involved in the administration's response to
the coronavirus and is also the brother-in-law of the doctor's daughter,
the model Karlie Kloss. Ms. Kloss is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr.
Kushner's brother and a venture capitalist who in 2012 helped found a
start-up insurer called Oscar Health.

``Tonight I was asked by Jared through my son-in-law for my
recommendations,'' Dr. Kloss wrote on Wednesday evening. ``That's when I
turned to you guys my fellow BAFERDs for help.'' BAFERD is an acronym
for emergency room doctors, joined by a number of expletives.

Among the laundry list of suggestions Dr. Kloss listed on his personal
page were ideas like nationalizing testing devices ``as in wartime,''
activating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, creating pop-up
field hospitals and canceling mass gatherings, according to the post.

Other ideas included using emergency funding to compensate those who
were quarantined, and ``draconian'' travel restrictions. Screenings, Dr.
Kloss mused, could be done over telemedecine-based video services.

In recent days, Jared Kushner has assumed large portions of the
portfolio managing the coronavirus crisis and by Dr. Kloss's account,
was highly interested in the doctors' recommendations.

In a series of follow-up posts on Wednesday evening, Dr. Kloss posted
updates to the Facebook group, which includes more than 20,000 medical
professionals. ``Jared is reading now,'' one message said.

Dr. Kloss ended the post with the phrase ``got to turn this in now,''
though a series of commenters who apparently knew his connection to the
Trump administration urged him to send the list of ideas to the
president.

``Send it to TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!'' one commenter wrote, followed by more
than a dozen exclamation points and three bicep emojis. ``Done,'' Mr.
Kloss responded.

A person close to Mr. Kushner said he was unaware of Dr. Kloss's
activities and a White House spokesman did not respond to a request for
comment. Messages to Dr. Kloss went unanswered.

    its recommendation of six feet} on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

The Spectator
\href{https://spectator.us/karlie-kloss-dad-jared-kushner-coronavirus-research/}{earlier
reported} news of the Facebook group.

Turning to Dr. Kloss is not entirely without merit. A graduate of the
University of Miami medical school, he is an emergency medicine
specialist who has practiced for more than 30 years.

But Dr. Kloss is also outside the purview of the government, where
officials have struggled to get on the same page. By midday Friday, news
of Dr. Kloss's crowdsourced knowledge gathering had hit the internet.

The exchange alarmed at least some of the doctors in the group,
according to a person who viewed the discussion. The only requirement to
be let into the private Facebook group was showing the administrator
proof of practicing medicine; anyone part of the group could comment on
or view the exchange.

One person described the group as ``far from a group of experts,'' but
more a ``collection of rando doctors on social media.''

The Facebook post was deleted from Dr. Kloss's page later Thursday
evening, after reporters inquired about the matter.

Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Maggie Haberman from New
York.
