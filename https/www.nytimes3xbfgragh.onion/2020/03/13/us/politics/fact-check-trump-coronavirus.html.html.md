As he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak,
President Trump attempted to deflect criticisms of his administration’s
response to the virus with inaccurate claims. Here’s a fact-check.

what the facts
are

## Mr. Trump wrongly blamed the Obama administration for coronavirus testing shortages and falsely said it “didn’t do testing” during the swine flu epidemic of 2009.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of
circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications
from a different time.”*

**False.** The Food and Drug Administration issued a “draft guidance” in
2014 in which it sought to extend its authority to [regulate
laboratory-developed
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/08/01/business/fda-to-regulate-lab-developed-test-kits.html).
But it’s wrong to blame that effort for the scattered and insufficient
delivery of coronavirus tests as the guidance was not particularly
relevant to emergency situations and was never [finalized or generally
enforced](https://www.fda.gov/media/102367/download).

[A law enacted in 2004](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R43607.pdf)
created the process and requirements for the use of unapproved products
in public health emergencies. Under the law and
[guidance](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/SurveyCertificationGenInfo/Policy-and-Memos-to-States-and-Regions-Items/QSO18-19-CLIA?DLPage=2&DLEntries=10&DLSort=3&DLSortDir=descending)
set by the Trump administration itself, the Food and Drug Administration
[requires](http://archive.is/lgqI6#ldt) developers of
laboratory-developed tests to submit information and to comply with
certain procedures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The agency said in early March that it would permit unapproved tests for
the coronavirus for 15 days while developers are preparing their
emergency authorization request. Neither the 2004 law nor subsequent
amendments restricted the Trump administration from doing so, nor did it
hamper previous administrations in [fast-tracking
testing](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/historical-information-about-device-emergency-use-authorizations)
for other health crises.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t
do testing like this, and actually they lost approximately 14,000
people, and they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about
testing when it was far too late.”*

**False.** This is blatantly wrong. Diagnostic tests for the swine flu
were approved and shipped out less than two weeks after the H1N1 virus
was identified and a day before the first death in the United
States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the [first
case](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm) of the
virus on April 14, 2009. The Obama administration
[declared](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2009/04/26/press-briefing-swine-influenza)
swine flu a public health emergency on April 26. The Food and Drug
Administration approved a rapid test for the virus two days later. At
the time, the C.D.C. had reported [64
cases](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/updates/042809.htm) and zero deaths.
The C.D.C. [began shipping test
kits](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/cdcresponse.htm#CDC_Laboratories_Bolster_Nations_Testing)
to public health laboratories on May 1 (at 141 cases and [one
death](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/updates/050109.htm)) and a second
test was
[approved](https://web.archive.org/web/20090729221914/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm173543.htm)
in July. From May to September 2009, the agency shipped more than 1,000
kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.

Different tests developed by companies also came into widespread use,
though researchers found [flaws and limitations in
them.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/08/06/health/06flu.html)
A vaccine became available in early October but, amid reports of
shortages, President Obama
[declared](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/10/25/us/politics/25flu.html)
the outbreak a national emergency later that month. The [estimated death
toll](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21342903) in the United States
from the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010.

What the Facts
Are

## Mr. Trump inaccurately described a website in development to mitigate the outbreak.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website, it’s
going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine
whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby
convenient location.”*

**This is misleading.** Mr. Trump misstated the company developing the
website and exaggerated its scope. After Mr. Trump spoke, Google issued
a statement on Twitter from Verily, a separate subsidiary of Google’s
parent company.

“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19
testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to
roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more
broadly over time,” [the statement
read](https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1238574670686928906).

A spokeswoman for Verily said it had originally intended for the website
to be used only by health care workers. Mr. Trump’s statement prompted
the company to make it available to the public. The site will direct
people to “pilot sites” for testing in the Bay Area, the spokeswoman
said. If the pilot goes well, Verily aims to deploy the project
nationwide, but there is no timetable for a national rollout.

what the facts
are

## Mr. Trump again mischaracterized travel restrictions imposed on certain European countries.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and
we closed that border a while ago.”*

**This is misleading.** Mr. Trump [imposed some travel
restrictions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-certain-additional-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/)
on 26 European countries on Wednesday night, but those restrictions do
not go into effect until midnight on Friday and do not amount to a total
shutting down of the border.

The restrictions bar the entry of foreign nationals who have been to any
of the 26 countries that make up Europe’s Schengen Area of open borders
within 14 days. That area does not include more than 20 other European
countries, including Britain. The proclamation also does not apply to
American citizens, permanent residents, their immediate families, or
those who are members of air or sea crews.

waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that
has happened in the not-so-distant
past.”*

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

**This is exaggerated.** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
[expanded access to telehealth
services](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/telehealth-benefits-medicare-are-lifeline-patients-during-coronavirus-outbreak)
— for example, virtual check-ins and telephone consultations with
doctors — for Medicare beneficiaries this week. But these technologies
[have
been](https://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_telemedicine_2010.pdf#page=11)
[in use](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45445/) [since
the 1960s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207141/).

The University of Nebraska used video links to provide exams and
diagnoses with a state hospital 112 miles away in 1964. Three years
later, the University of Miami and a local fire department transmitted
cardiac rhythms using radio channels. Federal agencies initiated a host
of other services in the 1970s and 1980s.

A 1997 government [report](https://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/ns9767.pdf)
noted a severely injured sailor aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln was
able to be treated by a doctor in San Diego 6,000 miles away through
telemedicine. By 2014, “more than 20 federal agencies were engaged in
some aspect of telehealth,” [according to the Congressional Research
Service](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/757e3b90-ff10-497c-8e8c-ac1bdbdb3aaf.pdf),
with the Department of Veterans Affairs providing more than 2.1 million
telehealth consultations in the 2015 fiscal year.

## Mr. Trump said he was not responsible for disbanding the White House’s pandemic team.

what Mr. Trump said

*“When you say me, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could ask
— perhaps my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that
because I don’t know anything about it.”*

**This is misleading.** The top White House official tasked with leading
the country’s response to a pandemic left the administration in May 2018
and his team was disbanded by Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at
the time, John R. Bolton, [The Washington Post has
reported.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/)

While there is no evidence that Mr. Trump personally directed the
ousting of these officials, he also did not replace them in the nearly
two years since, despite repeated bipartisan urgings from
[lawmakers](https://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/021320%20NSC%20Novel%20Coronavirus%20Letter%20final%20pdf.pdf)
and
[experts](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/191122_EndingTheCycle_GHSC_WEB_FULL_11.22.pdf?utm_campaign=wp_the_health_202&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_health202#page=31).

What the Facts
Are

## Mr. Trump announced his administration would temporarily waive interest on some student loans.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“To help our students and their families, I have waived interest that
all student loans held by federal government agencies, and that will be
until further notice.”*

**This needs context.** Interest rates will be temporarily waived for
borrowers, but [their monthly payments will not actually
decrease](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/business/live-stock-market.html#link-6b9e26b3),
according to a Department of Education spokeswoman. Instead, borrowers’
full payments will go toward the principal on their loans.

The waiver also does not cover student loans issued through state
agencies, big private lenders, a majority of Federal Family Education
Loans or school-held Perkins loans.
