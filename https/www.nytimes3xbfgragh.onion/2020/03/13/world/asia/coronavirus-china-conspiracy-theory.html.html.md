# China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic

</div>

After criticizing American officials for politicizing the pandemic,
Chinese officials and news outlets have floated unfounded theories that
the United States was the source of the virus.

BEIJING — China is pushing a new theory about the origins of [the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage):
It is an American disease that might have been introduced by members of
the United States Army who visited Wuhan in October.

There is not a shred of evidence to support that, but the notion
received an official endorsement from China’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, whose spokesman accused American officials of not coming clean
about what they know about [the
disease](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/coronavirus-news.html).

*\[Read:* [*As its coronavirus cases dwindle, China is turning its focus
outward*](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/world/asia/coronavirus-china-aid.html)*.\]*

The intentional spreading of an unfounded conspiracy theory — which
recirculated on China’s tightly controlled internet on Friday —
punctuated a downward spiral in relations between the two countries that
has been fueled by the basest instincts of officials on both sides.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The insinuation came in a series of posts on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, a
ministry spokesman who has made good use of the platform, which is
blocked in China, to push a newly aggressive, and hawkish, diplomatic
strategy. It is most likely intended to deflect attention from [China’s
own
missteps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
in the early weeks of the epidemic by sowing confusion or, at least,
uncertainty at home and abroad.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Zhao’s posts appeared to be a retort to similarly unsubstantiated
theories about the origins of the outbreak that have spread in the
United States. Senior officials there have called the epidemic the
“Wuhan virus,” and at least one senator [hinted
darkly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html)
that the epidemic began with the leak of a Chinese biological weapon.

*\[Read:* [*Two women fell sick from the coronavirus. One
survived.*](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html)*\]*

“The conspiracy theories are a new, low front in what they clearly
perceive as a global competition over the narrative of this crisis,”
said Julian B. Gewirtz, a scholar at the Weatherhead Center for
International Affairs at Harvard.

“There are a few Chinese officials who appear to have gone to the Donald
J. Trump School of Diplomacy,” added Mr. Gewirtz, who recently
[published a
paper](https://academic.oup.com/past/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pastj/gtz068/5780302)on
China’s handling of the AIDS epidemic, after a similar disinformation
campaign. “This small cadre of high-volume Chinese officials don’t seem
to realize that peddling conspiracy theories is totally self-defeating
for China, at a moment when it wants to be seen as a positive
contributor around the world.”

The circulation of disinformation is not a new tactic for the Communist
Party state. The United States, in particular, is often a foil of
Chinese propaganda efforts. Last year, Beijing [explicitly
accused](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/05/world/asia/china-hong-kong-protests.html)
the American government of supporting public protests in Hong Kong in an
effort to weaken the party’s
rule.

The old tactic has been amplified by more combative public diplomacy and
a new embrace of a social media platform that is blocked in China to
spread a message abroad.

Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California at
San Diego who studies Chinese politics, said that while the campaign was
very likely an attempt to distract and deflect blame, a more worrisome
possibility was that some officials fabricated the idea and persuaded
top leaders to believe it.

“If the leadership really believes in the culpability of the U.S.
government,” he warned, “it may behave in a way that dramatically
worsens the bilateral relationship.”

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has faced sharp criticism for the
government’s initial handling of the outbreak, even at home.[Public
anger
erupted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html)
in February when a doctor who was punished for warning his colleagues
about the coronavirus died, prompting censors to redouble their efforts
to stifle public
criticism.

Chinese officials have repeatedly urged officials in other countries not
to politicize what is a public health emergency. Conservatives in the
United States, in particular, have latched on to loaded terms that have
been criticized for stigmatizing the Chinese people. Secretary of [State
Mike Pompeo referred to the “Wuhan
virus,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/us/politics/wuhan-virus.html?searchResultPosition=1)while
Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called it the
“Chinese coronavirus.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In response, Chinese officials and state news media have stepped up
their criticism of American officials’ comments.

Only days before Mr. Zhao’s latest post, the Xinhua news agency
published a commentary denouncing “Washington’s poisonous coronavirus
politics” and warning that spreading rumors simply encouraged “fear,
division and hate.”

“Their dangerously irresponsible statements are highly counterproductive
at this drastic hour that demands solidarity and cooperation,” [the
commentary](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/09/c_138859548.htm),
written by Gao Wencheng, said, “and could be much more menacing than the
virus itself.”

The coronavirus, according to all evidence, emanated from Wuhan, China,
in late December. Scientists have not yet identified a “patient zero” or
a precise source of the virus, though preliminary studies have linked it
to a virus in bats that passed through another mammal before infecting
humans.

A senior official of China’s National Health Commission, Liang Wannian,
said at [a
briefing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/24/world/asia/china-coronavirus-world-health-organization.html)
in Beijing last month that the likely carrier was [a
pangolin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/opinion/coronavirus-china-pangolins.html),
an endangered species that is trafficked almost exclusively to China for
its meat and for its scales, which are prized for use in traditional
medicine.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

The first cluster of patients was reported at the [Huanan Seafood
Wholesale
Marke](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html)t,
and studies have since suggested that the virus could have been
introduced there by someone already infected. Wuhan and the surrounding
province of Hubei account for the [overwhelming
amount](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
of cases and deaths, so there is no scientific reason to believe the
virus began elsewhere.

Mr. Zhao’s assertion began with a post linking to a video of the
director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert
R. Redfield, testifying before the House on Wednesday and suggesting
that some flu deaths might have been caused by the
coronavirus.

“When did patient zero begin in US?” Mr. Zhao wrote on Twitter, first in
English and separately in Chinese. “How many people are infected. What
are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the
epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent\! Make public your date\! US owe us an
explanation.”

Mr. Zhao appeared to refer to the[Military World
Games](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/CISM-Military-World-Games/),
which were held in Wuhan in October. The Pentagon sent 17 teams with
more than 280 athletes and other staff members to the event, well before
any reported outbreaks. The Pentagon has had confirmed cases in South
Korea and Italy and is [bracing for more to
emerge,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/12/us/politics/military-virus-pentagon.html)but
no illnesses have been tied to American service members from October.

Mr. Zhao’s remarks were spread on China’s most prominent social media
platform, Weibo, under a hashtag:
\#ZhaoLijianPostedFiveTweetsinaRowQuestioningAmerica. By late afternoon
on Friday, that hashtag had been viewed more than 160 million times,
along with screenshots of the original Twitter posts.

The State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador on Friday to
protest Mr. Zhao’s comments, officials in the Trump administration said.

At the regular briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday,
another spokesman, Geng Shuang, sidestepped three questions about
whether Mr. Zhao’s suggestion had politicized the crisis and reflected
official Chinese policy.

He instead noted the statements made by American officials and lawmakers
to “smear and attack” China.

“We are firmly opposed to this,” he said. “In fact, the international
community, including the United States at home, have different views on
the source of the virus. What I have been saying in recent days is that
the Chinese side always believed that this is a scientific issue and
requires scientific and professional opinions.”
