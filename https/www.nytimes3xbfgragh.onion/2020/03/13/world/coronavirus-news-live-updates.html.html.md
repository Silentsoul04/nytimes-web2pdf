Congress and the White House [struck a deal on
Friday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-relief-congress.html)
on a sweeping relief package to assist people affected by the outbreak
of the coronavirus, moving to confront a growing pandemic that has
upended lives and wreaked havoc on financial markets.

The House was set to vote on the plan on Friday evening, after a
roller-coaster day of negotiations that threatened to veer off track as
President Trump criticized the plan during a White House Rose Garden
news conference in which he declared a national emergency.

Instead, by dusk, Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to House Democrats saying,
“We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to
resolve outstanding challenges.”

Not long after, even as congressional and administration aides
negotiated the final legislative language of the compromise, Steven
Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, confirmed it would move forward.

“We have an agreement that reflects what the president talked about in
his speech the other night,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox News. He said Mr.
Trump was focused on making sure “hard-working Americans don’t lose
their compensation because they have to be home.”

The measure includes two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months
of paid family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits, free
virus testing including for those who lack insurance, additional food
aid and federal funds for Medicaid.

The deal is a product of an intense round of talks that unfolded between

report a known case of the virus by Friday evening. The United States is
facing the prospect that those numbers could grow exponentially, as they
did in China, Italy, South Korea and other countries.

Mr. Trump on Friday afternoon officially declared a national emergency
that he said would give states and territories access to up to $50
billion in federal funds to combat the spreading coronavirus epidemic.

In a live address in the White House Rose Garden, he also gave broad new
authority to the health secretary, Alex Azar, who he said would now be
able to waive regulations, giving doctors and hospitals more flexibility
to respond to the virus, including making it easier to treat people
remotely.

“I am officially declaring a national emergency, two very big words,”
Mr. Trump said, adding, “I’m urging every state to set up emergency
operations centers effective immediately.”

Mr. Trump said he was waiving interest on student loans, and that with
oil prices low, the government would buy large quantities of crude oil
for the nation’s strategic reserve.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His comments marked the first time he has addressed the coronavirus as a
problem within the country’s borders, not just something that needed to
be kept out with travel restrictions. But the optics of the address
offered a contrast to the social distancing that many experts recommend:
Mr. Trump and the top advisers he invited to speak crowded together
around the lectern and shared a microphone.

Mr. Trump, who has been accused of downplaying the crisis, said that
millions of virus testing kits would become available, but added that he
did not think so many would be needed.

“We don’t want everybody taking this test,” he said. “It’s totally
unnecessary.”

“This will pass, this will pass through, and we will be even stronger
for it,” the president said.

Asked if he would be tested for the coronavirus because of his contact
at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, with an infected Brazilian official,
he said, “most likely, yeah,” countering earlier White House statements
that he would not be tested.

“I think I will do it anyway,” he said. “Fairly
soon.”

The S\&P 500 rose more than 9 percent, with most of the gains coming as

Financial markets have been nothing if not inconsistent for the past

them.

The government gave the Swiss health care giant Roche emergency
permission to sell its three-and-a-half-hour test to U.S. labs, and said
it was awarding over a million dollars to two companies to accelerate
development of one-hour
tests.

“I don’t take responsibility at all,” President Trump said in response
to a reporter’s question on Friday, “because we were given a set of
circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications
from a different time.”

While South Korea is testing 10,000 people a day, overall U.S. state and
federal testing has yet to log even 15,000, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi highlighted the urgency on Friday, while discussing
an emergency spending package she said the House would pass later in the
day, saying, “The three most important parts of this bill are testing,
testing, testing.”

On Friday, the federal government said that it would allow New York
State’s public health department to authorize local labs to perform
coronavirus tests.

By next week, New York could be conducting 6,000 tests a day, the
governor said. On Friday, the state opened a “drive through” testing
facility in New Rochelle, a city north of New York City [that has been

“I want to thank Google,” Mr. Trump said from the Rose Garden. “Google
is helping to develop a website, it’s going to be very quickly done,
unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted
and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”

Google’s shares surged, to a gain of more than 9 percent, as Mr. Trump
spoke.

Late Friday, Carolyn Wang, a spokeswoman for Verily, said that the aim
was to make a website that helps triage people for virus screening
available by Monday, but that it would be limited to testing sites in
the Bay Area. If the pilot goes well, Verily aims to deploy the project
nationwide, but there is no timetable for a national rollout.

Trying to answer that question, epidemiologists arrived at some
terrifying estimates of what would happen if — and this was a very big
“if” — nothing was done to stop the spread: more than a million
Americans could die, and hospitals would be swamped with many times more
patients than beds.

Last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and experts from around the world conferred quietly about the range of
possibilities, with what was known then about the virus. The agency
presented a range of possibilities based on variables that remain hard
to pin down, like how contagious the virus is, and how severe the
resulting illnesses are.

A key, unknown factor is how quickly the virus would spread, which could
determine whether a medical system [with fewer than a million hospital
beds](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals) could
handle the wave of patients.

The estimates were 160 million to 214 million people in the United
States infected, or nearly half to two-thirds of the population; 2.4
million to 21 million people needing hospitalization; and 200,000 to 1.7
million dead. The results were not publicized, but have been reviewed by
The New York Times.

Those figures represented the worst-case scenario, with no organized

are private organizations and individuals. But they give an idea of the
potential seriousness of the disease.

Local officials in Washington State recently settled on two locations to
house people exposed to the coronavirus who may have no safe place to
isolate themselves: a former Econo Lodge Motel in the city of Kent,
south of Seattle, and another location in an unincorporated part of the
county, both of which serve mostly lower-income neighborhoods.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The plan [quickly ran into
trouble](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-seattle-isolation-housing.html).
Kent’s mayor, Dana Ralph, said that neither of the two communities had
experienced any cases of the virus before the new facilities opened, and
that residents of her town have wondered if their city was chosen to
protect wealthier neighborhoods around Seattle.

Residents and political leaders circulated petitions, complaining that
their communities were becoming sacrifice zones for the coronavirus and
warning that businesses could suffer and neighbors could become
infected.

Then on Friday some of their fears were confirmed: One of the first
residents at the converted motel, a homeless person who was awaiting the
results of a coronavirus test, ignored the instructions of a security
guard and wandered away, eventually taking a northbound bus, King County
officials said in a statement.

The bus was taken out of service for cleaning and sanitation; the
community was still reeling.

A County Council member, Girmay Zahilay, said that even in a health
crisis, the county has an obligation to all of its residents.

“During this unprecedented crisis, we have to make sure that the
consequences of our decisions don’t fall on the most vulnerable and
marginalized communities,” he said. “That’s how we all get through this
together.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The revelation comes as the Bureau of Prisons, which runs the federal
prisons that hold more than 175,000 people, suspended all visits to
prisoners for 30 days, including most by lawyers. The bureau said the
densely packed nature of prisons “creates a risk of infection and
transmission for inmates and staff.”

In Washington State, where more than 30 people have died from the virus,
more than anywhere else in the country, public health officials have
escalated through most of a 13-step strategy checklist for controlling
infectious outbreaks and now have only a few remaining options: closing
workplaces, restricting people to their homes and cordoning off targeted
areas to help control the spread of infection, measures that have
already been put in place in other parts of the world.

The possibility of more draconian measures if the outbreak continues to
escalate has become a rising subject of conversation among public health
officials across the country, forcing them to confront difficult
questions about how much pain to endure — in their local economies and
in civil liberties — to save more lives.

Political leaders are considering their options, alarmed over research
that suggests 400 people in the Seattle area could die in the coming
weeks if the trajectory of the outbreak cannot be altered. The research
shows that if policymakers could reduce the transmission rate by 75
percent — primarily through what is known as “social distancing” — then
the number of deaths could be reduced to only about 30 in that period.

One official said that none of the options were off the table, but that
officials were mindful of the tremendous burden that such restrictions

other policymakers, the cases vividly illustrate how no one is immune
from a virus that does not distinguish between the powerful and everyone
else.

The risk is that entire cabinets or senior government officials could be
sidelined at once, potentially undermining an already complex response.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said on Friday he would extend
his self-quarantine to March 17 after learning he had come into contact
with a second individual who has tested positive, though he still had no
symptoms. Two other Republican senators, Rick Scott of Florida and
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have also preemptively isolated
themselves after exposure to
others.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Friday that the country
would be [placed under a state of emergency for 15
days](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-emergency.html),
which could allow his government to restrict the movement of citizens,
ration goods and impose other measures to fight the spread of the new
coronavirus.

The decision came as Spain’s caseload rose to about 4,200 cases, the
most in Europe after Italy’s more than 17,600. The Spanish death toll
reached 120 on Friday.

postponed*](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-funerals.html)*.\]*

European caseloads overall jumped to more than 35,000 on Friday, nearly
double the number three days earlier. France’s case count rose by 800,
reaching more than 3,600. Germany’s rose by a similar number to more
than 3,100.

Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people in northeastern Spain,
announced a broad lockdown late Friday, saying it would start to
“restrict entrances and departures.” It did not offer details.

In a brief televised address, Mr. Sánchez said that the state of
emergency would come into force on Saturday, and that it was designed to
use “all the resources of the state to protect better the citizens,
especially those who are most vulnerable to the
virus.”

## Louisiana will postpone its April 4 primary, becoming the first state to do so.

Louisiana will postpone its April 4 primary election for two months,
becoming the first state to adjust its elections in response to the
coronavirus outbreak. The presidential primary will now be held on June
20, and municipal elections on July 25.

Concern for public health, and particularly the health of poll workers —
whom are mostly senior citizens — led officials to decide on postponing
the primary. The state’s decision to postpone elections after Hurricane
Katrina in 2005 was a precedent, the secretary of state, R. Kyle Ardoin,
said at a news conference.
