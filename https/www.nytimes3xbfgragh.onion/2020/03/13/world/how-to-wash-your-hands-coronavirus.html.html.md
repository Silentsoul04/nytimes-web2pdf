It’s one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself,
your family and your community. And if you’re like us, you’ve probably
been doing it

*We asked the experts how to wash our hands. After they taught us the
proper technique (above), we had a few more questions:*

**Will touching the wet faucet really ruin everything?**

Yes.

The faucet may have the same germs you started with\! Use a tissue or
paper towel to turn it off once your hands are clean. You don’t want to
begin again, do you?

**How hard do I have to scrub?**

Most people don’t rub vigorously enough, said Barbara Smith, a nurse
epidemiologist and infection prevention specialist at Mount Sinai Health
Systems in New<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>York.

When you wash your hands, you are using soap and water to physically
dislodge germs from your skin and then rinse them
away.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

**Do I really have to dry my hands all the way?**

Most people don’t dry thoroughly enough. **** Germs love moisture. And
don’t be afraid to use a little force here too: You are physically
removing whatever germs
remain.

**Do I have to use paper towels?**

No. Cloth towels are fine for personal use, but should be washed every
few days — more if multiple people use the same towel. A sick person
should use a separate towel. Use paper towels for guests\!

**What about an air dryer?**

In terms of hygiene, [paper towels are
best](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961200393X).
Hand dryers are OK, so long as you dry your hands thoroughly. There is
inconclusive research that suggests a higher germ concentration around
some hand dryers, but using a hand dryer is definitely better than
wiping your hands on your pants.

**What’s the best way to know you’ve washed for 20 seconds?**

One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand…

</div>

</div>

**Does it matter what kind of soap I use?**

Liquid soap is best. Bar soap is fine too, just don’t let it sit around
in a gloppy dish. Remember: germs love moisture.

**When should I be washing my hands?**

  - Before you leave the house (to protect others from your germs).

  - And when you arrive at your destination (to wash off germs you’ve
    picked up from door knobs, elevator buttons, public transportation,
    etc.)

  - Before and after you eat or prepare food.

  - Before and after you clean your home.

  - After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.

  - After you use the bathroom or change a diaper.

  - After you feed or touch a pet.

**What about lotion for dry hands?**

Yes, but use your own personal supply (most lotion does not contain
antibacterial agents, so it should not be shared). And don’t forget to
keep the bottle and dispenser
clean\!

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

**Can I still paint my nails?**

Yes, but it’s best to keep your nails short and your manicure fresh.
Germs can live in cracked and chipped polish.

**What’s the technique with hand sanitizer?**

Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, and
scrub your hands the same way you would with soap and water. Be sure to
use enough liquid so you can reach every surface of your hands.

*Note:* If you’ve seen the recipe circulating on social media for
homemade sanitizer using aloe vera gel and rubbing alcohol, we tried it
and it didn’t work. You’ll just wind up with a batch of diluted alcohol.

**Is hand-washing really that important?**

“Your hands carry almost all your germs to your respiratory tract.
Keeping them as clean as possible is really helpful,” said Dr. Adit
Ginde, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado
School of Medicine. “It would dramatically reduce transmission if people
did it well.”
