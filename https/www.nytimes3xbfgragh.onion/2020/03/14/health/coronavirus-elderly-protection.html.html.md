# How to Protect Older People From the Coronavirus

People over 60, and especially over 80, are particularly vulnerable to
severe or fatal infection. Here are some steps to reduce their risk.

Amid the uncertainty swirling around the coronavirus pandemic stands one
incontrovertible fact: The highest rate of fatalities is among older
people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions.

Of the confirmed cases in
[China](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/)
to date, nearly 15 percent of patients over 80 have died. For those
under 50, the death rate was well below 1 percent.

There is no evidence yet that older people are significantly more likely
to acquire the coronavirus than younger people. But medical experts say
that if people over 60 are infected, they are more likely to have
severe, life-threatening disease, even if their general health is good.
Older people with underlying medical conditions are at particularly high
risk. Experts attribute some of the risk to a weakening of the immune
system with age.

This leaves older people and their families wondering what extra
precautions they should take. Several best practices have been
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World
Health Organization, geriatricians and infectious diseases specialists.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Familiarize yourself with guidelines and follow them.

Geriatricians recommend their patients adhere to current recommendations
from the
[C.D.C](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#who-is-higher-risk).
and W.H.O., a litany of advice that has become all too familiar: Wash
your hands frequently with soap and warm water for 20 seconds (the time
it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice) or clean them with
alcohol-based hand gel; avoid handshakes; stay away from large
gatherings; clean and disinfect objects that are touched frequently; and
avoid public transportation and crowds. Stock up on supplies.

Cruises are out, as is nonessential travel. Visits with grandchildren
are ill-advised.

“I’ve had this conversation about a hundred times in the last week,”
said Dr. Elizabeth Eckstrom, chief of geriatrics at Oregon Health &
Science University in Portland. Dr. Eckstrom said most of the patients
she sees in her clinic are over 80. All of them have made their worry
plain.

And all of her patients, Dr. Eckstrom said, have at least one chronic
condition. “Most of them have three, four, five or more,” she added.

People are wrong to assume that if an underlying condition is well

conditions that are stable should take extra precautions.

“These conditions can limit underlying reserve and lead to worse
outcomes when older people become severely ill, which taxes all organ

at Zuckerberg San Francisco General
Hospital.

“For example, diabetes can make it harder to fight infection, and
underlying heart or lung disease may make it more difficult for those
organs to keep up with demands created by a serious Covid-19 infection,”
she said, referring to the syndrome caused by the new coronavirus.

Dr. Daniel Winetsky, an infectious diseases fellow at Columbia
University in New York, said his advice to his own parents, who live
across the country in San Francisco, has shifted dramatically. A week
ago, he said, he was reassuring them about their safety, even
encouraging them to go ahead with a trip they were planning to the
Florida Everglades with a small tour group.

Over the weekend, his fears about the pandemic rose, and by Tuesday not
only was he telling them not to go, but he also was advising them to
reduce to a minimum the number of people they came into contact with.
Visits with grandchildren are verboten.

Dr. Winetsky told his mother, Carol, who is 73 and has asthma, to stop
meeting with her biweekly knitting group. And he instructed his father,
Hank, who has had two coronary stents, not to attend either of his two
book group meetings.

His mother continues to go to the grocery store, while avoiding crowded
places like Costco. With her son’s permission, she still goes to
physical therapy for a back injury, but she is careful to make sure the
therapist washes her hands and that the equipment gets wiped down with
disinfectant.

## What about nonessential doctor’s appointments?

Some experts are recommending that older adults at risk cancel
nonessential doctor’s appointments, including wellness visits.
Telemedicine sessions, if available, are often a reasonable substitute.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Eckstrom generally agrees, but with caveats. While it might be
prudent to cancel wellness and other visits that are not urgent, she
said, “many older adults have issues that require regular follow up,
such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease, falls, heart problems.” She
worries that skipping visits might allow these conditions to spiral out
of control, but agrees that telemedicine can usually bridge the gap.

Another helpful step: talking to your doctor about stockpiling two or
three months of any critical prescription
medicines.

## Beware of social isolation.

Experts warn that social distancing, the cornerstone of epidemic
control, could lead to social isolation, already a problem in the older
population. According to a [recent Pew Research
Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/10/older-people-are-more-likely-to-live-alone-in-the-u-s-than-elsewhere-in-the-world/)
study of more than 130 countries and territories, 16 percent of people
60 and older live alone. Loneliness, [researchers have
found](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/06/health/lonliness-aging-health-effects.html),
comes with its own set of health hazards.

Dr. Winetsky is aware of the danger, and has suggested to his parents
that they switch to virtual meetings with friends and relatives, with
the benefits of social engagement in mind. “I’ve tried to frame it as,
‘Don’t cancel these things, but change to Zoom or Skype or FaceTime,’”
he said.

April Vollmer, 68, an artist who lives in New York, flew to California
in November for an extended stay with her 91-year-old father, who lives
in Santa Cruz. She has yet to leave.

Just when she was planning last month to fly back to New York, she said,
where she has a husband, friends and a rich cultural life, the
coronavirus hit. Now she oversees her father’s home health aides and
takes long walks along the bluffs above the Pacific, a “virus-free”
activity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Recently Ms. Vollmer got an email from a friend of her father’s who last
year decided to move to assisted living. “The home has canceled group
events, and residents are eating alone in their rooms,” Ms. Vollmer
said. “Seems like a bigger change there than for someone living at
home.”

## Have a talk with home health aides.

The National Association for Home Care & Hospice estimates that 12
million “vulnerable persons of all ages” in the U.S. receive care in
their homes, delivered by a home care work force of approximately 2.2
million people. For many older adults, that means a steady parade of
home health aides trooping through the door, some more mindful of
hygiene than others.

People should have conversations with their caregivers about hygiene,
suggested Dr. David Nace, president-elect of the Society for Post-Acute
and Long-Term Care Medicine, a professional group that represents
practitioners working in long-term care
facilities.

Double-check that aides are washing their hands or using hand gel. Any
equipment they bring in should be wiped down with disinfectant. And make
sure they are feeling healthy.

“If you’re by yourself, you may be in a very vulnerable position because
you’re dependent upon that person,” Dr. Nace said. “It can feel
intimidating. But hopefully there’s a good enough relationship that you
can open the
conversation.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Adam Henick, an investor who lives on the Upper East Side in Manhattan,
said his father, 92, and mother, 88, live in an apartment a block away,
and aides come through every day. Only one wears a mask, he said.

“In a perfect world, no one would enter the apartment without putting a
mask on,” said Mr. Henick. “But it’s better than being in a nursing
home.”

## The nursing home conundrum.

Some 1.7 million people, mostly older, are in nursing homes in the U.S.,
a fraction of the 50 million Americans over age 65.

Given the rash of deaths at [a nursing home in Kirkland,
Wash.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/us/coronavirus-nursing-home.html),
hit hard by the virus, nursing homes are on high alert. Many have gone
into full lockdown mode.

The federal government is telling nursing homes to bar all visitors,
making exceptions only “for compassionate care, such as end of life
situations.”

Curtis Wong, 66, a retired Microsoft researcher who lives in the Seattle
area, used to visit his parents often. They are in their 90s and live in
an assisted living facility in Sierra Madre, Calif.

On Thursday, the facility prohibited all nonmedical visits and said it
was changing its building entrance codes. In an email announcing the
measure, the facility’s management offered to put residents in touch
with family members via FaceTime.

Three days ago, Mr. Wong said, during a video chat with his father, “I
worried I might not see him again. Things got very
emotional.”

Cathy Johnson, who lives outside of Boston, is trying to take matters
into her own hands. Ms. Johnson is the primary caregiver for her
96-year-old father, who lives nearby in an independent living facility
with 2,200 residents. Two cases of coronavirus have been reported in the
area and Ms. Johnson, worried that the facility might shut its doors to
visitors, has been planning to extract her father and bring him to live
at her house.

“I actually think that’s not unreasonable, if it’s in your community and
you have the ability to care safely for that person in your house,” said
Dr. Nace.

But so far, Ms. Johnson’s father, wedded to place and routine, is
refusing to leave the facility.

## Stay active, even in a pandemic.

Geriatricians fear that social distancing may affect routines in ways
that can compromise the vitality of older adults. They emphasize the
importance of maintaining good habits, including sufficient sleep,
healthful eating and exercise.

Exercise may be beneficial in fighting the effects of coronavirus. It
can help boost the body’s immune functions, decrease inflammation and
have mental and emotional benefits. A patient who relies on daily
exercise at the gym but is trying to avoid risky situations might simply
go for a walk.

On Wednesday afternoon, Hank Winetsky, 80, had just returned from a
round of golf with a small group. His foursome ranged in age from 70 to
81. “Golf is pretty safe when it comes to human contact,” he said.

But even golf proved not to be a contact-free sport. “There was a bottle
of water on the cart, and everybody thought it was their own bottle,” he
said. “All four of us drank out of it. Now we’re all freaked out.”
