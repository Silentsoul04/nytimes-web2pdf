With works like Barcelona's Olympic Stadium, he combined a respect for
older traditions with bold expressions of the new. He had contracted the
coronavirus in his native Italy.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Vittorio Gregotti, an Italian modernist architect, theorist and city
planner whose monumental projects included opera houses, arenas --- like
Barcelona's Olympic Stadium --- and even an entire suburb, died on
Sunday at a hospital in Milan. He was 92.

Mr. Gregotti had been infected by the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus}{coronavirus}
and died of pneumonia, according to Michele Reginaldi, a former partner
at his firm. Mr. Gregotti's wife, Marina Mazza, was hospitalized with
\href{https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions}{Covid-19},
the disease caused by the virus, Italian news reports said.

As of Monday, Italy had recorded more than 24,700 confirmed cases of
Covid-19 --- the most outside of China --- with more than 1,800 of them
fatal.

Dario Franceschini, Italy's minister of cultural heritage, described Mr.
Gregotti in a
\href{https://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Comunicati/visualizza_asset.html_1827386555.html}{statement}
as ``a great Italian architect and urban planner who has given prestige
to our country in the world.''

Mr. Gregotti's buildings, and many of those designed by his firm,
Gregotti Associatti International, combined a reverence for older
architectural styles with an embrace of the new. His large-scale
constructions, which often housed cultural and athletic organizations,
typically conveyed a sense of grandeur but nevertheless complemented
rather than eclipsed their often antique surroundings.

Perhaps the best example of Mr. Gregotti's approach was his renovation
of Barcelona's Olympic Stadium, which was built for an exhibition in
1929 and fell into disrepair after hosting the Mediterranean Games in
1955. Mr. Gregotti chose to preserve the original walls and towers of
the stadium --- on Montjuïc, the hill overlooking Barcelona --- while
completely revamping the interior.

The architect Neil Wilson wrote in the British newspaper The Independent
in 1989, before Mr. Gregotti had finished the stadium, that those who
had been present there in 1929 would recognize ``the same sweeping
amphitheater reminiscent of a Roman circus, the neo-Classical appearance
of arches and lofty towers in soft yellow stone.''

Mr. Gregotti's cultural projects include, in France, a mountainous cafe
au lait-colored structure surrounding a garnet bowl-shaped concert hall
for the
\href{http://www.aixenprovence.fr/Grand-Theatre-de-Provence}{Grand
Théâtre de Provence}; and, in Italy, the
\href{http://teatroarcimboldi.it/index.php}{Teatro degli Arcimboldi}, a
granite-and-plaster opera house and concert hall in Milan that seats
more than 2,300. It became the city's foremost opera house for a time
when La Scala closed for renovations in 2002.

Mr. Gregotti and his firm were also city planners, helping to redesign a
formerly industrial area in Milan's Bicocca district and creating
Pujiang New Town, a
\href{http://travel.cnn.com/shanghai/visit/shanghais-italian-town-224942/}{Shanghai
suburb} built around Italian architectural principles.

He collaborated with Manuel Salgado on the
\href{https://www.ccb.pt/Default/pt/Inicio/Institucional/Historial}{Belém
Cultural Center} in Lisbon, Portugal, a collection of buildings designed
for meetings, exhibitions and performances. The complex, sprawling over
hundreds of thousands of square feet, was built mainly out of blocks of
lightly-colored limestone, a material that allowed it to blend in with
the older buildings around them.

Mr. Gregotti closed his firm in 2017, saying that he thought practical
architecture was no longer valued and that he disagreed with the
fanciful direction the field had taken. He told the Italian newspaper La
Stampa in 2019 that ``architects are only creating images, to amaze,
rather than propose projects'' and that contemporary architecture had
lost touch with ``the idea that this profession has at its base a
collective product and must answer to specific social needs, tied to
places and their history.''

Vittorio Gregotti was born on Aug. 10, 1927, in Novara, in Italy's
northwestern Piedmont region. He earned an architecture degree from the
Polytechnic University of Milan in 1952.

Mr. Gregotti worked for
\href{https://www.casatigallery.com/designers/studio-bbpr/}{B.B.P.R.},
an architecture and design studio in the city, where Ernesto Rogers
became his mentor. He founded his own firm in 1974. He served as the
editor in chief of the Italian architecture magazine Casabella during
the 1950s and '60s, wrote books about architecture theory, taught
architecture at various universities and twice directed the visual arts
section of the Venice Biennale during the 1970s.

Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available.

In 2002, the \href{http://teatroarcimboldi.it/index.php}{Teatro degli
Arcimboldi} closed briefly after a 440-pound light panel had fallen from
the ceiling during a performance. Audience members had been evacuated
after one of them noticed that the panel was cracking; no one was
injured.

Mr. Gregotti acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and suggested
that the panel might have fallen because a TV crew had interfered with
it during a shoot.

When asked in an
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/03/05/arts/arts-abroad-a-proud-renovation-aside-from-that-falling-glass.html}{interview}
if he would change his design if he had to do it over again, he said,
``Of course, or I wouldn't have any fun.''
