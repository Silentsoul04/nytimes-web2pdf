The sudden and prolonged shutdown of New York City’s museums and its
iconic Broadway theaters. [Restaurants and bars also
closed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/nyregion/nyc-closing-bars-restaurants-coronavirus.html)
except for take out and delivery. Hotels struggling to stay open in the
face of a wave of canceled reservations. Movie theaters shuttered. The
evaporation of nearly all business and leisure travel to the city.

The coronavirus pandemic is all but bringing life to a halt in the
nation’s largest city, slamming the brakes on what had been a robust
economy and leaving [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus-new-york),
which has more than 25,000 restaurants and 120,000 hotel rooms,
confronting a dire threat that experts say will surely lead to sweeping
layoffs and business failures.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The fallout could be more widespread than the economic damage from
either of the past two crises the city had faced — the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in 2001 or the 2008 financial crisis — said Ronnie
Lowenstein, director of the city’s Independent Budget Office. “Economic
activity slows and time stops,” she said. “Everything gets affected.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Both of those events caused significant harm to the city’s financial
health, Ms. Lowenstein said, but in both cases the city was rescued by
huge infusions of federal aid.

But the coronavirus is spreading from coast to coast, leaving New York’s
city and state officials pleading for help in a large crowd of their
counterparts, she said.

“If it was one city under siege like 9/11, that’s one thing,” Ms.
Lowenstein said. But the coronavirus pandemic is “going to be disastrous
for a lot of economies across the country,” she added.

New York is also particularly exposed because of its heavy dependence on
domestic and foreign visitors who come to the city to watch shows, visit
museums and take advantage of its vibrant night life.

The city is likely to lose as many as 500,000 jobs in businesses that
cater to tourists and people moving about the city, said James Parrott,
director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center for New York City
Affairs at The New School. In one month, their lost wages amount to $1
billion, he added.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Parrott said that those industries included hotels, restaurants,
museums, movie and television production and ride-hailing apps like Uber
and Lyft. Some of those businesses rely so heavily on tourists and
business travelers that they probably will close and lay off most or all
of their workers, as all 19 restaurants run by Danny Meyer’s company,
Union Square Hospitality Group, [did on

location, as well as two smaller centers, in Brooklyn and Stamford,

owners.

He said that their 1,500 employees were furloughed and given two weeks’
pay but that he expected them to apply for unemployment benefits.

Mr. Tewksbury said he was unaware if any of those employees or any of
the more than 25,000 members of the three locations had tested positive
for the coronavirus.

But the decision to close, he added, was based on a concern for the
health and safety of the workers and of members, and a “social
responsibility” to be “a leader as opposed to a
follower.”

Much like it was before the coronavirus swept across the country, the
city’s economy was relatively healthy before the Sept. 11 attacks.
“But,” Mr. Parrott said, “after 9/11, people woke up and realized
that we were in a recession.”

In the wake of that shock, the New York Stock Exchange and other
financial markets shut down for a few days and air travel was disrupted
for weeks.

But the city began to recover quickly, buoyed by [support from
Washington](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/12/30/nyregion/after-9-11-parcels-of-money-and-dismay.html),
which provided billions of dollars in disaster relief. Theaters
reopened, ballgames resumed and elected officials urged New Yorkers to
go out, spend money and get back to work.

The 2008 financial crisis was centered on Wall Street, where some major
investment banks failed and others survived only through a [massive
federal
bailout](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/10/03/business/worldbusiness/03iht-bailout.4.16679355.html).

Now, with no certainty about when life might return to normal, the full
effect on the city’s economy is impossible to project, Ms. Lowenstein,
director of the city’s Independent Budget Office, said. But Mr. Parrott
said the city would almost surely fall into a recession that would end
its longest period of expansion and job growth on record — more than 10
years.

This week, the state labor department said that New York City’s
unemployment rate fell to an all-time low of 3.5 percent in January,
compared with highs of about 8.5 percent in the aftermath of Sept. 11,
and 10 percent during the financial crisis.

The ranks of the city’s unemployed peaked between 340,000 and 400,000 in

The prospects for the city’s economy has changed so abruptly as so many
venues have shut down that its tourism agency, NYC & Company, has
shelved its forecast for the year, said Fred Dixon, its chief executive.

As recently as two weeks ago, the city projected a slight increase in
visitors in 2020. But that was before travel from most of Europe was
banned. For now, Mr. Dixon said, the flow of international travelers has
virtually dried up and it is not clear when it may resume.

Without tourists or business travelers, hotels in New York are
struggling to continue operating and grappling with how many workers
they can retain, said Fred Grapstein, chairman of the Hotel Association
of New York City.

“What you’re seeing, unfortunately, is the layoff of all personnel —
both union and management,” Mr. Grapstein
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?

        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Hotel owners, he added, were negotiating with the Hotel Trades Council,
the powerful union that represents 40,000 workers, including room
cleaners, desk clerks, waiters and bartenders. “The layoffs that we’re
talking about are truly temporary, and we hope that business will pick
up again soon,” Mr. Grapstein said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Peter Ward, the union’s president, said, “The union is working
diligently with management to mitigate the consequences of this
unprecedented crisis on our members and their families.”

Mr. Grapstein said that “there has been a lot of discussion about hotels
making sure they are financially viable.” Many of them routinely lose
money in the slower months of January and February but start turning
profits as tourism picks up in the spring, he said.

“February was kind of bandaged together but things have fallen apart,”
Mr. Grapstein continued. Some hotels saw their occupancy rates fall from
70 percent to 30 percent, he said, and even lower as the news about the
spread of the coronavirus became bleaker and spurred a cascade
cancellations.

The sudden closing last week of Broadway theaters — a keystone of New
York’s tourism industry — as well as museums and other cultural
institutions, dealt a blow to restaurants, too.

Before the order to close restaurants, some, like Rosa Mexicano, which
has restaurants on the East Side of Manhattan and on the West Side near
Lincoln Center, had been trying to stay open as long as they could —
though with half as many seats.

Rosa Mexicano removed tables and chairs from its dining rooms to comply
with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s order that smaller public spaces reduce
their capacity by 50 percent, said Chris Westcott, the chief executive
of the company that operates them.

Even without the new rule, diners had already been staying away.

“Quite frankly, there wasn’t enough business to fill a lot of those
tables,” Mr. Westcott
said.

He said that on Thursday night, business was down about 60 percent at
the Lincoln Center location and about 40 percent on the East Side, a
more residential neighborhood.

Still, the company has not yet laid off any workers, opting instead to
cut their hours and to try to continue providing customers with an
atmosphere honed over 35 years: the same menu, guacamole prepared
tableside.

“Everybody still has a job,” Mr. Westcott said. “I think they all want
to work more, but we’re not in a position to keep people whole.”

Mr. Westcott, who worked for a different company in 2001, said the
current situation made it more difficult to plan than in the days after
Sept. 11. “With 9/11, we hit bottom almost immediately,” he said. “Now,
we’re still waiting to hit bottom.”

The city’s Chinatowns, in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, have been
reeling for weeks with many customers staying away after the coronavirus
started to break out in China.

Jing Fong, a large and popular dim sum restaurant in Manhattan closed —
temporarily its owners said — and laid off its entire staff of 180
employees.

Ming Lam, whose family owns Jing Fong, said business had dropped by 80
percent over the past six weeks.

Qing Chen, 59, a waiter at the restaurant, said he had applied for
unemployment but was worried about when he could start collecting
benefits and, more important, when he could go back to work. “We live in
a very confusing and worrying time,” he said.
