On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended
against any [gatherings of 50 or more
people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html)
over the next eight weeks, in an effort to contain the coronavirus
pandemic. Many public schools, libraries, universities, places of
worship, and sporting and cultural institutions have also shut down for
at least the next few weeks. These measures are an attempt to enforce
distance between people, a proven way to slow pandemics.

Experts have also been urging people to practice voluntary “[social
distancing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/bishop-gerald-glenn-coronavirus.html).”
The term has been trending on Twitter, with even President Trump
[endorsing
it](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238824050924883968) on
Saturday.

Still, people all over the United States have been out in large numbers
at restaurants, bars and even sporting events, suggesting more than a
little confusion around what social distancing is and who should be
practicing it.

This is deeply worrying, experts said, because even those who become
only mildly ill — and maybe even those who never even know they are
infected — can propel the exponential movement of the virus through the
population.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They emphasized that it’s important for everyone to practice social
distancing, not just those considered to be at high risk or who are
seriously ill.

“These are not normal times, this is not a drill,” said Dr. Jeanne
Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama
in Birmingham. “We have never been through anything like this before.”

What exactly is social distancing? We asked experts for practical
guidance.

## What is social distancing?

Put simply, the idea is to maintain a distance between you and other
people — in this case, at least six feet.

That also means minimizing contact with people. Avoid public
transportation whenever possible, limit nonessential travel, work from
home and skip social gatherings — and definitely do not go to crowded
bars and sporting arenas.

“Every single reduction in the number of contacts you have per day with
relatives, with friends, co-workers, in school will have a significant
impact on the ability of the virus to spread in the population,” said
Dr. Gerardo Chowell, chair of population health sciences at Georgia
State University.

## I’m young and don’t have any risk factors. Can I continue to socialize?

Please don’t. There is no question that older people and those with
underlying health conditions are most vulnerable to the virus, but young
people are by no means immune.

And there is a greater public health imperative. Even people who show
only mild symptoms may pass the virus to many, many others —
particularly in the early course of the infection, before they even
realize they are sick. So you might keep the chain of infection going
right to your own older or high-risk relatives. You may also contribute
to the number of people infected, causing the pandemic to grow rapidly
and overwhelm the health care system.

If you ignore the guidance on social distancing, you will essentially
put yourself and everyone else at much higher risk.

Experts acknowledged that social distancing is tough, especially for
young people who are used to gathering in groups. But even cutting down
the number of gatherings, and the number of people in any group, will
help.

## Can I leave my house?

Absolutely. The experts were unanimous in their answer to this question.

It’s O.K. to go outdoors for fresh air and exercise — to walk your dog,
go for a hike or ride your bicycle, for example. The point is not to
remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with people.

You may also need to leave the house for medicines or other essential
resources. But there are things you can do to keep yourself and others
safe during and after these excursions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When you do leave your home, wipe down any surfaces you come into
contact with, disinfect your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer and
avoid touching your face. Above all, frequently wash your hands —
especially whenever you come in from outside, before you eat or before
you’re in contact with the very old or very young.

## Can I go to the supermarket?

Yes. But buy as much as you can at a time in order to minimize the
number of trips, and pick a time when the store is least likely to be
crowded.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

When you do go, be aware that any surface inside the store may be
contaminated. Use a disinfecting wipe to clean the handle of the grocery
cart, for example. Experts did not recommend wearing gloves, but if you
do use them, make sure you don’t touch your face until you have removed
the gloves.

Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University,
recommends stowing your cellphone in an inaccessible place so that you
don’t absent-mindedly reach for it while shopping. “That could be a
transmission opportunity,” she said.

If it’s a long shopping trip, you may want to bring hand sanitizer with
you and disinfect your hands in between. And when you get home, Dr.
Rivers said, wash your hands right away.

Those at high risk may want to avoid even these outings if they can help
it, especially if they live in densely populated areas.

Dr. Marrazzo said her mother is an “incredibly healthy” 93-year-old who
usually drives herself to the store, but she said she has asked her
mother not to go out during this time, because “the risks are too great
given the age-related mortality we’re seeing.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Can I go out to dinner at a restaurant?

Some countries have closed down restaurants and bars for the next few
weeks, but there is no specific nationwide guidance yet on this in the
U.S. beyond the C.D.C.’s recommendation against gatherings of more than
50 people.

Before New York City announced it would be [shutting down restaurants
and
bars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus.html#link-709bff21),
they were supposed to be operating at half capacity to maintain social
distancing and soften the economic impact. But in small restaurants,
that may still mean you’re too close to other diners. It’s also not
possible to maintain true social distance from the people preparing or
serving the food.

In general, avoid going out to restaurants, Dr. Marrazzo said, but, “If
you’re going to go, go to some place that you trust.” Choose spacious
restaurants and ones where the staff members likely practice good
hygiene. Better yet, opt for takeout. If you’re concerned for the
restaurant’s financial future, ask about purchasing gift certificates
you can redeem
later.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

## Can family come to visit?

That depends on who is in your family and how healthy they are.

“Certainly, sick family should not visit,” said Dr. Marrazzo. “If you
have vulnerable people in your family, or who are very old, then limit
in-person contact.”

But if everyone in the family is young and healthy, then some careful
interaction in small groups is probably OK. “The smaller the gathering,
the healthier the people are to start with, the lower the risk of the
situation is going to be,” she said.

At the same time, you don’t want family members to feel isolated or not
have the support of loved ones, so check in with them by phone or plan
activities to do with them on video.

## Can I take my kids to the playground?

That depends. If your children have any illness, even if it’s not
related to the coronavirus, keep them at home.

If they seem healthy and desperately need to burn energy, outdoor
activities such as bike rides are generally OK. But “people, especially
in higher-risk areas, may want to think twice about trips to
high-traffic public areas like the playground,” said Dr. Neha Chaudhary,
a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.

Kids also tend to touch their mouths, noses and faces constantly, so
parks or playgrounds with few kids and few contaminated surfaces are
ideal. Take hand sanitizer with you and clean any surfaces with
disinfecting wipes before they play.

Serious [illness from this virus in kids is
rare](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/health/coronavirus-children.html),
so the kids themselves might be safe. “That doesn’t mean they can’t come
home and give it to Grandma,” said Dr. Marazzo.

So kids should wash their hands often, especially before they come into
contact with older or high-risk family
members.

## I’m scared to feel alone. Is there anything I can do to make this easier?

It’s a scary and uncertain time. Staying in touch with family and
friends is more important than ever, because we are biologically
hard-wired to seek each other out when we are stressed, said Dr.
Jonathan Kanter, director for the Center for Science of Social
connection at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Dr. Kanter said he was particularly worried about the long-term impact
of social isolation on both the sick and the healthy. The absence of
physical touch can have a profound impact on our stress levels, he said,
and make us feel under threat.

He said even imagining a warm embrace from a loved one can calm the
body’s fight-or-flight response.

In the meantime, we are lucky enough to have technologies at hand that
can maintain social connections. “It’s important to note that social
distancing does not mean social isolation,” Dr. Chaudhary said.

She suggested people stay connected via social media, chat and video. Be
creative: Schedule dinners with friends over FaceTime, participate in
online game nights, plan to watch television shows at the same time,
enroll in remote learning classes. It’s especially important to reach
out to those who are sick or to high-risk people who are self-isolating.
“A phone call with a voice is better than text, and a video chat is
better than a telephone call,” Dr. Kanter said.

## How long will we need to practice social distancing?

That is a big unknown, experts said. A lot will depend on how well the
social distancing measures in place work and how much we can slow the
pandemic down. But prepare to hunker down for at least a month, and
possibly much longer.

In Seattle, the recommendations on social distancing have continued to
escalate with the number of infections and deaths, and as the health
system has become increasingly strained.

“For now, it’s probably indefinite,” Dr. Marrazzo said. “We’re in
uncharted territory.”
