SEATTLE — After her shifts in the emergency room, one
[doctor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-doctors.html)
in Utah strips naked on her porch and runs straight to a shower, trying
not to contaminate her home. In Oregon, an emergency physician talks of
how he was recently bent over a drunk teenager, stapling a head wound,
when he realized with a sudden chill that the patient had a fever and a
cough. A doctor in Washington State woke up one night not long ago with
nightmares of being surrounded by coughing patients.

“Most physicians have never seen this level of angst and anxiety in
their careers,” said Dr. Stephen Anderson, a 35-year veteran of
emergency rooms in a suburb south of Seattle. “I am sort of a pariah in
my family. I am dipping myself into the swamp every day.”

As the coronavirus expands around the country, [doctors and
nurses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-doctors.html)
working in emergency rooms are suddenly wary of everyone walking in the
door with a cough, forced to make quick, harrowing decisions to help
save not only their patients’ lives, but their own.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The stress only grew on Sunday, when the American College of Emergency
Physicians revealed that two emergency medicine doctors, in New Jersey
and Washington State, were [hospitalized in critical
condition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/us/coronavirus-physicians-emergency-rooms.html)
as a result of the coronavirus. Though the virus is spreading in the
community and there was no way of ascertaining whether they were exposed
at work or somewhere else, the two cases prompted urgent new questions
among doctors about how many precautions are enough.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Now that we see front-line providers that are on ventilators, it is
really driving it home,” Dr. Anderson said.

Doctors, nurses and other staff members in a variety of hospital
departments face new uncertainty. In intensive care units, for example,
health care providers must have extended exposure to people who have
contracted the virus. But they know in advance of the risk they face.

In emergency departments, the danger comes from the unknown.

Patients arrive with symptoms but no diagnosis, and staff members must
sometimes tend to urgent needs, such as gaping wounds, before they have
time to screen a patient for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.
At times, the protocols they must follow are changing every few hours.

“Many of us have trained for disasters, like Ebola and hurricanes,” said
Dr. Adam Brown, the president of emergency medicine for Envision
Healthcare, the largest provider of contract physicians to emergency
rooms. “This is different because of the scale and scope of the
disease.”

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Add to that the shortage of protective gear and delays in testing, and
health care workers fear they are flying
blind.

Though the numbers are still low, Envision, which employs 11,000
emergency clinicians across the United States, has five times as many
doctors under quarantine as it did a week ago, Dr. Brown said.

Several providers spoke on the condition of anonymity because their
employers have told them not to talk to the news media.

The personal strain is cascading as the virus reaches new parts of the
country. “Everybody feels the stress, but everybody is pulling
together,” said Dr. K. Kay Moody, an emergency room doctor in Olympia,
Wash., who runs a Facebook group with 22,000 emergency physicians. “That
is what is keeping us OK.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A few doctors said they were talking about bunking up in Airbnbs to
create “dirty doc” living quarters to avoid endangering their children
when they go home. Some are showing their partners where to find their
passwords and insurance, should they end up in intensive care. Dr. Moody
said she knew of at least one doctor whose former spouse was threatening
to take their children away if the doctor went to work.

Many emergency physicians work as contractors, not hospital staff, so
they will not necessarily be paid if they are quarantined. “As it
stands, that is one of the most anxiety-provoking things,” Dr. Moody
said, “on top of fear for your life.”

Nurses face similar challenges, though with less pay and support. An
emergency nurse in Milwaukee said she bought her own goggles after
hearing that protective gear was running low. A nurse at a rural
hospital near Lake Tahoe in California said that the hospital was
providing physicians with shower facilities as well as clean scrubs to
wear, but that nurses had to wash their work clothes at home. She said
that the physicians she worked with lobbied the hospital to provide
clean scrubs for the nurses, but that the hospital concluded it would
cost too much.

One doctor, who spoke on condition that the identity of the veterans
hospital where she worked was not revealed, said the protocols have not
kept up with the changing reality on the ground. When determining if a
patient should get a separate room, she said, the emergency department
still asks patients if they have been to high-risk countries, like China
and Italy, even though community transmission of the virus has been well
established.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Doctors have begun building plans for how they will ration supplies when
there are more patients than their hospitals can handle. Emergency room
doctors have experience sitting families down to advise discontinuing
care because it would be futile. But in the United States, they are not
used to making such calls based on resources alone.

Some said they were looking to Italy, where doctors on the front line
have sometimes had to ration care in favor of younger patients, or those
without other complicating conditions, who are more likely to benefit
from it.

“If we get it all at once, we don’t have the resources, we don’t have
the ventilators,” said Dr. William Jaquis, chair of the American College
of Emergency Physicians.

Last week, Italian media reported that Bergamo, a city northeast of
Milan, saw roughly 50 doctors test positive for the virus. In the region
of Puglia in the south, local media reported that 76 employees had been
quarantined after being exposed to patients who contracted Covid-19.

After the coronavirus broke out at a nursing facility near Seattle, Dr.
Anderson sat with the leaders of his hospital, MultiCare Auburn Medical
Center, to talk about how urgently they should prepare. Their hospital
is ringed by nursing homes and other care facilities, and he rattled off
those most at risk for fatal cases of the virus: males over 60, and
those with cardiac and pulmonary problems. “I literally stopped what I
was saying and realized that that was me,” he said.

He said his hospital was down to a two-day supply of surgical masks — he
wears one per shift. “Those are supposed to be disposable,” he said. Now
he must carefully remove and clean the mask each time he takes it off
and on. “That may sound just like a nuisance, but when you’re
potentially touching something that has the virus that could kill you on
it, and you’re doing it 25 times a shift, it’s kind of nerve-racking,”
he said.

His wife has moved to their mountain cabin, and they have given up on
their retirement cruise in Europe. “I haven’t slept for longer than
three hours in the past two weeks,” he said.

In the early hours of Monday morning, he could not sleep. More than 200
emails had come into his inbox since he went to bed, including news that
three other health care providers had been admitted to a hospital
overnight, he said.

But he plans to be at his next shift nonetheless.

“I have been doing this for 35 years," he said, “and I’m not going to
stop now.”
