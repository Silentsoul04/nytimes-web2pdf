The white-tablecloth restaurants and the dive bars are closed. The ample
buffets that feed America’s tech work force and Las Vegas gamblers have
been shut down, along with millions of school cafeterias. On Monday,
McDonald’s joined other fast-food companies and closed its restaurants
except for delivery and drive-through.

Almost overnight, Americans have had to rethink one of the most
elemental parts of their daily lives: food.

It’s painful but not impossible to forgo some pleasures, routines and
duties for now: playing a soccer game, going to a movie, visiting a sick
friend. But eating is a cultural ritual that is also a necessity.

Mealtimes arrive three times a day. How do you feed yourself and your
family when restaurants are shuttered and store shelves emptying? And
how do you take care of a community in crisis when caregiving meals like
Sabbath suppers, pancake breakfasts, casseroles for new parents and
funeral food are off limits?

Catherine Powell, 58, a lawyer in Crested Butte, Colo., is like millions
of other people who suddenly have to figure out how, and what, to cook
in the age of the coronavirus.

She sat in her car outside a grocery store on Sunday, struggling to pull
up recipes her husband had sent to her phone. “I’m a recipe follower,”
she said, not a practiced cook who can whip up a meal from a random
assortment of pantry ingredients.

In the end, it didn’t matter that she couldn’t download the recipes. The
store was out of pasta and canned vegetables. There was no chicken, but
plenty of pork, which she doesn’t eat.

“I don’t know if I’m going to be able to become a different kind of
cook,” she said. “But I’m going to have to try.”

All at once, it seems, many Americans are scrambling to learn how to
cook. A week ago, Google searches for cooking videos hit
Thanksgiving-level highs, and traffic to cooking websites is
skyrocketing.

Cooking teachers and chefs who don’t have kitchens to run are offering
tips on social media for cooking from pantry ingredients and making
dishes that can be stretched into several meals. Families and friends
are teaching one another on FaceTime and Zoom to bake sourdough and cook
beans.

At the same time, a world where everyone is forced to eat at home has
turbocharged the nation’s already competitive online delivery services.
[GrubHub](https://www.barrons.com/articles/grubhub-stock-nyc-food-delivery-market-coronavirus-51584381819)
has been adding restaurants to its platforms at a daily rate that’s
three times its previous peak, Matt Maloney, the founder and chief
executive, said Tuesday.

As countries like Italy and Spain were shutting down restaurants
completely, Mr. Maloney said his company — which includes Seamless and
Yelp delivery services, and has the largest network of restaurant
clients in the country — had lobbied state and local officials to allow
restaurants to keep their kitchens open for takeout and delivery, even
as dining rooms are closed. (The company also announced that payments
from the restaurants — anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of each order —
will be deferred but not reduced, which angered many restaurateurs.)

In the Bay Area, [where six
counties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/03/16/us/16reuters-health-coronavirus-usa-sfarea-factbox.html)went
into lockdown on Tuesday, restaurant deliveries have been deemed an
essential service that can continue — for
now.

The California restaurateur [Alice
Waters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/22/dining/alice-waters-chef-author-book.html)
was sequestered in her Berkeley home on Monday while [Chez
Panisse](https://www.chezpanisse.com/reservations/), the restaurant she
opened in 1971, pivoted to selling boxes of produce from farmers and
preparing to offer complete meals of hearth-cooked beans, greens and
cornbread for online ordering.

[K.C. Hysmith](https://www.kchysmith.com/), 30, a doctoral candidate at
the University of North Carolina studying food history, said her family
was trying to order from local restaurants as much as possible.

During World War II, Americans tended [victory
gardens](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1943/09/19/archives/first-year-is-hardest-despite-mistakes-victory-gardens-have-done.html),
needing both fresh food and a sense of participating in a national
cause. In the last few days, Ms. Hysmith said, a similar urge has set
in: Diners are using apps to order from favorite local restaurants in an
effort to save them, knowing that places without financial safety nets
may never reopen.

“We ordered Chinese takeout last night, knowing they could shutter at
any moment,” she said. “It’s almost as if our victory gardens are how we
are using our digital expertise to feed ourselves and help others.”

But delivery is expensive. It’s not readily available in many parts of
the country, and even those averse to cooking can’t rely on it forever.

Dan Nguyen, 34, a data scientist with Airbnb in San Francisco, hasn’t
cooked since he began working in the tech industry five years ago. He
would eat two meals a day, and occasionally dinner, at work. Anything
else was delivered to his apartment in the Mission district.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When you get three meals a day, you just stop cooking altogether,” Mr.
Nguyen said. He plans to transition back into cooking at least some of
his own food, while also relying on deliveries — for as long as they
remain available.

The return to the kitchen has underscored the differences among
America’s cooks. City dwellers with small kitchens who are used to
regular shopping at a weekly farmers’ market or who cook only when the
urge to make an interesting new recipe strikes have vastly different
skills than Americans used to cooking from a large pantry that is kept
stocked with monthly runs to a big-box store.

[Hi‘ilei Hobart](https://www.hiokinai.com/), 38, an assistant professor
of anthropology at the University of Texas, pointed out that many
Americans, especially in rural communities, already know how to stock
and cook every day from a pantry of shelf-stable ingredients.

“They have knowledge that a lot more people had in the early 20th
century,” she said. “That’s not to say modern urban dwellers are dumb,
but they have a different knowledge set and skill set that is
appropriate for their everyday lives.”

In Weatherford, Okla., a college town of about 15,000, people are used
to driving a half-hour or more to a grocery store and stocking up for a
week or two. So far, the shelves haven’t been stripped. And there are
other sources of food.

“A lot of people here slaughter a beef, and a lot of people have a ton
of meat in their freezer,” said Garrett King, 34, who was home from his
job at Southwest Oklahoma State University, helping tend his two
preschool-age children. “There is no one in rural Oklahoma that doesn’t
have more than one freezer.”

Still, concern about provisions is setting in, particularly among the
many there who farm for a living and know that any disruption in
government certifications or inspections for grain or cattle could mean
empty store shelves later on.

Even in communities where preserving and storing food is already a
habit, life under social distancing is proving a challenge.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Suddenly, the jokes don’t seem so funny anymore. The reality of what not
sharing food can mean to communities connected by food rituals is
starting to sink in.

Her grandfather’s funeral will be held in Idaho on Wednesday. The
community of Mormon women who regularly provide food for funerals said
it will be the last one they will service until the threat from the
coronavirus is over.

“It’s shocking in a way to realize this thing that is so central to how
we communicate is dangerous,” said Dr. Spackman, a professor at the
School for the Future of Innovation in Society at Arizona State
University. “You say to yourself, even though I trust this sisterhood of
believers, how do I trust that they are not a carrier?”

Cooking may provide a sense of control, but today even the first step —
shopping for ingredients — can seem risky.

Rather than visit stores, many who can afford it are using shopping
services like Postmates and
[Instacart](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/06/technology/instacart-doordash-tipping-deliveries.html).
Grocery delivery services and restaurants offering takeout and delivery
have told consumers that extra sanitation practices have been put in
place. (Federal health officials say the virus is spread mainly through
respiratory droplets and to a lesser degree by touching surfaces that
might hold it. There is no evidence, according to the [Centers for
Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html),
that the virus has been transmitted through
food.)

Safety aside, a trip to the grocery store can be a somber exercise. At
the Whole Foods Market in Glendale, Calif., all of the chicken — from
breasts to wings to thighs — had been snatched up before noon on Monday.
Workers hustled carts through half-empty aisles, trying to meet a surge
in delivery orders.

Valerie Aguilar, 19, a student at California State University-Northridge
who works as a part-time shopper at Whole Foods, looked at a new order
on her phone and shook her head. “There’s no more Cheerios,” she said
grimly. “No more beans, no more spaghetti.”

When selection is limited and many people can’t go shopping, even the
most adept cook can be challenged. And when you get the groceries home,
the joy of preparing food for yourself and others can be fraught,
especially if family members have special dietary requirements or eating
schedules.

Tina Gupta Patel, 51, lives in Nashville with her husband and two
children, one in high school and the other in college. Both are home
now, and everyone seems to eat on a different timetable.

“It has been really tough to corral everyone and say, ‘Let’s sit down
and eat family dinner the way we used to,’ ” she said. So she makes
dishes like pot roast that can be eaten as is or shredded into tortillas
throughout the day, and pushes the fruit and vegetables, which so far
are in abundant supply at the local supermarket.

Unlike some cooks who are embracing the time to cook at home, preparing
food is not cathartic or pleasurable for her at the moment. “It takes
energy for me to want to cook, and I don’t have a lot of energy right
now.”

Even those eager to turn to the kitchen as balm and social connection
are stymied.

“It’s a super-strange time,” said Ms. Powell, the lawyer in Colorado.
“In our community we often take meals to other people or drop off
dinner for our friends. We have some friends who have babies right now.
But I don’t want to freak people out with a COVID Stroganoff.”

Priya Krishna, Tejal Rao and Rachel Wharton contributed reporting.
