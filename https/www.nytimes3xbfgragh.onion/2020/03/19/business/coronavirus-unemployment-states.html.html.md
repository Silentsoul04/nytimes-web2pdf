With the coronavirus pandemic triggering layoffs in industries from
restaurants to retail — the Department of Labor said on Thursday that
[claims for jobless benefits surged 33
percent](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/ui-claims/20200480.pdf)

offices, long hindered by lumbering technology and bare-bones staffing,
are already groaning under the weight.

From [New

to [Texas](http://texas) to [Oregon](http://oregon), the newly jobless
have tried to file claims, only to run into glitchy websites and clogged
phone
lines.

Ryan Connolly was laid off by video chat on Tuesday from his job on a
software development project for [RDK Truck Sales &
Service](https://www.rdk.com/) in Tampa, Fla. Within a few hours, he was
on the county website trying to figure out unemployment benefits but
couldn’t get past the first link. Every time he clicked, the loading
wheel would circle interminably.

“My heart just dropped, and I realized that I’m definitely not the only
one scrambling here,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was obvious the site was overwhelmed by the volume, said Mr.
Connolly, who is worried about his wife and two young daughters. They
were on his health insurance.

“As soon as I saw that, I realized that it was just going to be a
nightmare,” he said.

He kept trying on Tuesday. It didn’t get better. “I’ve given up,” he
said Wednesday.

Help is on the way. A stimulus bill that President Trump signed into law
on Wednesday provides $1 billion in emergency grants to states for
unemployment insurance, and fully half could be immediately used to
strengthen staffing, technology and other administrative costs.

The need is urgent. In Colorado, the number of unemployment benefit
claims went from 400 on March 9 to 3,900 on Monday and then 10,000 on
Wednesday. In Connecticut, there were 2,500 claims last week, but more
than 40,000 from Friday evening until Wednesday evening. The [number of
requests in
Ohio](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1240352256152809473?s=20)
jumped to 78,000 this week from 6,500 two weeks ago.

Maryland said that its website and call centers were experiencing “an
unprecedented volume” of requests. The state’s division of unemployment
insurance said it was extending its call center hours, working to
increase its network’s bandwidth and asking claimants and employers to
email.

New York’s [online application
system](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html#link-1c0b3898)
crashed as it tried to accommodate a spike in volume that resembled the
surge after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. By noon on Tuesday, the state
labor department had received more than 21,000 calls, compared with
2,000 a week earlier. Visits to its website more than doubled. The
department is now extending its hours and staggering filing times
alphabetically by last name.

Delta Vasquez, 22, spent several hours trying to slog through Oregon’s
unemployment claims portal on Monday night after she was laid off from
her hosting position at Bamboo Sushi in Portland. She and her co-workers
got the news by email after the state moved to restrict bars and
restaurants to takeout and delivery.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Vasquez tried calling the unemployment office instead, but the line
rang and eventually disconnected without sending her to voice mail. She
tried online again, but the site was confusing — it has operating hours,
and stops accepting new claims at 10 p.m. on weekdays.

Ms. Vasquez restarted the online claims process twice before managing to
fill out the necessary forms. “If you’re not working, you can’t save
money,” she said. “The only resource is unemployment insurance.”

Even when unemployment was stable and low, state employment offices were
“threadbare,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow with the Century
Foundation, a public policy research group.

State unemployment insurance programs rely on federal grants to pay for
the administration of benefits, but those costs have been cut by 30
percent over the past two decades, he said.

Part of the reason for low staffing: Unemployment office head counts are
pegged to the unemployment rate, which had reached historic lows before
the pandemic hit.

Even in normal times, unemployment offices struggled with busy signals
and website problems, said Julia Simon-Mishel, a supervising attorney in
the unemployment compensation unit at Philadelphia Legal Assistance. “So
we expect there to be issues with the website and phone lines across the
country now.”

Further complicating matters are the outdated systems most offices use.
Pennsylvania is partway through a technology overhaul, but “a lot of
states are still operating on their old mainframe computer systems that
are most likely not set up for remote access,” Ms. Simon-Mishel said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same time, some states are undertaking emergency measures to
expand and speed up workers’ access to benefits. [Montana officials
said](http://governor.mt.gov/pressroom/governor-bullock-announces-emergency-rules-to-streamline-unemployment-benefits-for-workers-impacted-by-covid-19)
that people forced by employers to stay home, or who are quarantined or
caring for a family member with coronavirus, can qualify for benefits.
Wisconsin, where [nearly
half](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/covid19/public/det.htm) of job center
locations are closed because of the outbreak, [loosened
rules](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/news/2020/200317-emergency-order.htmhttps://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WIGOV/bulletins/281f868)
that require claimants to actively search for work. Arkansas,
California, Virginia and other states have waived the waiting period
before workers can receive aid.

But that still requires applicants to get through the front door.

Desperate, many laid-off employees began requesting donations
and[posting
links](https://twitter.com/Whatapityonyou/status/1239639173843136512?s=20)
to their GoFundMe, Venmo and Cash accounts. The website for one charity
group was overrun with people hoping to apply for its[bartender
emergency assistance program](https://www.usbgfoundation.org/beap).

Eilís Godfrey, 27, learned on Sunday night that the restaurant where she
worked as a server in Los Angeles was closing its doors. She and her
colleagues gathered in a back room, usually reserved for private
parties, to watch the city’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, who ordered the
[closing of many
businesses](https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1239387832554106881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1239387832554106881&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fla.eater.com%2F2020%2F3%2F15%2F21180760%2Flos-angeles-bar-restaurant-shutdown-order)
and said dine-in service at restaurants must stop. The spin studio where
she worked the front desk also closed that night.

On Monday, Ms. Godfrey tried to apply for unemployment benefits, but
realized that she needed to gather her pay stubs, tax return and other
information. On Tuesday, she could no longer get access to California’s
unemployment benefits site, and couldn’t get through on the phone,
either.

So she went back to her computer, where, she said, she spent hours “just
refreshing the page.”
