The coronavirus pandemic on Earth is knocking [NASA’s
moon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/science/moon-robot-rover-viper-nasa.html)
plans off course.

On Thursday evening, Jim Bridenstine, the space agency’s administrator,
announced the suspension of the manufacture and testing of the Space
Launch System and Orion, the giant rocket and crew capsule that would be
used to take astronauts back to the moon.

The Trump administration had [set a goal of the next moon landing
occurring by the end
of 2024](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/22/science/trump-moon-nasa.html).
With the spread of the coronavirus, however, NASA is now shutting down
work at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the rocket
is being built, and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, about 45
miles to the northeast of Michoud. The first Space Launch System booster
is being tested at Stennis.

There has been one confirmed case of the coronavirus among Stennis
employees. There are no confirmed cases at Michoud, but the number of
infected people in the New Orleans area has risen quickly in the past
few days.

The directive from Mr. Bridenstine is for workers at the two NASA sites
to work remotely, but there is no way to build or test a rocket without
people at the sites. The change takes effect on Friday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that
puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,” Mr.
Bridenstine said in a news release. A minimal team will remain after the
shutdown, only for security and to maintain critical
infrastructure.

Development of the Space Launch System — a modern equivalent of the
powerful Saturn 5 that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon — has been
delayed for years, and the price tag has risen by billions of dollars.
The first launch, a test flight without any astronauts aboard, was
already not scheduled to occur before 2021. Now even that target may be
too optimistic if work at Michoud and Stennis is suspended for an
extended period.

“We realize there will be impacts to NASA missions,” Mr. Bridenstine
said, “but as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce
risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of
the NASA workforce.”

There have also been confirmed coronavirus cases at two other NASA
centers: the Ames Research Center in California and the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Alabama. NASA has been encouraging employees to work
from home if possible.

The spread of the coronavirus could also jeopardize NASA’s science
missions including [the James Webb Space
Telescope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/22/science/nasa-webb-space-telescope-hubble.html),
a successor to [the Hubble Space
Telescope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/04/23/science/space/unforgettable-hubble-space-telescope-photos.html)
that is scheduled to launch in March 2021 [after years of
delays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/27/science/webb-telescope-nasa.html).

During a virtual town hall on Friday that was broadcast over the
internet, NASA officials told planetary scientists that the pandemic has
slowed some work.

“Many people have asked us about James Webb,” said Thomas H. Zurbuchen,
the associate administrator for NASA’s science mission directorate. “And
of course, it will be impacted, even though it is one of our top
priorities.”

Because of restrictions for travel of people needed to complete testing
and preparation of the spacecraft, “It is anticipated by early April,
the Webb project could be experiencing a day-for-day schedule impact to
its critical path as an increased number of activities come to a halt,”
Dr. Zurbuchen said.

The [Perseverance
rover](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/science/mars-2020-rover-name.html),
which is to head to Mars this summer, could also be affected. That
spacecraft is at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which has not yet
been shut
down.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Because of the orbital paths of Mars and Earth, the launch must occur in
a window in July or August, or it would have to be delayed until 2022
when the two planets again line up.

“Teams are doing, frankly, heroes’ work to keep us on track for a July
launch,” Dr. Zurbuchen said.

Another Mars mission, ExoMars, a collaboration between Russia and the
European Space Agency, has [already been pushed back to 2022
from 2020](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/12/science/mars-rover-coronavirus.html),
mostly because of technical problems that cannot be solved by July.
Officials also acknowledged that the travel restrictions because of the
coronavirus pandemic would have made the work even more challenging to
complete.

More optimistically, NASA announced Wednesday that [it was aiming to
launch
astronauts](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-invite-media-to-first-crew-launch-to-station-from-america-since-2011)
to the International Space Station before the end of May.

The two astronauts would fly aboard Crew Dragon, a capsule built by
SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Elon Musk, and would be the first
crewed mission to lift off from the United States since the space
shuttles were retired in 2011. Since then, NASA has been relying on
Russia to provide transportation for its astronauts.
