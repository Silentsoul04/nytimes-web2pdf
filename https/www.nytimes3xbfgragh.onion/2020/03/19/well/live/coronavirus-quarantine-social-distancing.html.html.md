# Deciding How Much Distance You Should Keep

When Dr. Asaf Bitton looked out from his window in Boston recently, he
was shocked by the scene. Although schools, offices and businesses
already had shut down to slow the spread of coronavirus, the park was
packed.

“I saw people from my window outside playing in the park together, and I
thought, ‘This is crazy,’” said Dr. Bitton, [executive director of
Ariadne
Labs](https://www.ariadnelabs.org/about-us/people/management/asaf-bitton/)
at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health. “Why did we close the schools if we’re going to shift
social contact from the schools to the playground?”

With a sense of urgency, he sent his wife an email to share with friends
and post on Facebook. It quickly went viral and was later [published on
Medium](https://www.ariadnelabs.org/resources/articles/news/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day/),
under the headline: “Social Distancing: This Is Not a Snow Day.” To slow
the coronavirus, wrote Dr. Bitton, we must act quickly and start “making
daily choices to stay away from each other as much as possible.”

But how to make those choices has not always been clear. Concepts like
“social distancing,” “self-quarantine” and “isolation” come from the
lexicon of the infectious disease community (and scary movies). Here in
real life, parents, workers and even government leaders are struggling
to make sense of it all. Here’s a guide to help you make good decisions,
based on advice from infectious disease and public health experts.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## *Social Distancing*

Social distancing is ultimately about creating physical distance between
people who don’t live together. At the community level, it means closing
schools and workplaces and canceling events like concerts and Broadway
shows. For individuals, it means keeping six feet of distance between
you and others while in public and avoiding physical contact with people
who do not share your home.

But one aspect of social distancing — the admonition to avoid gatherings
of 10 people or more — has created a lot of confusion. It has given the
impression that while public indoor events are bad, it’s OK to host up
to nine people at your home or outside. That is not correct. Right now
*everyone* should limit close contact, indoors and outdoors, to family
members only. This means no dinner parties, no play dates, no birthday
parties with a few friends.

***Who should do this?*** Everyone.

## *Shelter in Place*

In a nutshell, this means stay home. Don’t leave the house unless you
absolutely have to. Don’t socialize with people outside your family.
Don’t go to a friend’s house for dinner or invite a trusted friend
over.

During a shelter-in-place order, you are typically allowed to go outside
for essentials — to pick up groceries or prescriptions — but you should
limit those trips to no more than once a week if possible. People with
essential jobs — public safety, medical, sanitation or grocery worker —
can still go to work. And you can visit someone if you are their
caregiver.

There is a bright spot. In most cases, a shelter-in-place order allows
you to walk the dog or exercise outside (for brief periods) as long as
you keep a six-foot distance from others.

“Right now I’m recommending to my family and to people who are asking
that outdoor activities that are solitary or done in parallel with
someone who is far away is fine,” said [Carolyn C.
Cannuscio](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p6153664),
associate professor of family medicine and community health at the
University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. “We’re trying to
avoid face to face contact, especially in close up and confined spaces.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

***Who should do this?*** Everyone who lives in an area with a mandatory
shelter-in-place order, including some communities in Northern
California and possibly, soon, New York City. But many infectious
disease experts say that everyone else should also voluntarily shelter
in place to prevent the virus from spreading. “People should really be
keeping to themselves,” said Dr. Kryssie Woods, hospital epidemiologist
and [director of infection
prevention](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/krystina-l-woods) at
Mount Sinai West.

## Self-Monitoring

This means regularly checking your temperature and watching for signs of
coronavirus infection, including fever, shortness of breath and
coughing. A person who is self-monitoring should already be staying home
and limiting interactions with others.

***Who should do this?*** **** Self-monitoring is for people who learn
they might have been exposed to the virus but had only distant contact
with the infected person. This might be someone in your orbit — for
example, a colleague, a speaker at a conference or the parent of your
child’s classmate — but not a person with whom you had close physical
contact. Consult with your doctor to see if self-monitoring is
recommended for your specific situation.

## Self-Quarantine

This term is used to separate and restrict the movement of someone who
is well but who recently had close contact with a person who later was
diagnosed with the virus. A person in self-quarantine should follow all
the rules of sheltering in place, except they should avoid going to
stores or interacting with the public even on a limited basis for a
14-day period. (A friend should bring you
groceries.)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Quarantine means staying home and away from other people, including
those in your household, as much as possible, for a 14-day quarantine
period. A person in self-quarantine should sleep in a separate space
from family members.

***Who should do this?*** **** Anyone who does not have symptoms, but
who had close contact with someone who later became ill.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Self-Isolation

Isolation is used to separate a person who has a diagnosed case or
someone who has distinct symptoms including a cough, fever and shortness
of breath, but hasn’t yet been tested or received test results. A person
in isolation should be confined to a separate room with no or minimal
contact with the rest of the household (including pets) and use a
separate bathroom if possible. Most of the time, a sick person will feel
a bit miserable, but he or she can pick up food trays left at the door
and sanitize a shared bathroom after using it.

***Who should do this?*** Anyone with a confirmed case of Covid-19, in
consultation with their doctor, a person waiting for test results or a
person with obvious symptoms who is still waiting to be tested. Everyone
else in the household should self-quarantine.

## Official or Mandatory Quarantine

A government-imposed lockdown on a community, as has happened in Italy,
in which movements are severely restricted. People can still go out for
essentials and to get fresh air, but they can do so only under strictly
controlled conditions or on a specific schedule imposed by public safety
officials.
