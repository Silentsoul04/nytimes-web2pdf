\textbf{MY BEST FRIEND}\\
\textbf{Written by Julie Fogliano}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Jillian Tamaki}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/22/books/review/22PictureThis-Russo/22PictureThis-Russo-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Two small girls spend a perfect day together in the park, making chalk
drawings, twirling until they fall, sitting peacefully under a big tree.
``She is my best friend / I think,'' one says. Slowly, and hilariously,
we realize they have just met. Fogliano (``A House That Once Was'') has
a poet's ear and a psychologist's awareness of little ones' inner lives.
With Tamaki's (``They Say Blue'') buoyant, scratchy illustrations in
shades of rose and green, this joyful book may inspire you to rush up to
someone who has a pre-school-age child --- or a talent for making fast
friends --- and press it into her hands.

\emph{32 pp. Atheneum. \$17.99. (Ages 3 to 7.)}

\textbf{EVERYONE'S AWAKE}\\
\textbf{Written by Colin Meloy.}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Shawn Harris.}

Image

From ``Everyone's Awake.''

This madcap rhyming bedtime story from Meloy (the frontman of the
indie-rock band the Decemberists and author of the Wildwood series) and
Harris (``Her Right Foot'') reads like an updated riff on the 1980s
favorite ``The Napping House.'' ``The dog's into the eggnog; / Mom's tap
dancing to Prince / while Dad is on the laptop / buying 10-yard bolts of
chintz'': The exuberant nighttime household chaos, well conveyed in
Harris's witty, sloppy style with thick strokes of saturated blues and
blazing orange, will make many a sleep-deprived parent laugh between
shouts of ``Settle down!''

\emph{48 pp. Chronicle. \$17.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)}

\textbf{DANDELION'S DREAM}\\
\textbf{Written and illustrated by Yoko Tanaka.}

Image

From ``Dandelion's Dream.''

With each dreamy page in yellow and charcoal grays that fade to black,
this solo debut by Tanaka (``Sparrow Girl'') is wordless, and wonderful.
A dandelion is thrilled to discover it has bloomed into a real lion.
Setting off boisterously across a field, it hops a ride on a train,
leaps onto a fuzzy sheep, joins a sea gull on a sailing vessel. There's
a scary interlude on a city street and the novelty of a movie before it
flies back home, becoming a fluffy white seed head. The seeds waft
upward, forming a leaping lion and stoking sublime thoughts of cosmic
connection.

\emph{32 pp. Candlewick. \$16.99. (Ages 3 to 6.)}

\textbf{WE ARE WATER PROTECTORS}\\
\textbf{Written by Carole Lindstrom.}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Michaela Goade.}

Image

From ``We Are Water Protectors.''

An Ojibwe girl confronts a grave situation by channeling age-old wisdom
in this powerful book inspired by the movement that brought Indigenous
nations together to protest with the Standing Rock Sioux. The ``black
snake'' of an oil pipeline was set to cross their land, endangering
their water supply, and in her culture women must protect the water, men
the fire. ``We fight for those who cannot fight for themselves: the
winged ones, the crawling ones,'' she says. Goade's illustrations
combine a mystical mood with the lovely fierceness of a child seeking
justice.

\emph{32 pp. Roaring Brook. \$17.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)}

\textbf{I VOTED: MAKING A CHOICE MAKES A DIFFERENCE}\\
\textbf{Written by Mark Shulman.}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Serge Bloch.}

Image

From ``I Voted.''

What does it mean to vote, and how do we do it? I admire picture books
that use entertaining narration and appealing art to teach children
about things we assume --- often wrongly --- they understand. Shulman
starts in school (``Imagine you're choosing a classroom pet'') and moves
on to the nuts and bolts of selecting our government. Bloch's frisky
line drawings make democracy look like a ton of fun, and the coveted ``I
Voted'' sticker, of course, provides a brilliant ending.

\emph{32 pp. Neal Porter/Holiday House. \$18.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)}

\textbf{STORY BOAT}\\
\textbf{Written by Kyo Maclear.}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Rashin Kheiriyeh.}

Image

From ``Story Boat.''

Even among many excellent recent picture books about refugees, Maclear's
(``It Began With a Page'') story stands out, showing how comfort and
routine can be found on an uncertain journey. The children don't know
why they've left or where they are. ``Here is just here,'' and ``here''
is the family singing, drinking from a familiar cup and waiting.
Kheiriyeh's (``Saffron Ice Cream'') gorgeously playful illustrations add
to the humane, hopeful message.

\emph{40 pp. Tundra. \$17.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)}

\textbf{THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF BOOK}\\
\textbf{Written by Christopher Healy.}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Ben Mantle.}

Image

From ``This Is Not That Kind of Book.''

When a story lover starts to realize that many of her favorite books are
following --- aha! --- a formula, this one will be riotously satisfying.
We start with a letter A doing the alphabet-book thing. He's interrupted
by a red-cloaked girl declaring that the book is actually a fairy tale.
The pair proceed until they're stopped by a robot, then a talking
animal, and so on. The ingenious upshot: It's a \emph{friendship} book,
about bonds between all different types.

\emph{32 pp. Random House. \$17.99. (Ages 4 to 8.)}

\textbf{THE SPIRIT OF SPRINGER:}\\
\textbf{THE REAL LIFE RESCUE OF AN ORPHANED ORCA}\\
\textbf{Written by Amanda Abler.}\\
\textbf{Illustrated by Levi Hastings.}

Image

From ``The Spirit of Springer.''Credit...TBD

This beautiful book tells a suspenseful, heart-rending true story. In
2002, a baby orca was found swimming alone next to a Seattle ferry.
Restoring her to her pod, near Vancouver, and finding her a foster
mother, involved scientists, a marine wildlife agency and the First
Nations people who welcomed her. Read over your kid's shoulder if you
like; adults, too, will enjoy the elegant details.

\emph{48 pp. Little Bigfoot/Sasquatch. \$18.99. (Ages 6 and up.)}
