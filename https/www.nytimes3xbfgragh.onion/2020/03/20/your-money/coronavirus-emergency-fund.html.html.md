The coronavirus is [rapidly
slowing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/business/economy/coronavirus-us-economy-shutdown.html)
the U.S. economy and disrupting jobs. If you don’t have a rainy-day fund
already, it’s time to set aside whatever cash you can.

Most people think of [an emergency
fund](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/25/your-money/emergency-savings.html)
as something saved gradually, over time. But the crisis is here now for
many people — or soon will be, in the coming weeks — so a different
approach is needed.

“It’s hard to save a lot of money quickly on a modest income,” said
Stephen Brobeck, senior fellow with the Consumer Federation of America.
And compared with the last downturn, he said, the current economy has
many more people in [“gig” or freelance
jobs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/technology/gig-economy-pandemic.html),
who generally aren’t eligible for unemployment benefits and whose
fluctuating income makes it hard to save.

Cash assistance may be coming from the federal government as part of its
response to the virus outbreak, but details are uncertain. So making a
plan on your own is wise.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The answer can’t be to do nothing,” said John Thompson, chief program
officer of the Financial Health Network, a nonprofit focused on
financial innovation.

One reason for hope: Even small cash cushions can help people stave off
disaster. [As little as
$250](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/thriving-residents-thriving-cities-family-financial-security-matters-cities)
can significantly reduce the risk that a family will miss paying a
utility bill or be evicted, research suggests.

“Each extra dollar saved” reduces the likelihood of having to skip bill
payments, said Mariel Beasley, a co-founder of Common Cents Lab, a
financial research group at Duke
University.

Americans’ lack of emergency savings is a longtime worry, even during
the strong economy of the past few years. Numerous surveys by the
[Federal
Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm)
have found that many households would struggle to handle an unexpected
$400 expense.

## So what to do?

First, try to get a handle on your income, Mr. Thompson said. Employers
often use computer systems to schedule shifts weeks in advance, so try
to find out if your hours will be cut so you can estimate how much of a
shortage you’re facing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Next, take stock of possible sources of cash and credit. It’s not
advisable to open new credit card accounts, but knowing the credit limit
on each card already in your wallet can help you get an idea of what you
can draw on if needed, Mr. Thompson said.

If you are expecting any sort of lump sum — whether a bonus or a
commission, or an income tax refund — set aside as much of it as you
can. Many Americans are now receiving tax refunds, and the amounts can
be substantial, in part because of the earned-income tax credit, which
particularly benefits families with children.

Among families getting a refund, the average is more than $3,000, or the
equivalent of [nearly six
weeks](https://institute.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/household-income-spending/report-tax-refunds.htm#finding-2)
of take-home pay, according to a study of millions of customer accounts
by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the research arm of the big bank. (The
study looked at data from 2015, 2016 and 2017. According to I.R.S.
statistics, the average refund as of March 5 was $3,012).

That could help provide a financial lifeline for the difficult weeks
ahead — but it isn’t a panacea, Mr. Thompson said.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

That’s because many people have earmarked their refunds for specific
expenditures, like paying down credit card debt or buying household
items. “For many people, the money is already spent,” he said.

Still, families getting tax refunds had, on average, more than a quarter
of their refunds remaining six months after receiving them, the Chase
research found. “A few hundred dollars can make a substantial
difference,” Mr. Thompson said.

Next, scrutinize spending, and cut where you can. It may feel harsh, but
belt tightening is the idea. Can you postpone a (no doubt much
anticipated) spring trip? Are there subscriptions you can do without
temporarily? (Many
[publications](https://www.adweek.com/digital/major-publishers-take-down-paywalls-for-coronavirus-coverage/)
are offering online coronavirus coverage free of charge.) Can you switch
to a less expensive cellphone plan for a few months?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Take a really aggressive approach,” Ms. Beasley said, and direct all
the savings to your emergency fund.

Depending on your circumstances, you may consider temporarily reducing
contributions to your retirement account and redirecting the money to an
emergency fund. It’s common for people to contribute to workplace
accounts like 401(k) plans yet lack emergency savings, Ms. Beasley said.
That’s because many employers automatically enroll workers in retirement
contributions from their
paycheck.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In general, it’s wise to keep contributing to retirement plans
regularly, because your money is buying more shares when prices are low.
But if your situation is dire, a cut is better than stopping entirely.
Ms. Beasley said one option might be to suspend contributions above any
match from your employer; that way, you’re still saving for your
long-term retirement. Just make sure — set a calendar reminder on your
phone, perhaps — to resume contributions once the crisis passes.

While it might not be something you have considered in the past, she
said, now is a good time to identify local food banks, or investigate
how to apply for government food
[benefits](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361), like the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

If you own a home, you could consider opening a home equity line of
credit as a financial backstop. The loans let you draw on your home
equity — the difference between the value of your home and any mortgage
you already have. At the end of 2019, nearly 45 million homeowners with
mortgages had “tappable” home equity, $119,000 on average, according to
the research firm [Black
Knight](https://cdn.blackknightinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BKI_MM_Jan2020_Report.pdf).

Lines of credit generally carry lower interest rates than credit cards.
However, the loans are secured by your home, which means you risk
foreclosure if you miss payments. For that reason, Ms. Beasley said,
people should be cautious about using home equity.

Once you have a savings cushion, don’t feel bad about using the money if
you need it — that’s what it’s for. An emergency fund is different from
retirement savings, which are meant to grow over a long period.
Rainy-day accounts are meant to be drawn down and replenished so you can
use them again.

“You’re not saving to create an account you never touch,” Mr. Thompson
said.

Here are some questions and answers about emergency savings:

**Do any employers offer emergency savings programs?**

Some employers have begun offering workers the option to save for
emergencies via payroll deduction, but the programs aren’t yet
widespread. Some employers offer one-time “hardship” grants to workers
who face an unexpected financial setback; amounts vary, but a maximum of
$2,500 is common. Often, the programs are geared toward helping people
during natural disasters, like hurricanes. Now many are adapting to help
workers affected by the coronavirus, said Doug Stockham, president of
the [Emergency Assistance
Foundation](https://emergencyassistancefdn.org/), which manages hardship
funds for employers.

Workers who can’t go to work because of the virus — perhaps because they
have to stay home with children or a sick member of their family —
should check with their human resources department to see if grants are
available and how to apply, Mr. Stockham said.

**Why save when banks are paying low interest rates?**

The main point of an emergency cushion isn’t to earn big returns; it’s
to have a reserve to cover necessary costs, until things — hopefully —
turn around. Some credit unions, including Affinity in Basking Ridge,
N.J., and Canvas in Englewood, Colo., offer “reverse tier” savings
accounts, which pay higher interest rates on low balances to encourage
saving. (Most banks offer higher rates on bigger balances, to attract
deposits.) At Affinity, for example, you can earn 2 percent on balances
below $2,500.

**Can I take a loan or hardship withdrawal from my 401(k)?**

Many companies allow [hardship
withdrawals](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/hardships-early-withdrawals-and-loans)
or loans from 401(k) retirement plans, but doing so puts your long-term
retirement savings at risk. Hardship withdrawals don’t have to be paid
back but are taxable as income and may result in penalties. Loans aren’t
taxable but must be repaid, and they can be risky because if you leave
your employer you generally have to repay the loan quickly, said J.
Michael Collins, director of the Center for Financial Security at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
