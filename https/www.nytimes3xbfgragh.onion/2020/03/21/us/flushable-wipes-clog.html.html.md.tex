\section{Americans Coping With the Coronavirus Are Clogging
Toilets}\label{americans-coping-with-the-coronavirus-are-clogging-toilets}}

Sewage systems and toilets are backing up as consumers clean their homes
with disinfectant wipes and turn to paper towels, napkins and baby wipes
to cope with the lack of toilet paper.

Many Americans seem to be following the recommendations of public health
officials to clean and sterilize countertops, doorknobs, faucets and
other frequently touched surfaces in their homes.

The problem? Many are then tossing the disinfectant wipes, paper towels
and other paper products they used into the toilet.

The result has been a coast-to-coast surge in backed-up sewer lines and
overflowing toilets, according to plumbers and public officials, who
have pleaded with Americans to spare the nation's pipes from further
strain.

Many say the woes besieging the nation's infrastructure have been
compounded
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/business/toilet-paper-shortage.html}{by
the lack of toilet paper on store shelves}, which is leading some to use
paper towels, napkins or baby wipes instead.

\href{https://twitter.com/SpokaneCity/status/1241394135854198784?s=20}{Spokane,

to flush wipes down the toilet using the hashtag
\href{https://twitter.com/hashtag/WipesClogPipes?src=hashtag_click}{\#WipesClogPipes}.

``Flushable wipes are not truly flushable,'' said Jim Bunsey, chief
operating officer of the
\href{https://medium.com/@neorsd/important-reminder-wipes-clog-pipes-91d173195f65}{Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District}. ``They might go down the drain, but they
do not break up like regular toilet paper.''

The plumbing repair company Roto-Rooter issued a similar plea to its
customers, and said that substituting facial tissue for toilet paper was
``\href{http://view.exacttarget.com/?qs=dcbe0a06ae64c47901e4e08e738e178fe4c78b93c2932c6af35225dbdf1741d0a62043887fad5f9afc903d2f5a9287456ead6fca47c874c3934144e70a11c5a50d65290c618d5e1d35927892c3e6308d}{another
bad idea},'' unless it's used in small amounts and flushed frequently.

The California State Water Resources Control Board
\href{https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2020/pr03172020_products_clogging_sanitation.pdf}{warned
this week} that ``even wipes labeled `flushable' will clog pipes and
interfere with sewage collection and treatment throughout the state.''

``Flushing wipes, paper towels and similar products down toilets will
clog sewers and cause backups and overflows at wastewater treatment
facilities, creating an additional public health risk in the midst of
the coronavirus pandemic,'' it said.

The agency said wastewater treatment plants across California were
reporting problems.

It noted that most urban sewage systems depend on gravity and water flow
to move toilet paper and waste, and were not designed to accommodate
disinfectant wipes and paper towels, which do not break down as easily
and clog the system.

The board noted that clogged sewer lines are more than just a headache
for residents cooped up in their homes during a pandemic. Spills flow
into lakes, rivers and oceans, where they can harm public health and the
environment, it said.

Plumbers said they were fielding an increase in calls from people
working from home and self-quarantining.

``We have noticed an uptick in the amount of clogged main sewer lines
and, when we dispatch our technicians, we are pulling baby wipes out of
the line and we're seeing paper towels and Lysol wipes,'' Mark Russo,
vice president of Russo Brothers \& Company, a plumbing and heating
service in East Hanover, N.J., said on Saturday.

``These items are things that should never be flushed down the toilet,''
he said.
