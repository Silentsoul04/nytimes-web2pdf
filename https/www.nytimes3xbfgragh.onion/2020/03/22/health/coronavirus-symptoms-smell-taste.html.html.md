A mother who was infected with the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-body-symptoms.html)
couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every
spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes
bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the
foul odor of kitty litter.

Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying
diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of
Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of
infection.

On Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from
colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of
smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other
symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited,
but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings.

“We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and
that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,”
Prof. Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society,
wrote in an email. “It could contribute to slowing transmission and save
lives.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She and Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a group representing ear,
nose and throat doctors in Britain, issued a joint statement urging
health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating
any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against
performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because
the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt
coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus.

Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected
with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr. Hopkins said.
Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged,
had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors
were infected and dying in large numbers, Dr. Hopkins said.

The British physicians cited reports from other countries indicating
that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia,
saying that in South Korea, where testing has been widespread, 30
percent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as
their major presenting symptom (these were mild
cases).

The [American Academy of Otolaryngology on Sunday posted information on
its
website](https://www.entnet.org/content/coronavirus-disease-2019-resources)
saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced
sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated
with Covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately
tested positive with no other symptoms.

The symptoms, in the absence of allergies or sinusitis, should alert
doctors to screen patients for the virus and “warrant serious
consideration for self isolation and testing of these individuals,” the
academy said. The organization has reminded its members that the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [has urged all clinicians to
prioritize urgent and emergency
visits](https://www.entnet.org/content/new-recommendations-regarding-urgent-and-nonurgent-patient-care)
for the next several weeks and to reschedule elective and routine
procedures.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There is evolving evidence that otolaryngologists are among the highest
risk group when performing upper airway surgeries and examinations,”
said a notice posted on the academy’s website on Friday. “A high rate of
transmission of Covid-19 to otolaryngologists has been reported from
China, Italy and Iran, many resulting in death.”

Dr. Rachel Kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Rutgers,
said colleagues in New Rochelle, N.Y., which has been the center of an
outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the
coronavirus, sharing that patients who had first complained of anosmia
later tested positive for the coronavirus. “This raised a lot of alarms
for me personally,” Dr. Kaye said, because those patients “won’t know to
self quarantine.”

“Most ENTs have on their own accord tried to scale down,” she said,
adding that her department at Rutgers had already started using personal
protective equipment and stopped performing nonessential exams.

In the areas of Italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say

“Almost everybody who is hospitalized has this same story,” said Dr.
Marco Metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in
Brescia, where 700 of 1,200 inpatients have the coronavirus. “You ask
about the patient’s wife or husband. And the patient says, ‘My wife has
just lost her smell and taste but otherwise she is well.’ So she is
likely infected, and she is spreading it with a very mild
form.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

A study from South Korea, where widespread testing has been done, found
that 30 percent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the
coronavirus reported experiencing anosmia.

Hendrik Streeck, a German virologist from the University of Bonn who
went from house to house in the country’s Heinsberg district to
interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least
two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported
experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days.

Another physician [who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in
Germany](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1.full.pdf)
said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a
smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented
after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to
distinguish people who should be tested.

Dr. Clemens Wendtner, a professor of medicine at the Academic Teaching
Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, said that the
patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and
that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they
were congested. Using nasal drops or sprays did not help, Dr. Wendtner
said.

Several American patients who have had symptoms consistent with the
coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test
results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though
their noses were clear and they were not congested.

Andrew Berry, 30, developed a fever and
[body](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-body-symptoms.html)
aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating
headaches. He tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the
result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was
convinced that he had the virus, he said.

Now, Mr. Berry said, he literally cannot smell the coffee.

“Even with a clear nose, I just realized I couldn’t smell the food that
I was cooking, and I couldn’t taste the food that I was making,” said
Mr. Berry, a tattoo artist based in Orlando, Fla. He was cooking a
plantain dish with onions and vinegar, yet he could not smell it.

Amy Plattmier, a woman from Brooklyn, was not tested for the coronavirus
during a recent illness, but her husband then became sick and had a
positive test. Ms. Plattmier said she usually had a very sensitive nose,
but now could barely smell anything — not the bleach she was using to
clean the counters, which usually makes her feel nauseated, or the dog’s
accident in the bathroom, which she cleaned up.

Mr. Berry has also lost some weight, because he has not had much of an
appetite. “Hopefully it’s not a prolonged effect,” he said. “I can
imagine it changes the quality of life.”
