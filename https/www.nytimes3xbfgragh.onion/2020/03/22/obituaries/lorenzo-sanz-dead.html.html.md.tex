\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Lorenzo Sanz, who, as its president, helped return the Spanish soccer
club Real Madrid to victory in Europe's top competition after more than
three decades, died on Saturday in Madrid. He was 76.

His family said he died after contracting the coronavirus.

Mr. Sanz had tested positive for the virus after entering a Madrid
hospital on Tuesday with a fever. He also had kidney failure, according
to local news media reports.

His son Fernando said that Mr. Sanz had tried to fight the fever at home
for eight days before going to the hospital because he did not want to
burden an already strained Spanish health-care system.

He is the most prominent person in Spain to have died from the
coronavirus. Spain is second only to Italy as the European country worst
hit by the pandemic, and the Madrid region has been the epicenter of it
in Spain, accounting for about 60 percent of the 1,750 people who have
died from the outbreak there.

Mr. Sanz, who was president of Real Madrid from 1995 to 2000, is
credited with ending the club's 32-year wait for another victory in what
is now the European Champions League, which Real Madrid won in 1998 by
beating Juventus in the final in Amsterdam. Two years later, Real Madrid
won the competition again, beating Valencia in Paris.

The team also won one league title, a Spanish Super Cup and an
Intercontinental Cup under Mr. Sanz.

In 2000, he narrowly lost an election battle and was replaced as the
club's president by Florentino Pérez, a construction tycoon who still
leads the club.

In a
\href{https://www.realmadrid.com/noticias/2020/03/22/declaracion-del-presidente-florentino-perez-sobre-lorenzo-sanz}{message}
released by the club, Mr. Pérez said that Mr. Sanz would be remembered
by Real Madrid's fans as ``the president who brought us back hope and
joy'' in 1998. By winning the European competition again only two years
later, he added, ``Real Madrid got back the place that belonged to it in
history.''

Lorenzo Sanz was born in Madrid on Aug. 9, 1943, and played soccer as a
youth, as a goalkeeper. He became a successful businessman, mainly by
buying real estate around Madrid.

He was appointed a director of Real Madrid in 1985 and took over the
club, heavily in debt at the time, a decade later, succeeding Ramón
Mendoza, who had invited him to join the board.

Under Mr. Sanz, Real Madrid revamped its squad and changed coaches
several times; the Champions League was won under Jupp Heynckes in 1998
and under Vicente del Bosque in 2000. He also made some ambitious deals
for players, like the purchase of the French forward
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2000/03/16/sports/IHT-anelkas-shadow-casts-gloom-over-real-madrid.html}{Nicolas
Anelka} from Arsenal in 1999 for about \$34 million, a club record.

After the team won the Champions League in 2000, Mr. Sanz decided to
hold an early election by the club's 100,000 or so members, who pay an
annual fee and hold the right to elect the president. But the move
backfired: He was defeated by Mr. Pérez by just over 3,000 votes.

He tried to regain the presidency twice, unsuccessfully. He also failed
in a bid to take over Parma, the Italian club that had been plunged into
crisis by Parmalat, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/01/11/business/the-rise-and-fall-of-parma-s-first-family.html}{dairy
company that collapsed} in one of Italy's biggest fraud scandals.

Instead, in 2006, Mr. Sanz bought the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/05/sports/soccer/05iht-malaga05.html}{Spanish
club of Málaga}, which he sold four years later to a member of Qatar's
ruling family.

In recent years, Mr. Sanz ran into legal problems linked to his business
deals and tax payments. In 2018, he was sentenced by a Madrid provincial
court to three years in prison and a fine of 1.2 million euros for tax
evasion. But his appeal dragged on, and he did not go to jail.

In addition to his son Fernando, Mr. Sanz is survived by his wife, Mari
Luz; two other sons, Lorenzo and Francisco; and two daughters, Diana and
Malula, who is married to a former Spanish soccer star, Míchel Salgado.
