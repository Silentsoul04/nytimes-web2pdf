*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Manu Dibango, a saxophonist from Cameroon whose 1972 single [“Soul
Makossa”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF92yOsv3Y8) made modern
African music a clear presence on Western pop charts, died on Tuesday in
a hospital in France. He was 86.

His [Facebook
page](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ManuDibangoOfficiel) said the
cause was Covid-19 but did not say where in France he died. Mr. Dibango
had lived in France for some time.

Although “Soul Makossa” was named after makossa, a Cameroonian style of
music, and its lyrics were in the Douala language of Cameroon, Mr.
Dibango’s worldwide hit was an internationalist piece of funk.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With his terse, dryly insistent saxophone lines answering his own
chanted vocals, a tricky stop-start beat and a scrubbing rhythm guitar,
“Soul Makossa” arrived at the dawn of the disco era and made its way
to dance floors and R\&B radio stations across the United States, Europe
and Africa.

Michael Jackson would later quote its refrain in “Wanna Be Startin’
Somethin’,” a track on his 1983 album, “Thriller,” one of the
best-selling records of all time; that song was in turn sampled by
Rihanna for her 2007 “Don’t Stop the Music.” Mr. Dibango sued them both
in 2009; Mr. Jackson’s estate settled out of court. The song has also
been widely sampled in hip-hop.

Although Mr. Dibango was best known for “Soul Makossa” and a 1984 hit,
[“Abele Dance,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph5GB8RArks) there
was much more to his career. He recorded and toured prolifically,
appearing worldwide and collaborating with musicians including Herbie
Hancock, Fela Kuti, Peter Gabriel, Angélique Kidjo, Youssou N’Dour, the
Fania All-Stars and Sinead O’Connor. In a 2017 [interview with the
BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52017834), Mr. Dibango took
pride in the eclecticism of his music.

“You’re not a musician because you’re African,” he said. “You’re a
musician because you are musician. Coming from Africa, but first,
musician.”

Emmanuel N’Djoké Dibango was born on Dec. 12, 1933, in Douala, the
largest city in Cameroon. His father was a civil servant; his mother was
a dressmaker. He grew up listening to Protestant church music, local
traditional music and Westernized pop.

At 15 he was sent to Europe to study classical piano and music theory in
Paris and Brussels. But he was drawn to jazz, and he began playing
saxophone in the early l950s.

When he started performing in cabarets and jazz clubs in 1956, his
family cut off his allowance. In Belgium, he began working with
musicians from the Belgian Congo (which would be renamed Zaire after
gaining independence in 1960 and then the Democratic Republic of Congo).
He worked with African Jazz, the group led by Le Grand Kalle (Joseph
Kabasele), in Leopoldville (later renamed Kinshasa) in the early 1960s
before returning to France. By the late 1960s he was leading his own
band in Paris.

“Soul Makossa” was originally the B-side of a single celebrating
Cameroon’s national soccer team. According to “Turn the Beat Around: The
Secret History of Disco” (2005), by Peter Shapiro, the New York City
disc jockey David Mancuso found a copy in a West Indian record store and
[played it at the
Loft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/arts/music/love-saves-the-day-loft-playlist.html),
a pioneering disco space, and the influential radio host Frankie Crocker
put the song in heavy rotation on WBLS. Soon there were more than a
dozen cover versions, as the imported original disc sold out. Atlantic
Records licensed Mr. Dibango’s original, which reached the American pop
Top 40 in 1973.

The song opened a worldwide touring and recording circuit for Mr.
Dibango. He collaborated widely: with the reggae producers Sly Dunbar
and Robbie Shakespeare in Jamaica, with Serge Gainsbourg in Paris, with
the bassist and producer Bill Laswell in the group Deadline in the
United States. In 1992 he recorded “Wakafrica,” an album of African hits
with guest appearances by King Sunny Ade, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Salif
Keita, Papa Wemba, N’dour, Ms. Kidjo and others.

Information on survivors was not immediately available.

Mr. Dibango’s extensive catalog includes film scores, jazz standards,
reggae, pop and hip-hop. In 2017 he released “M & M,” a collaboration
with a jazz saxophonist from Mozambique, Moreira Chonquiça, and in 2018
he released “Cubafrica,” a collaboration with the Cuban group Cuarteto
Patria. Many of his other albums fused [jazz, funk, African instruments,
and dance beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=zK69LoCTYus) —
electronic or hand-played — behind his terse melodic lines.

“Sound is a magma. You have to give it a form. It’s never the same,” Mr.
Dibango said in a 1991 interview with [UNESCO Courier
magazine](https://en.unesco.org/courier/march-1991/interview-manu-dibango).
“In music there is neither past nor future, only the present. I must
compose the music of my time, not yesterday’s
music.”
