# Nashom Wooden, Downtown Denizen, Is Dead at 50

</div>

He had survived every iteration of gay nightlife. Then came a sudden
illness, believed to be the novel coronavirus.

The messages began pinging around Instagram around noon on Monday.

Nashom Wooden, an omnipresence on New York’s gay bar and club scene, was
dead at 50 after a short illness that he had suspected but not confirmed
was Covid-19.

It came as a shock, first because Mr. Wooden looked barely different
than he had at 35, but also because among people in nightlife, there was
about him a survivalist quality rivaled only by Susanne Bartsch, the
drag queen empress whose parties he sometimes appeared at, and [Lady
Bunny](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/29/style/lady-bunny-drag-queen.html),
his drag queen comrade and former roommate.

Over the years, Mr. Wooden performed in heels as Mona Foot; appeared
with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert DeNiro in the 1999 movie
“[Flawless](https://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/library/film/112499flaw-film-review.html)”;
co-wrote and performed a song that became a top 10 hit all around
Europe; bartended at the Cock, a longtime gay dive in Manhattan’s East
Village neighborhood; and showed up at countless movie premieres and
fashion shows, usually [in
his](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-GGYGwjffJ/) fitted Maison Margiela
leather jacket, dark jeans and Rick Owens boots.

Mr. Wooden grew up in Brooklyn but came of age at [Boy
Bar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/20/style/new-york-gay-bars-that-are-gone.html),
the not-quite-bar not-quite-nightclub where many an early ’90s drag
queen was hatched.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The original idea (it's not exactly clear whose) was to turn him into
what Lady Bunny described as a “a sassy mammy character,” with Aretha
Franklin wigs and floral print ’50s dresses.

But Mona had glamour running through her veins, down past her bulging
calves. So off went that look and on came the glittery,
[Barbarella](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-GA4r3pJjo/)- and [Wonder
Woman](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Fqtz4h62D/)-inspired duds.

At night, Mr. Wooden hosted Mona Foot’s “Star Search,” a weekly
competition at Barracuda that preceded RuPaul’s “Drag Race” by more than
15 years and probably served as one of its inspirations.

During the day, Mr. Wooden ran the men’s department at the Patricia
Field boutique, working alongside Candis Cayne, another of the scene’s
best-known personalities.

In heels onstage, he was a terrifying presence. “He could really cut a
bitch,” Ms. Cayne said. Out of heels, he was a mensch.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By the end of the ’90s, Mr. Wooden had been cast as one of a gaggle of
drag queens in “Flawless,” where he serves as one of Mr. Hoffman’s
sidekicks and performs Cher’s “Half Breed” in a drag club.

He and his sisters of the cloth, JoJo Americo and Paul Alexander
(performing as the trio The Ones), [recorded a
song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_e5oYqNRSM) with the movie’s
title. It went to No. 4 on the Billboard Club Play chart, No. 7 in the
United Kingdom and No. 2 in Belgium.

George Michael added a few lyrics and rerecorded it a few years later as
“Flawless (Go to the City).” It became his last big hit.

From there, The Ones recorded a few albums and performed at festivals
around the world. But Mr. Wooden was less known for having a career than
for being a presence.

“He was at every gym, he was at every club, he was equally beautiful in
and out of drag,” said Christopher Peregrin, the global director of
partnerships at Magnum, a leading photography agency. “Sometimes, these
queens wash their faces, take off the make up and the attractiveness
disappears. But he was as compelling [out of
drag](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FmVdbhEqn/) as he was in it.”

“A [Tom of Finland-looking
god](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-HAIqPC-PN/),” Ms. Cayne said

Three weeks ago, Mr. Wooden was in peak physical shape, working out with
friends in Chelsea. A week and a half ago, he was holed up at home in
the East Village with what seemed to be a strange flu.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some days it was worse, others better.

In text messages to [David
Dalrymple](https://www.instagram.com/daviddalrympleinc/?hl=en), a
costume designer who made many of Mona’s outfits, Mr. Wooden expressed
confusion about what was going on. “He told me he wasn’t having trouble
breathing, but I’m guessing he just didn’t want to worry me,” Mr.
Dalrymple said, adding that no one in their circle of friends heard that
he sought testing or care.

On Thursday, he told Mr. Dalrymple he was about to start watching
“Westworld.”

“He seemed to think he was improving,” Mr. Dalrymple said.

But Saturday rolled around and he fell out of touch. Friends simply
couldn’t reach him.

On Monday morning, Mr. Dalrymple became concerned enough to go over to
his apartment. Using a spare key, he opened the door and found his
collaborator inside, dead.

This was all but unimaginable to those that knew him.

Mr. Wooden had H.I.V. for many years, friends said, but he was on
medication and was “undetectable,” the term used for people whose viral
load drops to virtually zero.

“He ate well, he slept well, he was at the gym six times a week,” said
Josh Jordan, a fashion photographer who’d just run into him in February.
“There weren’t mental illness or addiction issues. There was nothing
sketchy in his life. That’s why it’s so crazy. It’s an awful wake-up
call.”
