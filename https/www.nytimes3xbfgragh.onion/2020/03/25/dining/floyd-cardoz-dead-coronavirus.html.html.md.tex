the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Floyd Cardoz, an international restaurateur and the first chef to bring
the sweep and balance of his native Indian cooking to fine dining in the
United States, died on Tuesday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair,
N.J. He was 59.

The cause was the coronavirus, his family said.

\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l2vGEQHT1M}{Mr. Cardoz} was the
first chef born and raised in India to lead an influential New York City
kitchen, at Tabla, which he and the restaurateur Danny Meyer opened in
the Flatiron district of Manhattan in 1998. Soon after, Ruth Reichl of
The New York Times gave Mr. Cardoz's cooking a rapturous
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/02/24/dining/restaurants-american-food-indian-spices.html}{review}.

``Yes, I thought. This is what I have been waiting for,'' she wrote.
``This is American food, viewed through a kaleidoscope of Indian
spices.''

Before opening Tabla, Mr. Cardoz cooked at the luxurious New York
restaurant
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/04/11/nyregion/a-gilded-age-of-sumptuous-dining-comes-to-a-close-in-the-st-regis-hotel.html}{Lespinasse},
where he rose from line cook to executive sous-chef under the Swiss chef
Gray Kunz. (Mr. Kunz
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/obituaries/gray-kunz-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1}{died}
this month.)

Mr. Kunz, like many chefs who participated in the revolution in French
cooking known as nouvelle cuisine, was already occasionally deploying
Asian ingredients like ginger, cardamom and star anise, but at Tabla,
Mr. Cardoz summoned a fully Indian-American modern cuisine with dishes
like halibut in watermelon curry and spice-braised oxtails with tapioca.

The Atlanta-based chef
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/06/dining/chef-asha-gomez-india.html}{Asha
Gomez} said Mr. Cardoz's work at Tabla inspired her culinary career and
those of many other Indian-American chefs.

``I remember walking into that restaurant and feeling this sense of
pride that I had never felt as an Indian,'' she said. ``To see what he
had done to elevate Indian cuisine to the likes of French cuisine ---
because it deserves to be in that same light --- was at the time
mind-blowing to me.''

Floyd Mark Cardoz was born in Mumbai, India, on Oct. 2, 1960, and grew
up there. He pursued a culinary career at a time when such a course was
unusual in India for a young professional, especially one who had
studied biochemistry.

He met his wife, Barkha, when they were both students at hospitality
school in Mumbai, then worked for the prestigious Taj Group of hotels.
He went on to study European haute cuisine in Switzerland, and the
couple emigrated to the United States in 1988.

His partner at Tabla, Mr. Meyer, said on Wednesday that Mr. Cardoz's
perseverance kept the vision of Indian-American fine dining intact when
doubters and some early reviews were negative, often complaining that
the food was either too Indian or not Indian enough.

``He was a super-taster, big-hearted, stubborn as the day is long,'' Mr.
Meyer said in a statement. ``He never once lost his sense of love for
those he'd worked with, mentored and mattered to.''

After Tabla closed in 2010, Mr. Cardoz went on to head the kitchens at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/28/dining/restaurant-review-blue-smoke-and-north-end-grill.html}{North
End Grill}, in Battery Park City; at White Street, in TriBeCa; and at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/09/dining/paowalla-review.html}{Paowalla},
in SoHo, which became
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/15/dining/floyd-cardoz-paowalla-closing-bombay-bread-bar.html}{Bombay
Bread Bar}. All are now closed. His 2016 cookbook,
``\href{https://www.wnyc.org/story/flavorwalla/}{Flavorwalla},'' adapted
his cooking style for American home cooks.

After winning the culinary competition television show ``Top Chef
Masters'' in 2011 with a variation on upma, a South Indian breakfast
staple, Mr. Cardoz became a celebrity son of India. In Mumbai, he opened
the \href{http://thebombaycanteen.com/}{Bombay Canteen} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/19/travel/o-pedro-restaurant-mumbai-review.html}{O
Pedro}, a restaurant influenced by his family's Portuguese roots in Goa.

This month, he visited the city to attend an anniversary party for
Bombay Canteen and to oversee the opening of his
\href{https://www.bombaysweetshop.com/}{Bombay Sweet Shop}. On
Instagram, \href{https://www.instagram.com/p/B92S1FunVEX/}{he wrote}
that he had become ill soon after returning home to Roseland, N.J., on
March 8.

He is survived by his wife; his sons, Peter and Justin; his mother,
Beryl Cardoz; and five siblings.
