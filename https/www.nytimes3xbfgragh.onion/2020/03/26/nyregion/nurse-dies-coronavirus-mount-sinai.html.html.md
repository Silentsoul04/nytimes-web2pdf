Kious Kelly, a nurse manager at a Manhattan hospital, texted his sister
on March 18 with some devastating news: He had tested positive for the
coronavirus and was on a ventilator in the intensive care unit. He told
her he could text but not talk.

“I’m okay. Don’t tell Mom and Dad. They’ll worry,” he wrote to his
sister, Marya Patrice Sherron.

That was his last message. Ms. Sherron’s subsequent texts to him went
unanswered. In less than a week, he was dead.

Mr. Kelly, a 48-year-old assistant nurse manager at Mount Sinai West,
may have been the first New York City nurse to die from the virus.

His sister said he had asthma but was otherwise well.

“His death could have been prevented,” [Ms. Sherron said on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/marya.patrice.5) Wednesday.
Later, she added: “I’m angry. He was healthy.”

Colleagues at the hospital were angry, too. Some complained on social

clothing or
masks.

A nurse who worked with Mr. Kelly said the hospital had offered nurses
one plastic protective gown for an entire shift, though normal protocol
required a change of gowns between interactions with infected patients.
The nurse, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the staff member
was not authorized to speak to the media, said Mr. Kelly had not used
protective equipment, even though he regularly helped nurses on his team
with hands-on care.

As recently as March 10, he helped a nurse take off her protective gear
after working with a patient who tested positive for the virus, the
nurse said.

Several Mount Sinai West staff members, contacted for this story, said
they had been told by hospital administrators not to speak to
journalists. Mr. Kelly’s death was first reported [in The New York
Post](https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/worker-at-nyc-hospital-where-nurses-wear-trash-bags-as-protection-dies-from-coronavirus/).

Gia Lisa Krahne, an outside consultant who provided alternative
Ayurvedic care to a patient at Mount Sinai West, said she last saw Mr.
Kelly at work the week of March 9, interacting with patients and
hospital staff, wearing neither a mask nor any protective gear.

[Bevon Bloise, a registered nurse at Mount Sinai
West,](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/bevin.watters?fref=profile_friend_list&hc_location=friends_tab)
complained on Facebook that the hospital does not have sufficient
personal protective equipment, or P.P.E. “I’m also very angry with the
Mount Sinai Health System for not protecting him. We do not have enough
PPE, we do not have the correct PPE, and we do not have the appropriate
staffing to handle this pandemic. And I do not appreciate
representatives of this health system saying otherwise on the news.”

“We lost a great fighter during this war,” a co-worker named [Diana
Torres said on
Facebook.](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/profile.php?id=100002423997442&fref=nf&__tn__=%2Cdm-R-R&eid=ARD3RFKP5QZqsa_C3RBnYqLHsbpfiCZa6AZq3nus_0V7UW1KwfIR7flzwZ7k7w6LQhwdE-33JrbViY5k)
She posted a photo of co-workers tying bandannas over their faces in an
effort to protect themselves. “NO THIS IS NOT PROPER PPE,” she wrote.

On its Facebook page, Mount Sinai West said it was “deeply saddened by
the passing of a beloved member of our nursing staff,” without naming
Mr. Kelly.

In an email, a hospital spokeswoman, Lucia Lee, disputed the claim that
the hospital had not furnished protective equipment to its staff. “This
crisis is straining the resources of all New York area hospitals, and
while we do — and have had — enough protective equipment for our staff,
we will all need more in the weeks ahead,” Ms. Lee said in the
statement.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The New York Post article included a photo of hospital staff wearing
garbage bags over what appeared to be scrubs. Two nurses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of being fired, said they were
disposable scrubs made of permeable material, which is why nurses
wrapped plastic garbage bags around them.

The photo, they said, was taken on March 17, at a time when there were
many coronavirus patients at the hospital and others who had yet to be
tested but who presented symptoms of infection.

In the emailed statement, Ms. Lee added that “the troubling photo
circulating in the media specifically shows the nurses in proper P.P.E.
underneath garbage bags.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She did not respond to a question asking why hospital staff wore garbage
bags.

Mr. Kelly lived a few blocks away from the hospital and was described by
colleagues as a dedicated, good-humored colleague.

“He used to carry around a thick notepad holder that hides a box full of
chocolates and candies so he can have it handy to give out to miserable/
grumbly nurses and doctors who are more likely than not ‘hangry,’”
[Joanne Loo, a nurse at Mount Sinai West, posted on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/joanne.loo.9)on Wednesday.

But nursing was not his first vocation. A native of Lansing, Michigan,
Mr. Kelly moved to New York more than 20 years ago to pursue a career as
a dancer, his sister said. He then went to nursing school and worked as
a nurse at Mount Sinai West, before being promoted to the post of
assistant manager in the telemetry department.

His family is now trying to bring his body back to Michigan.

“We know we can’t have a service anytime soon, but we want him home,”
Ms. Sherron said. “He died alone. We want him home now.”
