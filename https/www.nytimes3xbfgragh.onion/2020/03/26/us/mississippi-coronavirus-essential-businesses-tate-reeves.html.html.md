# Mississippi Governor Clarifies Order Defining Most Businesses as Essential

</div>

Gov. Tate Reeves issued a supplement to an executive order about
essential businesses, saying it was a standard for local leaders, who
had already issued their own.

Days after issuing an executive order that broadly defined most
[businesses as
essential](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/wwe-essential-business-florida-coronavirus.html)
during the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/wwe-essential-business-florida-coronavirus.html)
shutdown, Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said on Thursday that it was
not meant to interfere with decisions made by local governments.

Governor Reeves signed the order on Tuesday, saying that essential
businesses should be allowed to stay open, with some limitations, during
the coronavirus shutdown. It offered a broad list of such businesses,
including some that were exempt from limits on gatherings of more than
10 people as long as they took into account “reasonable measures,” such
as social distancing and sending sick employees home.

After widespread criticism, Governor Reeves said on Thursday that he
would issue a supplemental notice saying that the order was intended as
“a floor statewide” for local governments to follow.

Some cities and counties in the state had already imposed their own more
narrow restrictions regarding which businesses were considered
essential, leading to confusion about how the state order would be
executed.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Thursday, Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the
executive order was considered a “state managed, locally executed”
directive that “sets a statewide standard in terms of social distancing
and defining essential businesses to slow the spread and protect public
health.”

“This establishes statewide parameters that local leaders on the front
lines can build on to make decisions that are in the best interest of
their communities,” Ms. Eze said in a statement. She said the supplement
to the order would “clarify that no local precautionary measures are
overruled by this executive order and ensure that essential businesses
remain open.”

At a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Governor Reeves sought to
clarify the intent of the original order.

“If any municipality wants to utilize their local emergency power — and
a lot of them do, and that’s perfectly fine — if they want to utilize
their emergency power to go beyond what the state does, as long as their
ordinance does not directly conflict with allowing for what the state
order says, then they’re perfectly fine to do so.”

But Governor Reeves also said that the order was written to ensure that
no county or municipal order “can keep those essential services from
going on.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The executive order defines essential businesses as those involved in
public safety, including emergency medical workers and health care
operations and facilities. It also includes laundromats and home and
auto repair. Restaurants and bars were also considered essential and
could provide dine-in services, but they were not allowed to have more
than 10 customers at a time in seating areas or other indoor spaces.

The list included nearly every type of business, including financial and
religious institutions, and real estate services. On Twitter, the
governor said he [rejected “dictatorship models like
China”](https://twitter.com/tatereeves/status/1242845607309565956) in
his approach to the order, which in some cases appeared, in effect, to
overturn local orders [put into place by local
governments](https://m.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/24/gov-tate-reeves-orders-limited-gatherings-today-ex/).

In Oxford, Miss., Mayor Robyn Tannehill said that the city government
was confused about how to carry out the order and merge it with its own
resolution on March 22 about how businesses should operate.

Oxford, about an hour south of Memphis, has a population of about
25,000, with a large retirement community. But the local population is
infused with an additional 20,000 students attending the University of
Mississippi.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“Our first reading of the executive order caused us great concern and
confusion, as it appeared it was superseding all of the plans and
policies that we had put in place for our community,” she said on
Thursday.

One example, she said, was that the executive order appeared to allow
restaurants to open their dining rooms to 10 people or fewer. “It seemed
to open the door for a lot of businesses we had asked to be curbside
only, or to close,” she said.

The order also lacked clear penalties for violators, whereas in Oxford,
violators could face a $1,000 fine, she said.

Ms. Tannehill said she spoke with Governor Reeves on Wednesday. “He said
his intention was not to open the doors wider, but to get a minimum
standard,” she said. “And I think he understood that different
communities are going to have to approach this differently.”

Mississippi has reported 485 Covid-19 cases, of which five were fatal,
the State’s Department of Health said. The order was signed as
neighboring Louisiana was experiencing the [fastest growth in new
coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-louisiana-new-orleans.html)
in the world, with nearly 1,800 reported as of Thursday. Gov. John Bel
Edwards of Louisiana said on Tuesday that the current trajectory of case
growth in Louisiana was similar to those in Spain and Italy.

Governor Reeves’s order said that, through April 17, Mississippi
residents should avoid “social and other nonessential gatherings” of
more than 10 people in “close proximity.” “This does not apply to normal
operations of locations like airports, medical and health care
facilities, retail shopping including grocery and department stores,
offices, factories and other manufacturing facilities or any essential
