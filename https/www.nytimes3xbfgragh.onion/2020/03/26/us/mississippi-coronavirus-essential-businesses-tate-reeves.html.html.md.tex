\section{Mississippi Governor Clarifies Order Defining Most Businesses
as
Essential}\label{mississippi-governor-clarifies-order-defining-most-businesses-as-essential}}

Gov. Tate Reeves issued a supplement to an executive order about
essential businesses, saying it was a standard for local leaders, who
had already issued their own.

Days after issuing an executive order that broadly defined most
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/wwe-essential-business-florida-coronavirus.html}{businesses
as essential} during the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/wwe-essential-business-florida-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus}
shutdown, Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said on Thursday that it was
not meant to interfere with decisions made by local governments.

Governor Reeves signed the order on Tuesday, saying that essential
businesses should be allowed to stay open, with some limitations, during
the coronavirus shutdown. It offered a broad list of such businesses,
including some that were exempt from limits on gatherings of more than
10 people as long as they took into account ``reasonable measures,''
such as social distancing and sending sick employees home.

After widespread criticism, Governor Reeves said on Thursday that he
would issue a supplemental notice saying that the order was intended as
``a floor statewide'' for local governments to follow.

Some cities and counties in the state had already imposed their own more
narrow restrictions regarding which businesses were considered
essential, leading to confusion about how the state order would be
executed.

On Thursday, Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the
executive order was considered a ``state managed, locally executed''
directive that ``sets a statewide standard in terms of social distancing
and defining essential businesses to slow the spread and protect public
health.''

``This establishes statewide parameters that local leaders on the front
lines can build on to make decisions that are in the best interest of
their communities,'' Ms. Eze said in a statement. She said the
supplement to the order would ``clarify that no local precautionary
measures are overruled by this executive order and ensure that essential
businesses remain open.''

At a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Governor Reeves sought to
clarify the intent of the original order.

``If any municipality wants to utilize their local emergency power ---
and a lot of them do, and that's perfectly fine --- if they want to
utilize their emergency power to go beyond what the state does, as long
as their ordinance does not directly conflict with allowing for what the
state order says, then they're perfectly fine to do so.''

But Governor Reeves also said that the order was written to ensure that
no county or municipal order ``can keep those essential services from
going on.''

The executive order defines essential businesses as those involved in
public safety, including emergency medical workers and health care
operations and facilities. It also includes laundromats and home and
auto repair. Restaurants and bars were also considered essential and
could provide dine-in services, but they were not allowed to have more
than 10 customers at a time in seating areas or other indoor spaces.

The list included nearly every type of business, including financial and
religious institutions, and real estate services. On Twitter, the
governor said he
\href{https://twitter.com/tatereeves/status/1242845607309565956}{rejected
``dictatorship models like China''} in his approach to the order, which
in some cases appeared, in effect, to overturn local orders
\href{https://m.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/24/gov-tate-reeves-orders-limited-gatherings-today-ex/}{put
into place by local governments}.

In Oxford, Miss., Mayor Robyn Tannehill said that the city government
was confused about how to carry out the order and merge it with its own
resolution on March 22 about how businesses should operate.

Oxford, about an hour south of Memphis, has a population of about
25,000, with a large retirement community. But the local population is
infused with an additional 20,000 students attending the University of
Mississippi.

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make

``Our first reading of the executive order caused us great concern and
confusion, as it appeared it was superseding all of the plans and
policies that we had put in place for our community,'' she said on
Thursday.

One example, she said, was that the executive order appeared to allow
restaurants to open their dining rooms to 10 people or fewer. ``It
seemed to open the door for a lot of businesses we had asked to be
curbside only, or to close,'' she said.

The order also lacked clear penalties for violators, whereas in Oxford,
violators could face a \$1,000 fine, she said.

Ms. Tannehill said she spoke with Governor Reeves on Wednesday. ``He
said his intention was not to open the doors wider, but to get a minimum
standard,'' she said. ``And I think he understood that different
communities are going to have to approach this differently.''

Mississippi has reported 485 Covid-19 cases, of which five were fatal,
the State's Department of Health said. The order was signed as
neighboring Louisiana was experiencing the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-louisiana-new-orleans.html}{fastest
growth in new coronavirus cases} in the world, with nearly 1,800
reported as of Thursday. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on
Tuesday that the current trajectory of case growth in Louisiana was
similar to those in Spain and Italy.

Governor Reeves's order said that, through April 17, Mississippi
residents should avoid ``social and other nonessential gatherings'' of
more than 10 people in ``close proximity.'' ``This does not apply to
normal operations of locations like airports, medical and health care
facilities, retail shopping including grocery and department stores,
offices, factories and other manufacturing facilities or any essential
business or operation,'' it said.

\href{https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/24/governor-wait-and-see-state-lockdown-despite-71-ne/}{In
a news conference on Tuesday,} Governor Reeves said that he had been in
