At The Times, he vitalized what in lesser hands might have been
benumbing explications of property tax assessments and revisions of the
City Charter.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Alan Finder, an unflappable eye in the storm of daily newspapering,
reported on or oversaw coverage of New York City government, education,
urban affairs, sports and international news during nearly three decades
at The New York Times.

He died on Tuesday at 72 at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J., his
daughter, Lauren Drucker, said.

Mr. Finder had complained of mild symptoms of a cold starting around
March 7. When the symptoms worsened, his internist sent him to the
emergency room for a chest X-ray, to rule out pneumonia, and a
coronavirus test. The X-ray apparently proved negative, and doctors
released him because they doubted he had the virus and feared he might
be more likely to become infected in the hospital.

His condition deteriorated at home, however, and he was admitted to the
hospital early on March 14. That evening, the test results confirmed
that he had contracted the virus.

Mr. Finder was a beat reporter on the metropolitan desk, bureau chief at
City Hall and an editor for sports enterprise and for regional news at
The Week in Review.

In an often frenetic profession, he found the time to mentor colleagues,
maintained a sardonic --- but never cynical --- sense of humor, and
managed to vitalize what in lesser hands might have been benumbing
explications of why property tax assessments, revisions of the City
Charter and affirmative action goals in granting municipal contracts
were relevant to average readers.

Born on Feb. 19, 1948, in Brooklyn, Alan Aaron Finder graduated from
Valley Stream South High School on Long Island and earned a bachelor's
degree in history from the University of Rochester in 1969 and a
master's in American studies from Yale.

He worked as a reporter and editor for The Bergen Record in Hackensack,
N.J., and a reporter at Newsday, on Long Island, before joining The
Times in 1983.

He retired in 2011, but had worked part time as an editor at The Record,
Newsday and, until recently, on the international desk of The Times.

He lived in Ridgewood, N.J., with his wife, Elaine (Isaacson) Finder. In
addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by their son, Jason.
