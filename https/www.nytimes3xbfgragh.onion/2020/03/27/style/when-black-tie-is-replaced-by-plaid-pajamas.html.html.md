*With the New York gala circuit on hiatus because of the coronavirus
outbreak, here is how some patrons and society figures are spending
their time (and money) while self-isolated. Interviews have been edited
for space.*

## Stacey Bendet

**Age**: 41

**Occupation**: fashion designer, Alice + Olivia

**Favorite Charities**: [No Kid Hungry](https://www.nokidhungry.org/)
and [Good+Foundation](https://goodplusfoundation.org/).

**Where are you hunkering down?** Malibu, Calif.

**Have you evolved a daily routine?** When things seemed dicey in New
York, I sent my children to Malibu. I flew out to be with them 10 days
ago. At first it was chaos, but we’ve set up a little schoolhouse, a
room with a whiteboard and iPads, where the girls (they’re 4, 9 and 11)
can study. Our babysitter, who is living with us, handles the lessons.
We’re not all cut out to be math teachers (laughs).

**What’s your advice for parents trying to keep up a semblance of order
and sanity?** It’s important to take an hour in the morning to work out,
or just think. When you’re not used to being with your children 24-7,
you’re going to need that early morning downtime.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What about work?** We’ve set up a mini office in our house. It’s
tricky, but everyone is on mobile videoconferencing apps so we can have
marketing, budget and design discussions. We have to get our samples
done. There is no retail now, but your business really can’t stop.

**How do you keep up your charitable giving?** I’m working with No Kid
Hungry. We’ve donated 10 percent of our online sales to support working
moms and supply meals to the millions of children who would otherwise be
relying on schools for their lunch.

**What tweaks have you made in your socializing?** We have Zoom dinner
parties. Everyone sits down with their iPad or phone and a glass of
wine. We all laugh. Sure, there are glitches. Some of us look kind of
blurry onscreen. Who cares?

**Are you feeling nostalgic for your New York life?** I miss passing the
deli on my morning walks, with all the colorful flowers out front. It’s
the little things that you took for granted that you’re reminded to
appreciate in the future.

And I miss dressing up. Sometimes I just stare at my beautiful racks of
clothes. Last week I was telling a friend on the phone, “You can’t wear
plaid pajamas all day.” That’s become my life rule.

## Debbie Bancroft

**Age**: 65

**Occupation**: columnist for the [New York Social
Diary](https://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/)

**Favorite Charities**: Parrish Art Museum (she is on the board) and the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

**Where are you hunkering down?** Southampton, N.Y.

**Have you adopted any novel forms of socializing?** My daughter,
Serena; my son, Will, who is in Los Angeles ; and I are on FaceTime. We
do a cook-off almost nightly. I made beef stroganoff last night and
shrimp scampi the night before. We’re a little competitive, but we also
inspire each other. We’re longing for a little scratch-and-sniff app on
our phones.

**What do you miss the most?** I miss just a handful of friends, and
especially my monthly dinners with my best friend Chappy \[Morris\] at
table 12 at the Carlyle — a little pocket of civilization in Manhattan.

**How about the parties?** I don’t miss the big charity parties. I do
think it will be revelatory in the next couple of months to see who will
still be supporting these causes, now that their pictures are not being
published.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What are some pet peeves?** There are people who actually brag about
the way they’re distancing themselves from their housekeepers or
trainers, like that’s a badge of honor. This kind of crisis puts a
magnifying glass on who we really are.

**How are you keeping your spirits up?** I’m fostering an old cat. He’s
called Bear, because he’s big and black like a bear. Serena and I found
him on the Animal Rescue Fund van that comes around from time to time.
Seeing him propped inside in a corner really was a heart tugger. There
are so many older animals that no one is going to adopt. They need a
home.

Drinking for me is a purely social sport, so I’m having an inadvertent
dry spell. But boy, there is a martini on the other side of
this.

## Wes Gordon

**Age:** 33

**Occupation:** creative director at Carolina Herrera

**Favorite Charities:** [A Common
Thread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/style/coronavirus-fashion-rescue-plan.html),
a new initiative by Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of
America, and Parsons School of Design (he is a board member).

**Where he is hunkering down:** his farm in northeastern Connecticut.

**What’s your version of “Keep Calm and Carry On”?**

I wake up when I normally would, shower, pick up my clothes and get
dressed. Doing these ordinary things can make a huge difference. I find
myself checking in by phone with friends and family and people I’ve been
out of touch with for a while. We take Bird, our little cockapoo, for
walks. She normally has a strict routine. This has really turned her
world upside down.

We’ve never spent as much time on social media or watching movies and TV
— films they’ve released for home viewing, like “Emma” and “Invisible
Man.” The strangest thing is watching people kiss in these films, or
have dinner together.

**Is there a positive side to this crisis?**

We’re talking about a dire situation. There is no silver lining. But in
so many ways we’re united. Humanity is more connected as a whole than in
any time I can recall.

**How are you keeping up with work?**

I have two video chats a day with the design team and product
development. I’m planning sketches and pinning them to a pin board. In a
lot of ways it’s similar to being at the office.

But what can’t be replaced is the craft and human interaction: draping,
looking at fabric and embroidery swatches, working with the
patternmakers and seamstresses. These are the heart and soul of any
design studio, and some of the things I miss most.
