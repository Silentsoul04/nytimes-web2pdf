*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

[Mike Longo](https://www.mikelongojazz.com/), a jazz pianist, composer
and educator best known for his long association with the trumpeter
Dizzy Gillespie, died on March 22 in Manhattan. He was 83.

The cause was the coronavirus, Dorothy Longo, his wife of 32 years,
said.

As a musician and a composer, said Matthew Snyder, who had studied
composition with Mr. Longo and played baritone saxophone with the big
band he led, the [New York State of the Art Jazz
Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-lHtW5wDA), Mr. Longo “was
simultaneously very earthy and also had the highest possible level of
harmony and melodicism and complexity in his musical conception.”

As an educator, Mr. Longo wrote 10 books and produced four DVDs,
espousing concepts he had refined while working with Mr. Gillespie. He
also advocated tirelessly for other artists, engaging them for concerts
and releasing their recordings on [CAP (Consolidated Artists
Productions)](https://jazztimes.com/archives/label-watch-consolidated-artists/),
which he had established as a publishing company in 1970 and a record
label in 1981.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He took on other artists because he wanted them to have a forum to
produce their own music and express their creativity,” Ms. Longo said in
an email. “CAP is an umbrella organization whereby musicians produced
and owned their own product, but if Mike chose to take them on, because
of his reputation, he was able to get airplay and distribution.”

Born into a musical household, Mr. Longo played his first nightclub
date, with the alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, while still in high
school. After arriving in New York in 1960, he found work supporting
musicians like the trumpeter Red Allen and the tenor saxophonist Coleman
Hawkins at the Metropole, a Manhattan nightclub. A year later, he moved
to Toronto to study with the pianist Oscar Peterson.

Returning to New York in 1962, Mr. Longo became an in-demand accompanist
for singers including Nancy Wilson, Gloria Lynne and Joe Williams. In
1965 he led a house band at the New York nightclub Embers West, where he
performed with a wide range of luminaries. A year later, Mr. Gillespie
engaged him as his musical director and arranger, an association that
would endure until 1975, and informally until shortly before [Mr.
Gillespie’s death
in 1993](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1993/01/07/arts/dizzy-gillespie-who-sounded-some-of-modern-jazz-s-earliest-notes-dies-at-75.html).

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Longo went on to perform and record solo, in duos
and[trios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bgr-fDptYQ), and with the
New York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble, which he founded in 1998.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mike’s book was roughly split between his arrangements of other tunes
and his original tunes,” Mr. Snyder said of Mr. Longo’s repertoire, “and
it was obvious it was all the same thing for him; even his arrangements
were
recompositions.”

<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0" data-aria-hidden="true">Mr. Longo
was still with Mr. Gillespie when he released the album “Matrix” in
1972. He would continue to perform and would record prolifically as a
bandleader, arranger and composer after leaving Mr. Gillespie’s band in
1975.</span>

</div>

</div>

Michael Joseph Longo was born on March 19, 1937, in Cincinnati, to
Michael Anthony Longo and Elvira Margaret (Vitello) Longo. He began to
study piano with his mother, a homemaker who sang and played the piano
and the organ, at age 3, starting formal lessons a year later. The
family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where Mr. Longo’s father
established a successful business supplying produce to stores and to
restaurants while also leading bands in which he played bass.

Mr. Longo’s father hired Mr. Adderley, who was black, to play in his
band at a time when racial mixing was uncommon and potentially perilous.
Mr. Adderley in turn took young Mr. Longo under his wing, engaging him
for church performances and, on one occasion, an engagement at Porky’s
Hideaway, a Fort Lauderdale jazz club.

Mr. Longo studied classical piano at Western Kentucky University,
graduating in 1959 with a B.A. in music. Offered a scholarship by the
jazz magazine DownBeat, he opted instead to pursue his education on the
road with a small combo, the Salt City Six, and then in New York. His
studies with Mr. Peterson in Toronto, Mr. Longo recalled in a 2006
interview with the website All About Jazz, taught him “how to play piano
and how to be a jazz pianist — textures, voicings, touch, time,
conception, tone on the instrument.”

Mr. Longo studied composition privately with [Hall
Overton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1972/11/26/archives/hall-overton-of-juilliard-dead-symphonic-and-jazz-composer.html)
from 1970 to 1972 and worked prolifically as a bandleader, arranger and
composer after leaving Mr. Gillespie’s employ. But his association with
Mr. Gillespie would dominate much of his professional career, even
offering him the opportunity to compose an orchestral work, “A World of
Gillespie” (1980), which Mr. Gillespie performed with the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to his wife, Mr. Longo is survived by a sister, Ellen.

Like Mr. Gillespie, Mr. Longo embraced the Baha’i faith, a religion that
espouses the unity of all people and finds truth in multiple faith
traditions. In 2004, he began leading weekly concerts at the [New York
City Baha’i Center](http://bahainyc.org/) in Greenwich Village. The last
concert was on March
10.
