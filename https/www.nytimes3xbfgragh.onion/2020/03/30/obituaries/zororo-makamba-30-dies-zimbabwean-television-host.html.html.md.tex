\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Zororo Makamba, a 30-year-old radio and television commentator and the
scion of one of Zimbabwe's wealthiest families, died on March 23, two
days after testing positive for the virus. His was the first recorded
death from the virus in that southern African nation.

His death was confirmed by Obadiah Moyo, Zimbabwe's health and child
care minister, and by Alexa Halvorssen, a friend.

Nurses in Zimbabwean state hospitals walked off their jobs earlier in
March because they lacked protective equipment, and the United Nations
warned that the main infectious-diseases hospital in Harare, the
capital, lacked intensive care beds.

``The government is ill-prepared to deal with the virus,'' Mr. Makamba's
older brother, Tawanda, was quoted as saying in the local news media.
His brother's test results were delayed, he said, and the hospital where
he was treated lacked a ventilator, oxygen equipment and other medical
supplies.

Mr. Makamba arrived in New York for a visit on Feb. 29 and returned to
Harare on March 9. He reported flulike symptoms three days later.
Because his immune system had been compromised by myasthenia gravis, a
chronic neuromuscular disease, and by surgery last fall to remove a
tumor, his doctor took extra precautions, his family said.

The doctor recommended that Mr. Makamba isolate himself and, after he
developed a fever, that he undergo tests at the Wilkins Infectious
Diseases Hospital in Harare. He died there.

Mr. Makamba was born on Jan. 17, 1990, a son of Irene and James Makamba.
His father is a politically connected media entrepreneur, former
broadcaster and philanthropist, and his mother is the managing director
of a food bank network.

He earned a bachelor's degree in communication from Michigan State
University in 2012 and a master's in producing from the New York Film
Academy.

In addition to his parents and his brother, his survivors include a
sister.

Mr. Makamba was best known for his online commentary and his appearances
on talk shows and current affairs programs, discussing climate change
and other political and social issues. Writing in The Herald, the
state-owned daily newspaper, Leroy Dzenga described Mr. Makamba as ``a
passionate, eloquent patriot who understood the role of lucid
communication in nation-building.''

On Twitter, Mr. Makamba described himself this way: ``I hold the pen and
my story is still being written.''
