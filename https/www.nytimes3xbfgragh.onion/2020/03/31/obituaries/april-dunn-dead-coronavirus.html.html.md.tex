33}\label{april-dunn-louisiana-fighter-for-disability-rights-dies-at-33}}

Ms. Dunn, who succumbed to the coronavirus, successfully pushed for
legislation that provided alternative ways to gain a high school degree.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

April Dunn, an advocate for people with disabilities who worked for the
governor of Louisiana, died of complications of the coronavirus on
Saturday in Baton Rouge. She was 33.

Her death was announced by Gov. John Bel Edwards. ``April worked hard as
an advocate for herself and other members of the disability community,''
he said.

Ms. Dunn was a very visible presence in the State Capitol. As chair of
the Louisiana Developmental Disabilities Council, she gave frequent
testimony and urged lawmakers to enact laws that could bring the
marginalized into life's mainstream. She was unable to take standardized
tests, and so never received a high school degree, but
\href{https://laddc.org/initiatives/education-and-early-intervention/current-education-issues/promotiondiploma-pathways/}{helped
pass a law that provided alternative paths to a degree}.

``She was a voice that people respected,'' said Bambi Polotzola,
director of the governor's office of disability affairs. ``When she
asked something of someone, you just knew it was the right thing for the
right reasons.''

She was also determinedly considerate, starting each day checking off a
list of friends' birthdays and wishing each of them a happy birthday
online.

Ms. Dunn was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and cerebral palsy. Her
mother, Joanette Dunn, who adopted her at 5 months, said Ms. Dunn had
frequent upper respiratory infections and episodes of pneumonia. ``She
did a lot of suffering as a baby,'' she recalled. ``She was always
sick.''

But Ms. Dunn was also determined to find a place in the world, her
mother said. ``I want to help people,'' she would tell her mother.
``People like me.''

She joined state government as an intern in 2017 and became a member of
the governor's staff in 2018. The governor
\href{https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/images/April/Untitled.mp4}{recorded
a public service announcement with her} to promote hiring people with
disabilities.

On March 10, Ms. Polotzola said, she, Ms. Dunn and another colleague
spent the day driving to meetings around the state. All three of them
became ill with the virus, she said, though her own case and the other
colleague's were mild.

By Thursday, doctors told Ms. Dunn's mother that they did not expect her
daughter to survive. On Friday, she entered the hospital; paramedics
warned her mother that she would not be allowed to visit. She sent Ms.
Polotzola a text message saying: ``I need for you to be strong. She is
dying.''

Remembering the moment they were preparing her daughter for the ride in
the ambulance, Ms. Dunn said April had an urgent request: ``Mommy, when
you come by, be sure to bring my cellphone and my notepad. I still need
to wish everyone a happy birthday.''
