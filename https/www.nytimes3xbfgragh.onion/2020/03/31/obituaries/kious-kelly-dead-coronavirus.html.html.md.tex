He may have been the first New York City nurse to be claimed by the
virus. His death has been a rallying cry.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Back in early January, before the first coronavirus case turned up in
the United States, Kious Kelly, an assistant nurse manager at Mount
Sinai West in Manhattan, was singled out in the hospital's blog --- not
for helping to make someone well, but for helping a family deal with a
patient's death.

``Assistant Nurse Manager Kious Jordan Kelly, RN, showed my mom and us
empathy and compassion that helped us get through the weekend and what
was to come,'' a man named Joseph Fuoco had written to the hospital's
president. ``He went above and beyond.''

Just a few weeks later, it was Mr. Kelly's family members and friends
who would need empathy and compassion. He
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/nyregion/nurse-dies-coronavirus-mount-sinai.html}{died
on March 24}, about a week after being placed on a ventilator. He may
have been the first nurse in New York to succumb to the illness.

His death, at age 48, was reported all over the country and beyond, and
friends and colleagues used it to highlight the shortage of protective
gear for medical personnel. It was a far different sort of fame than Mr.
Kelly might have dreamed of when he first arrived in New York years ago
from the Midwest.

Friends there knew him as James or Jamie. He was born Marion James Smith
IV in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1971. He grew up in Lansing, Mich., and
graduated from Everett High School there in 1989.

He moved to New York sometime after earning a bachelor's degree in
performing arts and dance at Butler University in Indianapolis in 1993.
He hoped to pursue a dance career.

But, as with many who come to New York with show business aspirations,
that ambition fell by the wayside, and Mr. Kelly went to nursing school.
He graduated from the nursing program at New York University in 2012.

Social media have been awash
\href{https://www.gofundme.com/f/covid19-nurse-hero-kious-kelly?utm_source=facebook\&fbclid=IwAR2HNJ9SiMmX2GmmmH72O4TU9l0x0DHVVdO_N9QJrCf2b1aTIdlwArcH3X0}{in
tributes} from friends and colleagues in the past week, and his sister,
Marya Patrice Sherron, has done numerous interviews talking about the
suddenness of his death and pleading for more protective gear for those
on the front lines.

``Too soon, too quick and not necessary,'' she told CNN.

In an impassioned post on
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/marya.patrice.5}{her Facebook
page} on March 27, Ms. Sherron wrote of how she hoped her brother would
be depicted.

``Let me be absolutely clear,'' she said. ``Kious was not a victim. He
served with love. If you needed care, you would get it. He ran toward
the oncoming enemy determined to bring survivors back with him. That's
who he was.''
