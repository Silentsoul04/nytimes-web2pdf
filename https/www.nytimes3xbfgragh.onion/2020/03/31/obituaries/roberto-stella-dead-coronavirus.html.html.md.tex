\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

In early March, Dr. Roberto Stella, a general practitioner in a town
near Milan, told a colleague that the medical staff at his practice had
run out of face masks and gloves.

``We're not stopping,'' he said. ``We're being careful and pressing
on.''

Dr. Stella died on March 11, the first doctor known to have succumbed to
the virus in Italy, Dr. Marco Cambielli, a colleague, said. ``The
\href{https://portale.fnomceo.it/elenco-dei-medici-caduti-nel-corso-dellepidemia-di-covid-19/}{first
of many},'' he added. Dr. Stella was 67.

Dr. Stella lived in Busto Arsizio, 20 miles northwest of Milan in
Lombardy, the Italian region that has been hit particularly hard by the
coronavirus. His death made headlines and was a grim reminder that
health care workers are among those at greatest risk. At least 66
Italian doctors have died of the virus through March, and thousands of
health care workers have been infected.

``Busto salutes you and above all thanks you; your example won't be
forgotten,'' Mayor Emanuele Antonelli wrote that day on his Facebook
page. The post received more than 300 comments, many from patients
praising Dr. Stella's bedside manner.

He was born in Busto on July 22, 1952, graduated from medical school in
1978 and began practicing there. He also specialized in hematology.

For nearly 30 years, Dr. Stella held elected positions with the Italian
National Federation of the Associations of Doctors, Surgeons and
Dentists, at both a local and a national level. For the national
organization, he was responsible for the medical training and continuing
medical education division. He sat on the boards of national medical
associations, was president of the Italian Scientific Society for
Continuing Medical Education of General Practitioners, and served on
Italy's government advisory board on health issues.

``When you've held various positions for many years, you leave an even
bigger void,'' Dr. Cambielli said.

With Dr. Stella's death, the Italian health system lost a ``point of
reference,'' Health Minister Roberto Speranza said.

Dr. Stela is survived by his wife, Daniela, and two sons.

His last publication for The BMJ, a peer-reviewed medical journal, was
a\href{https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1065/rr-7}{co-written
article} published on March 16 presenting an e-learning course on
Covid-19 that had been made available to Italian doctors ``a few hours
after the confirmation of the first case of local transmission in
Italy.''

``He was a real doctor,'' said Dr. Alessandro Colombo, another colleague
and friend. ``He worked until the end.''
