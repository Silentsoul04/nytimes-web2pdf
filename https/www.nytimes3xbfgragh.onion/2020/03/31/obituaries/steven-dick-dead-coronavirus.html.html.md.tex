\emph{This obituary is part of a series remembering the people who have
died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Steven Dick always dreamed of working for Britain's Foreign Office. In
December, more than 10 years after he joined it as a desk officer at the
office's migration directorate, he became the deputy head of mission at
the British Embassy in Budapest. Within weeks he was dead.

Mr. Dick died on Tuesday in Hungary after contracting the coronavirus,
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
\href{https://www.gov.uk/government/people/steven-dick}{said}. He was
37.

Praised for his kindness and dedication, Mr. Dick had worked his way up
the diplomatic ranks and had the potential to become an outstanding
diplomat, Simon McDonald, the head of the diplomatic service at the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
\href{https://twitter.com/SMcDonaldFCO/status/1242937595602108418?s=20}{wrote
on Twitter} on Thursday.

Mr. Dick, who was Scottish, was fluent in Hungarian and had studied
Arabic for a year before joining the British Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, as the head of press in 2011. Three years later, he became a
political officer at the British Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, and then
the chief of staff to the Foreign Office's chief operating officer in
London. He did a two-year stint in the Department for Digital, Culture,
Media and Sport before taking up his post in Hungary.

Hundreds of social media users paid tribute to Mr. Dick on Facebook
after the embassy in Budapest created a
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/notes/uk-in-hungary/book-of-condolences-in-memory-of-steven-dick/3050849818298957/}{virtual
condolence book} in his memory. The portrayed him as a man who wanted to
build bridges between countries, as one who was committed to immersing
himself in the Hungarian culture --- and also as a fine dancer, who once
taught a friend the Strip the Willow, a Scottish country dance.

``This young man won our hearts with learning our difficult language,''
one Hungarian commenter, Barbara Shuhai, wrote. ``Now our hearts are
broken losing him.''

Mr. Dick was born on May 16, 1982, in Glasgow. He is survived by his
parents, Steven and Carol Dick. In a statement, they said, ``It was
always his dream to work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and he
was very happy representing our country overseas.''
