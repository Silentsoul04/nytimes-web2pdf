Rachel Bodt has been mulling over the relevance of hair color in our new
lives.

``I think it comes down to doing whatever we can to make ourselves feel
good,'' said Ms. Bodt, a colorist. ``If you're looking at your roots and
feel like you just have to fix them, just do it.''

But where to start? Experts say deciding how to maintain your color at
home isn't just about the shade --- what red, brown or blond do I use?
It's also about how different your faux color is from your natural
shade. That assessment determines what tools you'll need, Ms. Bodt said.

Roots}\label{if-youre-showing-only-subtle-roots}}

Your hair has grown out, but the roots are pretty subtle. Your dye job
is a gentle change from your natural hair color. You're coloring a
little gray, or you've gone from brunette to a different shade of brown.
If this sounds like you, root cover-up sprays and powders will help.

For little patches of gray peeking through at the hairline, use a powder
like \href{https://www.colorwowhair.com/us/root-cover-up}{Color Wow Root
Cover Up}, \$34.50. A powder is easier to control in small areas than a
spray. For a larger area, use a spray like
\href{https://ritahazan.com/products/root-concealer-color-spray}{Rita
Hazan Root Concealer Touch-Up Spray}, \$25.

Pick the shade that best matches your hair and apply it conservatively.
It's better to layer on a little more if you need it. ``And do it in
your bathroom so you're not getting spray on anything you can't wipe
down,'' Ms. Bodt said.

Say you're covering a lot of gray or going from light to dark or brown
to red. Root touch-up sprays won't cut it for you. Try an at-home
permanent dye.

``The No. 1 rule when touching up your own color is put color only where
it's needed --- on the roots,'' said Jaxcee, a colorist and a founder of
the Coily Collective at the Riccardo Maggiore Salon on Fifth Avenue.
People mistakenly think they have to pull the dye through the entire
length of hair so it will blend well.

``If you keep putting dye where there's already color, your hair will
look opaque and less natural,'' Jaxcee said. ``Imagine the guys who use
spray-on color in a can.'' She suggests using a thick conditioner or
coconut oil on the parts of your hair that you aren't coloring to
prevent dye from penetrating.

Personalized colors from online companies
like\href{https://www.colorandco.com/}{Color \& Co} and
\href{https://www.madison-reed.com/}{Madison Reed} are the best choice
and are delivered to your home.

``My clients have had success with those brands,'' Ms. Bodt said. ``The
shades are realistic and beautiful and don't damage the hair. And when
clients come to their next appointments, I've been able to color their
hair nicely, which isn't always the case with drugstore dye.''

The biggest challenge is selecting the right shade. Color \& Co and
Madison Reed have questionnaires that generate shade options.

``Go with the color that is closest to your current color,'' Jaxcee
said. But the most important feature of at-home color is its tone, she
said. Is your current color neutral, warm or cool?

And think about your past experiences with hair dye. Does your hair tend
to pick up color easily? If so, and you're picking between shades,
choose a lighter color.

``As a rule, at-home color is more concentrated,'' Jaxcee said. ``The
dye load is heavy because companies want to make users feel like their
result is luscious and rich.''

If you're still having trouble deciding, reach out to your stylist for
some guidance. ``I've been helping my clients take the online
questionnaires and have even walked them through dyeing over FaceTime,''
Ms. Bodt said.

If you do get that level of help, offering your stylist, who is likely
out of work, some cash is a nice gesture.

Here are a few additional tips from the experts:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Test it out. If you're a first-timer or otherwise still nervous, work
  through the whole process on a hidden piece of hair at the back of
  your head.
\item
  Wear a button-down shirt while applying. ``You don't want to have to
  remove a shirt over year head when it's time to rinse,'' Ms. Bodt
  said.
\item
  Prime your hairline. Apply Vaseline or ChapStick to prevent staining.
\item
  Deep condition to maintain. Nonprofessional color can be drying to
  your hair. Use a moisturizing treatment at least once a week. Jaxcee
  also recommends a strengthening treatment,
  \href{https://olaplex.com/products/no-5-bond-maintenance-conditioner}{Olaplex
  No. 5}, \$28, that repairs bonds in the hair that are broken during
  the dyeing process.
\end{itemize}

```Lived-in' has been the look in highlights for a while,'' Ms. Bodt
said. ``We're used to seeing a little root with highlights. People
should leave them alone.''

Bleaching, the chemical process that lightens your hair, is difficult to
do well, even by professionals. And it's damaging. If you D.I.Y. it,
you'll probably end up breaking off your hair.

Highlighting is always a two-step process. First, bleach lightens the
hair (melanin is removed from the shaft). Then, the newly lightened hair
is toned, a color-depositing process that gives highlights an exact
shade --- say, a cool ash blond or a warm bronze-y brown. Instead of
trying to bleach your roots, you should mimic only the second part of
the process: toning.

``When we perceive our highlights as looking bad, it's usually not about
the roots as much as the color and texture,'' Ms Bodt said. ``The hair
looks brassy, dull or frizzy.''

Blond highlights almost universally get brassy (orange) over time. Ms.
Bodt suggests a purple
conditioner,\href{https://www.kerastase-usa.com/collections/blond-absolu/masque-ultra-violet-purple-hair-mask.html}{Kérastase
Blond Absolu Masque Ultra-Violet Purple Hair Mask}, \$62. ``It corrects
both the tone and deeply moisturizes the hair so it's shinier and
de-frizzed,'' she said.

For brunette and red highlights, she suggests
\href{https://www.evohair.com/hair/family-171/fabuloso.html}{Evo
Fabuloso Colour Boosting Treatment}, \$35, which comes in eight shades.
For example, there's a copper (warm red) and a purple red (cool).

``Again, if you're having trouble figuring out which treatment color is
right for your hair, reach out to your stylist for advice,'' Ms. Bodt
said.
