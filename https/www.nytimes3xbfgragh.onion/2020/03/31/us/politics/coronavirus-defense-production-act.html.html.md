# Wartime Production Law Has Been Used Routinely, but Not With Coronavirus

</div>

The Defense Production Act has been invoked hundreds of thousands of
times in the Trump years. But with the pandemic, the president sees it
as a “break the glass” last resort.

WASHINGTON — Chemicals used to construct military missiles. Materials
needed to build drones. Body armor for agents patrolling the southwest
border. Equipment for natural disaster response.

A Korean War-era law called the [Defense Production
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/coronavirus-defense-production-act.html)
has been used to place hundreds of thousands of orders by President
Trump and his administration to ensure the procurement of vital
equipment, according to reports submitted to Congress and interviews
with former government officials.

Yet as governors and members of Congress plead with the president to use
the law to force the production of ventilators and other medical
equipment to combat [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus), he
has for weeks treated it like a “break the glass” last resort, to be
invoked only when all else fails.

“You know, we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business,” Mr.
Trump said earlier this month. “Call a person over in Venezuela, ask
them how did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too
well.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Defense Production Act includes a range of authorities including
issuing loans to expand a vendor’s capacity, controlling the
distribution of a company’s products and the more commonly used power of
compelling companies to prioritize the government’s order over those of
other clients.

The law’s frequent use, especially by the military to give its contract
priority ratings to jump ahead of a vendor’s other clients, has prompted
those most familiar with it to question why the administration has been
so hesitant to tap it for a public health emergency that as of Tuesday
has killed more than 3,600 Americans and sickened 181,000.

“What’s more important? Building an aircraft carrier or a frigate using
priority ratings or saving a hundred thousand lives using priorities for
ventilators?” said Larry Hall, who retired in August as the director of
the Defense Production Act program division at the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. “If we used the president’s logic, most of our
economy is already nationalized. But it isn’t.”

On Friday, the president said he had finally pressed the law into action
to force General Motors to step up efforts to manufacture ventilators.
Then the federal authorities [raided the home of a
hoarder](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/brooklyn-man-arrested-assaulting-fbi-agents-and-making-false-statements-about-his)
in Brooklyn and his warehouse in New Jersey, invoking the Defense
Production Act to recoup tens of thousands of surgical masks.

Those actions could presage a wider use of the law now that Peter
Navarro, the White House trade adviser, has been appointed the
coordinator of Defense Production Act policy. The law gives the
government the power to subpoena firms and force companies to fulfill
the government’s contractual obligations before those of other clients.
Mr. Navarro, who has in the past criticized multinational companies like
General Motors and Walmart for cheating workers and sending jobs abroad,
appears to relish his new role marshaling American industry.

Mr. Trump has “discretely, just in a discrete way, done something about
ventilators. But there’s an overall appeal for him to do much, much
more,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday. “And this is nothing that
can be handled piecemeal. It has to be across the board.”

Invoking the Defense Production Act is hardly a rare occurrence. As
recently as last summer, the Department of Defense used it to [obtain
rare earth
metals](https://www.businessdefense.gov/News/News-Display/Article/1913110/defense-production-act-title-iii-presidential-determinations-to-strengthen-the/)
needed to build lasers, jet engines and armored vehicles.

The Defense Department estimates that it has used the law’s powers
300,000 times a year. The Department of Homeland Security — including
its subsidiary, FEMA — placed more than 1,000 so-called rated orders in
2018, often for hurricane and other disaster response and recovery
efforts, according to [a
report](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1582898704576-dc44bbe61cce3cf763cc8a6b92617188/2018_DPAC_Report_to_Congress.pdf)
submitted to Congress in 2019 by a committee of federal agencies formed
to plan for the effective use of the law.

The law, which was used frequently by previous administrations as well,
does not permit the federal government to assert complete control over a
company. The federal government can, however, use it to jump ahead of
other clients or issue loans so a company can buy all of the supplies it
needs to complete the government’s order by a specific date. A rarely
used authority of the law also allows the administration to control the
distribution of a company’s products and determine where such materials
go.

The Pentagon has long been aggressive in its use of the law, inserting
language from the wartime act into contracts to ensure delivery of
products by a specific date.

For the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Trump has elected to rely on the
volunteerism of the private sector to obtain additional personal
protective equipment, virus test kits and hospital equipment. He and his
advisers have argued that using the act has been unnecessary, given the
outpouring of support from large and small American companies — from
Ford to MyPillow — that are retooling their factories to make masks,
ventilators and gloves.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

People familiar with the president’s thinking say he has been skeptical
of using the law, seeing it as anti-American. But politics may have also
influenced Mr. Trump’s decision. The president has repeatedly tried to
deflect responsibility for the most significant crisis on American soil
in decades. Using the Defense Production Act would make it clear that
the government is in charge.

Many corporate executives have also lobbied the Trump administration
against using the act, saying they fear that more government
intervention and bureaucracy at a time of intense supply chain
disruptions could do more harm than good.

“The Defense Production Act isn’t a magic wand,” said Neil Bradley, the
executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.

“It can’t produce highly specialized manufacturing equipment overnight,”
he added. “It can’t convert a refrigerator factory into a ventilator
factory.”

The only company the administration has targeted with the law is General
Motors. But more actions could come: Mr. Navarro said he anticipated
frequently using the law to crack down on hoarding and price gouging,
and he added that the government might also use the act to ensure
resources are allocated to companies making protective equipment,
medicines and other medical supplies.

“We won’t hesitate to use this where we need to,” he said.

So far, the administration has not been so decisive.

Peter T. Gaynor, the FEMA administrator, said on CNN last week that the
administration would use the law to procure 60,000 coronavirus test
kits, only to back off hours later.

With General Motors, it is unclear what the act accomplished. The
company had already announced its intention to collaborate with the
medical device firm Ventec Life Systems to produce ventilators.

After the president threatened on Friday to invoke the Defense
Production Act against G.M., the automaker announced that the venture
would aim to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a
month.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

“We cannot afford to lose hours in this crisis, much less days, in the
production of ventilators,” Mr. Navarro said, adding that G.M. had been
working too slowly.

While Mr. Trump has generally refrained from using the law, the recently
passed economic stabilization package included $1 billion to take action
under the Defense Production Act and ramp up purchases of necessary
medical equipment, protective gear and medicines.

Mr. Trump issued an executive order granting the Health and Human
Services Department and other federal agency leaders the authority to
use the act to compel companies to produce medical equipment. But the
agencies have been ambiguous about their plans.

Lizzie Litzow, a spokeswoman for FEMA, said the agency was “in the
process of reviewing” the authorities of the production act.

The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond
to a request for comment.

The law permits federal agencies to skip an often bureaucratic
procurement process that can take months and force companies to come to
the table to sign a contract. Given the speed of the crisis, Joshua
Gotbaum, a former assistant secretary of defense for economic security,
said the government did not have the luxury of normal bidding and
contracting.

“Under the process of business as usual, they’re not even going to award
contracts until this month or April, then there will be a protest,” he
said. “Under the Defense Production Act, they could have sat down with
people in February” and finalized a contract.

Previous administrations have also been hesitant to invoke the law for
nonmilitary matters.

If the federal government used the law to make itself the priority,
other clients that had worked through the company’s procurement process
could have their orders delayed, though under the law, the vendor is
protected from lawsuits.

“My general experience is when you’re in the midst of a national crisis,
contractors generally speaking want to help,” said Ernest B. Abbott, who
was the general counsel of FEMA during the Clinton administration. “They
want to participate. They want to be able to keep their people employed
to build what’s needed for the nation.”

But Mr. Hall, who in the months after Mr. Trump took office assisted
Customs and Border Protection in using the law to secure body armor from
Armor Express, a Michigan-based company, said such caution had allowed
understanding of the law’s powers to atrophy.

“You have people on the civil side saying, ‘What is this thing? I might
get in trouble using it,’” Mr. Hall said.

While FEMA and Health and Human Services have discussed the law in
training situations, Mr. Hall said he often had to press his superiors
to prepare for its use in the event of a national emergency, such as a
pandemic.

“They had the authority to do this years ago,” Mr. Hall said. “They
could have filled up the medical stockpile with priority ratings if they
thought it was necessary.”
