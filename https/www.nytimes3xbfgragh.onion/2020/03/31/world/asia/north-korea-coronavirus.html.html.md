SEOUL, South Korea — Shin Dong-yun, ​a scientist from the North Korean
Institute of Virology, ​rushed to the northwestern border with China in
early February. There, he conducted 300 tests, skipping meals to assess
​a stream of people ​so that “the country is protected from the
invasion of the novel coronavirus.”

Stories like this, carried in the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun,
focus attention on one of the stranger oddities surrounding the
Covid-19​ pandemic​: How could North Korea claim to not have a single
coronavirus case while countries ​around the world stagger under the
exploding epidemic?

​North Korea has taken some of the most drastic actions against the
virus and did so sooner than most other nations. It sealed its borders
in late January, shutting off business with neighboring China, which
accounts for nine-tenths of its external trade. It clamped down on the
smugglers who keep its thriving [unofficial
markets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-economy-marketplace.html)
functioning. It quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. ​The
totalitarian state’s singular ability to control the movement of people​
also bolsters its disease-control efforts.

But decades of isolation and [international
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/18/world/asia/north-korea-economy-sanctions.html)have
ravaged​ North Korea’s public health system, raising concerns that ​it
lacks the medical supplies to fight an outbreak, which many fear has
already occurred.

“You can see immediately what’s going to happen if you get a surge of

​lecturer at Harvard Medical School who has worked alongside North
Korean doctors to help improve the country’s health system. “It will
overwhelm the system very quickly.”

“It’s a blatant lie when they say they have no cases,” said Seo
Jae-pyoung, secretary-general of the Seoul-based Association of North
Korean Defectors, who said he heard from his North Korean contact that a
family of three and an elderly couple died of the virus in the east
coast city of Chongjin in mid-March. “The last thing ​the North wants is
​a ​social chaos ​that may erupt ​when North Koreans realize that people
are ​dying of an epidemic with no cure​.”

The North’s leader, [Kim
Jong-un](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/world/asia/kim-jong-un-absence-north-korea.html),
is clearly aware of the threat the virus poses to his country​’s
decrepit health system. Around when Washington
[announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/14/world/asia/coronavirus-north-korea-sanctions.html)on
Feb. 13 that it would allow coronavirus-related ​humanitarian
shipments​, North Korea made a rare request for urgent help from
relief groups, including diagnostic kits, according to people familiar
with the matter.

​In recent weeks, the North’s official media outlets have ​carried
alarming reports detailing the coronavirus’s toll around the world: a
snowballing caseload in South Korea; bodies piling up in Italy;
“panicked citizens” hoarding “guns and ammunition”​ in the United
States.

By its own account, North Korea has quarantined 10,000 people.
International disease-control officials “have all been amazed” how North
Korea could have done it, the state-run Rodong newspaper said this
month.

But video clips shot in Hyesan, a town on the North’s central border
with China, in February and early March depict a far less flattering
picture of the North’s disease-control efforts.

A red wooden marker on a sidewalk covered with a dirty slush of ice said
“disinfection station,” according to a clip, which was ​smuggled to the
Rev. Kim Seung-eun, a human rights activist in South Korea, and viewed
by The New York Times. A lone official in a green plastic suit with a
tank of disinfecting liquid on his back stood idly. A silver van raced
through the town blaring the importance of wearing masks. In another
clip, a sign saying
“[Quarantined”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dY4hwjJnM) was
stuck on the door of what looked like a tenement house where Reverend
Kim said people with possible ​symptoms were kept.

Reverend Kim said ​one of his North Korean contacts ​had been unable to
return home for a month after visiting ​another town because the
government​ controlled internal movement. Such restrictions were needed
for disease control because of North Korea’s crowded public
transportation network.

The country’s information blackout and the inability of outside health
experts to get into the country leave the rest of the world largely in
the dark about how North Korea is coping with the
virus.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In the past, the country has hushed or played down epidemics, military
rebellions, man-made disasters or anything else that could ​undermine
the people’s faith in the government.

​But this time, the North’s unusually aggressive moves​, as well as its
unique ability to detain people, may have prevented a devastating
outbreak​, said Jung Gwang-il, a North Korean defector who leads No
Chain, a North Korean human rights activist group in Seoul​. As soon as
an outbreak was ​reported in China, North Korea rounded up ​all ​Chinese
visitors in its northeastern town of Rason ​and quarantine​d​ them ​on
an island for a month, Mr. Jung said.

“It’s safe to say that there are cases in North Korea, but I don’t think
the outbreak there is as large as the ones we have seen in South Korea,
Italy and the U.S.,” said Ahn Kyung-su, the head of the Seoul-based
Research Center of DPRK Health and Welfare, which monitors the North’s
health system. “North Koreans are trained to obey government orders in a
shipshape way during crises. But there is the risk of the virus running
out of control if it starts spreading among its malnourished people.”

Mr. Ahn said testing kits from China were available in big cities like
Pyongyang. Telltale evidence came when Kim Jong-un inspected a missile
test this month and military officers surrounding him [did not wear
masks](https://news.joins.com/article/23736429), which Mr. Ahn said
would not have happened had they not tested
negative.

But the coronavirus has put Mr. Kim between a rock and a hard place,
analysts say.

On March 17, ​he broke ground on a modern ​“Pyongyang General Hospital​”
to be completed by October. But such projects in the North rely​ on mass
mobilization​s​ of soldiers who ​sleep and eat together for months at a
stretch​, and raise the risk of mass infections during an epidemic.

​By this month, some help began reaching North Korea in its efforts to
confront the virus. Russia donated 1,500 test kits​​. China is also
believed to have sent diagnostic tools​. The United Nations has
​​​​begun waiving sanctions for aid groups like​ the Red Cross
to ship testing machines and diagnostic kits, as well as ventilators and
protective equipment. But the shipments have been slow.

​“Given the global shortage of supplies and items being available in
different locations, we are still in the process of procuring the
items,” said Ellie Van Baaren, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
