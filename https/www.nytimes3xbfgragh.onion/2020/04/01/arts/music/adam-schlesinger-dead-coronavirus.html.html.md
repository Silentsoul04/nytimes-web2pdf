*This obituary is part of a series about people who died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about
others*[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Adam Schlesinger, an acclaimed singer-songwriter for the bands Fountains
of Wayne and Ivy who had an award-winning second career writing songs
for film, theater and television, died on Wednesday in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y. He was 52.

The cause was complications of the coronavirus, his family said.

In Fountains of Wayne, which was started in 1995, Mr. Schlesinger and
Chris Collingwood perfected a novelistic form of hummable pop-rock in a
style derived from the Kinks and from 1970s groups like Big Star and the
Cars.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They chose northern New Jersey and boroughs outside Manhattan as
thematic territory, chronicling the lives of suburban mall shoppers,
Generation X slackers and down-market cover bands in songs like
“Hackensack” and “Red Dragon Tattoo.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Adored by critics, Fountains of Wayne — in which Mr. Schlesinger played
bass and Mr. Collingwood played guitar and sang lead vocals — became a
cult favorite but had modest record sales. Its most famous moment came
in 2003 with [“Stacy’s
Mom,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4) a winking novelty
track about a teenage boy infatuated with a friend’s mother. With a racy
video featuring the supermodel Rachel Hunter, the song made it to No. 21
on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.

Almost from the start of his career, Mr. Schlesinger found success in
other mediums. He wrote the Beatlesesque theme song to “That Thing You
Do\!,” a 1996 film directed by Tom Hanks about an also-ran 1960s rock
band; like the best Fountains of Wayne songs, [“That Thing You
Do\!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsi-eF6-uOY) had an instantly
catchy melody, a twisting chord progression and plenty of wordplay.

The movie brought Mr. Schlesinger nominations for an Academy Award and a
Golden Globe. He also won three Emmys, including one last year for [his
songs on the 2010s TV show “Crazy
Ex-Girlfriend,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/10/arts/television/crazy-ex-girlfriend-best-songs.html)
which often threaded campy, Broadway-style numbers into its plot.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a journeyman songwriter, he also [wrote
jingles](https://ew.com/article/2007/04/20/adam-schlesingers-musical-resume/)
for the Maryland State Lottery and Gillette.

Mr. Schlesinger received two Grammy nominations with Fountains of Wayne,
but his sole trophy was for his work with David Javerbaum — another
frequent collaborator — on Stephen Colbert’s “[A Colbert Christmas: The
Greatest Gift of
All\!](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/11/21/arts/television/21colb.html),”
which took best comedy album in 2010.

In the theater, Mr. Schlesinger worked with Mr. Javerbaum to write songs
for the 2008 Broadway musical “Cry-Baby,” based on John Waters’s 1990
film of the same title. That earned them a Tony nomination in 2008, and
Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Javerbaum worked together again in 2015 on the
play “An Act of God.”

Adam Lyons Schlesinger was born in Manhattan on Oct. 31, 1967, to Bobbi
and Stephen Schlesinger, and grew up in Montclair, N.J. He studied
philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he met Mr.
Collingwood.

After graduation, Mr. Schlesinger went to New York, where he founded the
group Ivy with Andy Chase and Dominique Durand, while Mr. Collingwood
moved to Boston. The two men later reconnected in New York and founded
Fountains of Wayne, writing most of the songs for their first album in a
West Village bar.

The band was signed by Atlantic Records and released its first album,
“Fountains of Wayne,” in 1996. With jagged guitars and sneering vocals
on songs like “Radiation Vibe,” the band fit the mold of post-grunge
alternative rock.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Collingwood stood out with witty and
sharp-eyed lyrics. Melody and location were central elements to their
music, a lesson they derived from Ray Davies of the Kinks, as Mr.
Schlesinger [told The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/07/09/movies/streets-new-york-with-fountains-wayne-urban-minstrels-with-roots-suburbia.html)
in an interview in 1999 for the band’s second album, “Utopia Parkway,”
named after a road in Queens.

“When we were teenagers, we liked listening to Kinks records because
we’d never been to England, and we got a sense of what it was like to
live there,” he said.

With minimal sales, though, the band was dropped from Atlantic. It
released its next album, “Welcome Interstate Managers,” in 2003 on the
small label S-Curve. That album found some success with “Stacy’s Mom”
and [reached No. 3](https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres03.php)
on The Village Voice’s critics’ poll for that year.

Fountains of Wayne released two more studio albums, “Traffic and
Weather” (2007) and “Sky Full of Holes” (2011), but had been on hiatus
since.

In recent years, Mr. Schlesinger had devoted himself to “Crazy
Ex-Girlfriend” and to the theater world. Two of his Emmy wins were for
songs he wrote with Mr. Javerbaum that were performed during Tony Awards
telecasts: “[It’s Not Just for Gays
Anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BHyfYiBt5o),” which won in
2012, and “If I Had Time,” in 2013.

More recently, Mr. Schlesinger had been collaborating with Sarah
Silverman on a stage adaptation of her memoir, “The Bedwetter,” which
was scheduled to begin performances Off Broadway this month at the
Atlantic Theater Company, but was delayed by the pandemic; he wrote the
music, and co-wrote the lyrics with Ms. Silverman. And he had begun
working with Rachel Bloom of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” to write songs for a
musical adaptation of the TV show “The Nanny,” which is in development
and aimed at Broadway.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Schlesinger is survived by his parents; two daughters, Sadie and
Claire Schlesinger; a sister, Laurie Rose; and his partner, Alexis
Morley. His marriage to Katherine Michel ended in divorce.

Mr. Schlesinger’s mother, a former public relations executive, has
sometimes been credited with suggesting the name Fountains of Wayne, but
in an interview on Wednesday, she refuted that.

Her son had been playing music and writing songs from the time he was a
child, she said, and from a young age had an eye on [a garish,
only-in-New Jersey lawn ornament shop in Wayne,
N.J](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/blog/end-fountains-of-wayne/).

“Every time we drove past it,” Ms. Schlesinger said, “Adam would say,
‘Fountains of Wayne. That would be a great band
name.’”
