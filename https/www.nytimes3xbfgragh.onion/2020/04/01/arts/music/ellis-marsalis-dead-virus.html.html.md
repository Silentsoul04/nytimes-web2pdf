*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Ellis Marsalis, a pianist and educator who became the guiding force
behind a late-20th-century resurgence in jazz while putting four
musician sons on a path to prominent careers, died on Wednesday in New
Orleans. He was 85.

The cause was complications of Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus, his son Branford said in a statement.

Mr. Marsalis spent decades as a working musician and teacher in New
Orleans before his eldest sons, Wynton and Branford, gained national
fame in the early 1980s embodying a fresh-faced revival of traditional
jazz.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Marsalis’s star rose along with theirs, and he, too, became a
household name.

“Ellis Marsalis was a legend,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans
[wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/mayorcantrell/status/1245523886810238979)
on Wednesday night. “He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk
about New Orleans jazz.”

That was not always so. Mr. Marsalis’s devotion to midcentury bebop and
its offshoots had long made him something of an outsider in a city with
an abiding loyalty to its early-jazz roots. Still, he secured the
respect of fellow musicians thanks to his unshakable talents as a
pianist and composer, and his supportive but rigorous manner as an
educator.

Once they reached the national stage, the Marsalises’ advocacy of
straight-ahead jazz made them renegades of a different sort. Wynton, a
trumpeter, boldly espoused his father’s devotion to heroes like Charlie
Parker and Thelonious Monk, and he [issued public
broadsides](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/07/31/arts/music-what-jazz-is-and-isn-t.html)
against the slicker jazz-rock fusion that had largely displaced acoustic
jazz during the late 1960s and ’70s.

Photogenic, erudite and fabulously talented, Mr. Marsalis’s children and
many other young jazz musicians he had taught — including Terence
Blanchard, Donald Harrison Jr., Harry Connick Jr. and Nicholas Payton —
became the leaders in a burgeoning traditionalist movement, loosely
referred to as the Young Lions.

In an acknowledgment of the patriarch’s influence as well as his own
talents, the National Endowment for the Arts in 2011 [named Mr. Marsalis
and his musician
sons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/01/13/arts/music/13nea.html)
Jazz Masters. It is considered the highest honor for an American jazz
musician, and until then it had been awarded only on an individual
basis.

By that point, the Marsalises were widely understood to be jazz’s royal
family. Wynton had become the founding artistic director of Jazz at
Lincoln Center in New York, the world’s pre-eminent nonprofit
organization devoted to jazz, and he won [the Pulitzer Prize for music
in 1997](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/wynton-marsalis). Branford was
a world-renowned saxophonist and bandleader with three Grammys to his
name. Mr. Marsalis’s two other musician sons, Delfeayo, a trombonist,
and Jason, a drummer and vibraphonist, were well established as
bandleaders.

In addition to those sons, Mr. Marsalis is survived by two nonmusician
sons, Mboya and Ellis III; a sister, Yvette; and 15 grandchildren.
Dolores Marsalis, his wife of 58 years, died in 2017.

In an [interview with The New York Times Magazine
in 2004](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/10/03/magazine/the-music-man.html),
Wynton Marsalis said that his father had always led by example —
expecting, rather than demanding, a high level of seriousness from his
students.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“My father never put pressure on me.” he said. “He’s too cool for that
kind of stuff.” Asked to define his father’s brand of cool, he
explained: **“**The house could fall down and everyone would be running
around, and he would still be sitting in his same chair.”

Ellis Louis Marsalis Jr. was born in New Orleans on Nov. 14, 1934. His
mother, Florence (Robertson) Marsalis, was a homemaker. [His
father](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/09/24/arts/music/ellis-marsalis-sr-96-jazzmens-patriarch-dies.html)
owned the Marsalis Motel in suburban New Orleans and was involved in the
civil rights movement. The motel’s guests included the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of New York, the
future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall and Ray Charles.

Mr. Marsalis started out as a saxophonist before switching to the piano
in high school. He earned his bachelor’s degree in music education from
Dillard University in New Orleans in 1955 and taught at Xavier
University Preparatory School until enlisting in the Marine Corps in the
late 1950s. There he became a member of the Corps Four, a quartet of
Marines that performed jazz on television and radio to aid in
recruitment.

After leaving the Marines he taught briefly in Breaux Bridge, La., then
returned to New Orleans with Dolores and their four children to work at
his father’s motel while playing shows at
night.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Mr. Marsalis performed and recorded throughout the 1960s and ’70s with a
variety of modern and progressive jazz musicians, including the drummer
Ed Blackwell and the eminent horn-playing brothers Cannonball and Nat
Adderley.

He later earned a master’s degree in music education from Loyola
University in New Orleans and led the jazz studies program at the New
Orleans Center for Creative Arts for high school students. It was there
that he mentored such future stars as Mr. Blanchard and Mr. Connick as
well as his own children.

[Reviewing a 1979
performance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1979/07/07/archives/jazz-piano-ellis-marsalis-plays-at-carnegie-tavern.html?searchResultPosition=3)
by Mr. Marsalis at the Carnegie Tavern in New York just before his
family burst onto the national stage, John S. Wilson of The New York
Times introduced him to his readers. “Unlike the widely accepted image
of jazz musicians from New Orleans, Mr. Marsalis is not a
traditionalist,” Mr. Wilson wrote, describing him as “an eclectic
performer with a light and graceful touch” and an “exploratory turn of
mind.”

Four years later, Mr. Marsalis made another New York appearance, at a
next-door locale with a similar name: Carnegie Hall. There he gave a
solo concert, oscillating between original compositions and jazz
standards.

“Mr. Marsalis’s interpretations were impressive in their economy and
steadiness,” [the Times critic Stephen Holden
wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1983/06/29/arts/ellis-marsalis-s-solo-piano.html).
“Sticking mainly to the middle register of the keyboard, the pianist
offered richly harmonized arrangements in which fancy keyboard work was
kept to a minimum and studious melodic invention, rather than pronounced
bass patterns, determined the structures and tempos.”

Before Wynton and then Branford found acclaim, Mr. Marsalis had recorded
only sporadically. But once they all became nationally known, that
changed. In the 1990s, after the Young Lions boom he had helped unleash
led major labels to reinvest in straight-ahead jazz, Mr. Marsalis
released a series of albums for Blue Note and then Columbia.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2008, Mr. Marsalis was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of
Fame.

He had held a weekly gig for decades at Snug Harbor, one of New
Orleans’s premier jazz clubs, before giving it up in December.

Always hungry for knowledge, Mr. Marsalis saw himself as a perpetual
student. In an [interview with Offbeat
magazine](http://www.offbeat.com/articles/ellis-marsalis-interview/) in
1989, just after joining the faculty at the University of New Orleans,
he said: “I’d like to get involved in a course on physics to get a good
understanding of the physical aspects of the universe. There are
literature courses I’d like to take. I might one day. I don’t buy the
idea that colleges are just for young people.”
