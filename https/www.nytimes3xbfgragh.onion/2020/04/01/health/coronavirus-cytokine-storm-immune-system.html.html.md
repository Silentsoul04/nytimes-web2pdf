# The Coronavirus Patients Betrayed by Their Own Immune Systems

A “cytokine storm” becomes an all-too-frequent phenomenon, particularly
among the young. But treatments are being tested.

The 42-year-old man arrived at a hospital in Paris on March 17 with a
fever, cough and the “ground glass opacities” in both lungs that are a
trademark of infection with the new coronavirus.

Two days later, his condition suddenly worsened and his oxygen levels
dropped. His body, doctors suspected, was in the grip of a cytokine
storm, a dangerous overreaction of the immune system. The phenomenon has
become all too common in the coronavirus pandemic, but it is also
pointing to potentially helpful drug treatments.

When the body first encounters a virus or a bacterium, the immune system
ramps up and begins to fight the invader. The foot soldiers in this
fight are molecules called cytokines that set off a cascade of signals
to cells to marshal a response. Usually, the stronger this immune
response, the stronger the chance of vanquishing the infection, which is
partly why children and younger people are [less vulnerable over
all](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/health/coronavirus-children.html)
to coronavirus. And once the enemy is defeated, the immune system is
hard-wired to shut itself off.

“For most people and most infections, that’s what happens,” said Dr.
Randy Cron, an expert on cytokine storms at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in some cases — as much as 15 percent of people battling any serious
infection, according to Dr. Cron’s team — the immune system keeps raging
long after the virus is no longer a threat. It continues to release
cytokines that keep the body on an exhausting full alert. In their
misguided bid to keep the body safe, these cytokines attack multiple
organs including the lungs and liver, and may eventually lead to death.

In these people, it’s their body’s response, rather than the virus, that
ultimately causes harm.

Cytokine storms can overtake people of any age, but some scientists
believe that they may explain why healthy young people died during the
1918 pandemic and more recently during the SARS, MERS and H1N1
epidemics. They are also a complication of various autoimmune diseases
like lupus and Still’s disease, a form of arthritis. And they may offer
clues as to why otherwise healthy young people with coronavirus
infection are succumbing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, a
common consequence of a cytokine storm.

Reports from China and Italy have described young patients with clinical
outcomes that seem consistent with this phenomenon. It’s very likely
that some of these patients developed a cytokine storm, Dr. Cron
said.

In the case of the 42-year-old patient, the suspected cytokine storm led
his doctors to eventually try tocilizumab, a drug they have sometimes
used to soothe an immune system in distress.

After just two doses of the drug, spaced eight hours apart, the
patient’s fever rapidly disappeared, his oxygen levels rose and a
chest scan showed his lungs clearing. The case report, described in an
upcoming paper in Annals of Oncology, joins dozens of accounts from
Italy and China, all indicating that tocilizumab might be an effective
antidote to the coronavirus in some people.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On March 5, China approved the drug to treat serious cases of Covid-19,
the disease caused by the coronavirus, and authorized clinical trials.
On March 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to
the pharmaceutical company Roche to test the drug in hundreds of people
with coronavirus infection.

Tocilizumab is approved to quieten the chatter of immune molecules in
rheumatoid arthritis and in some types of cancer. It mutes the activity
of a specific cytokine called interleukin-6 that is associated with an
over-exuberant immune response.

“That’s the rationale for using the drug,” said Dr. Laurence Albiges,
who cared for the patient at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center in Paris.

Even as researchers look for treatments, they are trying to learn more
about why some people’s immune systems go into this dangerous overdrive.
Genetic factors explain the risk, at least in some kinds of cytokine
storms.

There are many variations on the phenomenon, and they go by many names:
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cytokine release syndrome,
macrophage activation syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Broadly speaking, they are all marked by an unbridled surge in immune
molecules, and may all result in the fatal shutdown of multiple organs.

But many doctors are unfamiliar with this niche concept or how to treat
it, experts said.

“Everyone’s talking about cytokine storm as if it were a well-recognized
phenomenon, but you could have asked medics two weeks ago and they
wouldn’t have heard of it,” said Dr. Jessica Manson, an immunologist at
University College London Hospital.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A patient battling a cytokine storm may have an abnormally fast heart
rate, fever and a drop in blood pressure. Apart from a surge in
interleukin-6, the body may also show high swirling levels of molecules
called interleukin-1, interferon-gamma, C-reactive protein and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha.

This storm, if it develops, becomes obvious a few days into the
infection. But the sooner doctors catch on to it and treat it, the more
likely the patient is to survive. Too late, and the storm may be beyond
control, or may already have caused too much
damage.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

There is a relatively simple, rapid and easily available test that can
detect whether a patient’s body has been taken over by a cytokine storm.
It looks for high levels of a protein called ferritin.

But if the test does suggest a cytokine storm is underway, what then?

The seemingly obvious solution is to quell the storm, Dr. Cron said: “If
it’s the body’s response to the infection that’s killing you, you need
to treat that.”

The reality is trickier, especially given the lack of reliable data for
Covid-19. But noting that drugs like tocilizumab are taken regularly by
people with arthritis, Dr. Cron said the benefit would probably outweigh
potential harm if someone is facing death.

“We need evidence-based data, but in a pandemic, where we’re flying by
the seat of our pants, we always have to treat the patient in front of
us,” he said.

Other drugs might also be useful against cytokine storms. For example, a
drug called anakinra mutes interleukin-1, another of the wayward
proteins. Clinical trials of anakinra for Covid-19 are also underway. A
report published this week suggested that
[hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-malaria.html),
a much-spotlighted malaria drug that also calms an overactive immune
response, might also be effective as a treatment for those who are
mildly ill from coronavirus.

Doctors could also turn to corticosteroids, which broadly turn down the
entire immune response. That poses its own danger, by exposing the
patient to other opportunistic infections, especially in a hospital.
“It’s about getting the balance right between suppression of the
over-exuberant immune response and still allowing the immune response to
fight the virus,” Dr. Manson said.

A group of experts convened two weeks ago to discuss the best ways to
collect more data and to treat patients who appear to have cytokine
storm. It’s already clear that the complexities of the immune system and
the course of coronavirus mean there is no single best treatment.

At the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, doctors treated another coronavirus
patient with tocilizumab. That individual did not show any improvement
with the drug.

“The response to the pathogen, the virus, is totally different in
different individuals,” said Dr. Fabrice André, an oncologist at the
center. “The trials will determine in which patients it works.”
