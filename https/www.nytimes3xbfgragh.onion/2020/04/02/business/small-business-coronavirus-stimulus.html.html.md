# Banks Warn of ‘Overwhelming’ Demand and Messy Start for Small Business Loans

The government has promised to lend $349 billion to small businesses

\[[*Read our Coronavirus Relief Small Business
F.A.Q.*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html)\]

Small business owners, desperate for help amid the economic meltdown
wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, are eagerly awaiting the start of a
$349 billion government relief program.

But just one day before the program’s launch on Friday, the banks and
other lenders that the government is relying on to fund loans and vet
applicants were still waiting for much of the information they need to
participate. They are also nervous about how they — and the government —
will handle what is expected to be a huge crush of demand.

“The response is overwhelming — it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen in
my career,” said Craig Street, the chief lending officer of United
Midwest Savings Bank, a community bank in Columbus, Ohio. “We’re talking
about attempting to do 10 times our normal monthly loan volume, and
maybe more than that.”

The so-called [paycheck protection
program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/business/shake-shack-returning-loan-ppp-coronavirus.html),
part of the $2 trillion stimulus package enacted last week, offers
companies and nonprofits with up to 500 workers a low-interest loan to
cover up to two months of payroll and other expenses. Most — and in some
cases, all — of the loan will be forgiven if the borrower retains its
workers and doesn’t cut their wages. (The government will repay lenders
for the forgiven portions of the loans.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That’s an appealing deal for many companies that would otherwise be
leery of taking on debt in the midst of a global crisis. Jason
Dolmetsch, the president of MSK Engineering & Design in Bennington, Vt.,
said he was eager to apply. His engineering firm and its affiliated
architectural company are trying to hold on to their 23 workers despite
a rash of canceled and postponed projects.

When he called his business’s banker on Monday, he was told to be
patient and wait. The bank had no information yet about how the program
would work.

Late Tuesday, the Treasury Department and the Small Business
Administration released [an overview for
borrowers](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/paycheck-protection-program-ppp)
and a sample loan application. The S.B.A., which is backing the loans,
has waived most of its usual requirements — the loans do not require
collateral or detailed financial records — and is encouraging lenders to
take applications digitally and make quick decisions.

“This will be up and running tomorrow,” Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin said on Thursday at a White House briefing. He added that loan
checks could be disbursed “the same day” that borrowers applied.

But on Thursday evening, lenders were still waiting for technical
information about how to underwrite the loans — which will be break
even, at best, for most lenders — and collect reimbursement on those
that qualify for forgiveness. A trade group, the National Association of
Government Guaranteed Lenders, had to postpone a training call for 1,500
lenders on Thursday because it did not have the needed information from
the S.B.A.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’ve asked for the information twice today, and I still have nothing,”
Tony Wilkinson, the group’s chief executive, said on Wednesday. “I worry
that they’re asking lenders to make loans without the information they
need to understand the rules of
engagement.”

Bank lobbyist groups have warned the Treasury Department that the
program as designed will not be workable, expressing alarm about their
own legal liability as they try to rush money to borrowers and keep tabs
on potential fraud. The Independent Community Bankers of America sent a
letter to Mr. Mnuchin on Wednesday complaining that guidelines calling
for low-interest loans could mean “unacceptable losses” for lenders.

S.B.A. representatives did not respond to questions about when guidance
for lenders would be available.

Although the government has scrambled to pull aid together quickly, the
program’s slow rollout has frustrated business owners facing a daily
fight to salvage their companies. Paul Caragiulo is an owner of a group
of restaurants in Sarasota, Fla., that employ around 150 people. He is
loath to lay off anyone — even though his restaurants’ sales have
cratered — but he’s also hesitant about borrowing what could be millions
of dollars from a program whose details are being worked out on the fly.

The information sheets posted by the Treasury Department and the S.B.A.
have not reassured him. “Those are bullet points, not term sheets,” he
said. “We’re not used to having debt, and we don’t look at that
lightly.”

The Trump administration has said it wants the paycheck protection loans
to be easy to obtain; [a sample
application](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/Borrower%20Paycheck%20Protection%20Program%20Application_0.pdf)
posted on Tuesday is a four-page form that can be completed in less than
10 minutes. But the fine print contains a line that gave Mr. Caragiulo
pause: Borrowers must promise to buy only American-made equipment and
products “to the extent feasible.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Caragiulo, who uses Italian pizza ovens, said the requirement seemed
like an absurd bureaucratic tripwire. When asked about it, an S.B.A.
spokeswoman pointed to [a 1992
law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/4111/text)
that requires the agency to “encourage” business owners receiving
financial help to buy American goods. She did not respond to questions
about how — or if — that will be enforced.

Other federal small business aid efforts have been generous but chaotic.
A program offering [low-interest disaster
loans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html)
funded directly by the government has already had more than 100,000
applicants, according to one person familiar with its operations.

The S.B.A. started taking applications weeks ago, but last Friday’s
stimulus bill added a new sweetener: Applicants, including those who are
rejected for loans, are eligible for up to $10,000 in cash grants. (The
funds are described on the S.B.A. website as a “loan advance,” but an
agency spokeswoman confirmed that it does not have to be repaid.)

Abninder Mundra, who owns a franchise of the UPS Store in Portola
Valley, Calif., applied for a disaster loan on March 20 and was approved
four days later for $210,000. Then the stimulus bill introduced the
grants. Mr. Mundra said an S.B.A. representative had told him to fill
out a second loan application if he wanted the grant funds. He was still
waiting for both his disaster loan check and a response to the grant
application.

Mr. Mundra said he could afford to wait a few weeks and was grateful for
the aid. He also plans to seek a paycheck protection loan as soon as his
bank starts taking applications. He had to cut his three employees’
hours to offset a drop in foot traffic, and hopes the loan will help
restore them.

“I think the government really understood that small businesses are the
backbone of the economy,” he said. “If we stop employing people, they
won’t have money to pay their bills.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But with job losses [already setting
records](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html)
and certain to worsen, lenders fear that the $349 billion Congress
allocated for the paycheck program will quickly run out. Senior
officials from the Treasury and S.B.A. told reporters on Tuesday that
they were prepared to ask Congress for more money if needed.

Jim Donnelly, the chief commercial officer of Bangor Savings Bank in
Maine, said his small staff was working around the clock to accommodate
the pent-up demand. In a typical year, his bank handles hundreds of
business loans. He expects to process thousands in the coming months.

And even though his bank was still waiting for critical technical
information, it planned to start taking loan applications on Friday.

“We have local businesses like restaurants that have shut down and are
looking at these loans as a way to reopen their doors,” he said.

Many of the nation’s largest banks said they planned to offer the loans,
though some will restrict which applicants they will work with.

JPMorgan Chase, for example, said [it would make the loans
available](https://recovery.chase.com/cares) to customers with Chase
business checking accounts as of Feb. 15. Bank of America and Citi both
said they planned to participate but did not yet have details.

The Treasury has encouraged non-bank lenders to also offer the loans,
but some that want to do so say the process has been maddening. Kabbage,
one of the biggest online lenders, said the system for becoming an
approved lender was opaque.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Street, at United Midwest Savings Bank, was also desperate for more
information, including details about how thoroughly banks are expected
to scrutinize potential borrowers. Any choice involves trade-offs: Quick
approvals and cash disbursements raise the risk of mistakes and borrower
fraud, but rigorous underwriting takes time that desperate business
owners and overtaxed bankers don’t have to spare.

Mr. Street hopes the S.B.A. and the banking industry’s regulators will
give lenders leeway to err on the side of speed.

“We’re trying to set things up so that we can crank these things out,”
he said. “We had calls starting Monday morning from people who wanted to
borrow right away. It was hard telling people they had to wait. Nobody
can afford to wait.”
