### Hosted by Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham. Produced by Hans Buetow and Sydney Harper.

#### We examine when culture from our past — like the 20-year-old comedy “High Fidelity,” — gets reborn … as “High Fidelity.”

Thursday, April 2nd, 2020

</div>

  - jenna wortham  
    We’re going to do 1, 2, 3, record. No, baby, we’re not going to clap
    this time. We’re going to sync up our recordings like they do in the
    movies, like boop, you know what I mean? Like, we’re going to try to
    synchronize our tapings.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh-huh. Are we — am I hitting record on 3 or record?

  - jenna wortham  
    On record.

  - wesley morris  
    OK.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK, ready? 1, 2, 3, record.

  - wesley morris  
    I did it\!

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    (LAUGHS)

  - wesley morris  
    I did it.

  - jenna wortham  
    We’re just learning so much right now. I’m Jenna Wortham.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m Wesley Morris.
    
    We’re two culture writers at The New York Times.

  - jenna wortham  
    This is “Still Processing.”
    
    Wesley, I want to read something to you just for a moment. Can I?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, sure, hit me. Hit me.

  - jenna wortham  
    Ooh, OK. Here we go. “Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience
    of those who’ve been marginalized for all of us to remember the
    importance of community and mutual aid,” period. That’s a tweet.
    That’s a tweet. Who do you think that tweet is by?

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, this is the part where, like, you really blow my mind right
    now. But I’m going to just, like, hope against hope that it’s our
    current president, Donald J. Trump.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s his predecessor, Barack Hussein Obama, out here in these
    Twitter streets, offering comfort, things that are more hearty and
    nourishing than my bone broth — more or less. My bone broth is
    pretty good. But really out here dishing up delicious servings of
    shouting-out frontline workers and grocery store clerks. I know
    you’ve seen some of these.

  - wesley morris  
    I’ve seen some of them, and they are inspiring. I mean, I saw that
    he retweeted a post by a disabled activist.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    And I think it’s @cripchick.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s the one.

  - wesley morris  
    And he had a message basically saying, don’t forget, in these times,
    who else matters. I mean, it’s just — can you imagine how different
    things would be if this is what was happening during these press
    briefings every day, if there was, like — like, we’ve dealt with all
    the important information about handwashing, and protective gear,
    and all the other crisis-oriented things. But I want to take a
    moment now to just talk about the people, talk about the people who
    are out there on the frontlines suffering, and making this work, and
    people we’re not remembering right now. That’s important too. I
    think it’s partially a little bit a civics lesson, in that you are
    learning a little bit what else a leader can do. But there are other
    people actually giving actual civics lessons in some way. There are
    people out there telling you to fill out your census form. Don’t
    forget, amidst all this turmoil and chaos, y’all got a census form
    to fill out. And that’s important too.

  - jenna wortham  
    And you know who the number-one advocate in New York is for taking
    the 2020 census, Mr. Wesley Morris?

  - wesley morris  
    Besides the mayor and the governor?

  - jenna wortham  
    No, Cardi B.

  - archived recording (cardi b)  
    New York City, 2020 is a huge opportunity to make our voice heard.
    This year, we have the power to decide our city’s future, not just
    for the next four years, but for the next 10, by getting counted in
    the census. The census is about power, money —

jenna wortham

She is out here working for nyc.gov, but also hustling on her social
media platforms, reminding people, y’all want to be counted. You need to
be on record as existing so that we can get the social services we need.
I was, like, fanning myself watching this public service announcement.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS) Thank God for Cardi B.

jenna wortham

I also find her to be one of these unexpected and deeply-important,
impromptu, ad-hoc leaders in this moment right now. There’s a moment in
one of her Instagrams when she talks about — she’s wearing a mask, her
nails are fully done, which I love — and she’s talking about how
disgraceful it is, frankly, that celebrities can get tested and the
average person can’t get tested.

  - archived recording (cardi b)  
    And, on top of that, a lot of celebrities, y’all have the luxury to
    pay $34,000 or whatever the \[EXPLETIVE\] it costs to get tested and
    get treated. A lot of these people, they don’t \[EXPLETIVE\] have
    that money.

jenna wortham

And her voice cracks when she says money. She says, people don’t have
money. And I felt that. And I know she felt it. Like, she remembers what
it’s like not to have a lot. And it’s important for celebrities to not
be so out there in woo woo Island. I mean, our colleague Amanda Hess had
a great piece about that in The Times this week about how out of touch
they seem. And I love that Cardi B manages to be in touch as she talks
about this crisis.

wesley morris

And then, in the middle of all this, Oprah Winfrey comes back.

jenna wortham

I know. Truly, with a talk show, specifically about Covid-19 though.

\[laughter\]

jenna wortham

She was like, the people need me.

  - archived recording (oprah winfrey)  
    This is a moment that we have an opportunity, in the midst of all of
    our fears and disruption, to really rise. And I know —

wesley morris

The void is pretty big right now. And I am heartened to see a person
like Oprah Winfrey step into it with her special, “Oprah Talks
Covid-19,” where she just is trying to get people through this moment.
Talking to people on the front lines, hearing stories about people doing
their jobs, listening to people talk about this experience, and trying
to bring them some sort of comfort.

jenna wortham

And also demystify it for most Americans, right? Because the reason
we’re looking to these alternative leaders is because there hasn’t
been a lot of clear messaging around what’s happening right now for the
average person. So Oprah, we’re projecting a little, but Oprah
presumably feels the need to step in and be a little bit of an authority
because we really don’t feel like we have any right now.

wesley morris

Right, right, right.

jenna wortham

Meanwhile, did you see what Britney Spears posted?

wesley morris

No, I did not.

jenna wortham

O-M-G. I don’t know who sent this to her, and I don’t know how she found
out about it, but it was incredible. So a few days ago, in the midst of
everybody spiraling out on social media, and trying to figure out how to
use this time, and then figure out how to be productive, but then also
how to rest, and how to readjust their lives, homegirl Britney Spears
posts this real socialist-sounding manifesto that’s making the rounds
through all of queer and P.O.C. Instagram. And it’s a manifesto written
by a queer Chinese artist who lives in Brooklyn named Mimi Zhu, and I’m
just going to read a little bit of it. I’m going to read all of it,
actually. Because it’s incredible on its own, but then just think about
the fact that Britney Spears posts this. Here goes. “During this time of
isolation, we need connection now more than ever.” True. “Call your
loved ones. Write virtual love letters. Technologies like virtual
communication, streaming and broadcasting are part of our community
collaboration. We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the
waves of the web. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike.
We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay.
Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.”

wesley morris

I’m sorry. Did A.O.C. write that? (LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

Well, it’s part of this whole trend of people writing platitudes, and
using cool graphic designs, and posting them around the web, which
obviously is right up my alley. I don’t know why I’m speaking about it
like it annoys me. It’s just — it’s part of a bigger wave of people
doing things in the vein of artists like Jenny Holzer. And it’s, like,
coming up with the sayings we need for this time. Like, “we’re going to
save ourselves,” “we all we got.” Like, it’s very much in that mindset,
and I’m here for it. But there is another layer to it, because you think
about Britney Spears, who is always under quarantine. Like, she’s been
living this life. (LAUGHS) So I don’t know, I feel like she’s letting us
know, like, I’ve figured out how to make it work under my
conservatorship. Like, y’all can figure it out too.

\[laughter\]

jenna wortham

I’m like, how do we reach out and save Britney? But it also was just
incredible, though, because I think it’s an indicator that everyone’s
being impacted, everyone’s being affected. And there is a desire to let
one’s digital neighbor know, you’re not in it alone. I’m right here
beside you. And that’s a really incredible thing.

\[music\]

wesley morris

All right, so we’re going to take a break. And when we come back, we’re
going to talk about a woman who owns a record shop in New York City, in
2020.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

Hulu’s “High Fidelity.” We’ll be right back.

\[music\]

jenna wortham

Wesley, you know where I stand on lots of issues. But on the issue of
reboots, I don’t know if we’ve talked about it a ton, in terms of how I
feel about them. Generally I think they’re terrible.

wesley morris

Oh.

jenna wortham

They’re always not-great versions of the original thing. To me, it’s
like eating jerk seitan —

wesley morris

Ooh.

jenna wortham

— or Dippin’ Dots.

wesley morris

Oh.

jenna wortham

Two things I like, by the way. But I like them because I’m well aware
that they are not the thing they are sort of a proxy for. That’s not
really jerk chicken, and it’s not ice cream, but they both still taste
good to me.

wesley morris

Well, you are speaking my language right now, though. Because we’re
living in a moment of high — what I can only call “high reboot.”

jenna wortham

Oh yeah.

wesley morris

Like peak, maximal reboot. I am not a fan of this. I am an originalist
when it comes to popular culture. I just want you to give me the thing
that you came up with that is not based on some studio’s, or in some
cases — I’m not going to name names — your parents’ I.P.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

I don’t get mad at the artist level, necessarily. I’m mad at the
studios.

jenna wortham

Yes, yes.

wesley morris

You can hire anybody to think any thought, and write something new and
original, but you guys have created this system where you’ve
disincentived artists from thinking originally. They can easily see what
your library consists of — your back issues, your archives — and be
like, “You know what? I see that, Universal, you’ve got this incredible
old monster archive. I’m just going to take an old monster thing that
you have” — or if I’m an executive, “You know, we’ve got all these old
monsters. We should just redo them.” So in the last few years, we’ve
gotten everything from “Jumanji,” to “Westworld,” “Lost in Space,”
“Boomerang,” “Party of Five,” “Dumbo,” “Men in Black.” “What Women
Want” becomes “What Men Want,” with Taraji P. Henson. The live-action
“Lion King,” live-action “Aladdin.” “Charlie’s Angels,” which nobody
wanted\!

jenna wortham

I know.

wesley morris

And I just feel like, when you’re at the “Charlie’s Angels” point, you
have kind of hit bottom.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

And this isn’t to say that some of these reboots, remakes, sequels,
rethinks, whatever you want to call them don’t have anything to say.
Frequently what happens now is that you’re politically correcting for an
old problem, or you’re using a movie about four men to make a point
about its maleness by casting four women. I’m looking at you, that
needless “Ghostbusters” remake with all those great women. It was
another example of, why not get those four women together to do
something other than a “Ghostbusters” remake?

jenna wortham

Yes. And that’s why, honestly, Wesley, when you who told me I should
watch “High Fidelity,” I was like, no. I don’t need — like, on top of
everything else I’m going through, I don’t need a crappy reboot. But it
turned out, like many things you tell me to do that I don’t want to do,
you were right. I really enjoyed the new “High Fidelity.” I was
surprised. I had so much built up like — I sat down in a huff with my
arms crossed, and was like, we’ll see how this goes. And then I was just
like a melted popsicle on the floor by the end of the first episode.

wesley morris

So the show and the movie have a lot of things in common. They’re both
about a record store owner named Rob. The 2000 movie starred John
Cusack. The 2020 television show stars Zoë Kravitz. In the movie, it was
directed by Stephen Frears, who made “Dangerous Liaisons.” And he would
eventually go on to make “The Queen” with Helen Mirren. “High Fidelity”
is based on a Nick Hornby book. And when it came out, it was a decent
hit. Basically the two properties are about a recently dumped person in
pursuit of the person who dumped them, or is trying to figure out how to
deal with having been dumped.

\[zipper zips\]

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    OK, that’s everything, I think.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    I mean, you don’t have to go this second.

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    I know, but I think it’s best that I do, so —

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Just stay for tonight.

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    No.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    OK, just stay for a drink then.

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    No, I don’t think a drink’s going to do it, Rob.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Then how about — how about two drinks?

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    Jesus Christ, can we just make this just a little bit easy, please?

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Oh, I’m sorry, is this inconvenient for you?

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    You know what, I’m just going to go, all right?

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Wait, Mac.

\[door closes\]

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Mac.

wesley morris

And it’s about both these characters taking us on a journey, a narrated
journey through their past loves. And both Robs have new relationships.

jenna wortham

That’s a really nice way to put that they are rebounding with very sweet
innocence. But go on.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

But go on.

wesley morris

In the movie, it’s played by Lisa Bonet, who happens to be Zoë Kravitz’s
mother. And on the TV show, it’s Jake Lacy, who is now American popular
culture’s “perfect boyfriend” figure.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

They both own a record store called Championship Vinyl that has two
other employees. One is a wacky, loudmouth, obnoxious person, with a lot
of opinions, and the other person is a little more quiet and thoughtful
about what he likes. In the movie, the loud person was played by Jack
Black, and on the TV show, it’s played by Da’Vine Joy Randolph. I think
the thing that makes the show great, in addition to some good writing,
is Zoë Kravitz. The show does not work if she doesn’t work. And she
works, so the show works.

jenna wortham

Mm-hm, mm-hm.

wesley morris

I mean, this is a part that I have been waiting for her to get for a
long time, where she’s a star on this show. She’s a star\!

jenna wortham

She’s so natural, so sweet —

wesley morris

She’s so natural.

jenna wortham

— so charismatic.

wesley morris

What I love about Rob in this show is that she is enough of a character
that is brought to life by writing, but is also animated by this
performance. And there are all of these wonderful things that Zoë
Kravitz gets to do in terms of owning space as a performer.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm. Who know Zoë Kravitz, onscreen would just be so effortlessly
chill, and funny, and self-possessed, and witty, and charismatic? I’m
thinking in particular about that scene in the very first episode, after
she and Clyde have their drunken hookup.

\[fast rock music\]

jenna wortham

So there is Zoë Kravitz, sitting at her junky dining room table.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you don’t get back on the
    \[EXPLETIVE\] horse.

jenna wortham

Clutter everywhere.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Not that I needed another reminder. I have all the reminders that I
    need.

jenna wortham

And she’s just slopping cereal into the bowl. There’s Fruity Pebbles —
or whatever she’s eating — everywhere. She’s slopping the milk around
too, and then just shoveling spoonfuls into her mouth while she’s
explicating this hookup. And she’s so tangible. She’s really projecting
this self-effacing disregard that I just feel like is hard for someone
as well-known and as, frankly, pretty as Zoë Kravitz to do. She’s just
shed, basically, all of her cool persona, and really is putting herself
out there in this incredibly vulnerable way. And I was sold. I was here
for it.

wesley morris

I would also say, this Rob is different from John Cusack’s Rob in the
movie. In the movie, Rob is — he’s cranky, he’s cantankerous, he is
sexist a little bit, maybe, or just a little bitter.

jenna wortham

Don’t underqualify that. He is a lot of all those things, not a little
of those things.

wesley morris

Fair. This is another of John Cusack’s tortured lovers people. And in
this movie, I’m thinking about — you know, Lloyd Dobler, obviously —
there was a kind of romance for something that was sort of broken in
him, and brooding, but kind of sweetly optimistic at the same time. He
was vulnerable. He’s much harder in “High Fidelity.” And his bitterness
is this armor that keeps him from being able to maybe successfully be in
a relationship.

\[music - elton john, crocodile rock\]

  - archived recording (john cusack)  
    She was nice — nice manners, nice grades, nice-looking. She was so
    nice, in fact, that she wouldn’t let me put my hand underneath or
    even on top of her bra.

\[music - joan jett, crimson and clover\]

  - archived recording (john cusack)  
    Attack and defense, invasion and repulsion. It was as if breasts
    were little pieces of property that had been unlawfully annexed by
    the opposite sex. They were rightfully ours, and we wanted them
    back. Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breast that I
    would try to touch her between her legs. It was like trying to
    borrow a dollar, getting turned down, and asking for 50 grand
    instead.
    
    I wasn’t interested in Patty’s nice qualities, just breasts, and
    therefore she was no good to me.

jenna wortham

Yo, I rewatched the original “High Fidelity” in the same period of time
that I decide to watch “28 Days Later.” Now, I would not advise that
anyone watch “28 Days Later” while you’re in the midst of thinking about
contracting a virus, thinking about trying to protect yourself from some
pandemic. But I will tell you this, Wesley Morris, I had an easier time
finishing “28 Days Later” —

wesley morris

Oh no.

jenna wortham

— than I did “High Fidelity.”

wesley morris

Oh, Jenna, come on.

jenna wortham

I’m being 100 percent serious. I could not take, you know, being
submerged in this man’s just unhappiness, and his defensiveness, and his
insistence that things like appearance, and aesthetic, and all the
accoutrements of life don’t matter at all. The only thing that matters
is having a very well-curated record shelf and a very well-curated
bookshelf.

  - archived recording (john cusack)  
    A while back, Dick Barry and I agreed that what really matters is
    what you like, not what you are like. Books, records, films, these
    things matter. Call me shallow, it’s the \[EXPLETIVE\] truth.

wesley morris

What the argument of the movie ultimately is is that everybody can have
opinions, and that some people’s opinions are better than other people’s
opinions, essentially.

jenna wortham

I mean, this ideology is the thesis of everything about this man, Rob,
but also everything about this movie, from the chats they have in the
record store, to the songs they play, to all the references they drop.
And it’s not enough that it’s just in the realm of the movie. No, I feel
like it extends, in a very “Donnie Darko,” solar plexus, wormlike way
into the viewer itself. If you don’t agree with these ideas, if you
don’t think this is the best album of all time, or the best top five
songs of all time, then you’re a loser and you don’t get it. And I don’t
think I felt that as strongly the first time I watched it. The first
time I watched it, I was really, probably, taking notes. Actually
there’s probably a sad, little composition notebook out there
somewhere with my name on it, where I was diligently taking notes on the
albums I needed to listen to and the things I needed to be aware of in
order to make it in the world. Because back then, my entire world was
full of guys like that, men like John Cusack, Jack Black, and then the
other guy whose name I always forget, though I know you know.

wesley morris

Todd Louiso.

jenna wortham

Who’s so wonderful in the movie. They were taken as the ultimate
gatekeepers, or just the types of people that mattered in culture and in
society. And I think, being very much a child of the 2000s, it’s almost
a little bit painful that there’s no awareness or interest in any of the
exciting music that’s happening, whether it’s Missy Elliott, Destiny’s
Child, who is so a thing. And I get it — those guys would not have been
into those artists, necessarily, and they don’t have to be. But I
remember trying to have conversations about what I thought was exciting,
and being shut down by guys like those guys who thought, because I
didn’t know the entire discography of the Smiths — I mean, the Smiths
is a perfect example, because it’s a hill that I’ve had to die on many
times in the course of my adult life. Many a dorm room party were shut
down because I was just like, I’m not into this. And people just could
not handle it that I would just openly be like, not for me.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

Not for me.

wesley morris

Meat is murder\!

\[laughing\]

jenna wortham

Like, I hear it come on, and I’m like, yeah, it’s fine. But it’s like
one of those bands that people just have such a fixation on.

wesley morris

I’m a fixatee.

jenna wortham

Good. Well, you can talk me through it some time. I would love —

wesley morris

I don’t need to, though. You don’t need to love the Smiths. I mean —

jenna wortham

But the movie made me feel like if I didn’t at least have a baseline
appreciation of them, then you know, my cultural interests were moot.

wesley morris

Also, there’s this really interesting moment where, in “High Fidelity”
the movie, a man comes into Championship Vinyl looking for a copy of “I
Just Called to Say I Love You.” I don’t know why he’s doing it. The
song, at that point, is 16 years old. It makes no sense. But Jack Black
is not having it.

  - archived recording  
    What’s your problem?

  - archived recording (jack black)  
    Do you even know your daughter? There’s no way she likes that song.
    Oh, ooh, is she in a coma?

  - archived recording  
    Oh, OK, buddy. I didn’t know it was “pick on the middle-aged square
    guy” day. My apologies. I’ll be on my way.

  - archived recording (jack black)  
    Bye-bye. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the
    ‘80s and ‘90s. Go. Sub-question — is it in fact unfair to criticize
    a formerly great artist for his latter-day sins? Is it better to
    burn out than to fade away?

wesley morris

Here is a guy attacking another human being for being interested in
music by saying his interest in music was not worth dignifying with a
record sale. And it’s just like, all right, I see where you sit, Mr.
Black. And I will say that I appreciate it as a critic, because the show
does not have a moment like this, where the takes being had by any of
the characters are that strong. There’s nothing on the show that’s as,
like, “hot-takey” as that.

jenna wortham

But that’s the thing about the show that makes it so fun to watch. Rob
has this incredible cultivated collection of tastes, and interests, and
music. And it’s just hers. She’s not trying to lord it over anyone, or
use it to wield power or pass judgment. And you see that the best in the
interactions with her new love interest-slash-rebound, named Clyde, when
they’re hanging out one night. She’s talking about why they’re only
going to be friends because he likes Phish, you know, which is hilarious
to me.

\[music - fleetwood mac, dreams\]

jenna wortham

She’s like, yeah, we’re just going to be friends. He’s into Phish. And
then, on their first date, they’re hanging out in a bar, and he’s like —

  - archived recording (jake lacy)  
    Uh, question.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    (CLEARS THROAT) Answer.

  - archived recording (jake lacy)  
    If I were to admit, out loud, to you right now, that I truly, no
    joke, love this song, would you get up and leave?

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    No, I love this song.

jenna wortham

And the song that’s playing is “Dreams” — ugh — by Fleetwood Mac. So
good.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Yeah. I don’t love “Rumors” as a whole.

jenna wortham

And she’s like, no, I like this album. She’s like, but, I like “Tusk”
better, which is — you know.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

It’s funny. Another thing that’s so great about how the show uses music,
it’s almost like you’re getting tuned in to Rob’s psychological jukebox.
The whole first season of the show is populated with little pockets of
moments where you can’t really tell what is happening inside of Rob’s
head versus outside of her head. And I’m thinking in particular of one
scene where “Daydreaming” by Aretha Franklin is playing.

  - archived recording (aretha franklin)  
    (SINGING) Daydreaming and I’m thinking of you.

jenna wortham

And Rob is just staring off into space. And one of her co-workers,
Cherise, is trying to get her attention.

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Rob. Rob. Rob\! Come on. What the \[EXPLETIVE\] is your problem?
    Stay focused. Go. Your turn, dude.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

jenna wortham

And you can’t really tell if that’s the song that’s on in the shop, or
just what’s happening for her psychologically and psychically in that
moment. The show is very, very good at using music to score and
punctuate the emotional transitions that this woman is going through at
this very tender moment in her life. It’s also a show about someone who
is very self-absorbed but not a narcissist, and someone who is
interested in growth, and interested in self-improvement. Or at least
interested in trying to understand why she’s made a series of
questionable — I’m not going to call them bad — but a series of
questionable, questionable decisions.

wesley morris

You mean like treating Clyde as her personal Uber?

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

Yeah, I mean, I think that one of the things that’s smart about the show
is the way that it uses Clyde as a benchmark for her awfulness. Like
nobody on the show gets treated worse by her than this guy. And he’s the
person who’s most willing to put up with it because he likes her so
much.

jenna wortham

Well, I feel like that’s the awareness that she comes into over the arc
of the show. It’s less about resolving her past relationships, and it’s
more about how is she going to show up in potential new ones. There’s a
part of me that’s just so enamored with a female protagonist who is
interested in relationships, but more than being partnered, she’s
interested in thinking about how she is in relationship to other people.
Whether they’re romantic interests, whether they’re her friends, whether
they’re her siblings.

wesley morris

Clyde, her brother — yep, her brother. Exactly, that’s what I was
thinking about. There’s the consciousness about what kind of
relationships she’s going to have with other people, where — I mean, I’m
thinking specifically about romantic relationships. But then there is
this unconscious thing that’s going on with her and Cherise on the show.
And Cherise, of course, is the Jack Black character on the show. And her
function on the show initially is to just do Jack Black, but the way
that Da’Vine Joy Randolph would do Jack Black. And so her introduction
is to come into the store, take off the great music that’s already
playing, and put on Dexys Midnight Runners, “Come On Eileen.”

\[music - dexys midnight runners, come on eileen\]

wesley morris

You know, she’s really feeling “Come on Eileen.”

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    I had a \[EXPLETIVE\] dream about this shit last night.

  - archived recording   
    Were you wearing the overalls?

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Yeah. And what’s so crazy, I was having a dream about it, and then I
    — yeah, man — and then I was like, yo, I gotta listen to this song.
    And I had to listen to it and see if I really like it. And I forgot,
    this song’s as dope as shit\!

wesley morris

And it’s supposed to jar you in the sense that you wouldn’t expect this
to be the song that she rolls up in and says she had a dream about, puts
it on, and expects everybody to just “Come on Eileen” with her.

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

\[music stops\]

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Stop\! What the \[EXPLETIVE\]?

wesley morris

She’s big, she’s loud, she’s telling people off. She is the instigator
of many good conversations, by the way, about taste. She brings in this
top five villains question, where they sort of fill out the top five
villains, and then contests that Michael Corleone doesn’t count as a
villain because he’s the protagonist of the movie. And somebody says,
well, that’s just an anti-hero. And she says, no, I reject the term
anti-hero because that is something that somebody made up to make us
think Clint Eastwood is not an asshole.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS) That’s a great part.

wesley morris

That is criticism functioning at its highest level. And the idea that
you have this black woman with all these opinions about art, and taste,
and is conversant in all of these modes of being is a great thing to
have on a show like this. The problem, of course, is that she also is
ragingly insecure. And you — I mean, I don’t know if you could feel it
the way I could feel it, but, like, there’s something going on with this
woman that feels really deep. And the show isn’t willing to unpack it.

jenna wortham

Cherise, to me, is the most interesting character on the show. And she
gets the least amount of screen time in a lot of ways. I want to know
how Cherise and Rob became friends. And they exist as these two black
women in this universe who have had very different life experiences,
just because they exist as two different people. But we never find out
what Cherise’s life experience is. We know that she has another job
outside of the record store, but we never find out what it is. She’s
deeply interested in starting her own band. Where does that come from?
We never find out. Rob’s brother also takes up a pretty big chunk of the
show. He gets his own episode arc, as they have kind of a bachelor party
because his wife’s about to give birth, and so it’s his last night out
on the town. And he gets his own segue. But Cherise, there’s so many
question marks. Every time she disappears off screen, you’re like, well,
what’s she up to?

wesley morris

Where’s she going?

jenna wortham

Where’s Cheri going?

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

And they never tell us\! They never tell us. But yet we know that she is
deeply impacted by the world. We know that she does feel the weight of
other people’s projections and biases against her, and what they think a
woman who lives in her specific skin must be like. A perfect example of
that is she puts up a sign in the record store describing herself as a
front person for the band she hopes to form.

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Read my \[EXPLETIVE\] influences.

  - archived recording   
    Influences must include Stevie Wonder, ‘66-‘77 —

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Stevie Wonder\!

  - archived recording   
    — only. James Brown “Live at the Apollo ‘63,” mostly side A.

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Only side A.

  - archived recording   
    King Crimson, but not so prog, Dungen, but more Nordic, Cream, but
    only Ginger and Jack. Tambourine —

jenna wortham

And then there’s a moment, after it goes up, where this guy comes in and
reads it, and he’s like, oh, damn, I got to meet her. And he asks
somebody in the store, who wrote that? And they point to Cherise. And
the guy takes a look at her, and is like, nah, and dips out. So the
implication of that scene is that this grungy-ass white dude is repulsed
— OK — by the physicality of Cherise, who’s a fuller-figured,
darker-skinned black woman. Her experience stands in direct contrast to
Rob’s. Everybody knows what Zoë Kravitz looks like, but she’s a very
slim-bodied, fair-skinned black woman. And there’s another moment in the
show where the gang is hanging out in front of one of their local
watering holes, and they’re all very tipsy. And I think it’s Simon who
says, get home safe. And Zoë Kravitz is like, “don’t shoot” in this very
offhand way that was like, maybe you’ve never known somebody who was the
victim of police brutality or violence, but that is a very light-handed
thing to say. And I get it within the universe of the show. But that, to
me, kind of speaks to one of the things that Rob is working with, her
unawareness about her own privilege as a fair-skinned black woman.

wesley morris

Well, it’s also important just to point out, when you’re talking about
the difference in their complexions, is these two women are bringing
with them the entire history of black women in entertainment.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm.

wesley morris

Right?

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm.

wesley morris

This is like — this is 250 years of American history happening in this
little record store, where Cherise is Ethel Waters and Pearl Bailey, and
Rob is Lena Horne. (LAUGHS) And there’s a constant preference for people
who look like Rob, and a fixed job for people who look like Cherise. And
this is sort of the pain that Da’Vine Joy Randolph brings with her to
the performance in some ways. And the bigness of her performance has
these layers of these reserves of hurt and ache. But what it’s missing
right now is writing that makes the character make more sense. So this
is where, Jenna, you and I plea with the people who make the show to —
like, for season 2, not only — don’t even — I don’t just want Cherise to
have her own episode. But just — I don’t know who’s writing the show,
but I’d like a black person to sort of focus on Cherise and her back
story, and what else could be in it.

jenna wortham

Exactly. We need to go into Cherise’s home. We need to go into her home
life. Who are her people? Who’s her family? Who’s she caring for? Who
cares for her? Does she have a love life? But also the depth and
development of her and Rob’s relationship is probably the most — one of
the most graceful, and compassionate, and, to me, real moments of that
show. That’s the real partnership that I’m invested in, that I think Rob
kind of becomes aware, over the course of the show, that she needs to
invest in too — her homies, not just her boos.

wesley morris

Right, right, yes.

\[music\]

jenna wortham

OK, we’ve just covered so much ground about this television show. But
Wesley, we haven’t talked about the actual ground of this TV show, which
is our beloved city of residence (SINGING) New York City. Ugh, which I
miss so much\! And part of the reason we recommended this show, and part
of the reason I feel like we’re both enjoying it so much is because it’s
kind of like a virtual 3D tour of a place that we can’t go anymore. It’s
been many years since I’ve spent hours in a bar just shooting the shit
and drinking whiskey, but I want to do that now. It’s like I feel like
they’re doing it for me. They’re doing the very thing point that we want
to be doing, which is just luxuriating in our crappy, rat-filled city.
Don’t you just miss it so much?

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

I know I do.

wesley morris

I have never wanted to rub my elbows on my bar more in my entire life
than I do right now. And watching this show just made that want more
acute. I feel like this show deserves to be, to this moment, in some
ways what “Sex and the City” was to New York City after Sept. 11. What
is this show that’s about this city going to do when the most terrible
thing to happen to it changes the inhabitants’ relationship to it? How
is this show going to respond to that terrorist attack? And I wonder how
a show like “High Fidelity,” is it going to try to deal with this
moment?

jenna wortham

I hope not —

wesley morris

What are these characters —

jenna wortham

— no, no, please don’t —

wesley morris

OK, interesting.

jenna wortham

— please don’t. Because living in New York right now, through this
pandemic, is all the worst parts of New York with none of the good.
You’re dealing with high rent, you’re dealing with the daily
difficulties of basic, basic things. Like getting groceries is 10,000
times more of an ordeal than it normally is, and it’s a pretty big
ordeal on a day to day under regular circumstances in New York. So to
exist in New York right now and be confined to your home, which is
probably too small — there’s that joke that’s going around right now
about, when you get into your first Brooklyn apartment, and the realtor
is like, you’re not going to be here. Don’t think about the square
footage. You’re never going to spend time here, OK? The city is your
backyard. The city is your porch. The city is your playground. We have
none of that on offer right now. We are literally just confined to our
postage-stamp-sized box apartments, trying to make the most of it, with
family members, with roommates, with partners.

wesley morris

Living in an actual lie.

jenna wortham

So I don’t need my escape entertainment to remind me of that fact. I
want it to just be a fantasy of the city that I cannot wait to get back
out into.

wesley morris

This show has arrived at this moment where everything that happened
before a couple of weeks ago is instant nostalgia. It is instantly the
past. And this sort of bygone analog format is now the setting of a show
that is about a thing that we can no longer do as of a couple of weeks
ago. And it automatically makes everything on it romantic.

jenna wortham

Mmmmm.

wesley morris

The touching of an album is incredibly romantic to me.

jenna wortham

Mm.

wesley morris

The sitting at a bar, getting drunk with somebody, and doing your dime
store philosophizing is incredibly romantic to me. And I’m not a big
nostalgia person. I believe that nostalgia is like history for dessert.

\[laughing\]

wesley morris

It’s like you’re not really dealing with reality in some ways. You’re
dealing with a romance of reality. But right now we’ll take it. It’s all
we got.

\[music\]

jenna wortham

Well, that’s our show for this week. And, calling all you crazy cats and
kittens out there, if you tune in next week, we’ll be talking about
everyone’s favorite, most-hated — you take your pick — Netflix show,
“Tiger King.” I mean, I’m saying that half-reluctantly because I feel
like we kind of got bullied into it, just because it’s everywhere. But
we’re taking it on. So if you want to get caught up — or not — that’s
what we’re going to take on next week.

wesley morris

Oh my God.

jenna wortham

  - jenna wortham  
    We’re going to do 1, 2, 3, record. No, baby, we’re not going to clap
    this time. We’re going to sync up our recordings like they do in the
    movies, like boop, you know what I mean? Like, we’re going to try to
    synchronize our tapings.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh-huh. Are we — am I hitting record on 3 or record?

  - jenna wortham  
    On record.

  - wesley morris  
    OK.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK, ready? 1, 2, 3, record.

  - wesley morris  
    I did it\!

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    (LAUGHS)

  - wesley morris  
    I did it.

  - jenna wortham  
    We’re just learning so much right now. I’m Jenna Wortham.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m Wesley Morris.
    
    We’re two culture writers at The New York Times.

  - jenna wortham  
    This is “Still Processing.”
    
    Wesley, I want to read something to you just for a moment. Can I?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, sure, hit me. Hit me.

  - jenna wortham  
    Ooh, OK. Here we go. “Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience
    of those who’ve been marginalized for all of us to remember the
    importance of community and mutual aid,” period. That’s a tweet.
    That’s a tweet. Who do you think that tweet is by?

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, this is the part where, like, you really blow my mind right
    now. But I’m going to just, like, hope against hope that it’s our
    current president, Donald J. Trump.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s his predecessor, Barack Hussein Obama, out here in these
    Twitter streets, offering comfort, things that are more hearty and
    nourishing than my bone broth — more or less. My bone broth is
    pretty good. But really out here dishing up delicious servings of
    shouting-out frontline workers and grocery store clerks. I know
    you’ve seen some of these.

  - wesley morris  
    I’ve seen some of them, and they are inspiring. I mean, I saw that
    he retweeted a post by a disabled activist.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    And I think it’s @cripchick.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s the one.

  - wesley morris  
    And he had a message basically saying, don’t forget, in these times,
    who else matters. I mean, it’s just — can you imagine how different
    things would be if this is what was happening during these press
    briefings every day, if there was, like — like, we’ve dealt with all
    the important information about handwashing, and protective gear,
    and all the other crisis-oriented things. But I want to take a
    moment now to just talk about the people, talk about the people who
    are out there on the frontlines suffering, and making this work, and
    people we’re not remembering right now. That’s important too. I
    think it’s partially a little bit a civics lesson, in that you are
    learning a little bit what else a leader can do. But there are other
    people actually giving actual civics lessons in some way. There are
    people out there telling you to fill out your census form. Don’t
    forget, amidst all this turmoil and chaos, y’all got a census form
    to fill out. And that’s important too.

  - jenna wortham  
    And you know who the number-one advocate in New York is for taking
    the 2020 census, Mr. Wesley Morris?

  - wesley morris  
    Besides the mayor and the governor?

  - jenna wortham  
    No, Cardi B.

  - archived recording (cardi b)  
    New York City, 2020 is a huge opportunity to make our voice heard.
    This year, we have the power to decide our city’s future, not just
    for the next four years, but for the next 10, by getting counted in
    the census. The census is about power, money —

jenna wortham

She is out here working for nyc.gov, but also hustling on her social
media platforms, reminding people, y’all want to be counted. You need to
be on record as existing so that we can get the social services we need.
I was, like, fanning myself watching this public service announcement.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS) Thank God for Cardi B.

jenna wortham

I also find her to be one of these unexpected and deeply-important,
impromptu, ad-hoc leaders in this moment right now. There’s a moment in
one of her Instagrams when she talks about — she’s wearing a mask, her
nails are fully done, which I love — and she’s talking about how
disgraceful it is, frankly, that celebrities can get tested and the
average person can’t get tested.

  - archived recording (cardi b)  
    And, on top of that, a lot of celebrities, y’all have the luxury to
    pay $34,000 or whatever the \[EXPLETIVE\] it costs to get tested and
    get treated. A lot of these people, they don’t \[EXPLETIVE\] have
    that money.

jenna wortham

And her voice cracks when she says money. She says, people don’t have
money. And I felt that. And I know she felt it. Like, she remembers what
it’s like not to have a lot. And it’s important for celebrities to not
be so out there in woo woo Island. I mean, our colleague Amanda Hess had
a great piece about that in The Times this week about how out of touch
they seem. And I love that Cardi B manages to be in touch as she talks
about this crisis.

wesley morris

And then, in the middle of all this, Oprah Winfrey comes back.

jenna wortham

I know. Truly, with a talk show, specifically about Covid-19 though.

\[laughter\]

jenna wortham

She was like, the people need me.

  - archived recording (oprah winfrey)  
    This is a moment that we have an opportunity, in the midst of all of
    our fears and disruption, to really rise. And I know —

wesley morris

The void is pretty big right now. And I am heartened to see a person
like Oprah Winfrey step into it with her special, “Oprah Talks
Covid-19,” where she just is trying to get people through this moment.
Talking to people on the front lines, hearing stories about people doing
their jobs, listening to people talk about this experience, and trying
to bring them some sort of comfort.

jenna wortham

And also demystify it for most Americans, right? Because the reason
we’re looking to these alternative leaders is because there hasn’t
been a lot of clear messaging around what’s happening right now for the
average person. So Oprah, we’re projecting a little, but Oprah
presumably feels the need to step in and be a little bit of an authority
because we really don’t feel like we have any right now.

wesley morris

Right, right, right.

jenna wortham

Meanwhile, did you see what Britney Spears posted?

wesley morris

No, I did not.

jenna wortham

O-M-G. I don’t know who sent this to her, and I don’t know how she found
out about it, but it was incredible. So a few days ago, in the midst of
everybody spiraling out on social media, and trying to figure out how to
use this time, and then figure out how to be productive, but then also
how to rest, and how to readjust their lives, homegirl Britney Spears
posts this real socialist-sounding manifesto that’s making the rounds
through all of queer and P.O.C. Instagram. And it’s a manifesto written
by a queer Chinese artist who lives in Brooklyn named Mimi Zhu, and I’m
just going to read a little bit of it. I’m going to read all of it,
actually. Because it’s incredible on its own, but then just think about
the fact that Britney Spears posts this. Here goes. “During this time of
isolation, we need connection now more than ever.” True. “Call your
loved ones. Write virtual love letters. Technologies like virtual
communication, streaming and broadcasting are part of our community
collaboration. We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the
waves of the web. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike.
We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay.
Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.”

wesley morris

I’m sorry. Did A.O.C. write that? (LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

Well, it’s part of this whole trend of people writing platitudes, and
using cool graphic designs, and posting them around the web, which
obviously is right up my alley. I don’t know why I’m speaking about it
like it annoys me. It’s just — it’s part of a bigger wave of people
doing things in the vein of artists like Jenny Holzer. And it’s, like,
coming up with the sayings we need for this time. Like, “we’re going to
save ourselves,” “we all we got.” Like, it’s very much in that mindset,
and I’m here for it. But there is another layer to it, because you think
about Britney Spears, who is always under quarantine. Like, she’s been
living this life. (LAUGHS) So I don’t know, I feel like she’s letting us
know, like, I’ve figured out how to make it work under my
conservatorship. Like, y’all can figure it out too.

\[laughter\]

jenna wortham

I’m like, how do we reach out and save Britney? But it also was just
incredible, though, because I think it’s an indicator that everyone’s
being impacted, everyone’s being affected. And there is a desire to let
one’s digital neighbor know, you’re not in it alone. I’m right here
beside you. And that’s a really incredible thing.

\[music\]

wesley morris

All right, so we’re going to take a break. And when we come back, we’re
going to talk about a woman who owns a record shop in New York City, in
2020.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

Hulu’s “High Fidelity.” We’ll be right back.

\[music\]

jenna wortham

Wesley, you know where I stand on lots of issues. But on the issue of
reboots, I don’t know if we’ve talked about it a ton, in terms of how I
feel about them. Generally I think they’re terrible.

wesley morris

Oh.

jenna wortham

They’re always not-great versions of the original thing. To me, it’s
like eating jerk seitan —

wesley morris

Ooh.

jenna wortham

— or Dippin’ Dots.

wesley morris

Oh.

jenna wortham

Two things I like, by the way. But I like them because I’m well aware
that they are not the thing they are sort of a proxy for. That’s not
really jerk chicken, and it’s not ice cream, but they both still taste
good to me.

wesley morris

Well, you are speaking my language right now, though. Because we’re
living in a moment of high — what I can only call “high reboot.”

jenna wortham

Oh yeah.

wesley morris

Like peak, maximal reboot. I am not a fan of this. I am an originalist
when it comes to popular culture. I just want you to give me the thing
that you came up with that is not based on some studio’s, or in some
cases — I’m not going to name names — your parents’ I.P.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

I don’t get mad at the artist level, necessarily. I’m mad at the
studios.

jenna wortham

Yes, yes.

wesley morris

You can hire anybody to think any thought, and write something new and
original, but you guys have created this system where you’ve
disincentived artists from thinking originally. They can easily see what
your library consists of — your back issues, your archives — and be
like, “You know what? I see that, Universal, you’ve got this incredible
old monster archive. I’m just going to take an old monster thing that
you have” — or if I’m an executive, “You know, we’ve got all these old
monsters. We should just redo them.” So in the last few years, we’ve
gotten everything from “Jumanji,” to “Westworld,” “Lost in Space,”
“Boomerang,” “Party of Five,” “Dumbo,” “Men in Black.” “What Women
Want” becomes “What Men Want,” with Taraji P. Henson. The live-action
“Lion King,” live-action “Aladdin.” “Charlie’s Angels,” which nobody
wanted\!

jenna wortham

I know.

wesley morris

And I just feel like, when you’re at the “Charlie’s Angels” point, you
have kind of hit bottom.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

And this isn’t to say that some of these reboots, remakes, sequels,
rethinks, whatever you want to call them don’t have anything to say.
Frequently what happens now is that you’re politically correcting for an
old problem, or you’re using a movie about four men to make a point
about its maleness by casting four women. I’m looking at you, that
needless “Ghostbusters” remake with all those great women. It was
another example of, why not get those four women together to do
something other than a “Ghostbusters” remake?

jenna wortham

Yes. And that’s why, honestly, Wesley, when you who told me I should
watch “High Fidelity,” I was like, no. I don’t need — like, on top of
everything else I’m going through, I don’t need a crappy reboot. But it
turned out, like many things you tell me to do that I don’t want to do,
you were right. I really enjoyed the new “High Fidelity.” I was
surprised. I had so much built up like — I sat down in a huff with my
arms crossed, and was like, we’ll see how this goes. And then I was just
like a melted popsicle on the floor by the end of the first episode.

wesley morris

So the show and the movie have a lot of things in common. They’re both
about a record store owner named Rob. The 2000 movie starred John
Cusack. The 2020 television show stars Zoë Kravitz. In the movie, it was
directed by Stephen Frears, who made “Dangerous Liaisons.” And he would
eventually go on to make “The Queen” with Helen Mirren. “High Fidelity”
is based on a Nick Hornby book. And when it came out, it was a decent
hit. Basically the two properties are about a recently dumped person in
pursuit of the person who dumped them, or is trying to figure out how to
deal with having been dumped.

\[zipper zips\]

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    OK, that’s everything, I think.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    I mean, you don’t have to go this second.

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    I know, but I think it’s best that I do, so —

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Just stay for tonight.

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    No.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    OK, just stay for a drink then.

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    No, I don’t think a drink’s going to do it, Rob.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Then how about — how about two drinks?

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    Jesus Christ, can we just make this just a little bit easy, please?

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Oh, I’m sorry, is this inconvenient for you?

  - archived recording (kingsley ben-adir)  
    You know what, I’m just going to go, all right?

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Wait, Mac.

\[door closes\]

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Mac.

wesley morris

And it’s about both these characters taking us on a journey, a narrated
journey through their past loves. And both Robs have new relationships.

jenna wortham

That’s a really nice way to put that they are rebounding with very sweet
innocence. But go on.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

But go on.

wesley morris

In the movie, it’s played by Lisa Bonet, who happens to be Zoë Kravitz’s
mother. And on the TV show, it’s Jake Lacy, who is now American popular
culture’s “perfect boyfriend” figure.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

They both own a record store called Championship Vinyl that has two
other employees. One is a wacky, loudmouth, obnoxious person, with a lot
of opinions, and the other person is a little more quiet and thoughtful
about what he likes. In the movie, the loud person was played by Jack
Black, and on the TV show, it’s played by Da’Vine Joy Randolph. I think
the thing that makes the show great, in addition to some good writing,
is Zoë Kravitz. The show does not work if she doesn’t work. And she
works, so the show works.

jenna wortham

Mm-hm, mm-hm.

wesley morris

I mean, this is a part that I have been waiting for her to get for a
long time, where she’s a star on this show. She’s a star\!

jenna wortham

She’s so natural, so sweet —

wesley morris

She’s so natural.

jenna wortham

— so charismatic.

wesley morris

What I love about Rob in this show is that she is enough of a character
that is brought to life by writing, but is also animated by this
performance. And there are all of these wonderful things that Zoë
Kravitz gets to do in terms of owning space as a performer.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm. Who know Zoë Kravitz, onscreen would just be so effortlessly
chill, and funny, and self-possessed, and witty, and charismatic? I’m
thinking in particular about that scene in the very first episode, after
she and Clyde have their drunken hookup.

\[fast rock music\]

jenna wortham

So there is Zoë Kravitz, sitting at her junky dining room table.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you don’t get back on the
    \[EXPLETIVE\] horse.

jenna wortham

Clutter everywhere.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Not that I needed another reminder. I have all the reminders that I
    need.

jenna wortham

And she’s just slopping cereal into the bowl. There’s Fruity Pebbles —
or whatever she’s eating — everywhere. She’s slopping the milk around
too, and then just shoveling spoonfuls into her mouth while she’s
explicating this hookup. And she’s so tangible. She’s really projecting
this self-effacing disregard that I just feel like is hard for someone
as well-known and as, frankly, pretty as Zoë Kravitz to do. She’s just
shed, basically, all of her cool persona, and really is putting herself
out there in this incredibly vulnerable way. And I was sold. I was here
for it.

wesley morris

I would also say, this Rob is different from John Cusack’s Rob in the
movie. In the movie, Rob is — he’s cranky, he’s cantankerous, he is
sexist a little bit, maybe, or just a little bitter.

jenna wortham

Don’t underqualify that. He is a lot of all those things, not a little
of those things.

wesley morris

Fair. This is another of John Cusack’s tortured lovers people. And in
this movie, I’m thinking about — you know, Lloyd Dobler, obviously —
there was a kind of romance for something that was sort of broken in
him, and brooding, but kind of sweetly optimistic at the same time. He
was vulnerable. He’s much harder in “High Fidelity.” And his bitterness
is this armor that keeps him from being able to maybe successfully be in
a relationship.

\[music - elton john, crocodile rock\]

  - archived recording (john cusack)  
    She was nice — nice manners, nice grades, nice-looking. She was so
    nice, in fact, that she wouldn’t let me put my hand underneath or
    even on top of her bra.

\[music - joan jett, crimson and clover\]

  - archived recording (john cusack)  
    Attack and defense, invasion and repulsion. It was as if breasts
    were little pieces of property that had been unlawfully annexed by
    the opposite sex. They were rightfully ours, and we wanted them
    back. Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breast that I
    would try to touch her between her legs. It was like trying to
    borrow a dollar, getting turned down, and asking for 50 grand
    instead.
    
    I wasn’t interested in Patty’s nice qualities, just breasts, and
    therefore she was no good to me.

jenna wortham

Yo, I rewatched the original “High Fidelity” in the same period of time
that I decide to watch “28 Days Later.” Now, I would not advise that
anyone watch “28 Days Later” while you’re in the midst of thinking about
contracting a virus, thinking about trying to protect yourself from some
pandemic. But I will tell you this, Wesley Morris, I had an easier time
finishing “28 Days Later” —

wesley morris

Oh no.

jenna wortham

— than I did “High Fidelity.”

wesley morris

Oh, Jenna, come on.

jenna wortham

I’m being 100 percent serious. I could not take, you know, being
submerged in this man’s just unhappiness, and his defensiveness, and his
insistence that things like appearance, and aesthetic, and all the
accoutrements of life don’t matter at all. The only thing that matters
is having a very well-curated record shelf and a very well-curated
bookshelf.

  - archived recording (john cusack)  
    A while back, Dick Barry and I agreed that what really matters is
    what you like, not what you are like. Books, records, films, these
    things matter. Call me shallow, it’s the \[EXPLETIVE\] truth.

wesley morris

What the argument of the movie ultimately is is that everybody can have
opinions, and that some people’s opinions are better than other people’s
opinions, essentially.

jenna wortham

I mean, this ideology is the thesis of everything about this man, Rob,
but also everything about this movie, from the chats they have in the
record store, to the songs they play, to all the references they drop.
And it’s not enough that it’s just in the realm of the movie. No, I feel
like it extends, in a very “Donnie Darko,” solar plexus, wormlike way
into the viewer itself. If you don’t agree with these ideas, if you
don’t think this is the best album of all time, or the best top five
songs of all time, then you’re a loser and you don’t get it. And I don’t
think I felt that as strongly the first time I watched it. The first
time I watched it, I was really, probably, taking notes. Actually
there’s probably a sad, little composition notebook out there
somewhere with my name on it, where I was diligently taking notes on the
albums I needed to listen to and the things I needed to be aware of in
order to make it in the world. Because back then, my entire world was
full of guys like that, men like John Cusack, Jack Black, and then the
other guy whose name I always forget, though I know you know.

wesley morris

Todd Louiso.

jenna wortham

Who’s so wonderful in the movie. They were taken as the ultimate
gatekeepers, or just the types of people that mattered in culture and in
society. And I think, being very much a child of the 2000s, it’s almost
a little bit painful that there’s no awareness or interest in any of the
exciting music that’s happening, whether it’s Missy Elliott, Destiny’s
Child, who is so a thing. And I get it — those guys would not have been
into those artists, necessarily, and they don’t have to be. But I
remember trying to have conversations about what I thought was exciting,
and being shut down by guys like those guys who thought, because I
didn’t know the entire discography of the Smiths — I mean, the Smiths
is a perfect example, because it’s a hill that I’ve had to die on many
times in the course of my adult life. Many a dorm room party were shut
down because I was just like, I’m not into this. And people just could
not handle it that I would just openly be like, not for me.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

Not for me.

wesley morris

Meat is murder\!

\[laughing\]

jenna wortham

Like, I hear it come on, and I’m like, yeah, it’s fine. But it’s like
one of those bands that people just have such a fixation on.

wesley morris

I’m a fixatee.

jenna wortham

Good. Well, you can talk me through it some time. I would love —

wesley morris

I don’t need to, though. You don’t need to love the Smiths. I mean —

jenna wortham

But the movie made me feel like if I didn’t at least have a baseline
appreciation of them, then you know, my cultural interests were moot.

wesley morris

Also, there’s this really interesting moment where, in “High Fidelity”
the movie, a man comes into Championship Vinyl looking for a copy of “I
Just Called to Say I Love You.” I don’t know why he’s doing it. The
song, at that point, is 16 years old. It makes no sense. But Jack Black
is not having it.

  - archived recording  
    What’s your problem?

  - archived recording (jack black)  
    Do you even know your daughter? There’s no way she likes that song.
    Oh, ooh, is she in a coma?

  - archived recording  
    Oh, OK, buddy. I didn’t know it was “pick on the middle-aged square
    guy” day. My apologies. I’ll be on my way.

  - archived recording (jack black)  
    Bye-bye. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the
    ‘80s and ‘90s. Go. Sub-question — is it in fact unfair to criticize
    a formerly great artist for his latter-day sins? Is it better to
    burn out than to fade away?

wesley morris

Here is a guy attacking another human being for being interested in
music by saying his interest in music was not worth dignifying with a
record sale. And it’s just like, all right, I see where you sit, Mr.
Black. And I will say that I appreciate it as a critic, because the show
does not have a moment like this, where the takes being had by any of
the characters are that strong. There’s nothing on the show that’s as,
like, “hot-takey” as that.

jenna wortham

But that’s the thing about the show that makes it so fun to watch. Rob
has this incredible cultivated collection of tastes, and interests, and
music. And it’s just hers. She’s not trying to lord it over anyone, or
use it to wield power or pass judgment. And you see that the best in the
interactions with her new love interest-slash-rebound, named Clyde, when
they’re hanging out one night. She’s talking about why they’re only
going to be friends because he likes Phish, you know, which is hilarious
to me.

\[music - fleetwood mac, dreams\]

jenna wortham

She’s like, yeah, we’re just going to be friends. He’s into Phish. And
then, on their first date, they’re hanging out in a bar, and he’s like —

  - archived recording (jake lacy)  
    Uh, question.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    No, I love this song.

jenna wortham

And the song that’s playing is “Dreams” — ugh — by Fleetwood Mac. So
good.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Yeah. I don’t love “Rumors” as a whole.

jenna wortham

And she’s like, no, I like this album. She’s like, but, I like “Tusk”
better, which is — you know.

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

It’s funny. Another thing that’s so great about how the show uses music,
it’s almost like you’re getting tuned in to Rob’s psychological jukebox.
The whole first season of the show is populated with little pockets of
moments where you can’t really tell what is happening inside of Rob’s
head versus outside of her head. And I’m thinking in particular of one
scene where “Daydreaming” by Aretha Franklin is playing.

  - archived recording (aretha franklin)  
    (SINGING) Daydreaming and I’m thinking of you.

jenna wortham

And Rob is just staring off into space. And one of her co-workers,
Cherise, is trying to get her attention.

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Rob. Rob. Rob\! Come on. What the \[EXPLETIVE\] is your problem?
    Stay focused. Go. Your turn, dude.

  - archived recording (zoë kravitz)  
    Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

jenna wortham

And you can’t really tell if that’s the song that’s on in the shop, or
just what’s happening for her psychologically and psychically in that
moment. The show is very, very good at using music to score and
punctuate the emotional transitions that this woman is going through at
this very tender moment in her life. It’s also a show about someone who
is very self-absorbed but not a narcissist, and someone who is
interested in growth, and interested in self-improvement. Or at least
interested in trying to understand why she’s made a series of
questionable — I’m not going to call them bad — but a series of
questionable, questionable decisions.

wesley morris

You mean like treating Clyde as her personal Uber?

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS)

wesley morris

Yeah, I mean, I think that one of the things that’s smart about the show
is the way that it uses Clyde as a benchmark for her awfulness. Like
nobody on the show gets treated worse by her than this guy. And he’s the
person who’s most willing to put up with it because he likes her so
much.

jenna wortham

Well, I feel like that’s the awareness that she comes into over the arc
of the show. It’s less about resolving her past relationships, and it’s
more about how is she going to show up in potential new ones. There’s a
part of me that’s just so enamored with a female protagonist who is
interested in relationships, but more than being partnered, she’s
interested in thinking about how she is in relationship to other people.
Whether they’re romantic interests, whether they’re her friends, whether
they’re her siblings.

wesley morris

Clyde, her brother — yep, her brother. Exactly, that’s what I was
thinking about. There’s the consciousness about what kind of
relationships she’s going to have with other people, where — I mean, I’m
thinking specifically about romantic relationships. But then there is
this unconscious thing that’s going on with her and Cherise on the show.
And Cherise, of course, is the Jack Black character on the show. And her
function on the show initially is to just do Jack Black, but the way
that Da’Vine Joy Randolph would do Jack Black. And so her introduction
is to come into the store, take off the great music that’s already
playing, and put on Dexys Midnight Runners, “Come On Eileen.”

\[music - dexys midnight runners, come on eileen\]

wesley morris

You know, she’s really feeling “Come on Eileen.”

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    I had a \[EXPLETIVE\] dream about this shit last night.

  - archived recording   
    Were you wearing the overalls?

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Yeah. And what’s so crazy, I was having a dream about it, and then I
    — yeah, man — and then I was like, yo, I gotta listen to this song.
    And I had to listen to it and see if I really like it. And I forgot,
    this song’s as dope as shit\!

wesley morris

And it’s supposed to jar you in the sense that you wouldn’t expect this
to be the song that she rolls up in and says she had a dream about, puts
it on, and expects everybody to just “Come on Eileen” with her.

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

\[music stops\]

  - archived recording (da'vine joy randolph)  
    Stop\! What the \[EXPLETIVE\]?

wesley morris

She’s big, she’s loud, she’s telling people off. She is the instigator
of many good conversations, by the way, about taste. She brings in this
top five villains question, where they sort of fill out the top five
villains, and then contests that Michael Corleone doesn’t count as a
villain because he’s the protagonist of the movie. And somebody says,
well, that’s just an anti-hero. And she says, no, I reject the term
anti-hero because that is something that somebody made up to make us
think Clint Eastwood is not an asshole.

jenna wortham

(LAUGHS) That’s a great part.

wesley morris

That is criticism functioning at its highest level. And the idea that
you have this black woman with all these opinions about art, and taste,
and is conversant in all of these modes of being is a great thing to
have on a show like this. The problem, of course, is that she also is
ragingly insecure. And you — I mean, I don’t know if you could feel it
the way I could feel it, but, like, there’s something going on with this
woman that feels really deep. And the show isn’t willing to unpack it.

jenna wortham

Cherise, to me, is the most interesting character on the show. And she
gets the least amount of screen time in a lot of ways. I want to know
how Cherise and Rob became friends. And they exist as these two black
women in this universe who have had very different life experiences,
just because they exist as two different people. But we never find out
what Cherise’s life experience is. We know that she has another job
outside of the record store, but we never find out what it is. She’s
deeply interested in starting her own band. Where does that come from?
We never find out. Rob’s brother also takes up a pretty big chunk of the
show. He gets his own episode arc, as they have kind of a bachelor party
because his wife’s about to give birth, and so it’s his last night out
on the town. And he gets his own segue. But Cherise, there’s so many
question marks. Every time she disappears off screen, you’re like, well,
what’s she up to?

wesley morris

Where’s she going?

jenna wortham

Where’s Cheri going?

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

And they never tell us\! They never tell us. But yet we know that she is
deeply impacted by the world. We know that she does feel the weight of
other people’s projections and biases against her, and what they think a
woman who lives in her specific skin must be like. A perfect example of
that is she puts up a sign in the record store describing herself as a

And then there’s a moment, after it goes up, where this guy comes in and
reads it, and he’s like, oh, damn, I got to meet her. And he asks
somebody in the store, who wrote that? And they point to Cherise. And
the guy takes a look at her, and is like, nah, and dips out. So the
implication of that scene is that this grungy-ass white dude is repulsed
— OK — by the physicality of Cherise, who’s a fuller-figured,
darker-skinned black woman. Her experience stands in direct contrast to
Rob’s. Everybody knows what Zoë Kravitz looks like, but she’s a very
slim-bodied, fair-skinned black woman. And there’s another moment in the
show where the gang is hanging out in front of one of their local
watering holes, and they’re all very tipsy. And I think it’s Simon who
says, get home safe. And Zoë Kravitz is like, “don’t shoot” in this very
offhand way that was like, maybe you’ve never known somebody who was the
victim of police brutality or violence, but that is a very light-handed
thing to say. And I get it within the universe of the show. But that, to
me, kind of speaks to one of the things that Rob is working with, her
unawareness about her own privilege as a fair-skinned black woman.

wesley morris

Well, it’s also important just to point out, when you’re talking about
the difference in their complexions, is these two women are bringing
with them the entire history of black women in entertainment.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm.

wesley morris

Right?

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm.

wesley morris

This is like — this is 250 years of American history happening in this
little record store, where Cherise is Ethel Waters and Pearl Bailey, and
Rob is Lena Horne. (LAUGHS) And there’s a constant preference for people
who look like Rob, and a fixed job for people who look like Cherise. And
this is sort of the pain that Da’Vine Joy Randolph brings with her to
the performance in some ways. And the bigness of her performance has
these layers of these reserves of hurt and ache. But what it’s missing
right now is writing that makes the character make more sense. So this
is where, Jenna, you and I plea with the people who make the show to —
like, for season 2, not only — don’t even — I don’t just want Cherise to
have her own episode. But just — I don’t know who’s writing the show,
but I’d like a black person to sort of focus on Cherise and her back
story, and what else could be in it.

jenna wortham

Exactly. We need to go into Cherise’s home. We need to go into her home
life. Who are her people? Who’s her family? Who’s she caring for? Who
cares for her? Does she have a love life? But also the depth and
development of her and Rob’s relationship is probably the most — one of
the most graceful, and compassionate, and, to me, real moments of that
show. That’s the real partnership that I’m invested in, that I think Rob
kind of becomes aware, over the course of the show, that she needs to
invest in too — her homies, not just her boos.

wesley morris

Right, right, yes.

\[music\]

jenna wortham

OK, we’ve just covered so much ground about this television show. But
Wesley, we haven’t talked about the actual ground of this TV show, which
is our beloved city of residence (SINGING) New York City. Ugh, which I
miss so much\! And part of the reason we recommended this show, and part
of the reason I feel like we’re both enjoying it so much is because it’s
kind of like a virtual 3D tour of a place that we can’t go anymore. It’s
been many years since I’ve spent hours in a bar just shooting the shit
and drinking whiskey, but I want to do that now. It’s like I feel like
they’re doing it for me. They’re doing the very thing point that we want
to be doing, which is just luxuriating in our crappy, rat-filled city.
Don’t you just miss it so much?

wesley morris

(LAUGHS)

jenna wortham

I know I do.

wesley morris

I have never wanted to rub my elbows on my bar more in my entire life
than I do right now. And watching this show just made that want more
acute. I feel like this show deserves to be, to this moment, in some
ways what “Sex and the City” was to New York City after Sept. 11. What
is this show that’s about this city going to do when the most terrible
thing to happen to it changes the inhabitants’ relationship to it? How
is this show going to respond to that terrorist attack? And I wonder how
a show like “High Fidelity,” is it going to try to deal with this
moment?

jenna wortham

I hope not —

wesley morris

What are these characters —

jenna wortham

— no, no, please don’t —

wesley morris

OK, interesting.

jenna wortham

— please don’t. Because living in New York right now, through this
pandemic, is all the worst parts of New York with none of the good.
You’re dealing with high rent, you’re dealing with the daily
difficulties of basic, basic things. Like getting groceries is 10,000
times more of an ordeal than it normally is, and it’s a pretty big
ordeal on a day to day under regular circumstances in New York. So to
exist in New York right now and be confined to your home, which is
probably too small — there’s that joke that’s going around right now
about, when you get into your first Brooklyn apartment, and the realtor
is like, you’re not going to be here. Don’t think about the square
footage. You’re never going to spend time here, OK? The city is your
backyard. The city is your porch. The city is your playground. We have
none of that on offer right now. We are literally just confined to our
postage-stamp-sized box apartments, trying to make the most of it, with
family members, with roommates, with partners.

wesley morris

Living in an actual lie.

jenna wortham

So I don’t need my escape entertainment to remind me of that fact. I
want it to just be a fantasy of the city that I cannot wait to get back
out into.

wesley morris

This show has arrived at this moment where everything that happened
before a couple of weeks ago is instant nostalgia. It is instantly the
past. And this sort of bygone analog format is now the setting of a show
that is about a thing that we can no longer do as of a couple of weeks
ago. And it automatically makes everything on it romantic.

jenna wortham

Mmmmm.

wesley morris

The touching of an album is incredibly romantic to me.

jenna wortham

Mm.

wesley morris

The sitting at a bar, getting drunk with somebody, and doing your dime
store philosophizing is incredibly romantic to me. And I’m not a big
nostalgia person. I believe that nostalgia is like history for dessert.

\[laughing\]

wesley morris

It’s like you’re not really dealing with reality in some ways. You’re
dealing with a romance of reality. But right now we’ll take it. It’s all
we got.

\[music\]

jenna wortham

Well, that’s our show for this week. And, calling all you crazy cats and
kittens out there, if you tune in next week, we’ll be talking about
everyone’s favorite, most-hated — you take your pick — Netflix show,
“Tiger King.” I mean, I’m saying that half-reluctantly because I feel
like we kind of got bullied into it, just because it’s everywhere. But
we’re taking it on. So if you want to get caught up — or not — that’s
what we’re going to take on next week.

wesley morris

Oh my God.

jenna wortham
