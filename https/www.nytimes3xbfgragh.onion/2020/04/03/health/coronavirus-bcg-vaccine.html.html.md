<div class="css-53u6y8">

A vaccine that was developed a hundred years ago to fight the
tuberculosis scourge in Europe is now being tested against the
coronavirus by scientists eager to find a quick way to protect health
care workers, among others.

The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is still widely used in the
developing world, where scientists have found that it does more than
prevent TB. The vaccine prevents infant deaths from a variety of causes,
and sharply reduces the incidence of respiratory infections.

The vaccine seems to “train” the immune system to recognize and respond
to a variety of infections, including viruses, bacteria and parasites,
experts say. There is little evidence yet that the vaccine will blunt
infection with the coronavirus, but a series of clinical trials may
answer the question in just months.

On Monday, scientists in Melbourne, Australia, started administering the
B.C.G. vaccine or a placebo to thousands of physicians, nurses,
respiratory therapists and other health care workers — the first of
several randomized controlled trials intended to test the vaccine’s
effectiveness against the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Nobody is saying this is a panacea,” said Nigel Curtis, an infectious
diseases researcher at the University of Melbourne and Murdoch
Children’s Research Institute, who planned the trial. “What we want to
do is reduce the time an infected health care worker is unwell, so they
recover and can come back to work faster.”

A clinical trial of 1,000 health care workers began 10 days ago in the
Netherlands, said Dr. Mihai G. Netea, an infectious disease specialist
at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen. Eight hundred health
care workers have already signed up. (As in Australia, half of the
participants will receive a placebo.)

Dr. Denise Faustman, director of immunobiology at Massachusetts General
Hospital, is seeking funding to start a clinical trial of the vaccine in
health care workers in Boston as well. Preliminary results could be
available in as little as four months.

“We have really strong data from clinical trials with humans — not mice
— that this vaccine protects you from viral and parasitic infections,”
said Dr. Faustman. “I’d like to start today.”

The B.C.G. vaccine has an unusual history. It was inspired in the 1800s
by the observation that milkmaids did not develop tuberculosis. The
vaccine is named after its inventors, Dr. Albert Calmette and Dr.
Camille Guerin, who developed it in the early 1900s from mycobacterium
bovis, a form of tuberculosis that infects cattle.

The vaccine was first used in humans in 1921 and was widely adopted
after World War II. Now B.C.G. is primarily used in the developing world
and in countries where TB is still prevalent, where it is given to over
100 million babies a year.

Like other vaccines, B.C.G. has a specific target: TB. But evidence
accumulating over the past decade suggests the vaccine also has
so-called off-target effects, reducing viral illnesses, respiratory
infections and sepsis, and appears to bolster the body’s immune system.

The idea is an offshoot of the “hygiene hypothesis,” which suggests that
the modern emphasis on cleanliness has deprived children of exposure to
germs. The lack of “training” has resulted in weakened immune systems,
less able to resist disease.

One of the earliest studies hinting at the broad benefits of B.C.G.
vaccination was a [randomized trial of 2,320 babies in Guinea-Bissau in
West Africa,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21673035)published in
2011, that reported that death rates among low-birth-weight babies were
dramatically reduced after vaccination. A follow-up trial reported that
[infectious-disease mortality rates in low-birth-weight babies who were
vaccinated were cut by more than 40
percent.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29579158)

Other epidemiological studies — including a 25-year study of over
150,000 children in 33 countries — have reported a 40 percent [lower
risk of acute lower respiratory tract
infections](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25725054/?from_single_result=2015%2C+de+castro+mj%2C+clinical+infectious+disease&expanded_search_query=2015%2C+de+castro+mj%2C+clinical+infectious+disease)
in children who received a B.C.G. vaccine.

A study [in the

infections.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

A recent [review by the World Health Organization concluded that B.C.G.
had beneficial “off-target
effects](https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/1_BCG_report_revised_version_online.pdf),”
and recommended doing more trials of the vaccine against a wider range
of infections.

“This vaccine has saved as many lives as the polio vaccine — it’s an
amazing story,” said Dr. Curtis, who designed and launched the B.C.G.
trial in Melbourne in less than a month, hoping to stay one step ahead
of the coronavirus’s spread in Australia.

While he described the B.C.G. vaccine as underappreciated, he emphasized
that it was “not a specific Covid-19 vaccine.” B.C.G. also cannot be
administered to anyone who has a compromised immune system, because it
is a live-attenuated vaccine — meaning it contains live but weakened TB.

Dr. Faustman said it should not be used in hospitalized patients with
active disease, because it may not work fast enough and could interact
poorly with other treatments.

Not everyone is convinced B.C.G. holds much promise. Dr. Domenico
Accili, an endocrinologist at Columbia University, said he thought
efforts to use the vaccine against the coronavirus sound “a bit like
magical thinking.”

While acknowledging that B.C.G. is “a non-specific booster of the immune
system,” he said, “we should be able to deploy a more tailored
approach.”

One question is what effect the vaccine may have in patients whose
immune systems overreact to the coronavirus, resulting in what are
called cytokine storms. Dr. Randy Cron, an expert on cytokine storms at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said it was impossible to know.

A [recent analysis of the disparate toll the new
coronavirus](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1)
has taken on middle- and high-income countries found a correlation with
B.C.G. policies, concluding that countries that did not implement or had
abandoned universal B.C.G. vaccination have had more coronavirus
infections per capita and higher death rates. (Low-income countries were
excluded from the analysis because of unreliable Covid-19 reporting data
and generally poor medical systems.)

“You can make a new vaccine,” Dr. Faustman said. “We’re really smart,
and we can do that. But it’s two years off, and two years is going to be
two years too late.”

“If we’ve got something generic globally at hand that we can use to make
the human host stronger, this is a win-win for the public right away.”
