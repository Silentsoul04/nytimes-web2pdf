# Gita Ramjee, a Leading AIDS Researcher, Dies at 63

</div>

Working in South Africa, she led studies and drug trials, hoping to
overcome not only H.I.V. but also cultural barriers to stopping its
spread. She died of the coronavirus.

*This obituary is part of a series about* [*people who have died in the
coronavirus
pandemic*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

After earning a Ph.D. at the University of Natal in Durban, South
Africa, in 1994 while raising two young children, Gita Ramjee was
exhausted.

Her thesis had been on kidney diseases in children — she had worked in a
pediatrics ward at a local hospital — but she took a job on a small
research project in a different field, since it promised a less frantic
pace. It was a life-changing choice.

The research involved whether a vaginal microbicide was useful against
AIDS, which was rampant in South Africa. The research put her in contact
with sex workers, who told chilling stories of economic hardship,
high-risk behavior and men who were indifferent to using protection.

“It opened my eyes,” Dr. Ramjee [told The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/may/08/research.science)
in 2007.

“That’s when I knew I wanted to be involved in the prevention of H.I.V.
infection in women,” she added.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Ramjee became a leading researcher on the AIDS epidemic. On Tuesday
another epidemic claimed her: She died of Covid-19, the disease caused
by the coronavirus, at a Durban hospital. She had become ill shortly
after returning from a visit to her sons in London, local news accounts
said. She was 63.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Ramjee was chief scientific officer at the Aurum Institute in
Johannesburg, which battles AIDS and tuberculosis and [announced her
death](https://www.auruminstitute.org/about-aurum/news-updates/aurum-news/125-the-aurum-institute-saddened-by-the-death-of-professor-gita-ramjee)
on its website. She had previously been director of the H.I.V.
prevention unit at the South African Medical Research Council.

Those jobs put her at the forefront of the effort to contain AIDS,
especially in eastern and southern Africa, which has long had the
[highest
rate](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/overview)of
H.I.V. infection in the world.

Gita Parekh was born on April 8, 1956, in Kampala, Uganda, to Dhirajlal
and Nirmala Parekh. After Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator, forced Asians
to leave that country, Dr. Ramjee finished high school in India, where
her family was from, and then earned a bachelor’s degree at the
University of Sunderland in England. There she met her future husband,
Pravin Ramjee, a South African of Indian descent, and they settled in
South Africa in the early 1980s.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After joining the research council in 1996 she rose through the ranks,
administering studies and drug trials, with a particular focus on
helping women avoid AIDS.

“Gita was fundamental and inextricably linked to the endeavors to find
solutions to prevent H.I.V. in women,” Glenda Gray, president and chief
executive of the council, [said in a
statement](https://www.samrc.ac.za/media-release/samrc-mourns-loss-eminent-scientist-prof-gita-ramjee)
on the organization’s website.

Especially in places like southern Africa, that effort remains urgent.
Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, a global organization
working on the issue, called Dr. Ramjee’s death “a huge loss at a time
when the world needs her most.”

In addition to her husband, Dr. Ramjee is survived by two sons, Shaniel
and Rushil Ramjee; a brother, Atul Parekh; and three sisters, Rita
Kalan, Asmita Parashar and Reshma Parekh.

Dr. Ramjee recognized early on that the response to AIDS could not be
simplistic, and that the key was finding ways to give women control in
cultures and communities that did not always encourage that.
Policymakers, she knew, needed to understand that the ABC approach, as
it was often called — “abstinence,” “be faithful” and “condoms” — was
not enough, a point she made at the annual International AIDS Conference
in 2006.

“I would like to believe H.I.V. prevention will be more than ABC,” she
told the conference. The room burst into
applause.
