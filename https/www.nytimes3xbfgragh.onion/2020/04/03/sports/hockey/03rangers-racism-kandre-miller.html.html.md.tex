After the chat, the Rangers and the N.H.L. condemned the repeated use of
a slur by a hacker.

K'Andre Miller, a top prospect for the Rangers, was repeatedly subjected
to a racial slur when a team-sponsored online video chat was hacked on
Friday.

Miller, who is African-American, appeared on the videoconferencing app
Zoom, which allowed questions from fans. The N.H.L. has been shut down
since March 12 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Miller, 20, was chosen 22nd over all by the Rangers in the 2018 draft,
and he has played the past two seasons for the University of Wisconsin.
The 6-foot-4 defenseman, a native of St. Paul, Minn., signed an
entry-level contract with the Rangers last month.

During the question-and-answer session, the slur was repeatedly typed
out on the chat screen. In statements issued later, the Rangers and the
N.H.L. condemned the hacker's comments, and the team said it was
investigating the matter.

``We held an online video chat with fans and New York Rangers prospect
K'Andre Miller, during which a vile individual hijacked the chat to post
racial slurs, which we disabled as soon as possible,'' the Rangers said
\href{https://twitter.com/NYRangers/status/1246217625748697089?s=20}{on
Twitter}. ``We were incredibly appalled by this behavior, which has no
place online, on the ice, or anywhere.''

\href{https://twitter.com/usahockey/status/1246238904103002112?s=20}{U.S.A.
Hockey also tweeted} in support of Miller, calling him ``an incredible
leader, teammate, friend \& person. Racial \& derogatory slurs have
absolutely no place in the game or society.'' And at least three Rangers
--- Jacob Trouba, Ryan Strome and Tony DeAngelo --- expressed similar
sentiments online.

``I look forward to having you as a teammate,''
\href{https://twitter.com/JacobTrouba/status/1246239327618764803?s=20}{Trouba
wrote}.

Communication via Zoom and other teleconferencing methods --- which have
replaced face-to-face contact amid the coronavirus surge ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/technology/zoom-harassment-abuse-racism-fbi-warning.html}{has
led to many other incidents of abusive hacking}that are garnering
attention from the F.B.I.
