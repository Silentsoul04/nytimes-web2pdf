# He Needs Jobless Benefits. He Was Told to Find a Fax Machine.

Thousands of newly unemployed New Yorkers desperate to stay afloat are
being frustrated by the state’s 1970s-era technology.

Mohammed Saiful Islam got a taste of how antiquated the technology that
runs New York State’s unemployment-insurance system is when he had to go
to a Staples store in the middle of a pandemic to fax his pay stubs to
Albany.

Mr. Islam, a Lyft driver who lives in Queens and has been idled by the
outbreak, is among more than 450,000 New Yorkers who have tried, often
in vain, to apply for
[unemployment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/us/california-unemployment-edd-coronavirus.html)
benefits in the past three weeks.

As he and many others discovered, the state’s archaic systems were
woefully unprepared for the deluge of claims. In Mr. Islam’s case, he
said it took him four days to reach someone who could explain what he
had to do to complete the application process.

State officials admitted as recently as last summer that there were
problems with the technology used for such applications, describing New
York’s unemployment-insurance systems as relics from the heyday of
mainframe computers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The software programs that run the systems were “written in the 1970s
and 1980s and remain constrained by the technology of that era,”
officials wrote while seeking bids as part of a planned modernization
project.

In March, when hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs had suddenly
evaporated started trying to log onto the Labor Department website or
call its phone lines, the systems failed.

Would-be applicants’ frustration grew as their computer screens froze
repeatedly and their calls went unanswered for days. Some attempts to
apply for benefits yielded a pop-up message that suggested using
Netscape, a browser that effectively no longer exists.

Mr. Islam, who had never applied for jobless benefits in the 35 years
since he immigrated from Bangladesh, said he was taken aback to hear
that he had to find a fax machine to complete his claim.

But he put on a face mask and gloves and warily trudged off to a Staples
store. Late this week, he was still waiting to hear how much he would
receive, and when.

children.

New York’s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, acknowledged the problems with the
unemployment-claims process on Tuesday.

“I apologize for the pain,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference. “It
must be infuriating to deal with.”

The Labor Department, he said, had received 1.2 million calls the day
before, after getting more than seven million calls last week. But the
state reported just 80,000 claims for the week that ended March 20 and
just 370,000 last week, far fewer than either California and
Pennsylvania reported.

“The staff at the Department of Labor are killing themselves to try to
deal with this situation,” said Richard Blum, a lawyer with the Legal
Aid Society who advocates for worker protections and benefits. “But the
problems that they and applicants are facing are the results of
long-term disinvestment in the system.”

Department officials did not respond to repeated inquiries about the
computer systems.

New York is not the only state having trouble handling the tidal wave of
unemployment claims.

On Thursday, the executive director of Florida’s Department of Economic
Opportunity publicly
[apologized](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/04/02/i-apologize-for-floridas-unemployment-website-fiasco-director-says/)
after the state’s unemployment website failed. Auditors had warned the
governor, Ron DeSantis,
about[problems](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/03/31/ron-desantis-was-warned-about-floridas-broken-unemployment-website-last-year-audit-shows/)
with the website last year.

Connecticut has a backlog that could take five weeks to process because
its computer system is also at least 40 years old, said Nancy Steffens,
a spokeswoman for the state’s Labor Department.

Ms. Steffens said that Connecticut has had to resort to recruiting
retirees who knew how to program in COBOL, a nearly extinct computer
language. Connecticut and four other states are involved in a joint
project meant to overhaul their systems but it will not be finished
before next year, she said.

New York is not part of that effort. Instead, in 2017, the state sought
bids for a “solution” to its unemployment-insurance system. Last year,
it
[awarded](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/july19/070119.htm)
a $56 million, five-year contract for that solution to Tata Consultancy
Services, which is based in Mumbai.

In a subsequent solicitation last July, the state used similar wording
to describe its “outdated and expensive mainframe-based” systems,
suggesting that the modernization effort would take more time.

The repeated crashing of New York’s online application system was a
relatively minor setback for Elizabeth Lucia, considering what she has
been through lately. Ms. Lucia, who is 30 and several months pregnant,
lost two jobs on the same night last month.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“I already have a medical bill in the mail for $1,100 that I’m trying to
figure out what to do with,” she said, adding that “getting unemployment
would be a matter of sinking or swimming.”

Navigating the Labor Department’s overloaded system has been a challenge
even for tech-savvy applicants like Eric Saari, who said he had once
designed mobile apps for IBM.

Mr. Saari, 50, said he worried that he might become homeless if he was
unable to get unemployment benefits. He had been driving a taxi in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., until early March when a visibly ill passenger
wearing a mask said he might have the virus.

Mr. Saari quit driving after that and said he was down to his last
several hundred dollars, which he needed to buy food for the next month.
He has tried seven different websites and the phone numbers of at least
three government agencies to try to get help filing a claim, he said.

“Right now,” he said, “it’s unfortunately impossible, as far as I can
tell.”

Congress has promised those who are now unemployed especially generous
benefits for the next few months: $600 a week through July, on top of
what they would typically get from their home states.

But New York residents stand to collect less than recipients in nearby
states. The maximum weekly benefit in New York is $504 a week, compared
with

in Connecticut,
[$713](https://www.nj.gov/labor/lwdhome/press/2019/20200113_benefitrates.shtml)
in New Jersey and
[$823](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/how-your-unemployment-benefits-are-determined#calculating-your-maximum-benefit-credit-)
in Massachusetts.

“New York’s benefits system is unusually stingy,” said Paul K. Sonn, the
state policy program director at the National Employment Law Project,
which advocates for low-wage workers. Despite the state’s progressive
image, Mr. Sonn said, “New York is not a leading state in providing
economic security for jobless workers.”

But the $2 trillion stimulus package that Congress approved has made far
more people eligible for unemployment benefits, including artists and
other freelancers, said Nicole Salk, senior staff attorney at Legal
Services N.Y.C.

She said she had been counseling some people about how to apply for
benefits and avoid pitfalls in the process.

New York, she added, also had a distinctly punitive approach when
calculating benefits for part-time workers that withholds 25 percent of
what they receive in a week for each day they work, no matter how many
hours they put in.

That means that if an unemployed actress spent just an hour or two a day
three days a week delivering groceries for a service like Instacart, she
would forfeit 75 percent of her weekly check.

The rule, which is inconsistent with how other states handle part-time
work, gives unemployed New Yorkers a strong incentive to remain idle
while they collect benefits, Ms. Salk said.

Legislation to change the rule appeared to have the support of Mr. Cuomo
and legislative leaders last year, she said, but no bill was ever signed
into law.

Mr. Blum said he was told why: The Labor Department’s primitive
computers could not be reprogrammed quickly enough to make the
adjustment.
