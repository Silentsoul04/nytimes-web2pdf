Children make up a very small proportion of American coronavirus cases
so far and are significantly less likely to become seriously ill than
American adults, according to a preliminary report on the first wave of
coronavirus cases in the United States. But some have become [very
sick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-children-icu.html),
and at least three have died.

The
[study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e4.htm?s_cid=mm6914e4_w),
published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also
reported that
[children](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html)
appear less likely than adults to develop any of the major known
coronavirus symptoms: fever, cough or shortness of breath. That could
suggest that many children have mild or undetected cases of the disease
and could be spreading the virus to others in their families and
communities.

“We don’t think many kids get severe disease, so are kids transmitting
the disease at a significant rate that’s going to propagate this
outbreak?” asked Dr. Srinivas Murthy, an associate professor of
pediatrics at the University of British Columbia, who was not involved
in the study. The answer to that question, he said, will be important in
deciding how to manage the pandemic, when to reopen schools and how to
predict future waves of infection.

The C.D.C. study said that 2,572 of the nearly 150,000 confirmed
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/nyregion/child-dead-new-virus-kawasaki.html)
cases reported in the United States between Feb. 12 and April 2 were
[patients
under 18](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html).
Their median age was 11. Those cases included 850 from New York City,
the current epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, 584 from the
rest of New York State and 393 from New Jersey.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There were some significant gaps in the data. The researchers said that
important information — like whether the patients went to the hospital
or what, if any, symptoms they had — was not available for many of the
cases in the study. State and local health departments, many of which
have been overwhelmed by the fast-moving pandemic, may be able to
provide more data in the future, the report
said.

Of the 745 cases with data on whether the child was hospitalized, 147
children — about a fifth — were reported to have been hospitalized.
Among adults that rate is about a third, the report said.

Forty percent of pediatric hospitalizations, or 59 cases, were for
babies under 1. Five of the 15 children admitted to intensive care were
babies. Children with underlying health conditions also appeared to have
a greater risk of hospitalization, the report said.

“Compared to other respiratory diseases, this is incredibly unique in
the proportion of severely ill children,” Dr. Murthy said. “We would
expect more hospitalization based on the number of kids that might get
infected, and we’re not seeing that at all. And we still don’t know
why.”

Also, because many of the cases occurred very recently, shortly before
the publication of the report, the researchers said their analysis
“might underestimate severity of disease or symptoms that manifested
later in the course of illness.”

Despite the gaps in the data, experts said the report, which is believed
to be the largest study to date of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in
children, could provide a useful early snapshot of general
trends.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days

Scientists are exploring several theories about why children seem
relatively protected from severe disease. A leading idea is that a
receptor in human cells that the viral particles bind to, called the
[ACE2 receptor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167747), is not
expressed as prominently in young children or might be a different
shape. If so, in children, the virus might have more difficulty
attaching to and entering cells, a step that is necessary for the virus
to replicate and spread throughout the body.

Another theory is that children’s immune systems do not respond as
aggressively to the virus as adult immune systems do, a process that can
spiral out of control and cause as much damage as the infection.

“I’m getting more convinced that there’s a physiological age-based
reason rather than children are just healthy,” Dr. Murthy said.

The U.S. data echoes many of the findings in reports on pediatric cases
in China, where the global outbreak began, but differences in China’s
testing methodology make it difficult to compare results. One [study of
about 1,400 children
under 16](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2005073) in China
found that fewer than half had coughs and only 42 percent had fevers, a
much lower symptom rate than in adult patients.

In the American study, researchers had information about symptoms for
291 children. Of those, 73 percent had fever, cough or shortness of
breath, compared with 93 percent of adult patients age 18 to 64.

The [largest study to date of Chinese
children](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf),
found that nearly 6 percent of the 2,143 confirmed or suspected cases of
patients under 18 developed a severe or critical illness, and one
14-year-old boy with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus died. More
than 60 percent of the 125 children who became severely or critically
ill were age 5 or younger, the study reported. And 40 of those were
infants less than 12 months old.

The U.S. study also found that 57 percent of the reported cases were in
boys, a gender pattern that has been seen in some adult studies.
