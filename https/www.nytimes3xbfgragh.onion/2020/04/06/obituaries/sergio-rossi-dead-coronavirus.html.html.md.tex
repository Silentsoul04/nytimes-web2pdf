\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

As a teenager, Sergio Rossi and his brother, the sons of a bespoke
shoemaker, would travel up and down the Italian Riviera selling shoes in
the years after World War II, as the country was rebuilding.

Mr. Rossi fully joined the family business in the 1950s and by 1968 had
introduced a namesake line, becoming one of the first major figures in
the Italian footwear industry

Mr. Rossi died on Thursday in Cesena, Italy at 84. The cause was the
coronavirus, a spokeswoman for the company that carries his name said.

Mr. Rossi was part of the generation of Italian artisans who emerged
after World War II determined to take the country's expertise in
leatherwork and accessories from local family businesses to the world.

He was known for his perfectly balanced, albeit often spindly, heels as
well as styles like the Opanca sandal, with a sole that curved up the
sides to blend in with the foot, and his signature
\href{https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/sergio-rossi-godiva-stiletto-pumps-item-12546784.aspx}{Godiva
stiletto},

He was also among the first footwear specialists to lend his talents to
ready-to-wear designers, collaborating with names like Versace and Dolce
\& Gabbana to create the footwear for their collections. Each Sergio
Rossi shoe was famous for requiring 120 steps and 14 hours to make.

In a
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/lucianagarbugliasindaco/videos/1111139359247799/?q=Luciana\%20Garbuglia}{video
post} on Facebook on Friday, Mayor Luciana Garbuglia of San Mauro
Pascoli, an Italian shoemaking center near Cesena on the Adriatic coast,
where Mr. Rossi was born and lived, noted that Mr. Rossi had opened a
production facility in the town in 1951 that has became a major source
of jobs.

Mr. Rossi was born in 1935 and learned his trade from his father.

As a major designer, he reached global prominence in the 1970s in part
through his work with the upstart designer Gianni Versace. The way Mr.
Rossi's sensuous heels complemented Mr. Versace's clothes elevated shoes
to an integral part of a look, as opposed to an afterthought.

Mr. Rossi, who opened his first store in San Mauro in 1980, also worked
with Dolce \& Gabbana and Azzedine Alaïa in the 1980s and '90s. Over the
next two decades he continued to expand in Europe and America, and his
son, Gianvito, came to work at his side.

In 1999, during the flurry of consolidation among fashion brands that
laid the groundwork for the modern luxury industry, Gucci Group (later
Kering) \href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB942941056103661531}{bought
the Sergio Rossi brand} for approximately \$96.2 million; Mr. Rossi
remained as chairman and design director, though both he and his son
later left the business. His son now has
\href{https://www.gianvitorossi.com/us_en/}{his own line under his
name}.

Kering\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/12/10/business/dealbook/kering-sergio-rossi-investindustrial.html}{sold
the Rossi brand in 2015} to the private equity company Investindustrial,
which relaunched Sergio Rossi the following year.

``He loved women and was able to capture a woman's femininity in a
unique way, creating the perfect extension of a woman's leg through his
shoes,'' \href{https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hPwEKo0ug/}{Riccardo
Sciutto}, the shoe company's chief executive, said of Mr. Rossi in an
Instagram post.

The company has preserved his legacy with an
\href{https://aeworld.com/fashion/sergio-rossi-launches-a-new-project-that-celebrates-its-heritage/}{archive
of sketches and documents in their San Mauro facility}, along with
shoes, lasts and other accessories. Thus far, it has 6,000 items.
