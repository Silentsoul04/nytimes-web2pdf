SAN FRANCISCO — Airbnb said on Monday that it had [raised $1 billion in
new
funding](https://news.airbnb.com/silver-lake-sixth-street-partners-invest-1-billion-in-airbnb/)
as it grapples with devastation from the coronavirus pandemic, and as
some technology start-ups take extra measures to stockpile cash during
the outbreak.

The private equity giant Silver Lake and the investment firm Sixth
Street Partners led the investment, which was a mixture of equity and
debt. Airbnb, a home rental start-up that was previously valued at as
much as $31 billion, also lowered its internal valuation to $26 billion
last month, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who
declined to be identified because the information was confidential.

“The new resources will support Airbnb’s ongoing work to invest over the
long term in its community of hosts who share their homes and
experiences,” the company said in a statement.

Airbnb’s business has been hobbled during a shutdown in global travel
caused by the spread of the coronavirus. It is a delicate time for the
company, one of the largest and most prominent start-ups to emerge from
Silicon Valley in the last decade. Airbnb had said that it plans to go
public this year. But that may be in limbo because of stock market
volatility and uncertainty caused by the virus.

Airbnb’s new funding points to some of the tactical measures start-ups
are taking as they navigate the difficult period. In the last month,
numerous start-ups have laid off or furloughed staff, and cut spending
and expansion plans in moves that [signal the end of a long-running
boom](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/technology/virus-start-ups-pummeled-layoffs-unwinding.html)for
the industry. Well-funded travel start-ups, including Sonder, Lyric and
TripActions, have been hit especially
hard.

Airbnb, too, enacted a hiring freeze, slashed its $800 million marketing
budget and cut the pay of its top executives last month. The company
raised more money even though it has $3 billion in cash on its balance
sheet and access to a $1 billion line of credit.

A company spokesman declined to comment on what the new funding meant
for an I.P.O. Airbnb is under pressure to go public before some of its
early employees’ shares [begin to
expire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/20/technology/airbnb-employees-ipo-payouts.html)
later this year.

The difficulties Airbnb is facing have become increasingly apparent over
the past few weeks. The company has contended with frustrated customers
who demanded refunds for canceled trips, while also trying to find ways
to support its “hosts,” the people who rent their homes on its site.

Many of its hosts [have had their bookings drop to
zero](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/technology/airbnb-hosts-coronavirus.html)
over the past few months. The financial struggles of short-term-rental
operators have manifested themselves in online petitions and threats of
lawsuits against the company.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On March 30, Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s chief executive, held a video call
with the company’s hosts and said the past few weeks had been a “wake-up
call.” He announced a $250 million fund to compensate hosts for a
portion of their booking cancellations, as well as a $10 million pool of
grant money for its “Superhosts,” paid for by Airbnb’s founders and
employees.

“I’m sorry we didn’t consult you as partners,” Mr. Chesky said on the
call.

In its funding announcement, Airbnb said it would now focus on travel
that’s closer to home and long-term stays, including students and people
on extended work assignments.

“The desire to connect and travel is an enduring human truth that’s only
been reinforced during our time apart,” Mr. Chesky said in a statement
on Monday. He added that, practically speaking, the way we connect and
travel “will evolve as the world changes.”

Last month, Airbnb began fielding new and unsolicited funding offers
from venture capital firms, private equity firms and sovereign wealth
funds, a person familiar with the situation said at the time. Offers
ranged from $100 million to $1 billion, the person said.

Private equity firms like Silver Lake are sitting on large reserves of
cash. Many of [the firms said they saw investment opportunity as
American businesses
struggle](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/business/private-equity-hedge-funds-coronavirus.html).

In a statement, Egon Durban, co-chief executive of Silver Lake, said
Airbnb was well positioned to thrive when the world recovers from the
virus.

“While the current environment is clearly a difficult one for the
hospitality industry, the desire to travel and have authentic
experiences is fundamental and enduring,” he said.
