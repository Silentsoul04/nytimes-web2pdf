The home rental company raised new funding as its business has been
roiled by the coronavirus.

SAN FRANCISCO --- Airbnb said on Monday that it had
\href{https://news.airbnb.com/silver-lake-sixth-street-partners-invest-1-billion-in-airbnb/}{raised
\$1 billion in new funding} as it grapples with devastation from the
coronavirus pandemic, and as some technology start-ups take extra
measures to stockpile cash during the outbreak.

The private equity giant Silver Lake and the investment firm Sixth
Street Partners led the investment, which was a mixture of equity and
debt. Airbnb, a home rental start-up that was previously valued at as
much as \$31 billion, also lowered its internal valuation to \$26
billion last month, according to a person with knowledge of the
situation who declined to be identified because the information was
confidential.

``The new resources will support Airbnb's ongoing work to invest over
the long term in its community of hosts who share their homes and
experiences,'' the company said in a statement.

Airbnb's business has been hobbled during a shutdown in global travel
caused by the spread of the coronavirus. It is a delicate time for the
company, one of the largest and most prominent start-ups to emerge from
Silicon Valley in the last decade. Airbnb had said that it plans to go
public this year. But that may be in limbo because of stock market
volatility and uncertainty caused by the virus.

Airbnb's new funding points to some of the tactical measures start-ups
are taking as they navigate the difficult period. In the last month,
numerous start-ups have laid off or furloughed staff, and cut spending
and expansion plans in moves that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/technology/virus-start-ups-pummeled-layoffs-unwinding.html}{signal
the end of a long-running boom}for the industry. Well-funded travel
start-ups, including Sonder, Lyric and TripActions, have been hit
especially hard.

Airbnb, too, enacted a hiring freeze, slashed its \$800 million
marketing budget and cut the pay of its top executives last month. The
company raised more money even though it has \$3 billion in cash on its
balance sheet and access to a \$1 billion line of credit.

A company spokesman declined to comment on what the new funding meant
for an I.P.O. Airbnb is under pressure to go public before some of its
early employees' shares
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/20/technology/airbnb-employees-ipo-payouts.html}{begin
to expire} later this year.

The difficulties Airbnb is facing have become increasingly apparent over
the past few weeks. The company has contended with frustrated customers
who demanded refunds for canceled trips, while also trying to find ways
to support its ``hosts,'' the people who rent their homes on its site.

Many of its hosts
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/technology/airbnb-hosts-coronavirus.html}{have
had their bookings drop to zero} over the past few months. The financial
struggles of short-term-rental operators have manifested themselves in
online petitions and threats of lawsuits against the company.

On March 30, Brian Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive, held a video call
with the company's hosts and said the past few weeks had been a
``wake-up call.'' He announced a \$250 million fund to compensate hosts
for a portion of their booking cancellations, as well as a \$10 million
pool of grant money for its ``Superhosts,'' paid for by Airbnb's
founders and employees.

``I'm sorry we didn't consult you as partners,'' Mr. Chesky said on the
call.

In its funding announcement, Airbnb said it would now focus on travel
that's closer to home and long-term stays, including students and people
on extended work assignments.

``The desire to connect and travel is an enduring human truth that's
only been reinforced during our time apart,'' Mr. Chesky said in a
statement on Monday. He added that, practically speaking, the way we
connect and travel ``will evolve as the world changes.''

Last month, Airbnb began fielding new and unsolicited funding offers
from venture capital firms, private equity firms and sovereign wealth
funds, a person familiar with the situation said at the time. Offers
ranged from \$100 million to \$1 billion, the person said.

Private equity firms like Silver Lake are sitting on large reserves of
cash. Many of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/business/private-equity-hedge-funds-coronavirus.html}{the
firms said they saw investment opportunity as American businesses
struggle}.

In a statement, Egon Durban, co-chief executive of Silver Lake, said
Airbnb was well positioned to thrive when the world recovers from the
virus.

``While the current environment is clearly a difficult one for the
hospitality industry, the desire to travel and have authentic
experiences is fundamental and enduring,'' he said.
