*This obituary is part of a series about* [*people who have died in the
coronavirus
pandemic*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

In recent years, Albert Petrocelli was known in Staten Island’s Huguenot
section as that nice man with the rosary beads and the bountiful garden.
He walked the local streets, rosary in hand, offering to say prayers for
those who could use them: a neighbor, a crossing guard, anyone.

But Mr. Petrocelli, who died at 73 of the novel coronavirus on April 1,
was more than a retiree with beads and time on his hands. He served in
Vietnam. He served as a New York Fire Department battalion chief. He
lost a son in the World Trade Center attacks.

Most of all, his wife, Ginger Petrocelli, said, “He was a good guy.”

Mr. Petrocelli was born on Feb. 21, 1947, to Peter Petrocelli, a postal
worker, and Mary (Capece) Petrocelli, who ran the household. The family
lived first on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and then in Bay Ridge,
Brooklyn, where he attended William E. Grady High School and planned on
becoming an electrician.

When he was still in high school, Albert met an Irish-American girl,
Ginger Walsh, at a sweet shop in Bay Ridge, and they began to date.
After high school, and with the Army about to send him overseas, they
married in a hurry — on March 18, 1967, the day between the
Irish-centric St. Patrick’s Day and the Italian-centric St. Joseph’s
Day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Petrocelli came home from the war a year later, and before long the
couple had two boys. He enjoyed a long career with the Fire Department,
retiring as a battalion chief in Brooklyn. The sons — Albert Jr., a
firefighter, and Mark, a commodities broker — both married and settled
in Staten Island.

“Everything was like … ,” Mr. Petrocelli once said, and Mrs. Petrocelli
finished the thought: [“The way it should
be.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/09/10/nyregion/about-new-york-for-one-9-11-family-five-waves-of-grief.html?searchResultPosition=2)

On Sept. 11, 2001, Mark was on the 92nd floor of the north tower when
the first plane hit. His father and older brother rushed to Lower
Manhattan, determined to find him. But his father’s can-do attitude,
forged by war and fire, could not overcome what they found, and could
not find. Mark Petrocelli was 28.

Things were not as they should have been, but the Petrocellis endured.
They set up a memorial in their yard. They doted on their two
granddaughters, Emily and Lily. They celebrated their 50th anniversary
in style.

They also managed to have a brief moment with Pope Francis during the
pontiff’s New York visit in 2015. While attending a ceremony at the
National September 11 Memorial and Museum, Mr. Petrocelli held out his
firefighter’s hat, which contained some rosaries and prayer cards, and
asked the pope to bless them in Mark’s memory.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The pope smiled and blessed everything he had,” Mrs. Petrocelli
recalled.

Mr. Petrocelli walked nearly every morning to 7:30 Mass at St. Joseph
by-the-Sea High School. He walked everywhere, in fact, holding his
rosary beads of green Connemara marble — that is, when he wasn’t
nurturing his garden’s fruits and vegetables, which he would often give
away. Sometimes he gave away the entire plant.

He began to feel uncharacteristically fatigued in mid-March, declined
over the next two weeks, and died at Staten Island Hospital’s south
campus. In addition to his wife and son, Mr. Petrocelli is survived by
two granddaughters.

“When Mark was killed, I was devastated,” Mrs. Petrocelli said, voice
breaking. “But I had Albie. We did it together.”

A week after his death, his wife was continuing to receive messages from
the many people her husband had touched.

*I have his strawberry plants*, they say. *I have his fig
trees*.
