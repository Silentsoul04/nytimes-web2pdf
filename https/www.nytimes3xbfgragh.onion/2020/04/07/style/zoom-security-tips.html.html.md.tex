As Zoom's user base has grown in recent weeks, reports of
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/style/zoombombing-zoom-trolling.html}{Zoombombing},''
or ``Zoom raiding,'' have spread across the internet.

Public school classes, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, yoga sessions and
other virtual gatherings have been derailed by participants. Some of the
these Zoombombers have been students, frustrated by online schooling and
eager to escape the virtual classroom by any means. Others have
weaponized the platform's security flaws to harass specific populations
using
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/technology/zoom-harassment-abuse-racism-fbi-warning.html}{racial
slurs, sexist remarks and pornography}.

It's nearly impossible to prevent these attacks, especially when an
event is public by design (such as an A.A. meeting, or an open lecture).
But there are a few steps you can take to make your meeting more secure.

\hypertarget{dont-share-your-zoom-link-or-code-on-social-media}{%
\subsection{Don't share your Zoom link or code on social
media}\label{dont-share-your-zoom-link-or-code-on-social-media}}

The easiest way to avoid getting Zoombombed is to keep your event
private and your invite list small. If you are creating an event for a
large, public audience, do not share your meeting link directly on
social media. Instead, publicize an R.S.V.P. email address where people
can state their interest in attending the event. That way, you can vet
the list of prospective attendees and share the event link with only
those whom you choose.

\hypertarget{set-a-meeting-password}{%
\subsection{Set a meeting password}\label{set-a-meeting-password}}

A meeting password --- which is automatically generated by Zoom --- will
prevent uninvited users being able to join your event, even if they have
the meeting link. Unfortunately, many Zoombombers swap and obtain
meeting codes on social media. Be careful with where you share your
meeting code, and if you can, wait to send it out until shortly before
the event begins.

\hypertarget{create-a-waiting-room}{%
\subsection{Create a waiting room}\label{create-a-waiting-room}}

A waiting room gives the meeting owner the ability to put everyone
seeking to join the meeting in a virtual holding area. The host can then
select only those whom they have invited to the meeting. Sometimes
Zoombombers will use familiar names, so be careful to confirm the
person's identity by asking them to turn their camera on.

\hypertarget{set-screen-sharing-to-host-only}{%
\subsection{Set screen sharing to ``host
only''}\label{set-screen-sharing-to-host-only}}

One popular way Zoombombers hijack a meeting is through the app's screen
sharing function. When screen sharing privileges are set to ``all,'' any
member who joins a meeting could project offensive imagery to meeting's
participants.

how to keep screen sharing privileges limited here}}\emph{.}

\hypertarget{turn-off-the-annotation-feature}{%
\subsection{Turn off the annotation
feature}\label{turn-off-the-annotation-feature}}

Even if you limit screen sharing, trolls may draw offensive words or
shapes over the host's presentation using the annotation tool, which
gives users the ability to draw onscreen in different colors using a
cursor.

\hypertarget{restrict-other-features-as-needed-in-host-controls}{%
\subsection{Restrict other features as needed in host
controls}\label{restrict-other-features-as-needed-in-host-controls}}

Zoombombers will leverage every feature they can to ruin a meeting. For
some meetings it might make sense to
\href{https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004809306-Controlling-and-Disabling-In-Meeting-Chat}{block
private chats},
\href{https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362603-Host-and-Co-Host-Controls-in-a-Meeting}{turn
off file transfers and restrict custom backgrounds}, all of which could
be used to taunt or harass participants.

\hypertarget{disable-allow-removed-participants-to-rejoin}{%
\subsection{Disable ``allow removed participants to
rejoin''}\label{disable-allow-removed-participants-to-rejoin}}

Trolls can be persistent. One way to thwart their efforts is by
preventing them from rejoining. Unfortunately some attacks are
coordinated, so there may still be other bad actors in your meeting, but
at least you'll be one down.

Zoom}\label{make-sure-youre-running-the-latest-version-of-zoom}}

Zoom recently announced that it would be

all engineering resources} to combating harassment and improving
security features in order to better protect users. ``We are making sure
if we get issues in terms of security, we update the client right
away,'' said Oded Gal, Zoom's chief product officer. ``That's why it's
important to update.'' ****
