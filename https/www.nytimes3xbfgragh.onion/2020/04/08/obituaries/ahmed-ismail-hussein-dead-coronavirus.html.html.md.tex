\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Ahmed Ismail Hussein, whose sweet-stringed and melancholic melodies
captivated generations of Somalis and made him one of Somalia's most
important musicians, died on Tuesday in London. He was 91.

He had been infected by the novel coronavirus,
\href{https://twitter.com/KaydSomaliArts/status/1247758234149990400}{according
to} Hanna Ali, the artistic director of \href{http://www.kayd.org/}{Kayd
Somali Arts and Culture}, based in London, with which Mr. Hussein had
been affiliated in recent years.

Mr. Hussein was famous for playing the oud, the pear-shaped lutelike
instrument that is central to Arab and Middle Eastern music.

``The oud is my greatest pleasure,'' he
\href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/world/onyourstreet/mshudeydi.shtml}{told
a BBC interviewer} in 2003. ``If there's an oud lying near me, I've just
got to play it.''

He moved between Somalia, Djibouti and Britain over the course of his
recording and performing career. His music was influential in defining
and popularizing the traditional Somali style known as qaraami, which
involves a singer or a poet backed by the oud or drum.

Mr. Hussein was born on April 15, 1928, in the coastal town of Berbera
in northwestern Somalia. He spent his childhood and teenage years in the
Yemeni city of Aden, where his father worked as a police sergeant.

Mr. Hussein said he fell in love with the oud at 14 when he saw a man
playing one there. He later apprenticed with the prominent Somali
musician and poet Abdullahi Qarshe.

His nickname, Hudeydi, came from his grandfather, who sailed boats to
the Red Sea port of Hodeidah in Yemen.

Information on survivors was not immediately available.

Mr. Hussein, keen on preserving and passing on musical tradition,
started offering oud lessons at his apartment in London in recent years,
Ms. Ali said.

His music and legacy were crucial to Somalis wherever they lived in the
world, said the British-Somali novelist Nadifa Mohamed, who began
studying the oud with Mr. Hussein in 2012. ``His place in our cultural
pantheon is fixed.''
