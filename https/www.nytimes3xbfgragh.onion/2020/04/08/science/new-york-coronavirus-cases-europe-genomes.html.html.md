New research indicates that the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/coronavirus-neanderthals.html)
began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before
the first confirmed case, and that travelers brought in the virus mainly
from Europe, not Asia.

“The majority is clearly European,” said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a
[study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20056929v1)
awaiting peer review.

A separate team at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine came to strikingly
similar conclusions, despite studying a different group of cases. Both
teams analyzed genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers
starting in mid-March.

The research revealed a previously hidden spread of the virus that might
have been detected if aggressive testing programs had been put in place.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

On Jan. 31, President Trump barred foreign nationals from entering the
country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks.

It would not be until late February that Italy would begin locking down
towns and cities, and March 11 when Mr. Trump said he would block
travelers from most European countries. But [New Yorkers had already
been traveling home with the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/health/coronavirus-travel-ban.html).

“People were just oblivious,” said Adriana Heguy, a member of the N.Y.U.
team.

Dr. Heguy and Dr. van Bakel belong to an international guild of viral
historians. They ferret out the history of outbreaks by poring over
clues embedded in the genetic material of viruses taken from thousands
of patients.

Viruses invade a cell and take over its molecular machinery, causing it
to make new viruses.

The process is quick and sloppy. As a result, new viruses can gain a new
mutation that wasn’t present in their ancestor. If a new virus manages
to escape its host and infect other people, its descendants will inherit
that mutation.

Tracking viral mutations demands sequencing all the genetic material in
a virus — its genome. Once researchers have gathered the genomes from a
number of virus samples, they can compare their mutations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sophisticated computer programs can then figure out how all of those
mutations arose as viruses descended from a common ancestor. If they get
enough data, they can make rough estimates about how long ago those
ancestors lived. That’s because mutations arise at a roughly regular
pace, like a molecular clock.

Maciej Boni of Penn State University and his colleagues recently used
this method to see where the coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, came
from in the first place. While conspiracy theories might falsely claim
the virus was concocted in a lab, the virus’s genome makes clear that it
[arose in
bats](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008v1).

There are many kinds of coronaviruses, which infect both humans and
animals. Dr. Boni and his colleagues found that the genome of the new
virus contains a number of mutations in common with strains of
coronaviruses that infect
bats.

The most closely related coronavirus is in a Chinese horseshoe bat, the
researchers found. But the new virus has gained some unique mutations
since splitting off from that bat virus decades ago.

Dr. Boni said that ancestral virus probably gave rise to a number of
strains that infected horseshoe bats, and perhaps sometimes other
animals.

“Very likely there’s a vast unsampled diversity,” he said.

Copying mistakes aren’t the only way for new viruses to arise. Sometimes
two kinds of coronaviruses will infect the same cell. Their genetic
material gets mixed up in new viruses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s entirely possible, Dr. Boni said, in the past 10 or 20 years, a
hybrid virus arose in some horseshoe bat that was well-suited to infect
humans, too. Later, that virus somehow managed to cross the species
barrier.

“Once in a while, one of these viruses wins the lottery,” he said.

In January, a team of Chinese and Australian researchers published the
first genome of the new virus. Since then, researchers around the world
have sequenced over 3,000 more. Some are genetically identical to each
other, while others carry distinctive mutations.

That’s just a tiny sampling of the full diversity of the virus. As of
April 8, there were 1.5 million [confirmed
cases](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
of Covid-19, and the true total is probably many millions more. But
already, the genomes of the virus are revealing previously hidden
outlines of its history over the past few months.

As new genomes come to light, researchers upload them to an online
database called [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/). A team of virus
evolution experts are analyzing the growing collection of genomes in a
project called [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/). They continually
update the virus family tree.

The deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China. The
Nextstrain team has also used the mutation rate to determine that the
virus probably first moved into humans from an animal host in late 2019.
On Dec. 31, China announced that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens
of cases of a mysterious new respiratory
illness.

In January, as the scope of the catastrophe in China became clear, a few
countries started an aggressive testing program. They were able to track
the arrival of the virus on their territory and track its spread through
their populations.

But the United States fumbled in making its first diagnostic kits and
initially limited testing only to people who had come from China and
displayed symptoms of Covid-19.

“It was a disaster that we didn’t do testing,” Dr. Heguy said.

A few cases came to light starting at the end of January. But it was
easy to dismiss them as rare imports that did not lead to local
outbreaks.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

The illusion was dashed at the end of February by Trevor Bedford, an
associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and
the University of Washington, and his colleagues.

Using Nextstrain, they
[showed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/01/health/coronavirus-washington-spread.html)
that a virus identified in a patient in late February had mutation
shared by one identified in Washington on Jan. 20.

The Washington viruses also shared other mutations in common with ones
isolated in Wuhan, suggesting that a traveler had brought the
coronavirus from China.

With that discovery, Dr. Bedford and his colleagues took the lead in
sequencing coronavirus genomes. Sequencing more genomes around
Washington gave them a better view of how the outbreak there got
started.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

“I’m quite confident that it was not spreading in December in the United
States,” Dr. Bedford said. “There may have been a couple other
introductions in January that didn’t take off in the same way.”

As new cases arose in other parts of the country, other researchers set
up their own pipelines. The first positive test result in New York came
on March 1, and after a couple of weeks, patients surged into the city’s
hospitals.

“I thought, ‘We need to do this for New York,’” Dr. Heguy said.

Dr. Heguy and her colleagues found some New York viruses that shared
unique mutations not found elsewhere. “That’s when you know you’ve had a
silent transmission for a while,” she said.

Dr. Heguy estimated that the virus began circulating in the New York
area a couple of months ago.

And researchers at Mount Sinai started sequencing the genomes of
patients coming through their hospital. They found that the earliest
cases identified in New York were not linked to later ones.

“Two weeks later, we start seeing viruses related to each other,” said
Ana Silvia Gonzalez-Reiche, a member of the Mount Sinai team.

Dr. Gonzalez-Reiche and her colleagues found that these viruses were
practically identical to viruses found around Europe. They cannot say on
what particular flight a particular virus arrived in New York. But they
write that the viruses reveal “a period of untracked global transmission
between late January to mid-February.”

So far, the Mount Sinai researchers have identified seven separate
lineages of viruses that entered New York and began circulating. “We
will probably find more,” Dr. van Bakel said.

The coronavirus genomes are also revealing hints of early cross-country
travel.

Dr. van Bakel and his colleagues found one New York virus that was
identical to one of the Washington viruses found by Dr. Bedford and his
colleagues. In a [separate
study,](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043828v1)
researchers at Yale found another Washington-related virus. Combined,
the two studies hint that the coronavirus has been moving from coast to
coast for several
weeks.

Sidney Bell, a computational biologist working with the Nextstrain team,
cautions people not to read too much into these new mutations
themselves. “Just because something is different doesn’t mean it
matters,” Dr. Bell said.

Mutations do not automatically turn viruses into new, fearsome strains.
They often don’t bring about any change at all. “To me, mutations are
inevitable and kind of boring,” Dr. Bell said. “But in the movies, you
get the X-Men.”

Peter Thielen, a molecular biologist at the Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics Laboratory, likes to think of the spread of viruses like a
dandelion seed landing on an empty field.

The flower grows up and produces seeds of its own. Those seeds spread
and sprout. New mutations arise over the generations as the dandelions
fill the field. “But they’re all still dandelions,” Mr. Thielen said.

While the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart,
they don’t have any apparent effect on how the virus works.

That’s good news for scientists working on a vaccine.

Vaccine developers hope to fight Covid-19 by teaching our bodies to make
antibodies that can grab onto the virus and block its entry into cells.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some viruses evolve so quickly that they require vaccines that can
produce several different antibodies. That’s not the case for Covid-19.
Like other coronaviruses, it has a relatively slow mutation rate
compared to some viruses, like influenza.

As hard as the fight against it may be, its mutations reveal that things
can be a whole lot worse.

Of course, the coronavirus will continue to mutate as long as it still
infects people. It’s possible that vaccines will have to change to keep
up with the virus. And that’s why scientists need to keep tracking its
history.
