<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Trump on March 27 signed into law the $2 trillion stimulus
package designed to save millions of jobs and bail out companies
devastated by the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/travel/coronavirus-cruises-reopening.html).
But when the dust settled, one hard-hit sector of the travel industry
was left on the sidelines: the major
[cruise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/travel/coronavirus-cruises-reopening.html)
lines.

Even politicians who demanded that the industry clean up its
environmental record as a condition for receiving taxpayer funds were a
little stunned by the news.

“I have to admit I was surprised,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat
of Connecticut, said in an interview, “given the president’s support for
the cruise industry.”

So why were the major cruise lines left out? These are the three primary
reasons.

## They’re foreign corporations

In the weeks before the bill’s passage both [Democrats and Republicans
expressed
reservations](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article241044301.html)
about bailing out the major cruise lines because they are not American
corporations and are largely exempt from paying income taxes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Very emphatically and clearly, the intent of Congress is to exclude the
cruise line industry from any assistance with this bill,” Mr. Blumenthal
said.

Under the law, companies can only qualify for a loan if they are
“created or organized in the United States and under the laws of the
United States.”

While the major cruise lines are all headquartered in Miami, they are
incorporated in foreign countries: Royal Caribbean is registered in
Liberia, Norwegian in Bermuda, and Carnival in
Panama.

“If you literally go to the port of Miami and you actually look at the
flag on the stern of the ship, you won’t see a U.S. flag flying in the
breeze,” said James Walker, a maritime lawyer. “You’ll see the flag of
the Bahamas or the flag of Panama.”

The arrangement allows the major cruise lines to operate under the wage
and labor laws of the country they’re registered in, paying employees
many times less than what they would in the United States. It also
grants them access to a
[century-old](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2163&context=jil)
[provision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/883) in the tax
code that largely exempts them from paying federal income taxes.

$6.46 billion in revenue.

The cruise industry defended its tax and employment policies. Bari
Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International
Association, a trade group that represents the industry, said that the
cruise industry supports more than 421,000 jobs in the United States and
that it follows tax rules for international shipping which have
decades-long roots in U.S. tax law.

## Questions over environmental record

Earlier in March, a group of eight senators published [a
letter](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/whitehouse-markey-senate-democrats-request-requirements-for-airlines-and-cruise-lines-to-address-pollution-in-financial-assistance-package)saying
that the cruise industry and airlines should only get a bailout if they
took more steps to protect the environment. Days later, a coalition of
environmental groups sent [a
letter](https://www.stand.earth/sites/stand/files/CongressCruiseBailoutLetter.pdf)
to Congress asking lawmakers not to bail out the cruise industry, citing
a poor environmental record.

“The cruise sector has a decades-long track record of breaking
environmental laws and paying the fines as a matter of doing business,”
said Kendra Ulrich of Stand.earth, one of the environmental groups that
signed the letter to Congress.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

She noted that Princess Cruise Lines, a Carnival Corporation subsidiary,
was fined $40 million in 2016 for illegally dumping oil-contaminated
waste into the sea, and then covering it up. The company was fined $20
million this year [while on
probation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/04/business/carnival-cruise-pollution.html)
for discharging plastic into waters around the Bahamas and falsifying
records.

In an email, Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival Corporation, wrote
that actions were taken to address the issues that led to the recent
fines, including additional oversight, training and equipment to prevent
oil spillage, which he said has not happened again on any ship in the
fleet. Mr. Frizzell added that the company has undertaken a significant
push to “dramatically reduce” and remove single-use plastics on board
all of its ships since the 2016 fine.

Ms. Golin-Blaugrund, of the Cruise Line Industry Association, said the

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

## Accusations of a botched coronavirus response

First there was the Diamond Princess.

The world watched as the ship sat quarantined off the coast of Japan and
the coronavirus ripped through the cabin — infecting so many passengers
that at the time it became the [largest concentration of coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/22/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html)
outside China. The response from the cruise line was widely [seen as
rife with
mistakes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/08/world/asia/coronavirus-cruise-ship.html).

What followed was a series of actions by the industry [that
drew](https://skift.com/2020/03/10/nothing-could-stop-the-cruise-industry-then-came-coronavirus/)
[criticism](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-cruise-quarantine-draws-criticism-after-more-passengers-infected-11582039428),
just as members of Congress were drafting the bill. As more ships were
[hobbled by the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/california-coronavirus-cruise-ship.html),
the cruise industry was slow to respond and to [put in place
precautions](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-quarantine-went-wrong-2020-2)
that would protect passengers — at times[seeming to have an ad hoc
approach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/travel/coronavirus-cruise-costa-luminosa.html)
to [coronavirus
responses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/us/cruise-ship-california.html)
on board ships.

It was a public-relations nightmare, and eventually the State Department
stepped in and warned Americans, especially those with underlying health
issues, not to board cruise ships. After the warning, the major cruise
lines suspended U.S. operations for 30 days.

The optics for the industry are not great at the moment, said James
Hardiman, the managing director of leisure equity research for Wedbush
Securities, who follows the industry.

“I think if the U.S. public turns on the television and they see a bunch
of people getting back on a cruise ship anytime soon, I think the public
reaction to that is going to be very much akin to the public reaction
when you saw a bunch of spring breakers getting drunk and ignoring the
new reality,” he said.

The perception that going on a cruise is synonymous with bad or
irresponsible behavior, he said, “is going to be a real problem for the
industry.”

But cruise industry officials defended their actions. Mr. Frizzell wrote
in an email that Carnival Corporation responded quickly to news of the
outbreak in Asia — well before other industries. He added that Carnival
enacted a raft of changes in response to the virus including restricting
passengers who had traveled to China, instituting temperature checks and
health screenings, and canceling cruises to infected areas.
