In a country where anti-immigrant sentiment gave rise to the Brexit

LONDON — The eight men moved to
[Britain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html)
from different corners of its former empire, all of them doctors or
doctors-to-be, becoming foot soldiers in the effort to build a free
universal health service after World War II.

Now their names have become stacked atop a grim list: the first, and so
far only,
[doctors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/us/coronavirus-foreign-doctors-nurses-visas.html)
publicly reported to have died after catching [the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-new-orleans.html)
in
[Britain’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html)
aching National Health Service.

For a country ripped apart in recent years by Brexit and the
anti-immigrant movement that birthed it, the deaths of the eight
[doctors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/us/coronavirus-foreign-doctors-nurses-visas.html)
— from Egypt, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Sudan — attest to
the extraordinary dependence of Britain’s treasured health service on
workers from abroad.

It is a story tinged with racism, as white, British doctors have largely
dominated the prestigious disciplines while foreign doctors have
typically found work in places and practices that are apparently putting
them on the [dangerous front lines of the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/world/europe/coronavirus-united-kingdom-national-health-service.html).

“When people were standing on the street clapping for N.H.S. workers, I
thought, ‘A year and a half ago, they were talking about Brexit and how
these immigrants have come into our country and want to take our jobs,’”
said Dr. Hisham el-Khidir, whose cousin Dr. Adil el-Tayar, a transplant
surgeon, died on March 25 from the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html)

“Now today, it’s the same immigrants that are trying to work with the
locals,” said Dr. el-Khidir, a surgeon in Norwich, “and they are dying
on the front lines.”

By Tuesday, 7,097 people had died in British hospitals from the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/world/asia/coronavirus-migrants.html),
the government said on Wednesday, a leap of 938 from the day before, the
largest daily rise in the death toll.

And the victims have included not just the eight doctors but [a number
of nurses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52165167) who worked
alongside them, [at least one from
overseas.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/hong-kong-born-nurse-dies-of-coronavirus-after-44-years-with-nhs?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_b-gdnnews&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1586279774)

Britain is not the only country reckoning with its debt to foreign

but often face long waits for green cards, New York and New Jersey have
already cleared the way for graduates of overseas medical schools to
suit up in the coronavirus
response.

But Britain, where [nearly a third of doctors in National Health Service
hospitals](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/internationalmigrationandthehealthcareworkforce/2019-08-15)
are immigrants, has especially strong links to the medical school
systems of its former colonies, making it a natural landing place.

That was true for Dr. el-Tayar, 64, the oldest son of a government clerk
and a housewife from Atbara, Sudan, a railway city on the Nile.

He had 11 siblings, and one left a special impression: Osman, a brother,
who became ill as a child and died without suitable medical treatment.
Though Dr. el-Tayar rarely spoke of his brother’s death, he gave the
same name to his oldest son.

“In my mind, I think that’s what led him to medicine,” Dr. el-Khidir
said. “He didn’t want anyone else in his family to feel that.”

<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0" data-aria-hidden="true">Dr. Adil
El-Tayar</span>

</div>

</div>

After graduating from the University of Khartoum, Dr. el-Tayar decided
to help address a tide of kidney disease sweeping across sub-Saharan
Africa. So he moved to Britain in the early 1990s to train as a
specialist transplant surgeon. He returned to Sudan around 2010 and
helped set up a transplant program there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the deteriorating political situation in Sudan and the recent birth
of a son persuaded Dr. el-Tayar to settle back in Britain, where he went
to work once again for the health service. Having lost his status as a
senior doctor when he left for Sudan, he had taken up work filling in at
a surgical assessment unit in Herefordshire, northwest of London,
examining patients coming through the emergency room.

It was there that his family believes Dr. el-Tayar, working with only
rudimentary protective gear, contracted the virus. Sequestered in the
western London home where he loved sitting next to his 12-year-old son,
he became so short of breath recently that he could not string together
a sentence. While on a ventilator, his heart failed him.

Had the health service started screening hospital patients for the virus
sooner or supplied doctors with better protective gear, Dr. el-Tayar
might have lived, said his cousin, Dr. el-Khidir.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“In our morbidity analyses, we go through each and every case and ask,
‘Was it preventable? Was it avoidable?’” he said. “I’m trying to
answer this question with my cousin now. Even with all the difficulties,
I’ve got to say the answer has to be yes.”

Analysts warn that doctor shortages across countries ravaged by the
coronavirus will worsen as the virus spreads. While ventilators may be
the scarcest resource for now, a shortage of doctors and nurses trained
to operate them could leave hospitals struggling to make use even of
what they have.

By recruiting foreign doctors, Britain saves the roughly $270,000 in
taxpayer money that it costs to train doctors locally, a boon to a
system that does not spend enough on medical education to staff its own
hospitals. That effectively leaves Britain depending on the largess of
countries with weaker health care systems to train its own work
force.

Even so, the doctors are hampered by thousands of dollars in annual visa

service they work for.

Excluded from the most prestigious disciplines, immigrant doctors have
come to dominate so-called Cinderella specialties, like family and
elderly medicine, turning them into pillars of Britain’s health system.
And unlike choosier Britain-born doctors, they have historically gone to
work in what one lawmaker in 1961 called “the rottenest, worst hospitals
in the country,” the very ones that most needed a doctor.

Those same places are now squarely in the path of the virus.

“Migrant doctors are architects of the N.H.S. — they’re what built it
and held it together and worked in the most unpopular, most difficult
areas, where white British doctors don’t want to go and work,” said Dr.
Aneez Esmail, a professor of general practice at the University of
Manchester. “It’s a hidden story.”

When Dr. el-Tayar moved to Britain in the 1990s, he was following a
pipeline laid by the family of another doctor who has now died after
contracting the coronavirus: Dr. Amged el-Hawrani, 55.

An ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. el-Hawrani was about 11 when his
father, a radiologist, brought the family in 1975 from Khartoum to
Taunton, a town in southwestern England, and then Bristol, a bigger city
nearby.

Many Sudanese doctors at the time were burnishing their skills in
Britain before returning home or moving to Persian Gulf countries for
higher wages. But Dr. el-Hawrani’s family turned their home into a
staging post for Sudanese doctors interested in longer-term stays,
hosting their families during exams or house hunts.

        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Being British-Sudanese in the 1980s was not easy. Race riots flared in
cities across the country. Mosques were scarce. Dr. el-Hawrani went to
school almost exclusively with white British classmates.

The young doctor quietly stood up for his family: When someone once
tried to kill a 100-year-old fern in their garden by cutting out a ring
of bark, Dr. el-Hawrani snapped off branches and nailed them across the
gap so that nutrients could get across.

Still, discrimination bothered him. When it came time to follow his
father into medicine, Dr. el-Hawrani told his brother that he “wanted to
be an orthopedic surgeon but felt that maybe because of certain
prejudices he didn’t get it.”

His resolve only grew stronger after an older brother, Ashraf, a fellow
doctor, died at 29 of causes related to asthma. Dr. el-Hawrani
discovered his brother’s body.

Before Dr. el-Hawrani’s death, on March 28, he had finally come around
to the idea that his only son, Ashraf, named in his brother’s memory,
would study English instead of the family trade. Ashraf said in a
statement that his father “was dedicated towards his family.”

“Now he has to make his decisions about which university to go to on his
own,” Amal el-Hawrani said of Ashraf. “He was expecting to have his
father’s help.”

The coronavirus has taken a devastating toll on migrant doctors across
Britain, leaving at least six others dead: Dr. Habib Zaidi, 76, a
longtime general practitioner from Pakistan; Dr. Alfa Sa’adu, 68, a
geriatric doctor from Nigeria; Dr. Jitendra Rathod, 62, a heart surgeon
from India; Dr. Anton Sebastianpillai, in his 70s, a geriatric doctor
from Sri Lanka; Dr. Mohamed Sami Shousha, 79, a breast tissue specialist
from Egypt; and Dr. Syed Haider, in his 80s, a general practitioner from
Pakistan.

Barry Hudson, a longtime patient of Dr. Zaidi in southeastern England,
recalled their exam table conversations about England’s cricket team.

“He was a big figure in the community,” Mr. Hudson said. “He had a
proper doctor’s manner. He didn’t rush
anybody.”

For families that love to gather, grieving at a distance has been
wrenching.

Dr. el-Tayar was buried beside his father and grandfather in Sudan, as
he had wanted. But because only cargo planes were flying there, his wife
and children could not accompany the coffin.

At Dr. el-Hawrani’s burial, an imam said a prayer before a small,
spread-out crowd, and the doctor’s four living brothers and son lowered
his coffin into the ground. Then they dispersed.

His brother, Amal el-Hawrani, permitted himself a single intimacy: a hug
with his mother, because “I couldn’t turn that away,” he said.

Then she returned to her home in Bristol, along with a son who had
visited Dr. el-Hawrani in the hospital. Fearful of passing on the virus,
he had to forbid her from his room to keep her from bringing in food.
