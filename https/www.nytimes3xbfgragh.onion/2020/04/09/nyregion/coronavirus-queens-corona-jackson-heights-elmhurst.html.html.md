Anil Subba, a Nepali Uber driver from Jackson Heights, Queens, died just
hours after doctors at Elmhurst Hospital thought he might be strong
enough to be removed from a ventilator.

In the nearby Corona neighborhood, Edison Forero, 44, a restaurant
worker from Colombia, was still burning with fever when his housemate
demanded he leave his rented room, he said.

Not far away in Jackson Heights, Raziah Begum, a widow and nanny from
Bangladesh, worries she will be ill soon. Two of her three roommates
already have the symptoms of
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-quarantine-checkpoints.html),
the disease caused by the coronavirus. Everyone in the apartment is
jobless, and they eat one meal a day, she said.

“We are so hungry, but I am more terrified that I will get sick,” said
Ms. Begum, 53, who has diabetes and high blood pressure.

In a city ravaged by the

few places have suffered as much as central Queens, where a
seven-square-mile patch of densely packed immigrant enclaves recorded
more than 7,000 cases in the first weeks of the outbreak.

Across [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-quarantine-checkpoints.html),
there was a relatively encouraging sign on Thursday: [Hospitalizations
remained nearly flat

the first time since the lockdown began. Still, officials cautioned that
it was too early to tell if the trend would hold.

Deaths have continued to climb, and the state reached a new one-day high
of 799, according to figures released Thursday.

Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, which has had more deaths than any
other state besides New York, also said the curve of infection seemed to
be flattening in his state. He and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said
that social distancing measures would need to stay in place to keep up
the early progress.

A group of adjoining neighborhoods — Corona, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst and
Jackson Heights — have emerged as the epicenter of New York’s raging
outbreak.

As of Wednesday, those communities, with a combined population of about
600,000, had recorded more than 7,260 coronavirus cases, according to
data collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene. Manhattan, with nearly three times as many people, had about
10,860 cases.

Health officials have not released data on the race or ethnicity of the
people who are sick, and officials from the Department of City Planning
cautioned against drawing broad conclusions based on ZIP codes, which is
how the city has released limited information about positive
cases.

Yet health care workers and community leaders say it is indisputable
that the pandemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic day
laborers, restaurant workers and cleaners who make up the largest share
of the population in an area often celebrated as one of the most diverse
places on earth. [Latinos comprise 34 percent of the deaths in New York
City](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html?),
the largest share for any racial or ethnic group, [according to data
released by state officials on
Wednesday](https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Fatalities?).

The neighborhoods also have large communities of Indian, Bangladeshi,
Chinese, Filipino and Nepali people, and a score of other ethnicities
that have been devastated by the pandemic.

The city-run [Elmhurst Hospital
Center](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html)
was one of the earliest and hardest-hit by the virus. Dozens of Covid-19
patients have clogged hallways as they wait for beds, terrified, alone
and often unable to communicate in
English.

“We’re the epicenter of the epicenter,” said Councilman Daniel Dromm,
who represents Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. He became emotional as he
took stock of losses that included [five
friends](https://twitter.com/Dromm25/status/1245498053890539528?s=20)
and more than two dozen constituents. “This has shaken the whole
neighborhood,” he said.

In their daily toll of the fallen, city and state health officials have
not disclosed where exactly deaths are occurring. But community leaders
and organizers have kept their own tallies, providing a window into the
virus’s disproportionate impact on immigrant communities. Some of the
more prominent names in Queens include the [Rev. Antonio
Checo](http://gts.edu/general-news/2020/4/2/in-memoriam-antonio-checo-06),
a pastor at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Jackson Heights; [Lorena

a transgender activist; and [Kamal
Ahmed](https://bdnews24.com/people/2020/04/06/kamal-ahmed-chief-of-bangladesh-society-in-new-york-dies-from-coronavirus),
the president of the Bangladesh Society.

The New York Taxi Workers Alliance said 28 drivers had died — the vast
majority of them immigrants living in Queens — and Make the Road New
York, an advocacy organization that serves the area’s working-class
Latinos, said eight of its members in Queens had died. “A tragedy is
unfolding,” said the co-director, Javier H. Valdés.

The crisis has transformed the neighborhood. Roosevelt Avenue, the vital
commercial artery that normally bustles with taquerias, arepa stands,
threading salons and shops selling newspapers in dozens of languages,
has all but shut down. The eerie silence is intermittently broken by
sirens and the clattering of trains on elevated tracks.

A handful of street vendors have returned, but now they sell masks and
dress in Tyvek suits. With churches and mosques closed, families of the
dead can mourn only at
home.

[The chockablock density that defines this part of

poverty, [notoriously overcrowded

and [government

left residents especially vulnerable to the virus.

“I don’t think the city communicated the level of danger,” said Claudia

Empowerment, an advocacy group and worker center in Jackson Heights.

In early March, she said, city health officials sent out fliers with
hand-washing tips, but not the outreach workers and multilingual posters
that might have conveyed the looming peril.

The sick now include laborers like Ángel, 39, a construction worker from
Ecuador who asked that only his first name be used because of his
immigration status.

Like many, he said he worked at a Manhattan construction site until he
fell ill. He said he was turned away from Elmhurst Hospital because his
symptoms were not deemed life-threatening and had been suffering in the
apartment in Corona he shares with three other workers. “I don’t have
anyone to help me,” he
said.

City officials rejected the suggestion that they left the city’s
immigrant neighborhoods to fend for themselves. The Department of
Health, officials said, created coronavirus fact sheets in 15 languages.
Officials mounted multilingual public service campaigns in subways and
on television, and have provided continuous updates to the ethnic media
including on the need for social distancing.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Many residents struggled with poor health long before the coronavirus
arrived. Dr. Dave Chokshi, chief population health officer for the New
York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, said rates of diabetes, high
blood pressure and other chronic conditions in central Queens were
considerably higher than the city average.

Compounding the crisis, many residents lack health insurance and depend
on public hospitals for even routine procedures, said Diana Ramírez
Barón, a doctor at Grameen VidaSana, a clinic in Jackson Heights for
undocumented women.

“They tell them to stay home and call your physician,” she said,
referring to public health guidelines for people believed to have the
coronavirus. “But they don’t have a physician. They get scared and they
go to the
E.R.”

Patricia Rivera, a Mexican immigrant, said she had kept her distance
from her mother’s household in East Elmhurst as the virus ripped through
its seven members last month, infecting all but one. But then her
mother, who was struggling to breathe, needed to be taken to the
hospital.

Ms. Rivera, 38, took her to Flushing Hospital Medical Center, but came
home worried she would infect her own crowded household, which includes
a 70-year-old uncle. She found some N95 respirator masks given to a son
on a construction job, and handed them out to her family.

“Fear is what we’re all feeling,” said Ms. Rivera, who is working for a
laundromat, carrying laundry to and from quarantined homes.

For many, the fear of getting sick is heightened by the prospect of
becoming homeless. Johana Marin, 33, a waitress from Jackson Heights,
said she spent several days in the hospital.

“I thought I was going to die and never see my family in Colombia
again,” she said.

When she was discharged, she said, the woman who rented her a room
refused to let her stay. Ms. Marin found refuge in the apartment of an
aunt who she said was now pressing her to leave.

Mr. Dromm, the councilman, said such stories were increasingly common
and he urged the city to convert empty hotel rooms into temporary
housing for those discharged from the hospital or patients with mild
symptoms who were at risk of infecting others. City officials say they
are working to address the problem.

The challenges of dealing with the dead are becoming clear, as officials
discuss [digging temporary
graves](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/nyregion/mass-graves-nyc-parks-coronavirus.html)
and families call on consulates to help them repatriate the deceased to
their home countries.

In the meantime, the needs of the living keep growing. Thousands have
lost jobs, and the undocumented have so far been excluded from federal
government
aid.

At a food pantry run in nearby Flushing by the nonprofit organization La
Jornada, the vast majority of visitors were, until recently, single
mothers. Now two-thirds are men trying to feed their families, said the
director, Pedro Rodríguez, who worried the number of jobless residents
would soon prove overwhelming. “A tsunami is coming,” he said.

Despite the growing despair, many are finding ways to help others.
Mexican grandmothers share recipes for traditional herbal fever
remedies, Pakistani drivers deliver home-cooked meals and Nepali
volunteers — including Mr. Nembang, the cousin of the driver who died —
are distributing protective gear to those who must keep working.

For thousands of people, however, life has been reduced to the
dimensions of tiny rented rooms.

Ms. Begum, the former nanny from Bangladesh, said she was riddled with
fear. She spends her days compulsively cleaning the apartment’s bathroom
and steering clear of her ailing roommates. The landlord has been
demanding April rent and threatening eviction.

For succor, Ms. Begum turns to the Quran she keeps beside her bed. “I am
praying every day,” she said. “Praying that the coronavirus leaves
America.”
