*This obituary is part of a series about people who died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

As a young university graduate in the Philippines, Aileen Baviera was
among the first foreigners to receive a Chinese government scholarship
to study in Beijing. She arrived in 1981, five years after the end of
the Cultural Revolution and as the country was beginning to open up.

It was at the start of a 40-year academic career in which she became a
formidable expert on China and one of the Philippines’ leading scholars.
She became a professor at the University of the Philippines, where she
served for several years as the dean of its Asian Center.

Dr. Baviera died on March 21 at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila from
complications of the coronavirus, [the university
said](https://upd.edu.ph/baviera-60/?fbclid=IwAR1_Z18-pGK5rS6yRhDe1fAzP622HsCN1fxHlQUU7GQKhttSGB26TKIvZ4s).
She was 60.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The university praised her as “the country’s foremost Sinologist” and
said that she was much sought after for her expertise on China and its
long-running dispute with the Philippines over the South China Sea.

Richard Heydarian, an author and academic, pointed to the “sad irony”
that her death had come from a virus that originated in China, the
country she had spent her life studying.

“Her passing has sent shock waves across our community,” he said. “She
was one of the greatest scholars in the Philippines and had an uncanny
ability to work with groups across the political spectrum, even in the
most geopolitically polarized and divisive moments.”

Born Aileen San Pablo in 1959, she was drawn to leftist thinking as a
young student during the years of the Marcos dictatorship. But her
studies in China changed her views.

“‘Bombard the headquarters\!’ was Mao’s call to the Red Guards, calling
on them to challenge authority,” she wrote in a 2019 [article for Tulay
Fortnightly](https://tulay.ph/2019/08/20/forty-years-of-china-watching-from-the-eyes-of-a-filipino/),
a publication in the Philippines. “But exciting as that sounded to me, I
was by nature too much of a bookish and quiet loner to do any real
bombarding, and so found other, more boring ways to ‘serve the people,’
so to speak.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It also didn’t take too long before I learned to recognize and shun the
shallowness of political propaganda when I saw it, Mao’s as much as
Marcos’s,” she wrote.

Access to news was limited in Beijing, and she jumped at the chance to
work part time in the news bureau of The Chicago Tribune, where she
clipped and filed articles on China from Western newspapers. Reading
China coverage in The New York Times, The International Herald Tribune
and other papers helped inspire her own studies, she said.

She learned Mandarin in Beijing and later earned a Ph.D. in political
science from the University of the Philippines. She served as dean of
the university’s Asian Center from 2003 to 2009.

In addition to her professorship, she was president of the Asia Pacific
Pathways to Progress Foundation, which seeks to bring about peace and
cultural understanding through international dialogue and cooperation.

She also served as editor in chief of Asian Politics and Policy, a
quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal.

A widow, she is survived by her three children.

[In a 2016
article](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/can-anyone-really-rule-the-south-china-sea)
in The Straits Times newspaper of Singapore, Dr. Baviera ruminated on
the folly of efforts by governments to impose borders on the South China
Sea, which connects half a dozen nations.

“I envy the free creatures of the sea,” she wrote, “for we creatures of
the land have become captive of our own illusions of conquest and
control.”
