The best technology is simple to use. There's a dark side to that.

The technology we love is easy to use. Paying the babysitter on Venmo,
sharing a puppy video on Facebook or buying a novel on Amazon is a
breeze.

Most of the time, this is good. But as the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/business/zoom-video-privacy-security-coronavirus.html}{security
concerns} swirling around Zoom show, there's a dark side to making it
easy to buy, share and use.

The same qualities that let musicians go live on Facebook to
\href{https://www.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2020/03/24/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood-facebook-live-concert-coronavirus-mxp-vpx.hln}{entertain
us} also let a terrorist in New Zealand
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/14/world/asia/christchurch-shooting-new-zealand.html}{broadcast
mass murder} at the touch of a button. One-click ordering from Amazon is
great --- until your kid
\href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/move-over-santa-kids-are-asking-alexa-to-bring-them-presents-11576929600}{orders
stuff}without you knowing.

Ease of use is also a root cause of ``Zoombombing'' --- harassment
through the suddenly popular video-calling app.

Just about anyone has been able to join a Zoom call with one click. It's
simple, the call quality is good and the need to be with others has been
so great that Zoom has become a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/style/zoom-parties-coronavirus-memes.html}{staple
of pandemic life}.

But those same qualities have made it easy for trolls to use the
platform to
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/aa-intergroup-meetings-zoom-bombing-trolls-alcoholics-anonymous-2020-3}{invade
alcohol recovery meetings} and
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/video-chats-familiar-forms-online-harassment-make-comeback-n1168806}{shout
slurs} during online lectures.

People can
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/style/zoom-security-tips.html}{change
their settings} to make it less likely they will be harassed, but few
people do and they're not to blame. The company didn't focus on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/business/zoom-video-privacy-security-coronavirus.html}{security
and other dangers} when it should have. Zoombombing is now a consequence
of the company's deliberate choices to make video calling a breeze.

People who work on technology products obsess about removing anything
that slows us down. ``Friction'' is bad. As was the case for other
companies that decided to make things as easy as possible, Zoom's ease
was good until it wasn't.

Now that we're living more through screens, we need a little friction
--- even if it's annoying.

\href{https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033331271-Account-Setting-Update-Password-Default-for-Meeting-and-Webinar}{Requiring

\href{https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/}{approve}
30 students sharing their homework with a virtual class is a pain. It's
also protection against Zoom-crashing harassers, and it's good that the
company is moving in this direction. Zoom said it's now focusing more on
its security and
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-09/zoom-goes-from-conferencing-app-to-the-pandemic-s-social-network?srnd=premium}{re-evaluating
the balance} between security and ease of use.

Adding a little friction to WhatsApp last year helped slow the kind of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/07/18/technology/whatsapp-india-killings.html}{mob
rumors} that were deadly in India. To tamp down on coronavirus
misinformation, the Facebook-owned chat app this week further
\href{https://blog.whatsapp.com/Keeping-WhatsApp-Personal-and-Private}{tightened
rules} to allow people to pass on frequently forwarded messages to only
\href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-whatsapp-battles-coronavirus-misinformation-11586256870}{one
other person or group} at a time. Previously
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-whatsapp/facebooks-whatsapp-limits-text-forwards-to-five-recipients-to-curb-rumors-idUSKCN1PF0TP}{the
limit was five}.

Adding friction is not a cure-all. Bad people will find other ways to
spread hate. But now that Zoom has failed to protect our privacy, ``we
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/zoom-privacy-lessons.html}{shouldn't
just continue to use its product},'' my colleague
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/brian-x-chen}{Brian X. Chen}
wrote, ``just because it works well and is simple to use.'' (Brian has a
list of protective steps you can take if you need to use Zoom, and he
suggests alternatives such as FaceTime and Webex.)

I'm not saying everything in life should be harder. I want to flip open
Netflix instead of hunting through 10 menus on my television set. But
when there are stark consequences to easy, making things a little more
annoying makes life better for all of us.

My quarantine life has a telltale sound: The knock-knock-knock that nags
me about incoming messages in Slack, the chat app I use with my
colleagues to talk about work --- and dumb things on the internet.

Being cooped up with my pinging screens has made me curious about the
back story of this notification tone. Don't judge me.

What I hear is Slack's standard incoming message sound called ``Knock
Brush,'' a company representative told me. It was created by
\href{http://danielsimmons.ca/}{Danny Simmons}, a musician friend of
Slack's chief executive, Stewart Butterfield. Like almost all the sound
effects in Slack, the Knock Brush originally appeared in
\href{https://www.glitchthegame.com/}{Glitch}, a failed video game from
Butterfield and others that morphed into today's Slack.

And here's something for the Slackers out there to try: You can change
the incoming message tone to the sound of a longtime Slack employee
named Anna saying ``hummus'' in her British accent. I tried this and
found it distracting. (Sorry, Anna!) You can also
\href{https://slack.com/help/articles/360001559367-Troubleshoot-Slack-notifications\#h_60215489841550189674699}{turn
the sounds off} entirely.
