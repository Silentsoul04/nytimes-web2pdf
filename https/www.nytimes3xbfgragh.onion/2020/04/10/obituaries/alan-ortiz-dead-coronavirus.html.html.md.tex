\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Alan T. Ortiz, a leading foreign policy expert who held prominent
positions in the Philippine government and in business, traveled to
Paris in March to attend an international security conference.

He never made it home.

Dr. Ortiz, who had also served as president of the Philippine Council
for Foreign Relations, became infected with the coronavirus during his
trip and was hospitalized in Paris.

He died there on March 23, his daughter, Monica Ortiz, said in a post on
Facebook. He was 66.

``All the days of our lives, we will miss him, his laughter, his
intelligence, and his sense of adventure,'' she wrote.

Dr. Ortiz held a variety of key posts in government and business,
including as assistant director-general of the National Security Council
under former President Corazon Aquino and later as president and chief
operating officer of the power company SMC Global Power Holdings
Corporation.

In 1981, he placed first in the Philippine Foreign Service Officer
examinations.

He earned his doctorate in international relations at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, according to his
\href{http://pcfr.weebly.com/dr-alan-t-ortiz.html}{résumé} posted on the
website of the Philippine Council for Foreign Relations.

It also described him as an avid shooter, a rescue diver, a biking
enthusiast and an amateur photographer.
