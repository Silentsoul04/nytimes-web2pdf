Mr. Zhang, like his father, felt an impulse to serve his country from a
young age, but he paid a price from long-term exposure to radiation.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Zhang Lifa, a veteran of the People's Liberation Army, felt pride in the
years he spent working on China's nuclear weapons program, even as his
health faltered from the long-term exposure to radiation.

At 19, Mr. Zhang followed his father into the army, joining at a time
when China was racing to build its first atomic and hydrogen bombs. He
worked for six years on classified nuclear missions, including at a
remote site called
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/20/world/asia/china-jinyintan-atomic-city.html}{Plant
221}, also known as China's Los Alamos, in the northwestern province of
Qinghai.

Mr. Zhang died on Feb. 1 at a hospital in Wuhan from complications of
the coronavirus, his son, Zhang Hai, said. He was 76.

In January, after Mr. Zhang fell and broke his thigh bone, he traveled
with his son from Guangdong, where they lived, to Wuhan, his hometown,
for surgery. The virus was spreading in Wuhan at the time, but local
officials were playing down the risk of human-to-human transmission, so
Mr. Zhang proceeded with the trip.

Not long after he checked into the hospital, Mr. Zhang contracted the
virus, his son said, and he died less than two weeks later. By then, the
crisis had exploded into full view.

``If I had known the conditions, I would never have sent my father
back,'' Mr. Zhang's son said. ``Now I feel like sending him back was
like sending him into the hands of death.''

Zhang Lifa was born in 1943 in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong
and grew up in Wuhan. His father had fought in Mao Zedong's Communist
army against the Kuomintang during the Chinese Civil War, and he, too,
felt an impulse to serve his country from a young age.

After his years working on the country's nuclear program, Mr. Zhang left
the army in 1968. He began to suffer from health issues caused by
sustained exposure to radiation. He became deaf in one ear and had a
weakened liver.

After jumping from job to job, Mr. Zhang became a delivery driver for a
vocational school. He retired early, at 56, because of his illnesses.

Mr. Zhang is survived by his son and a daughter, as well as a grandson.
His wife died in 2009 of cancer.

Last year, Mr. Zhang was stricken with Alzheimer's disease.The younger
Mr. Zhang moved his father to Guangdong, where he lived, and quit his
job in real estate to take care of him full time.

In the months before Mr. Zhang's death, his mind and memories began to
fade. But at times, there were glimmers of his old patriotic self.

``Sometimes he envisioned himself back on the battlefield,'' his son
said. ``He'd be shouting, `Let's fight for our country!'''
