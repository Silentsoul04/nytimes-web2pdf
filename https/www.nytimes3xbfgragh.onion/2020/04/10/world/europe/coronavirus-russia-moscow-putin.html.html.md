MOSCOW — The authorities in Moscow said on Friday that coronavirus cases
are increasing rapidly here and have already pushed the city’s health
care system to its limit.

Warning that the outbreak in the Russian capital was far from reaching
its peak, Anastasia Rakova, a deputy mayor responsible for health, said
that the number of people hospitalized with the illness related to the
virus in Moscow had more than doubled over the past week to 6,500.
Nearly half of those infected are under the age of 45.

The city’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, sounded a further alarm, saying that
the virus “is gaining momentum” and that “the situation is becoming
increasingly problematic.”

A flurry of bad news on Friday about the outbreak indicated that Russia,
relatively spared until now from the ravages of the virus, has started
on the same harrowing path taken weeks ago by hard hit countries like
Italy and now the United States. This has dashed hopes in the Kremlin
that its decision in late January to close Russia’s long border with
China, the original source of the virus, and then limit travel from
Europe had contained the outbreak.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Vladimir V. Putin, who usually takes the lead with great
fanfare in times of crisis, has mostly stayed in the background. He has
retreated to his country residence outside Moscow, leaving Mr. Sobyanin,
the mayor, and Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, to take the
heat for a health crisis that now looks set to get far worse.

Ms. Rakova, the Moscow official, warned that the capital’s ambulance
service and hospitals were now stretched to the limit. The virus has
also started to wreak havoc in Russia’s vast hinterland, where the
ramshackle health system seems to be contributing to the spread of the
pathogen.

Hospitals in at least two regions are already overwhelmed by infected
patients. In Syktyvkar, the capital of the Komi oil-producing region
northeast of Moscow, the main hospital has more than 200 infected
people, while scores of medical personnel and more than a thousand
patients at a hospital in Ufa, 700 miles east of Moscow, have been
ordered not to leave the premises after 170 people there tested
positive.

Deviating from previous official assurances that Russia is well prepared
for a possible crush of patients, the health minister, Mikhail Murashko,
on Friday warned that the country’s health care services were now
“experiencing stress regarding supplies,” including the supply of
personal protection equipment and ventilators.

With little good news to celebrate on earth, Mr. Putin on Friday spoke
with Russian and American astronauts on board the international space
station, congratulating them on their safe arrival in space aboard a
Russian rocket launched on Thursday. Keeping his distance from the
coronavirus crisis, Mr. Putin also chaired a teleconference about
Russia’s aerospace industry.

Moscow reported 1,124 new cases of confirmed coronavirus infections on
Friday, bringing the total in the city to 7,822, compared with more than
80,000 in New York City. The authorities in the Russian capital, which
accounts for two-thirds of all cases in the country, last week ordered
residents to stay at home except to buy food and medicine and to walk
their dogs within 100 yards of their residence. But eager to avoid too
much disruption to the economy, they have done little to enforce the
restrictions.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

Police cars drive around the city broadcasting a message appealing to
“dear citizens” to stay indoors, and the mayor, Mr. Sobyanin, has made
increasingly insistent calls for Muscovites to follow self-quarantine
rules. On Friday, he warned that Moscow was still “somewhere at the base
of the peak” and needed to prepare for “a serious test ahead.”

After weeks of debate about the accuracy of official figures, an
official letter to Moscow hospital directors leaked online and seemed to
support allegations by Kremlin critics that Russia’s relatively low
coronavirus figures were not true. The letter, signed by the head of
Moscow’s health department, Aleksei Khripun, acknowledged that testing
had been compromised by a “very high number of false results” that
masked the true extent of
Covid-19.

Anastasia Vasilieva, the head of an independent doctors’ union, has
accused the government of downplaying the number of cases by
deliberately misclassifying Covid-19 as pneumonia. She was detained last
week in what was seen as punishment for puncturing an official narrative
that everything is under control.

But Russia’s health minister, Mr. Murashko, has himself since come close
to acknowledging widespread misclassification. In an interview on state
television, he said that patients with pneumonia will from now on be
treated in the same way as those confirmed as having coronavirus.
