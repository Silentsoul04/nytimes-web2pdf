MOSCOW --- The authorities in Moscow said on Friday that coronavirus
cases are increasing rapidly here and have already pushed the city's
health care system to its limit.

Warning that the outbreak in the Russian capital was far from reaching
its peak, Anastasia Rakova, a deputy mayor responsible for health, said
that the number of people hospitalized with the illness related to the
virus in Moscow had more than doubled over the past week to 6,500.
Nearly half of those infected are under the age of 45.

The city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, sounded a further alarm, saying that
the virus ``is gaining momentum'' and that ``the situation is becoming
increasingly problematic.''

A flurry of bad news on Friday about the outbreak indicated that Russia,
relatively spared until now from the ravages of the virus, has started
on the same harrowing path taken weeks ago by hard hit countries like
Italy and now the United States. This has dashed hopes in the Kremlin
that its decision in late January to close Russia's long border with
China, the original source of the virus, and then limit travel from
Europe had contained the outbreak.

President Vladimir V. Putin, who usually takes the lead with great
fanfare in times of crisis, has mostly stayed in the background. He has
retreated to his country residence outside Moscow, leaving Mr. Sobyanin,
the mayor, and Russia's prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, to take the
heat for a health crisis that now looks set to get far worse.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/04/10/world/10virus-moscow2/merlin_171469446_7c78db99-cf01-4455-8d25-3d7c2908db8f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Ms. Rakova, the Moscow official, warned that the capital's ambulance
service and hospitals were now stretched to the limit. The virus has
also started to wreak havoc in Russia's vast hinterland, where the
ramshackle health system seems to be contributing to the spread of the
pathogen.

Hospitals in at least two regions are already overwhelmed by infected
patients. In Syktyvkar, the capital of the Komi oil-producing region
northeast of Moscow, the main hospital has more than 200 infected
people, while scores of medical personnel and more than a thousand
patients at a hospital in Ufa, 700 miles east of Moscow, have been
ordered not to leave the premises after 170 people there tested
positive.

Deviating from previous official assurances that Russia is well prepared
for a possible crush of patients, the health minister, Mikhail Murashko,
on Friday warned that the country's health care services were now
``experiencing stress regarding supplies,'' including the supply of
personal protection equipment and ventilators.

And with Mr. Putin having scored a propaganda coup recently by sending
planeloads of such medical supplies to a variety of
countries,\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/world/europe/coronavirus-us-russia-aid.html}{including
the United States,} the reports of shortages could become a sore point.

With little good news to celebrate on earth, Mr. Putin on Friday spoke
with Russian and American astronauts on board the international space
station, congratulating them on their safe arrival in space aboard a
Russian rocket launched on Thursday. Keeping his distance from the
coronavirus crisis, Mr. Putin also chaired a teleconference about
Russia's aerospace industry.

Moscow reported 1,124 new cases of confirmed coronavirus infections on
Friday, bringing the total in the city to 7,822, compared with more than
80,000 in New York City. The authorities in the Russian capital, which
accounts for two-thirds of all cases in the country, last week ordered
residents to stay at home except to buy food and medicine and to walk
their dogs within 100 yards of their residence. But eager to avoid too
much disruption to the economy, they have done little to enforce the
restrictions.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

Police cars drive around the city broadcasting a message appealing to
``dear citizens'' to stay indoors, and the mayor, Mr. Sobyanin, has made
increasingly insistent calls for Muscovites to follow self-quarantine
rules. On Friday, he warned that Moscow was still ``somewhere at the
base of the peak'' and needed to prepare for ``a serious test ahead.''

After weeks of debate about the accuracy of official figures, an
official letter to Moscow hospital directors leaked online and seemed to
support allegations by Kremlin critics that Russia's relatively low
coronavirus figures were not true. The letter, signed by the head of
Moscow's health department, Aleksei Khripun, acknowledged that testing
had been compromised by a ``very high number of false results'' that
masked the true extent of Covid-19.

Anastasia Vasilieva, the head of an independent doctors' union, has
accused the government of downplaying the number of cases by
deliberately misclassifying Covid-19 as pneumonia. She was detained last
week in what was seen as punishment for puncturing an official narrative
that everything is under control.

But Russia's health minister, Mr. Murashko, has himself since come close
to acknowledging widespread misclassification. In an interview on state
television, he said that patients with pneumonia will from now on be
treated in the same way as those confirmed as having coronavirus.
