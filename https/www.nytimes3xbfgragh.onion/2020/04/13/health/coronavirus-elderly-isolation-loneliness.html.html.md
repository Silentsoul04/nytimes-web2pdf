At midmorning, Lisa Carfagna, a marketing staffer for the 92nd Street Y
in Manhattan, took a brief break from working at home on Long Island and
called the Rubins on the Upper East Side.

They were doing fine, Seymour Rubin, 89, assured her over a
speakerphone.

“We try to have a project every day,” said Shirley Rubin, 84. “Today,
I’m making a beef stew for the first time in 40 years.”

“If I’m here tomorrow,” her husband put in, “you’ll know it was good.”

When the coronavirus outbreak forced the Y to shutter last month —
leaving participants in its senior program bereft of their usual
lectures, classes and exercise programs — about 70 staff members quickly
volunteered to make weekly calls to all 650 of them. Ms. Carfagna
regularly checks in with 25.

Like many cultural organizations, the Y has turned to digital technology
— streamed concerts and lectures, classes on Zoom, discussion groups via
conference call — to keep its older patrons engaged.

But computers and smartphones can feel daunting; about a third of
Americans over 65 told Pew Research they [weren’t
confident](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/05/17/barriers-to-adoption-and-attitudes-towards-technology/)about
using digital technology. About half said they needed help in setting up
new devices. Some seniors lack broadband connection.

Besides, “there’s something about that live, person-to-person
connection,” said Julia Zeuner, who directs the senior program and
mobilized the volunteers. “A friendly voice on the other end of the
line.”

Social isolation and loneliness among older adults have become such a
concern that two years ago, the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering and Medicine assembled an expert committee to analyze
research findings and make recommendations.

Its
[report](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/the-health-and-medical-dimensions-of-social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults)
arrived in late February — as the coronavirus spread.

Now, older people have been sternly warned to adopt the very practices
that, the committee found, can endanger their health. With senior
centers, day programs, theaters, parks, gyms and restaurants closed and
most in-person visiting prohibited, they are enduring a lengthening
period of social separation. Nursing homes and assisted living
facilities are barring family members.

“It’s a public health crisis that should be recognized,” said Colleen
Galambos, a committee member and a gerontologist at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. “People who normally wouldn’t be considered
isolated or lonely are now experiencing it.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

These are not the same state, the National Academies report pointed out.
Social isolation refers to an objective lack of social contact with
others; loneliness, a subjective sense of being left out and ignored,
can strike even when people are surrounded by
others.

By itself, aging doesn’t create either problem. But it raises the risks.
“Many older people, especially women over 75, are living by themselves
because their spouses died,” said Dr. Dan Blazer, the committee chair
and a psychiatrist at the Duke University School of Medicine.

Retirement, difficulty driving, hearing and vision loss, cognitive or
physical problems that make getting out difficult — all contribute to a
troubling tide of disconnection.

About a quarter of people over 65 living independently in their
communities are considered [socially
isolated](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/75/1/107/4953727),
and 43 percent of those over 60
[report](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1188033)feeling
lonely — and that was before public health officials instructed older
people, and everyone else, to stay home.

“It’s not just touchy-feely stuff,” said Dr. Ken Covinsky, a
geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, who has
been a co-author on studies on loneliness. “Isolation is a real risk.”

In fact, it’s associated with significantly higher rates of [heart
disease](https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/13/987)and
[stroke](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091846) and a 50 percent
increased risk of
[dementia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30452410,), the National
Academies report pointed out. Isolated or lonely seniors report a
greater incidence of [depression and
anxiety](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1262-x).

They suffer a [mortality
rate](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316)
comparable to that linked to smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol
consumption and physical inactivity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the committee looked for promising solutions, it found
[studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0733464818807820)showing
that attending exercise programs helped reduce isolation — not a useful
approach at the moment. The evidence for much-heralded technological
approaches, from robotic pets and Zoom to voice-activated assistants,
remains thin thus far.

How, then, to help older people maintain their social connections when
they’re supposed to be socially, or at least physically, distanced?
Individuals and organizations around the country are proposing and
trying a variety of tactics.

Dr. Covinsky, particularly concerned about restrictions on visitors to
older people at home or in senior facilities, has suggested that as
coronavirus testing becomes more broadly available, family members or
friends who repeatedly test negative could become “designated visitors,”
permitted to spend time with their quarantined loved ones.

“We have restricted something that’s pretty essential,” he said. “We
need to move away from thinking of visitors to old people as optional.”

In Southern California, two PACE programs — federally funded efforts to
provide full medical and social services for those aging in place — have
leased tablets called [GrandPads](https://www.grandpad.net) for their
roughly 250 participants. Designed for those over 75, the devices allow
seniors to call the PACE center, receive and reply to email, and receive
video calls from PACE staff members (and play
games).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

At the Queens Public Library in New York, program assistants are calling
about 50 homebound patrons each week to remind them of programs
available by phone and to check on their well-being, said Madlyn
Schneider, the older adult coordinator.

In Los Angeles, the Motion Picture and Television Fund has fielded a
groundswell of new volunteers for its [Daily Call
Sheet](https://mptf.com/daily-call-sheet)program, which matches them
with older people who share their entertainment industry backgrounds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The volunteers, once vetted and trained, call once or twice a week.
“It’s reminiscing and connecting and fundamental human
conversation,” said Dr. Scott Kaiser, the geriatrician who established
the program.

The [Friendship
Line](https://www.ioaging.org/services/all-inclusive-health-care/friendship-line)
in San Francisco similarly operates a “warmline,” though without the
industry link. It has also seen a surge in users, and so many new
volunteers that it has resorted to a waiting list.

Dr. Blazer reports that the drivers delivering Meals on Wheels to his
96-year-old mother-in-law in suburban Atlanta, instead of just dropping
off food as usual, now tap on her door and chat from across the hallway
of her independent living building. “They have a conversation from six
feet away,” he said. “She says it makes a huge difference.”

However heartened by such efforts, Dr. Blazer cautioned that “social
isolation isn’t going away.” He worries about what will happen when some
degree of normalcy dawns — and millions of isolated or lonely elders

suburban New Jersey, has begun FaceTiming with her mother-in-law in
Manhattan every morning.

They work the New York Times crossword puzzle together, just as they
used to on Sundays in a city coffee shop, a pleasure now forbidden them.
(To subvert generational stereotypes, it’s Ms. Rosen, 56, who prefers
doing the puzzle on paper; the 87-year-old is using her tablet.)
