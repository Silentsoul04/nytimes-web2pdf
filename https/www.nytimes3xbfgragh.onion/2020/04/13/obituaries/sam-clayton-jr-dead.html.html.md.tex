\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

\href{https://www.reggaeville.com/artist-details/brain-damage/news/view/rip-sam-clayton-jr/}{Sam
Clayton Jr}. made sure the world heard real reggae, even when the people
making it came from countries far away from its birthplace, Jamaica.

Mr. Clayton, who was born and raised there, was a musical
jack-of-all-trades. He was a producer and sound engineer at Kingston's
famous \href{https://harryjstudio.com/}{Harry J. Studio}, where he
contributed to music by Jamaican roots reggae artists like Horace Andy
and Ernest Ranglin.

He also worked with many foreign artists, including Americans, like
Harrison Stafford, and Germans, like Sebastian Sturm. He lived in France
for some time, spoke fluent French, and worked with many French artists,
including the groups Danakil, Dub Inc., Brain Damage and Broussaï. He
also served as a sound engineer for the Jamaican band Toots and the
Maytals and the British group \href{https://steelpulse.com/}{Steel
Pulse}.

Mr. Clayton died on March 31 in Kingston, Jamaica. He was 58. The cause
was the coronavirus, David R. Hinds, Steel Pulse's frontman, said in an
email.

Mr. Hinds called Mr. Clayton a ``well-rounded individual'' who filled
multiple roles for the musicians he worked with, including touring
manager, guitar and keyboard technician, studio engineer, producer and
even percussionist.

``Most important of all, in this thieving, cutthroat music industry of
ours, he was trustworthy,'' Mr. Hinds said. ``Where Sam towered over the
rest of his peers, is that he held dearly every task he did, no matter
how small, or how tedious. They all got his relentless undivided
attention.''

Samuel Melchizedek Clayton was born on Aug. 30, 1961, in St. Andrew,
Jamaica, to Leonie and Sam Clayton. His
\href{https://thevinylfactory.com/features/sam-clayton-mystic-revelation-of-rastafari/}{father},
a percussionist and vocalist with Count Ossie's groundbreaking group the
Mystic Revelation of Rastafari, was an influential figure in
Rastafarianism. The Ethiopian Emperor,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1975/08/28/archives/haile-selassie-of-ethiopia-dies-at-83-deposed-emperor-ruled-ancient.html}{Haile
Selassie}, presented him with a medal on a visit to Jamaica in 1966.

The younger Mr. Clayton also worked as a railroad engineer and was part
of the Jamaican bobsled team that competed in the 1988 Winter Olympics
in Calgary, Alberta, and inspired the hit Disney film
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1993/10/01/movies/reviews-film-not-so-tough-sledding-from-4-unlikely-olympians.html}{Cool
Runnings}'' (1993).

Survivors include his wife, Annie Clayton; a daughter, Joelle Clayton;
three sons, John and Simon Clayton and Ice Fulchiron; and four sisters,
Nicole, Sophia, Aiesha and Suzzanne Clayton; and three grandchildren.
