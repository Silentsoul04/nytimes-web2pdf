JERUSALEM — With the negotiations over a unity government in Israel at a
critical juncture, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief
rival, Benny Gantz, asked the country’s president early on Tuesday to
extend the deadline to form a joint coalition to midnight Wednesday.

The two sides, hampered by discord and acrimony in their discussions
over a power-sharing deal, had been unable to reach an agreement before
a deadline passed at midnight Monday.

The president, Reuven Rivlin, acceded to the extension request on the
understanding that the two sides were close to an agreement, according
to a statement early Tuesday morning from his office.

If the two sides cannot resolve their differences by Wednesday night,
Mr. Rivlin is expected to refer the task of forming a government to
Parliament, a step that would start a countdown toward a possible new
election, Israel’s fourth in little over a year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Parliament would then have 21 days to come up with a candidate for
prime minister endorsed by 61 members of the 120-member assembly.
Failing that, Parliament would automatically disperse, sending Israelis
back to the ballot box.

In separate televised statements on Monday night, just hours before the
original deadline, both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz expressed their
desire for a unity government, citing the emergency created by the
coronavirus pandemic, but neither explained what was standing in the way
of an agreement.

“We will keep making every effort to achieve the unity that the country
so needs these days,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech that began with a
lengthy explanation of the latest coronavirus restrictions. Soon after,
he called on Mr. Gantz to negotiate.

“Benny, I’m waiting for you in the prime minister’s residence in
Jerusalem,” Mr. Netanyahu
[wrote](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1249767721912459265) on
Twitter. “Let’s meet and sign even tonight on forming a national
emergency government that will save lives and work for the citizens of
Israel.”

Last month’s election, the third inconclusive ballot since April 2019,
left Mr. Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party and its allies with a
slight numeric advantage in Parliament but, like Mr. Netanyahu’s
conservative Likud party, it was unable to muster a majority coalition.

The only apparent way out of the deadlock was to join forces.

Citing the good of the country, [Mr. Gantz reneged last
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gantz-government.html)
on repeated campaign promises not to sit in a government under Mr.
Netanyahu, who faces trial on corruption charges. Mr. Gantz agreed in
principle to enter a unity government in which Mr. Netanyahu would
remain prime minister for the first 18 months and Mr. Gantz would take
over for the following 18 months.

Mr. Gantz’s party immediately broke up as a result of his political
reversal, diminishing his political leverage as many former supporters
accused him of betraying their trust.

In his speech on Monday, Mr. Gantz defended his about-face, saying he
had put the country’s interests ahead of his own and adding, “I’m at
peace with myself and I’m at peace with my decision.”

“The state of emergency that has been forced upon Israel and the entire
world does not allow leaders to close their eyes and ears and remain
concerned only with their own egos,” he said.

But the talks, for what was meant to be a national emergency government
to combat the coronavirus crisis, became bogged down in political and
legal
details.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Many analysts were left questioning if Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest
serving prime minister and a renowned political survivor, really wanted
an agreement or if his plan was just to neutralize Mr. Gantz and aim for
a fourth election all along.

Even if the task of forming a government passes to Parliament, Mr.
Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz would still have three weeks to negotiate a
power-sharing deal.

Alternatively, with the opposition in pieces, Mr. Netanyahu, who already
has the endorsement of 59 lawmakers, could try to persuade a couple of
defectors to cross the lines and form a narrow government.

If neither of these things happen, a fourth election would become
inevitable.

So far, the unity talks have been rancorous, with Mr. Netanyahu
seemingly focused on ensuring he can remain in office despite his legal
troubles. Unity talks broke down last week as Mr. Netanyahu tried to
change the procedures for appointing Supreme Court judges, according to
Blue and White officials.

After talks resumed again a few days later, Mr. Netanyahu, analysts
said, was mostly concerned with finding a way to override any future
Supreme Court decision barring a candidate charged with crimes — like
himself — from forming a government.

Mr. Gantz, for his part, has been trying to salvage his reputation by
refusing to give way on Likud demands that he considers harmful to
democracy and the rule of law.

But even if a unity government is formed, political analysts were
skeptical that Mr. Gantz would get a turn as prime minister after Mr.
Netanyahu, or that the government would even last that long.

“This isn’t an emergency government, nor does it have anything to do
with the coronavirus,” Sima Kadmon, a political columnist, wrote in the
newspaper Yediot Ahronot on Monday. “Netanyahu managed to do to Gantz
what he does to everyone: first skin him, then barbecue him.”
