Most of the big droplets travel a mere six feet. The role of tiny
aerosols is the ``trillion-dollar question.''

The rule of thumb, or rather feet, has been to stand six feet apart in
public. That's supposed to be a safe distance if a person nearby is
coughing or sneezing and is infected with the novel coronavirus,
spreading droplets that may carry virus particles.

And scientists agree that six feet is a sensible and useful minimum
distance, but, some say, farther away would be better.

Six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the
organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation on the idea
that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze
will fall to the ground within six feet.

But some scientists, having looked at studies of air flow and being
concerned about smaller particles called aerosols, suggest that people
consider a number of factors, including their own vulnerability and
whether they are outdoors or in an enclosed room, when deciding whether
six feet is enough distance.

Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{farther
than six feet according to a recent study.}

We visualized a cough to show how far respiratory droplets can spread.
If you haven't been keeping your distance to fight the coronavirus, this
may persuade you.

No scientists are suggesting a wholesale change in behavior, or
proposing that some other length for separation from another human, like
seven, or nine feet, is actually the right one.

``Everything is about probability,'' said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, who is
the head of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and
21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering and Medicine. ``Three feet is better than nothing. Six feet
is better than three feet. At that point, the larger drops have pretty
much fallen down. Maybe if you're out of spitting range, that could be
even safer, but six feet is a pretty good number.''

One complicating factor is that aerosols, smaller droplets that can be
emitted when people are breathing and talking, play some role in
spreading the new coronavirus. Studies have shown that
\href{https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973}{aerosols can be
created} during certain hospital or laboratory procedures like when
using nebulizers to help patients inhale medication, which makes such
procedures risky for doctors who do them.

If the aerosols that people exhale in other settings are significant in
spreading the disease, the six-foot distance would not be completely
protective because those are carried more easily by air currents.

Aerosols are generally considered to be particles under 5 microns in
diameter, about the size of a red blood cell, and can be spread in the
environment by talking and breathing. But some researchers argue that
this is a false dichotomy. Infectious droplets can't easily be divided
into those that are big enough to fall to the ground quickly and those
that stay aloft because so much depends on environmental conditions and
how deeply they penetrate into the respiratory tract.

``It's really a continuum,'' said Dr. Donald Milton, who studies
bioaerosols at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.

Even without the launching power of a sneeze, air currents could carry a
flow of aerosol sized virus particles exhaled by an infected person 20
feet or more away.

``In any confined geometry like an office room, meeting room, department
store, food store,'' said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at Lehman
College and the City University of New York's Graduate Center. In a
study not yet peer reviewed, he analyzed air flow and showed how, ``the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13689}{vortices in the air are taking
the virus to different places}.''

A preliminary study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039446v2}{evidence
of coronavirus genetic material} on various surfaces in isolation rooms
where infected patients were being treated, including on air vents more
than six feet from the patients. The research, which has not yet been
peer reviewed, indicates that the virus can occasionally travel long
distances.

``The virus is so small, it can hitch a ride even on tiny, tiny
particles,'' Dr. Fineberg said. ``But how important is each size and how
well they can transmit disease is not fully understood.''

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

It is also unclear how many virus particles it takes to start an
infection, how long the viral particles remain viable or if studies like
the one in Nebraska simply detected the genetic calling card the virus
left behind.

Spacing is an effective solution because it also reduces the number of
people in a confined space. That reduces the likelihood of an infected
person being in the group. And if there is one, fewer other people might
be infected.

Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease
Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the six-foot
distance would clearly ``reduce the number of droplets you come in
contact with. I have no doubt about that.''

But, he said: ``The question is what does it take for you to get
infected? And that I think is the trillion-dollar question we have.''

He said, ``Maybe all it takes is an aerosol. You don't need any droplets
at all.'' If that's the case, he said, then someone who is at high risk
would not want to be in the same room with someone who is infected or
might be infected.

Current guidelines already suggest that anyone at high risk should stay
home and not be out in public in the first place. And they seem to be
working. Places where people
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html}{reduced
travel and started social distancing weeks ago}, especially in
California, New York and Washington, are starting to show a reduction in
the number of new coronavirus cases.

People still need to shop and take care of necessities, Dr. Osterholm
said, but reducing the risk of exposure to all possible modes of
transmission --- infected surfaces, droplets and smaller aerosols --- is
important.

``Your job is to limit it as much as you can.''
