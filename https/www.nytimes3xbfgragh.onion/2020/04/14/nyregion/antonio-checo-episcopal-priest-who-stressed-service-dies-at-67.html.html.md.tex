\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

In 2005, Antonio Checo became a mental health clinician at Mt. Sinai
Queens hospital, one of his many jobs devoted to helping people.

And it was there, on April 1, that he died of complications of the
coronavirus at 67.

In the intervening years he was ordained a priest and became the rector
of \href{http://saintmarks.net/}{St. Mark's Episcopal Church} in Jackson
Heights, Queens. As the
\href{https://www.diolicovid19.info/antonio-checo.html}{Very Rev.
Antonio Checo}, he spent many of those years working full time in the
church and at the hospital, allowing the practical service of his social
work to inform his ministry.

The Rev. Jason Moskal, the deacon at St. Mark's, confirmed the cause of
death.

Father Checo took over St. Mark's in 2009, when the congregation had
dwindled to about 20 members. He helped revive the church, which now has
a congregation of about 180 people. His parishioners included
African-Americans, Latin-Americans, white people and immigrants from
South America, the West Indies and the Philippines.

Father Checo enlarged the church's food pantry, emphasizing staples like
rice on which people in his neighborhood relied; conducted two Sunday
services, one in English and one in Spanish; and did his best to ensure
that his parishioners were able to navigate New York City's bureaucracy
to receive the help they needed.

Combining ``social work and the priesthood worked very well for him
because he stayed in tune with the real world,'' Father Moskal said.
``He understood the tribulations he was seeing at the hospital and
meshed that with the people he was seeing in the church.''

Antonio Checo was born in Santiago, the Dominican Republic, on May 6,
1952. He earned a bachelor's degree in social work from a Catholic
university there, then moved to New York City in 1982, where he earned a
master's in social work from Fordham University in the Bronx.

He worked for the New York Department of Social Services for 18 years,
then joined the Red Cross Sept. 11 Recovery Program after the 2001
terrorist attacks. After joining Mt. Sinai in 2005, he earned a master's
degree in theology the next year from the \href{http://gts.edu/}{General
Theological Seminary} of the Episcopal Church in Manhattan.

He was ordained a priest in 2007 and served in different capacities for
the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island before he became priest in charge
of St. Mark's, which falls within the diocese, in 2009. He was named the
church's fourth rector in 2016.

Father Checo is survived by his husband, Starlin, and several sisters.

Father Moskal said Father Checo had sometimes likened his faith to
doctor's orders for the soul.

``That's how he crossed over the medical and the faith,'' Father Moskal
said. ``We have the prescription. Jesus taught us what the prescription
was.''
