She was especially dedicated to working with Latino patients --- and to
organizing social events for friends.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Hailey Herrera was that friend you went to when you had a problem. So
she turned that gift into a profession.

``She was Dear Abby,'' her mother, Valerie Herrera, said. ``Everyone
wanted to come to her to ask her for advice. She said: `Mom, I am doing
this all for free. I might as well do it for a career and get paid for
it.'''

Ms. Herrera decided to become a therapist. She was working on a master's
degree in the marriage and family therapy program at Iona College in New
Rochelle, N.Y., when she died on April 7 at Jacobi Medical Center in the
Bronx. She was 25.

The cause was complications related to the new coronavirus, Mrs. Herrera
said.

Her mother, who also recently tested positive for the virus, said her
daughter had been seeing patients at
\href{https://www.iona.edu/academics/school-of-arts-science/departments/speech-communication/speech-and-language-hearing-clinic/clinic-services.aspx}{an
Iona clinic} in New Rochelle and at
\href{http://www.aristotlespsychological.com/}{Aristotle's Psychological
Center} in Astoria, Queens, where she had an internship. Both areas have
had a high number of coronavirus infections.

Ms. Herrera started feeling sick on March 16 and went into the hospital
about a week later, her mother said.

Hailey Marie Herrera was born on Sept. 2, 1994, in the Bronx and
graduated from \href{https://www.cardinalspellman.org/\#}{Cardinal
Spellman High School} there. She attended The College of Mount Saint
Vincent before transferring to Iona College, where she graduated in
2016.

Ms. Herrera, an only child, had a rich network of friends. She made a
point of organizing social events, which often centered on food. In
November she headed up an elaborate ``Galsgiving'' to celebrate the
Thanksgiving holiday with her girlfriends. In January she put together a
seafood boil at the home she shared with her mother and her father,
Arnold Herrera, in the Bronx.

``She brought this real vivaciousness with the way she approached the
world,'' said Katrina Svoboda, a friend and fellow student.

Ms. Herrera, whose relatives have Puerto Rican and Cuban roots, had an
affinity for working with families, especially Latino ones.

``Our field has been talking a lot about training clinicians of color
like Hailey,'' said Christiana I. Awosan, one of her professors.

Ms. Herrera understood how reluctant some people were to enter therapy,
so she developed a gentle but straightforward way of explaining the
process. She put it this way, Dr. Awosan said: People were like trees
and needed to develop strong roots to support themselves and their
relationships, which were the branches and leaves.

``She talked about it in an eloquent way that made so much sense to her
clients,'' Dr. Awosan said.
