73}\label{stuart-cohen-cabdriver-thirsty-for-knowledge-dies-at-73}}

Collecting used books, he read voraciously when not having lively
conversations with his passengers. He died in the coronavirus pandemic.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Stuart Cohen loved to explore the depths of human connection. And he did
it in countless fleeting interactions --- with passengers in his taxi.

As a New York City cabdriver for 25 years, Mr. Cohen thrived when
chatting with passengers about subjects like the Kennedy White House or
American politics. He once picked up former Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld as a fare, according to a friend of Mr. Cohen's, and inquired
eagerly about his personal history and thoughts on politics, in a manner
without social boundaries typical of a quintessential New Yorker.

Mr. Cohen died on April 8 at Coney Island Hospital. He was 73. The cause
was respiratory failure as a result of the coronavirus, W.J. O'Reilly, a
friend of 35 years, said.

Mr. O'Reilly said that his friend, who had become a Buddhist, had
performed the dharma of service by using his own car to give rides to
fellow Buddhists. They approximated family for him. And he often ended
the trip with a punchline. ``He would put his hand out asking for a
couple dollars as fare --- even when he wasn't driving a cab,'' Mr.
O'Reilly said.

Mr. Cohen was born on Jan. 1, 1947, in Brooklyn to Samuel and Nettie
Cohen. The family moved around the borough while he was growing up. He
had lost touch with his immediate family for unknown reasons, said Mr.
O'Reilly, who added that it seemed as if Mr. Cohen had tried to salve
his unhappiness by serving others.

He joined the Navy in 1967 and served primarily as a radio operator,
stationed for a period in the South Pacific, his friend said. Since 1988
he had lived on West 8th Street in Coney Island.

Mr. Cohen liked to collect books being thrown out or put up for
donation. He read as many as he could and then redistributed them,
dropping them off at places he knew to have bare bookshelves, like
nursing homes.

``One third of my high school graduating class went to Harvard
College,'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ``And I have to say, Stuart, who went to
high school only, was the best-read person I'd ever known.''
