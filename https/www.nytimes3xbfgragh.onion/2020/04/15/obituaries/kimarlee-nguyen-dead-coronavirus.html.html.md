Ms. Nguyen’s writing career was budding; she was also an inspiring

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Kimarlee Nguyen’s writing was as restrained as the Cambodian elders she
conjured in her fiction, short stories that sketched precarious, haunted
lives in a chilly new country.

But her personality was as exuberant as the rugby she played at Vassar,
with a team so determined, said [Kiese
Laymon](https://www.kieselaymon.com), a novelist and her creative
writing professor there, that the players would regularly come to class
concussed.

“Most people are reserved in their personality, but in their writing
everything busts out,” Mr. Laymon said. “Kim was the opposite. She would
tell stories so it appeared that nothing had happened. But, oh, man, so
much was happening.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You know sort of immediately the kids that are going to make themselves
into writers,” he added. “Kids with relentless imagination and uber
desire to revise. Kim had all of that, but also had, as she would say,
honest stuff for her people.”

Ms. Nguyen’s work was imprinted with her parents’ experience living
under the brutal Khmer Rouge regime. Her mother’s family had lived in a
refugee camp in Thailand for three years before coming to the United
States in 1982, eventually settling in Revere, Mass., where Ms. Nguyen
grew up.

She died of the novel coronavirus on April 5, on the way to the hospital
in nearby Everett, her cousin Tina Yeng said. She was 33.

Ms. Nguyen was born on May 6, 1986. For the last six years, she taught
English at Brooklyn Latin in New York, an academically rigorous public
high school with a classical liberal arts curriculum and a diverse
student body.

She was passionate about anime, Harry Potter and her students, whom she
mentored with fierceness, humor and scented stickers; after hours, they
crowded her classroom.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Nguyen earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Vassar in 2008 and
a master of fine arts degree from Long Island University Brooklyn in
2016. Her writing has appeared in
[PANK](https://pankmagazine.com/piece/these-things-and-how-they-go/),
[Hyphen
Magazine](https://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/2014/9/9/september-lit-ear-sky-kimarlee-nguyen)
and [The Adroit Journal](https://theadroitjournal.org); she has had
numerous[fellowships](http://www.kundiman.org/announcements/remembering-kimarlee-nguyen)
and residencies and was at work on a novel, “Lion’s Tooth,” about a
Cambodian-American family living in Cambridge, Mass.

She is survived by her brother, Steaven Nguyen; her mother, Vy Yeng; and
her father, Hai Van Nguyen.

Many of Ms. Nguyen’s students were, like her, first-generation Americans
and would go on to be the first in their families to attend college. In
an online tribute, one wrote:

“Two years ago, I was still that immigrant kid, struggling with English,
I felt excluded, I felt embarrassed for not being able to speak for
myself like the others. But you believed in me, you and your positive
energy brought me out of
darkness.”
