# Lee Konitz, Jazz Saxophonist Who Blazed His Own Trail, Dies at 92

</div>

He was a pioneer of the cool school, but he resisted pigeonholing and
focused on “making a personal statement.” He died of complications of
the coronavirus.

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Lee Konitz, a prolific and idiosyncratic saxophonist who was one of the
earliest and most admired exponents of the style known as cool jazz,
died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 92.

His niece Linda Konitz said the cause was complications of the
coronavirus. She said he also had pneumonia.

Mr. Konitz initially attracted attention as much for the way he didn’t
play as for the way he did. Like most of his jazz contemporaries, he
adopted the expanded harmonic vocabulary of his fellow alto saxophonist
[Charlie
Parker](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1955/03/15/archives/charlie-parker-jazz-master-dies-a-bebop-founder-and-top-saxophonist.html),
the leading figure in modern jazz. But his approach departed from
Parker’s in significant ways, and he quickly emerged as a role model
for musicians seeking an alternative to Parker’s pervasive influence.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Where modern jazz in the Parker mold, better known as bebop, tended to
be passionate and virtuosic, Mr. Konitz’s improvisations were measured
and understated, more thoughtful than heated.

“I knew and loved Charlie Parker and copied his bebop solos like
everyone else,” Mr. Konitz [told The Wall Street Journal
in 2013](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jazzs-king-of-coola-cool-65-1378152141).
“But I didn’t want to sound like him. So I used almost no vibrato and
played mostly in the higher register. That’s the heart of my sound.”

Although some musicians and critics dismissed Mr. Konitz’s style as
overly cerebral and lacking in emotion, it proved influential in the
development of the so-called cool school. But while cool jazz,
essentially a less heated variation on bebop, was popular for several
years — and some of its exponents, notably the baritone saxophonist
[Gerry
Mulligan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1996/01/21/nyregion/gerry-mulligan-a-baritone-saxophonist-and-cool-school-jazz-pioneerdies-at-68.html)
and the trumpeter and singer [Chet
Baker](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/05/14/obituaries/chet-baker-jazz-trumpeter-dies-at-59-in-a-fall.html),
both of whom he sometimes worked with, became stars — Mr. Konitz for
most of his career was a musician’s musician, admired by his peers and
jazz aficionados but little known to the general public.

This was in part because of his personality: An introvert by nature, he
was never entirely comfortable in the spotlight. And it was in part
because of his musical philosophy, which valued spontaneity above all
else and often led him to pursue daring improvisational tangents that
could leave his less adventurous listeners feeling a little lost. (His
way of preparing for a performance, he once said, was “to not be
prepared.”)

“My playing was about making a personal statement — getting audiences to
pay attention to what I was saying musically rather than giving them
what they wanted to hear, which is entertainment,” he said in the 2013
interview, referring to his early struggles to find an audience. “I
wanted to play original music.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His willingness to take chances was admired by advocates of so-called
free jazz, which, beginning in the late 1950s, defied established rules
of harmony and rhythm. But ultimately no label, not even “cool,” really
fit Mr. Konitz; he was best characterized as sui generis.

Reviewing a performance in 2000 for The New York Times, [Ben Ratliff
called Mr.
Konitz](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2000/05/13/arts/jazz-review-writing-their-own-ticket-on-an-original-of-the-past.html)
“as original a player as there is in jazz” and praised the “boiled-down
wisdom” of his playing, noting that “even when he is in the heat of
improvisation, it sounds like someone whistling a tune he has known all
his life.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Leon<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Konitz was born in Chicago
on Oct. 13, 1927, the youngest of three sons of Jewish immigrants. His
father, Abraham, who owned a laundry, was from Austria; his mother, Anna
(Getlin) Konitz, was from Russia.

Inspired by [Benny
Goodman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1986/06/14/obituaries/benny-goodman-king-of-swing-is-dead.html),
he persuaded his parents to buy him a clarinet when he was 11. He later
switched to saxophone, and in 1945, with the ranks of the nation’s dance
bands depleted by the draft and opportunities for young musicians
plentiful, he began his professional career with the Chicago-based band
of Jerry Wald.

His first big break came in 1947 when he joined [the Claude Thornhill
orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX05oHu63JE), whose soft
sound and pastel colors meshed well with his playing style. A
[subsequent stint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHxdZARIbSQ) with the
more dynamic and aggressive [Stan
Kenton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1979/08/27/archives/stan-kenton-band-leader-dies-was-center-of-jazz-controversies-in-an.html)
ensemble proved an uneasy musical mix but helped spread his name in the
jazz world.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The recordings that did the most to establish Mr. Konitz’s reputation
were made in the late 1940s and early ’50s, after he had moved to New
York, under the leadership of two of the most distinctive artists in
modern jazz: the pianist and composer [Lennie
Tristano](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1978/11/20/archives/lennie-tristano-at-59-pianist-was-innovator-in-the-cool-jazz-era.html),
with whom he studied for several years and whose [unorthodox approach to
improvisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bznqGjyYuRk) helped shape
his own; and the trumpeter [Miles
Davis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1991/09/29/nyregion/miles-davis-trumpeter-dies-jazz-genius-65-defined-cool.html),
whose short-lived but influential [nine-piece
band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPdP6-lrmc) sought to adapt the
ethereal Thornhill sound to a bebop context.

Those recordings, and others Mr. Konitz made as a leader in the 1950s,
were widely admired by other musicians. But that admiration did not
translate into work, and he struggled to find bookings; for a brief
period in the ’60s he stopped performing altogether.

He did not find steady employment as a musician again until the
mid-’70s, when New York City experienced a small jazz renaissance. He
attracted a loyal audience for his work both with small groups and
with[a nonet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge6RoRO-3sU) that, despite
its ambitious repertoire and arrangements, ultimately did not last much
longer than the Miles Davis ensemble on which it was partly modeled.

He had a bigger following in Europe, where for the last several decades
of his life he spent much of his time and did most of his recording. His
European discography ranged in style and format from “Lone-Lee” (1974),
on which he played unaccompanied, to [“Saxophone
Dreams”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVqhj7xnIg) (1997), on which
he was supported by a 61-piece orchestra.

He was named a National Endowment for the Arts [Jazz
Master](https://www.arts.gov/honors/jazz/lee-konitz) in 2009.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While Mr. Konitz rarely maintained a working group for more than a few
months, he performed and recorded as both leader and sideman with an
impressive array of top-rank musicians, ranging from the pianist [Dave
Brubeck](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/12/06/arts/music/dave-brubeck-jazz-musician-dies-at-91.html)
(on Mr. Brubeck’s 1976 album [“All the Things We
Are,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kwAoh8jl0U) which also
featured the avant-garde saxophonist [Anthony
Braxton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/11/arts/anthony-braxton-composer.html))
and the drummer [Elvin
Jones](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/05/19/arts/elvin-jones-jazz-drummer-with-coltrane-dies-at-76.html)
(on Mr. Konitz’s influential 1961 album
[“Motion,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpNhX-UvIxM) an
experiment in spontaneity recorded without planning or rehearsal) to, in
more recent years, the pianist [Brad
Mehldau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAKwaZOWX8c) and the guitarist
Bill Frisell. In 2003, in a rare foray outside the jazz world, he played
on Elvis Costello’s album “North.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite health problems, Mr. Konitz continued to perform into his 90s.
In recent years he would often stop playing in mid-solo and continue
improvising vocally.

Mr. Konitz was married three times. He is survived by two sons, Josh and
Paul; three daughters, Rebecca Pita, Stephanie Stonefifer and Karen
Kaley; three grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.

Like many jazz musicians, Mr. Konitz often found himself plying his
trade in bars and nightclubs where the audiences were less than
completely attentive. He professed not to mind.

“Wherever I’m at, I’m happy to have a chance to play,” he told the
British jazz writer Les Tompkins in 1976. “People come in and say, ‘How
can you work in this noisy little joint?’ I say: ‘Very easy. I take the
horn out of the bag, and I put it in my mouth.’ I appreciate the
opportunity.”
