\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

When playing his favorite game as a youngster, cops and robbers, Cedric
Dixon always insisted on being the one wearing the badge.

``He had to be a cop,'' Monique Dixon, his youngest sister, said. ``That
was always his goal.''

Mr. Dixon died on March 28 while wearing the badge of a detective with
the New York City Police Department. He was 48.

The cause was complications of the new coronavirus, Ms. Dixon said. His
death, at North Central Bronx hospital, is believed to be
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nypd.html}{the
first of a sworn N.Y.P.D. officer} caused by the virus.

Detective Dixon had served in the police department for 23 years,
working primarily in the Bronx. Promoted to detective just a year ago,
he was assigned to the 32nd Precinct, covering Harlem.

His colleagues described him as such an adroit interrogator that it was
not uncommon to find him shaking hands with a suspect after extracting a
confession. ``He was, simply, above par,'' a spokesman for the
Detectives Endowment Association said.

Detective Dixon was born on Aug. 10, 1971, and raised in the
Williamsbridge section of the Bronx by his mother, Ceceletha Dixon, a
nurse from Jamaica, alongside five sisters and a brother. As an adult he
was described as both towering --- at 6 feet 8 inches tall --- and
tender.

As news of his death spread, a woman whom Detective Dixon had once
arrested told his sister in a social media message that he was ``the
kindest man.''

``He made me feel like a person,'' the woman said.

Mr. Dixon enjoyed playing the piano (a particular point of pride was
teaching ``Chopsticks'' to each of his more than a dozen nieces and
nephews) and tinkering with electronics.

He is survived by his partner, Kyra Stevens; their daughters, Carys and
Cree; and six siblings.

``It didn't matter what it was --- my mother's radio, telephones, a
clock in our house --- he would constantly pull things apart to fix them
back together again,'' Ms. Dixon said.

Holding things together was something else he was good at --- at the
center of his family. ``He was the glue,'' Ms. Dixon said.
