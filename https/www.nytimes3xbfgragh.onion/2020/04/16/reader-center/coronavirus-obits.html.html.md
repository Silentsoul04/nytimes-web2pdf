[*Times
Insider*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/times-insider)
*explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes
insights into how our journalism comes together.*

Colleges were sending students packing. Wall Street was on its way to
its worst decline since Black Monday in 1987. Broadway went dark,
northern Italian hospitals fell into critical condition, and the World
Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic.

The prospect of death on a global scale was growing real.

That day, March 12, Sam Roberts, a veteran Times reporter and editor,
emailed his editors on the Obituaries desk — me among them: Should we be
thinking about a Portraits of Grief for victims of the virus?

I knew exactly what he had in mind.

[Portraits of
Grief](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2011/portraits-of-grief-10-years-later-lessons-from-the-original-new-york-times-911-coverage/)were
short written sketches in The Times, accompanied by photographs, of the
victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Beginning as a series
that ran for months, the profiles eventually numbered some 2,400 and
were published in a book. It was a powerful experience for all who were
involved — the editors and writers, the readers and especially the
family members of the victims. Like many other Times journalists of a
certain generation, I had contributed to the series.

But this time there was no finite number of the dead. No geographical
point united them. Their backgrounds were of infinite variety. They did
not die all at once on a bright blue
morning.

The same day that Mr. Roberts made his suggestion, I received an email
from my friend Donald G. McNeil Jr., the Times’s global health writer
and one of the lead reporters on the pandemic. You should prepare for
waves and waves of obituaries, he told me.

After some discussion among the editors in Obits, we agreed that it was
time for another generation’s Portraits of Grief. The executive editor,
Dean Baquet, immediately lent his support.

So began a frantic week of planning. The obituaries editor, Bill
McDonald, sent an all-points bulletin soliciting contributions from The
Times’s bureaus across the country and around the world. He asked me to
coordinate the project. Amy Padnani, the leader of the department’s
signature
[Overlooked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked.html)
series of unsung figures from the past, helped guide the project’s
online presentation. Both Peter Keepnews, the deputy editor, and Mr.
McDonald offered counsel and editing help while we all did our day jobs.
Julia Carmel, a news assistant, kept us organized. Our Interactive news
team came up with an elegant vehicle to display the [profiles
online](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

But then Mr. McNeil’s prediction came true. Major figures in the news
began dying of the novel coronavirus as well, including the Tony-winning
playwright [Terrence
McNally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/theater/terrence-mcnally-dead-coronavirus.html).
They joined our accounting of the dead, rubbing shoulders with everyone
else. We also asked for help from readers with a
[callout](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/obituaries/coronavirus-victims.html)
for candidates.

Times writers from other departments, including Styles, Culture and
Climate, joined in. Obituaries arrived from correspondents in London,
Tokyo, Rome and Nairobi. We started with a page of “Lost” obituaries in
print, appearing at first on Saturdays. But it soon became clear that
we’d need at least one more page of them a week, acknowledging that
even then they’d only scratch the surface of the mounting death toll.
Reinforcements began arriving from other departments.

Those who remember the Portraits of Grief, which emerged from the Metro
desk, will see something quite different here. Rather than vignettes,
these are more rounded obituaries, much as we write for heads of state,
Hall of Famers and trailblazers.

Most obituary writers and editors will agree that standard professional
detachment is the first line of defense when death is your beat.
Embracing the fascinating histories of the people we write about; using
graceful prose to capture them as best we can for the ages; and
employing journalistic chops to dig deep and uncover stories also help
keep morbidness at bay.
