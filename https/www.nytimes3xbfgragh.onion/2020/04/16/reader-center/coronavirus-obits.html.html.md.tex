How the Obituaries desk is memorializing victims of the coronavirus
pandemic.

Insider}} \emph{explains who we are and what we do, and delivers
behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.}

Colleges were sending students packing. Wall Street was on its way to
its worst decline since Black Monday in 1987. Broadway went dark,
northern Italian hospitals fell into critical condition, and the World
Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic.

The prospect of death on a global scale was growing real.

That day, March 12, Sam Roberts, a veteran Times reporter and editor,
emailed his editors on the Obituaries desk --- me among them: Should we
be thinking about a Portraits of Grief for victims of the virus?

I knew exactly what he had in mind.

\href{https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2011/portraits-of-grief-10-years-later-lessons-from-the-original-new-york-times-911-coverage/}{Portraits
of Grief}were short written sketches in The Times, accompanied by
photographs, of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Beginning as a series that ran for months, the profiles eventually
numbered some 2,400 and were published in a book. It was a powerful
experience for all who were involved --- the editors and writers, the
readers and especially the family members of the victims. Like many
other Times journalists of a certain generation, I had contributed to
the series.

But this time there was no finite number of the dead. No geographical
point united them. Their backgrounds were of infinite variety. They did
not die all at once on a bright blue morning.

The same day that Mr. Roberts made his suggestion, I received an email
from my friend Donald G. McNeil Jr., the Times's global health writer
and one of the lead reporters on the pandemic. You should prepare for
waves and waves of obituaries, he told me.

After some discussion among the editors in Obits, we agreed that it was
time for another generation's Portraits of Grief. The executive editor,
Dean Baquet, immediately lent his support.

So began a frantic week of planning. The obituaries editor, Bill
McDonald, sent an all-points bulletin soliciting contributions from The
Times's bureaus across the country and around the world. He asked me to
coordinate the project. Amy Padnani, the leader of the department's
signature
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked.html}{Overlooked}
series of unsung figures from the past, helped guide the project's
online presentation. Both Peter Keepnews, the deputy editor, and Mr.
McDonald offered counsel and editing help while we all did our day jobs.
Julia Carmel, a news assistant, kept us organized. Our Interactive news
team came up with an elegant vehicle to display the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{profiles
online}.

We came up with a name: Those We've Lost. The purpose was to convey the
human toll of Covid-19 by putting faces and names to the growing numbers
of the dead, and to portray them in all of their variety.

By March 27, we had our first group of obituaries, most written by Mr.
Roberts:

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without
    symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more
    than 200 other experts, who
    \href{https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798}{have

But then Mr. McNeil's prediction came true. Major figures in the news
began dying of the novel coronavirus as well, including the Tony-winning
playwright
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/theater/terrence-mcnally-dead-coronavirus.html}{Terrence
McNally}. They joined our accounting of the dead, rubbing shoulders with
everyone else. We also asked for help from readers with a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/obituaries/coronavirus-victims.html}{callout}
for candidates.

Times writers from other departments, including Styles, Culture and
Climate, joined in. Obituaries arrived from correspondents in London,
Tokyo, Rome and Nairobi. We started with a page of ``Lost'' obituaries
in print, appearing at first on Saturdays. But it soon became clear that
we'd need at least one more page of them a week, acknowledging that even
then they'd only scratch the surface of the mounting death toll.
Reinforcements began arriving from other departments.

Those who remember the Portraits of Grief, which emerged from the Metro
desk, will see something quite different here. Rather than vignettes,
these are more rounded obituaries, much as we write for heads of state,
Hall of Famers and trailblazers.

Most obituary writers and editors will agree that standard professional
detachment is the first line of defense when death is your beat.
Embracing the fascinating histories of the people we write about; using
graceful prose to capture them as best we can for the ages; and
employing journalistic chops to dig deep and uncover stories also help
keep morbidness at bay.

It's tougher when the story is all around you.
