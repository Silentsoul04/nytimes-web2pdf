Recently, I saw something on Twitter that annoyed me. It was an
[article](https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2020/04/14/were-not-afraid-of-any-virus-crowds-gathered-outside-of-ohio-statehouse-protesting-coronavirus-shutdowns)
from a local Ohio news site, describing a small crowd that had gathered
outside the statehouse to protest the state’s coronavirus shutdowns.
They were urging the governor to ignore social distancing guidelines and
open the state for business, a move that could endanger public health
and potentially put thousands of Ohioans’ lives at risk.

After fuming silently for a few minutes, I texted the link to my mother,
who lives in Ohio, with the caption “Idiots\!”

Then I caught myself. I wondered: Did a few dozen protesters doing
something reckless and irresponsible thousands of miles away from me
really deserve my outrage? Or had I allowed myself to be whipped into a
frenzy by people I’d never met, on a platform engineered to capture my
attention and convert it into advertising dollars? Was I ignoring the
larger forces at work — like the professional partisans who have made a
living exploiting the paranoid and fearful, or the long, slow erosion of
trust in mainstream health authorities — in favor of dunking on an easy
target? Was I actually mad, or did I just feel like I *should* be mad?

This is not a new thought pattern. I have it a few times a day, whenever
I find myself behaving in a way that feels less like genuine
self-expression and more like giving in to the invisible tug of a
faceless internet platform. Is the salad I’m making for dinner actually
what I want to eat, or do I just think the photo will make me look
healthy and responsible when I post it on Instagram later? Did I really
want to watch “Schitt’s Creek,” or did I just trust Netflix’s
recommendations more than my own taste? Which of my tastes, thoughts,
and habits are really mine, and which were put there by an algorithm?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’ve started calling this sensation “machine drift,” and I feel it every
day. Especially now, when millions of Americans are stuck inside during
a pandemic, the question of how our personalities and preferences are
being shaped by our digital surroundings seems more pressing than ever.

After all, for many of us, the world has been reduced to what we
experience on screens. And the things on those screens are not neutral
or inert. They’ve been put there on purpose and arranged, often by a
combination of humans and sophisticated forms of artificial
intelligence, to accomplish some goal. Maybe that goal is to make us
click, buy or share. Maybe it’s to persuade us, or harden some part of
our identity. Most of the time, what these machines want from us appears
harmless. Once in a while, it actually
is.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Marshall McLuhan, the 20th century media theorist, is often credited
with saying, “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.”

We know, by now, how we’ve shaped our tools. The origin stories of our
internet mega-platforms have been told over and over again, in glossy
business magazines and cable news specials. We know that Twitter ignited
the Arab Spring, and that Facebook ads helped elect President Trump. We
know that Google knows everything about us, and that Instagram’s effect
on our culture has been immeasurable.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Less clear, though, is the answer to the question raised by the other
side of McLuhan’s aphorism. How are our tools shaping us?

I’ve been obsessed with the internet since I was a preteen, and I’ve
been fascinated as things I used to consider niche phenomena — things
like ad microtargeting, meme culture and online conspiracy theories —
have wormed their way into the center of the national discourse. In the
past few years, internet culture has emerged not just as a nerdy
subculture, but as mass culture itself. And our reliance on the internet
as a primary source of information, entertainment and community seems to
be changing the ways we talk, the things we enjoy and the sources we
trust.

As a tech columnist, I’m inundated with both the good and bad parts of
the internet every day. And often, I have a hard time telling where the
internet stops and my personality starts. These days, more of my
thoughts arrive as trite, Twitter-size observations, and my more offbeat
tastes have been transformed into smoother, more mainstream ones by the
centripetal force of algorithmic recommendations. I’ve heard stories of
people I know struggling with their own versions of machine drift — a
friend whose political views were upended by a Facebook group, a friend
who reoriented her life around chasing Instagram fame, an acquaintance
who dropped into a dark corner of 4chan and never came back.

Last year, after the mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand — a
heinous mass murder committed by a white nationalist with ties to
far-right internet groups, whose [actions
seemed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/15/technology/facebook-youtube-christchurch-shooting.html)
to be calculated to produce maximum internet virality — my colleague
Andy Mills and I decided to try to figure out where the internet was
leading us, and what made its pull so powerful.

With the help of a small team of talented colleagues, we set out on a
yearlong project to make a narrative audio series that would tell the
stories of people who were shaping, and being shaped by, the internet.

You might have read versions of [some of these
stories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html)
in text form already. But by telling them in audio form, they’ve come
alive in a new way. And although we didn’t plan to release the series
during a national lockdown, it might turn out to be the right time to
explore the contours of the internet — this place I’ve spent my entire
adult life, this strange ecosystem we all now inhabit — and figure out
how, and why, it’s changing who we are.

The series comes out on Thursday. It’s called “[Rabbit
Hole](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/podcasts/rabbit-hole-internet-youtube-virus.html).”
I hope you’ll
listen.

## Listen to the first episode of ‘Rabbit Hole.’

### With Kevin Roose, produced by Andy Mills, Julia Longoria and Sindhu Gnanasambandan, and edited by Larissa Anderson and Wendy Dorr

#### A young man finds escape on the internet. He doesn’t realize that on the other side of the screen, a force is pulling him in.

  - archived recording 1  
    Take the spin, now you’re in with the techno set. You’re going
    surfing on the internet.

  - archived recording 2  
    It’s another day in the life of the Jamesons, maybe a family a
    little bit like yours. Except it’s not really just another day.
    Today’s the day I’m taking my family surfing around the world on the
    internet.

  - archived recording 3  
    It’s cool. Dad’s finally installed the internet on our home
    computer. Now I can surf the net any time I want.

\[music\]

  - andy mills  
    Test, test, test. Is this the state line?

  - kevin roose  
    I just saw the West Virginia Welcome Center.

  - andy mills  
    Wild, Wonderful, West Virginia with Jim Justice.

  - kevin roose  
    Oh, the governor’s name is Jim Justice. I feel like the campaign
    signs, like, make themselves.

  - andy mills  
    Vote Justice.

  - keving roose  
    You know?

andy mills

OK, so, just like, tell me the story and I’ll poke you on the way.

kevin roose

OK.

  - kevin roose  
    This is our exit here.

kevin roose

So last year, you and I hopped in a car —

  - andy mills  
    Can you just — can you just tell me, like, what are you up to today
    and what are you hoping to find out?

kevin roose

— to meet this guy.

  - kevin roose  
    His story is really interesting. So he says that he was radicalized
    through YouTube videos and spent, you know, several years becoming
    progressively more extreme in his politics.

kevin roose

After this shooting in New Zealand last March, there was a lot of talk
about online radicalization. The shooter was a white nationalist who
clearly spent a lot of time in far right internet communities.

  - kevin roose  
    I’ve been looking for a good case study of how it happens to just
    one person, what that path looks like.

kevin roose

And I kept hearing over and over again from sources I was talking to in
this world, like, you have to look at YouTube.

  - kevin roose  
    There are elements of it that seem very familiar to me and some that
    don’t seem so familiar. So we’re going to have him walk us through
    it. We missed our turn. I was so excited about this that I missed my
    turn.

kevin roose

So we drove down to West Virginia, where he lives.

  - kevin roose  
    Hey, how’s it going? All right, great.

kevin roose

He’s standing right there. He’s on his headphones. Big smile.

  - caleb cain  
    Nice to meet you guys.

  - andy mills  
    Hi, Andy.

  - kevin roose  
    This is Andy.

  - andy mills  
    I’m going to stick a microphone around you.

  - caleb cain  
    That’s fine.

kevin roose

He’s got a Gorillaz t-shirt on. He says hi and brings us into his
friend’s house.

  - kevin roose  
    Hi, I’m Kevin. Nice to meet you.

  - caleb's friend  
    Nice to meet you.

  - kevin roose  
    Thank you for letting us crash your —

  - caleb's friend  
    Oh yeah.

  - kevin roose  
    — your house here.

kevin roose

And the first thing he does is —

  - caleb cain  
    Now I’m gonna just sit this over here.

  - andy mills  
    Can you describe what it is that you’re setting down?

  - caleb cain  
    A Glock-43.

kevin roose

— pull out his gun.

  - kevin roose  
    Is that the first time you’ve had a gun?

  - caleb cain  
    I’ve liked firearms my whole life. I’m not against firearms. But,
    yeah, that’s — I’ve always been like, well, I don’t really need one.
    But then the day after I got death threats, went out and bought one.

  - kevin roose  
    Oh, man.

  - caleb cain  
    I’ll probably never have to use it. These guys usually just like
    send SWAT teams to your house and \[EXPLETIVE\] like that. But, you
    know, it’s just to be safe.

  - kevin roose  
    Well, where should we sit? Where’s the best place for us to —

  - caleb's friend  
    You can sit here.

kevin roose

Eventually we go over, we sit on the couch.

  - andy mills  
    Give me a little test here.

  - kevin roose  
    Oh, sure. Testing, one, two, three. Do-re-mi.

kevin roose

And he starts telling what begins like a pretty relatable and familiar
story.

  - kevin roose  
    So can you just start, like, tell us your name and how old you are?

  - caleb cain  
    Yeah. My name’s Caleb Cain. I’m 26 years old. I was born in Florida
    but I grew up here in West Virginia.

  - kevin roose  
    When did you move to West Virginia?

  - caleb cain  
    My mother had me with some man that I never met. And then she, like,
    immediately left Florida, I guess. I don’t know all the details
    there.

kevin roose

He had kind of a rough childhood, as he describes it.

  - caleb cain  
    Got raised by my grandparents.

kevin roose

Didn’t really have a lot of friends.

  - kevin roose  
    What were you like as a kid?

  - caleb cain  
    Um, really shy and nerdy, picked on on the bus.

kevin roose

Didn’t really feel like he fit in.

  - caleb cain  
    Going to high school was hell. I hated it. I saw everybody as
    conformists.

kevin roose

Like a lot of teenagers, he got really into video games.

  - caleb cain  
    So Zelda was a big one, Donkey Kong.

kevin roose

And then he discovered —

  - caleb cain  
    Freshman year of high school was whenever I got high speed internet.

kevin roose

— the internet. I don’t know what I would have done without the
internet.

  - archived recording (video gamer)  
    This thing is awesome\! \[LAUGHING\]

  - caleb cain  
    It was like a escape.

kevin roose

And the internet is a revolution for him, because finally —

  - caleb cain  
    That’s when I started playing a lot of online video games.

  - archived recording (video gamer 1)  
    Oh \[EXPLETIVE\], in the window of the house\!

  - archived recording (video gamer 2)  
    Oh, I’m reloading.

kevin roose

He finds people who are like him.

  - caleb cain  
    People over the country, all over the world.

  - archived recording (video gamer 1)  
    Oh, that was so good, man.

  - archived recording (video gamer 2)  
    Oh, nice. \[LAUGHTER\]

  - caleb cain  
    I met a lot of friends.

  - archived recording (video gamer)  
    They grow up so quickly. \[LAUGHTER\]

kevin roose

And he develops this new routine where, like, every day he comes home
from school, gets on his computer —

  - archived recording (video gamer)  
    All right, this is Call of Duty 2.

kevin roose

— plays a bunch of video games. And then, later at night —

  - caleb cain  
    I’d turn on YouTube.

kevin roose

— he goes on YouTube.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 1)  
    (SINGING) Chocolate rain.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 2)  
    I’m on crack.

kevin roose

And YouTube at the time, it was —

  - archived recording (youtube clip 3)  
    Is this supposed to be forever?

kevin roose

— mostly —

  - archived recording (youtube clip 4)  
    Charlie\! That really hurt.

kevin roose

— viral videos and comedy sketches. This was like, you know, early,
early YouTube.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 1)  
    I want my money\!

  - archived recording (youtube clip 2)  
    You need to relax.

  - caleb cain  
    Stay up all night and watch, like —

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    (SINGING) It’s my dick in a box, dick in a box, girl.

  - caleb cain  
    — and bust up laughing.

kevin roose

If Caleb didn’t feel like he fit in in high school, in his sort of
physical surroundings —

  - archived recording (youtube clip 1)  
    And the categories are Potent Potables.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 2)  
    You wouldn’t know it, but I like people.

kevin roose

YouTube was the place that he felt most at home.

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    I like people, but I like them in short bursts.

  - kevin roose  
    You’re speaking to me very deeply.

  - caleb cain  
    Yeah, exactly.

  - kevin roose  
    I experienced this too. Like, I was not cool in high school. And I
    remember the internet kind of being a place that you would go to,
    like, escape.

  - caleb cain  
    Yeah.

  - kevin roose  
    And it was sort of nicer than your real life, in some cases.

  - caleb cain  
    You’re right. It was nicer back then.

  - kevin roose  
    Were you political at the time?

  - caleb cain  
    Political in like a very surface level sense, right? Like
    anti-authority and like, you know. Most of my politics as a teenager
    came from, like, Dead Kennedys, and —

  - archived recording (dead kennedys)  
    (SINGING) California\! Uber Alles\!

  - archived recording (michael moore)  
    This is Michael Moore. I am here to make a citizen’s arrest.

  - caleb cain  
    — Michael Moore documentaries. And that influenced me a lot.

  - archived recording (michael moore)  
    I mean, I wish that CNN and the other mainstream media would just
    for once tell the truth about what’s going on in this country.

  - caleb cain  
    So there was very much that punk rock influence inside of me.

kevin roose

He also got really into these new atheist videos.

  - archived recording (cristopher hitchens)  
    When I say that I think religion poisons everything —

  - caleb cain  
    I remember watching, like, Christopher Hitchens on YouTube.

  - archived recording (cristopher hitchens)  
    I mean to say it infects us in our most basic integrity.

  - caleb cain  
    You’d get old uploads —

  - archived recording (richard dawkins)  
    For me, what matters is the truth.

  - caleb cain  
    — of like a Richard Dawkins speech.

  - archived recording (richard dawkins)  
    There is nothing special about the Bible.

andy mills

Oh, I remember these videos. They felt like, kind of scandalous at the
time.

kevin roose

Right. They felt subversive. They felt like watching people say the
uncomfortable thing.

  - archived recording (sam harris)  
    If God is good and loving and just, and he wanted to guide us
    morally with a book, why give us a book that supports slavery.

kevin roose

By today’s standards, obviously, like, this is extremely tame. But at
the time, like, this was pretty edgy stuff.

  - kevin roose  
    So this would have been, like, early Obama years, right?

  - caleb cain  
    Yeah. Yeah, early Obama years.

  - kevin roose  
    Did you like Obama? Or What did you feel about him?

  - caleb cain  
    I liked him. I didn’t know much about him, because I didn’t look
    into actual politics. So I didn’t know what he was doing. But, yeah,
    I liked him. I thought, yeah, we have a black president. That’s
    cool. Like, you know, first black president. Making progress.

  - andy mills  
    What year was it that you graduated from school?

  - caleb cain  
    I graduated 2011, went to college.

kevin roose

And then he goes off to college. And college, like, just doesn’t really
take for him.

  - caleb cain  
    I wanted to go and do an environmental major. And I didn’t have a
    good time. Most the time I’d stay in my room. Even on nice days when
    people were out on the quad throwing frisbees, I’d sit in my room
    and play video games. And then there was also this embarrassing
    moment where I got into a fight with this kid on campus and kind of
    got laughed off of campus. And that night, I freaking left. Because
    I wasn’t going to class anyway. And I just withdrew from my classes
    and I left. And I came back to West Virginia.

kevin roose

So he moves back in with his grandparents. And there, like, he doesn’t
have much to do. He doesn’t have a job. He doesn’t really have a
direction.

  - caleb cain  
    It’s just me in a room and a bed.

kevin roose

He spent a lot of time —

  - caleb cain  
    Slept a lot.

kevin roose

— feeling depressed.

  - caleb cain  
    I’d sit in my basement and just be, like, so freaking down.

kevin roose

At one point he even loses his gaming computer.

  - caleb cain  
    My gaming computer got stolen, by the way, which really
    \[EXPLETIVE\] drove me up a wall. And so not I didn’t even have
    video games. Now I have a crappy little computer that can hardly run
    anything. But it can run YouTube.

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    Whoa, that’s a cool rainbow.

kevin roose

And so now he’s in his early 20s. He’s living at his grandparents’
house.

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    It’s not so much that it’s bad.

  - kevin roose  
    And he feels like, at this time in his life, when he should be,
    like, finding his way, he should be starting a career and thinking
    about having a family —

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    So hide ya kids, hide ya wife.

kevin roose

Instead, he’s just watching YouTube.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 1)  
    Look at that horse.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 2)  
    All we know is how little we know.

  - archived recording (youtube clip 3)  
    (SINGING) What does the fox say?

kevin roose

And then —

  - archived recording (athene)  
    The human brain is a network of approximately 100 billion neurons.

  - caleb cain  
    I found a documentary called, “God is in the Neurons.”

  - archived recording (athene)  
    When we grow up, our moral and ethical compass is almost entirely
    forged by our environments.

  - caleb cain  
    It’s about like, cognitive dissonance, and like how you can fall
    into patterns of behavior. And since you have neuroplasticity, that
    you can get out of those patterns of behavior.

  - archived recording (athene)  
    When we are self-aware, we can alter misplaced emotions, because we
    control the thoughts that cause them.

  - caleb cain  
    So I got in this mindset of, oh, my brain is just like this tool
    that I can shape into whatever I want.

kevin roose

And then he stumbles into this emerging wing of YouTube.

  - caleb cain  
    And so I started, just going through self-help content.

kevin roose

Self-help videos.

  - archived recording (self-help video 1)  
    What dream or vision do you want to turn into reality?

  - archived recording (tony robbins)  
    All of our success and failure in life comes from little decisions.

  - caleb cain  
    Cheesy stuff, to be honest with you.

  - archived recording (tony robbins)  
    The process of conditioning ourselves actually feels incredible.

  - caleb cain  
    Like Tony Robbins and stuff.

  - archived recording (self-help video)  
    Every mind possesses the potential to be utterly free of all —

  - caleb cain  
    And Zen Buddhism stuff.

  - archived recording (alan watts)  
    We want to change our consciousness.

kevin roose

They’re like, people with advice specifically for —

  - archived recording (self-help video)  
    You continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making
    the change.

kevin roose

— guys like Caleb. And then —

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    To be truly free is both very easy and very hard.

  - caleb cain  
    — I found Stef.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    But we can only be kept in the cages we refuse to see.

kevin roose

So Stefan Molyneux is this Canadian libertarian, formerly a historian
and an entrepreneur. And then he sort of became like a podcaster guy.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    Good morning, everybody. It’s Stefan Molyneux from Freedomain Radio.
    I hope that you’re doing very well.

  - caleb cain  
    Stef just was in the sidebar one day, and I clicked on it.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    You really have to open the often iron-bound doors of your heart.

kevin roose

When YouTube, sort of early in its life, removed its 15-minute limit on
how long videos could be, he just started pumping out hour, two-hour
long shows called Freedomain Radio.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    The approach that we take at Freedomain Radio, the sort of
    philosophical Socratic approach that we take, can be very, very
    helpful for you.

kevin roose

Where he would expound on philosophical ideas.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    Philosophy is the all-discipline. It covers everything. And that’s
    why, to me, it is the most exciting and fundamental —

kevin roose

And Stefan Molyneux is telling him things that, you know, make him feel
better. He’s saying, this depression that you’re going through, it’s not
permanent. Things will get better. And that a lot of the disillusionment
and pain that young men like Caleb are facing is not actually their
fault.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    From the perspective of a young man, just take a brief look at
    society —

kevin roose

It’s the fault of society.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    I mean, you get of course on-demand pornography. You get video games
    that are unbelievably realistic, absorbing and addictive. And what
    else do they have to look forward to? Well, they can get themselves
    involved in higher education and graduate an average of $25,000 in
    debt to a job market that is pretty stagnant or declining. You’ve
    seen real wages —

kevin roose

He finds a lot of what he’s saying pretty sensible.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    College students are damn right to be depressed. Their society is
    unsustainable, because nobody’s asking the fundamental questions
    about why the society is the way it is, why things are so bad.

  - caleb cain  
    I was like yeah, yeah, that’s true.

kevin roose

And he’s not just talking at people. He invites people to send him
questions.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    I have had a number of requests to do a podcast on how to meet a
    nice girl, because there are a lot of —

kevin roose

He invites them into his life.

  - caleb cain  
    He would talk about how he grew up.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    I was interested in morality from a very early age. I was
    physically, emotionally and mentally abused.

  - caleb cain  
    And he’s talked about how he was so much better now.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    I have consistently said, if you have problems with your parents,
    talk to a therapist.

  - caleb cain  
    And he had went to therapy and his life had improved.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    Before we met, Christina had spent quite some time working on
    herself.

  - caleb cain  
    And he had a wife who would come on stream with him.

  - archived recording (christina papadopoulus  
    I had struggled with a previous relationship.

  - kevin roose  
    He has his wife on this channel and they talk about their life
    together.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    I’m watching my daughter learn how to make jokes. Finding out what
    is funny for her, what is not funny for her and why. Like, I just —
    I want to kiss her hair all day. Just because, you know, I must kiss
    your brain.

  - caleb cain  
    He talks about how much he loves his daughter. It’s like, I want all
    that stuff. I want a family like that. Because that’s what I wanted
    my whole life. I just wanted a stable family. And I thought, well,
    if I just keep watching more and more, I’ll be like Stef.

  - archived recording 1 (stefan molyneux)  
    Hey, everybody, Stefan Molyneux from Freedomain Radio.

  - archived recording 2 (stefan molyneux)  
    Hi, everybody, this is Stefan Molyneux.

  - archived recording 3 (stefan molyneux)  
    Hi, everybody, it’s Stefan Molyneux’s Freedomain Radio. I hope
    you’re doing very well.

kevin roose

And for Caleb —

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    You got happiness without responsibility.

  - kevin roose  
    — Stefan Molyneux, his voice and his videos, become a source of
    stability for him.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    There are very specific things that people need to do to be happy.

kevin roose

And Caleb says that all the stuff that he’s watching on YouTube, like,
it’s actually helping.

  - caleb cain  
    I started working at Dairy Queen.

kevin roose

He gets a new job.

  - caleb cain  
    And then I started, like, getting over a lot of my social anxiety,
    because now I’m forced to interact with people and I’m also hanging
    out with all these high school kids.

kevin roose

He starts to feel like things are picking up for him, finally.

  - caleb cain  
    And after that, I mean, it was just more and more of that.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    So the problem is not that we don’t know how to

  - archived recording (foster the people)  
    \[Intro to “Pumped up Kicks”\]

  - caleb cain  
    I was pretty much always on YouTube.

  - archived recording (lorde)  
    (SINGING) Every song’s like gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the
    bathroom.

kevin roose

He’s watching not only the self-help stuff from Stefan Molyneux.

  - archived recording (gyote)  
    (SINGING) But you didn’t have to cut me off.

  - archived recording (history channel documentary)  
    The Great Pyramid at Giza.

kevin roose

He starts getting pretty into Joe Rogan —

  - archived recording  
    Joe Rogan is the man.

kevin roose

— the biggest podcast, YouTube talk show guy that there is on the
internet.

  - archived recording (joe rogan)  
    Thank you very much for coming by, man. This is cool as
    \[EXPLETIVE\].

kevin roose

But back then, was just starting to experiment with uploading his
interviews to YouTube.

  - archived recording (joe rogan)  
    Anthony Bourdain is with us, ladies and gentlemen.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    Hi everybody, it’s Stefan Molyneux.

kevin roose

He just keeps watching and watching —

  - archived recording  
    You’re almost like an accidental —

kevin roose

— and watching.

  - archived recording (interposing youtube clip)  
    Take ownership of what they have done in their life.

  - caleb cain  
    If I wasn’t at work, any single moment that I had, I was watching
    YouTube videos.

  - archived recording (miley cyrus)  
    (SINGING) We can’t stop, we won’t stop.

  - archived recording (joe rogan)  
    This is episode 500.

  - archived recording  
    Probably, it’s at that point, 10, 12, 13, 14 hours a day.

  - archived recording (stefan molyneux)  
    — judge individuals as bad people.

  - caleb cain  
    I sound like a crazy person, but that’s what I would do.

kevin roose

And when Caleb talks about watching YouTube videos during this period in
his life, he talks about experiencing this as the sensation of falling.
But the thing that he doesn’t even really know to think about is that on
the other side of his screen there’s a force that’s pulling him in. And
that force has to do with a French guy named Guillaume —

  - kevin roose  
    Guillaume, hello. This is Kevin.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Hey, how are you?

  - kevin roose  
    Doing well. How are you?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Great.

kevin roose

— who, even though they’ve never met —

  - guillaume chaslot  
    So, yeah, I think everything is ready here.

kevin roose

— is a really important part of Caleb’s story.

\[music\]

  - guillaume chaslot  
    I did a PhD in artificial intelligence, and then I worked at
    Microsoft.

kevin roose

Guilllaume Chaslot is a pretty smart guy.

  - kevin roose  
    You studied how to make robots, essentially.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Exactly.

kevin roose

Got his doctorate, studying machine learning. And then in 2010 he got
his dream job, working at Google.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    And so when I joined Google, I actually didn’t know which project I
    would be put on.

kevin roose

And when he gets to Google, he gets this really interesting and exciting
assignment.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Yeah, it turned out they needed someone on the AI of YouTube. So I
    was the perfect fit.

kevin roose

And the project he’s assigned to work on is ultimately what
distinguishes YouTube from every other website on the internet. And that
has to do with the recommendations sidebar, and the artificial
intelligence that makes the whole thing work.

  - kevin roose  
    And did this seem to you like a big deal, to be given a job at
    Google, working on YouTube recommendations?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Yeah. That was really amazing at first to realize that my work was
    going to be affecting so many people. So I thought that was going to
    be a good thing. I thought, OK, we can make artificial intelligence
    to make the world a better place.

  - kevin roose  
    And when you got there, I assume there was some algorithm that was
    selecting videos for people. How did that algorithm work?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Yeah. So initially, when YouTube started, what’s best was clicks.
    Like, the more people clicked on videos, the better they thought it
    was. And then they realized that it led to too many clickbaits. So
    people would click on the title, then realize that the video was not
    at all but what was said in the title. And then they would leave the
    platform immediately. So that would be actually bad for YouTube. So
    then they switched their measure to total watch time.

  - kevin roose  
    And how was the goal of this algorithm explained to you? Like, what
    did you understand about what YouTube’s executives wanted?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    The idea was to maximize watch time at all cost. To just make it
    grow as big as possible.

kevin roose

It seems like a simple shift, but that shift has radical consequences.

  - archived recording 1  
    YouTube’s watch time has gone up by 50 percent.

  - archived recording 2  
    Seeing accelerating usage growth.

kevin roose

It produces these numbers that no one has ever seen before.

  - archived recording 1  
    YouTube now pulls in more than a billion dollars a quarter.

  - archived recording 2  
    It’s just an incredible size of audience who are consuming ever more
    video content.

  - archived recording 3  
    It’s not so much if you’re watching YouTube, it’s how much.

  - kevin roose  
    How are you feeling about your work at this point?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    I think we were so excited on working on this project that we didn’t
    really question too much that watch time was a good metric. We were
    thinking, yeah, I mean, if people are watching longer, they might be
    happier about what they’re watching. So at the time I felt pretty
    good about this. Yeah.

  - caleb cain  
    If I had a moment to stick earbuds in my ear —

  - archived recording (interposing youtube clips)  
    To reject how we are human by other —

  - caleb cain  
    Any single moment that I wasn’t talking to someone, I was consuming
    content.

  - archived recording (joe rogan)  
    Hey, everybody. This episode of the podcast is brought to you by —

  - guillaume chaslot  
    But then I realized there were some issues. People were noticing
    that you had a problem with maximizing just watch time that it
    creates this filter bubbles.

  - kevin roose  
    Say more about that.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    The way I explained it when I was at YouTube at the time was —

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    Say hi to everybody.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    When you watch a cat video then the recommendation engine can say,
    oh, you watched a cat video so we’re going to give you —

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    Meow.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    — another cat video, and then another cat video.

  - archived recording (youtube clip)  
    Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    And then another cat video — more of the same, more of the same,
    more of the same.
    
    At the time I was really worried about wasting human potential. If
    you could on all of YouTube, but then the thing that’s going to keep
    you watching the most is cats, is it the right thing to do to give
    you, again, cats on cats on cats?

kevin roose

And over time Guillaume realizes that this filter bubble problem he’s
been noticing, it’s actually worse than everyone just watching the same
cat videos over and over.

^archived recording^ (demonstraters)

\[CHANTING\]

  - guillaume chaslot  
    So at the time it was a demonstration in Cairo.

  - kevin roose  
    In Cairo, Egypt?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Yes.

  - archived recording  
    Violence has erupted in the Egyptian capital Cairo, as those —

kevin roose

He sees these news videos, these political videos, like this conflict in
Egypt that’s going on at the time. And he sees that the algorithm is
showing people in different groups, the same thing, over and over.

  - guillaume chaslot  
    You would see a video from the site of the protesters, and then it
    will recommend another video from the site of protesters. So you
    would only see the site of protesters. If you start with the side of
    the police, you would only see the side of the police.

  - archived recording  
    \[SPEAKING ARABIC\]

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Then you had only one side of reality. You couldn’t see both sides.

  - archived recording  
    \[SPEAKING ARABIC\]

  - guillaume chaslot  
    So these two different realities were created.

  - kevin roose  
    Once you recognized that there were these filter bubbles, these sort
    of algorithmic echo chambers, what did you do about it?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    So the first thing I didn’t want to do is complain about it and try
    to find, like, the bad example that shows what’s wrong with it.
    Because I didn’t want to be the grumpy French guy who complains. So
    what I did is side projects. I created, with another engineer, who’s
    still at YouTube, we created an algorithm that did the exact
    opposite. It got out of the filter bubble.

  - kevin roose  
    And did any of these side projects have any impact at YouTube? Like,
    did they move into testing, were they implemented, did managers like
    them?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    No, there were always just prototype. But then they were never even
    test on real users.

  - kevin roose  
    And why do you think that is?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    I mean, the way they were saying it is that, OK, it’s now our
    objective. And our objective was to increase watch time.

  - kevin roose  
    So, the problem of political polarization — of giving people only
    one side of a story — you’re noticing this problem while you’re at
    YouTube, and it sounds like you are trying to address it through
    these side projects. But you know, your bosses are not saying,
    Guillaume, that’s the best idea we’ve ever heard, let’s put it live
    on the site right now. Like, how did things unfold for you at
    YouTube from there?

  - guillaume chaslot  
    Yeah. So when I proposed the third project to my manager, he told
    me, “If I were you, I wouldn’t work on it too much.” And then for a
    few months I didn’t work on it. Then when I started working on it
    again, then I got fired for a bad performance review. Which is true,
    because then they spend so much time on this project that I spend
    less time on my main project.

kevin roose

So Guillaume left Google — actually left Silicon Valley altogether and
moved back to France. And he says that he kind of stopped thinking about
the YouTube algorithm altogether. Until one day, like an old French
romance, the two meet again.

\[music\]

  - guillaume chaslot  
    I was in a bus ride from Lyon to Paris, which was a six-hour bus
    ride. I was working in Paris, but I had family in Lyon, so I was
    visiting my family and then coming back to work in Paris. And there
    were these new buses with Wi-Fi. So I thought, OK, let’s give it a
    try.

kevin roose

So he’s sitting there on the bus. He’s on his laptop. He’s doing some
work. And he notices that on the screen next to him —

  - guillaume chaslot  
    My neighbor was watching YouTube videos for a very long time.

kevin roose

The guy was just going from one recommended video to the next
recommended video, to the next to the next and the next.
