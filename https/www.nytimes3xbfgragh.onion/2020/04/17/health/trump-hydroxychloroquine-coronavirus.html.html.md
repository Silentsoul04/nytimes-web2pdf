# Trump Calls This Drug a ‘Game Changer.’ Doctors Aren’t So Sure.

The malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has become a political litmus test.
But doctors on the front lines of coronavirus say it’s just another tool
in desperate times.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just a month ago, Dr. Bushra Mina had no playbook to treat patients who
were arriving with coronavirus at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.

His first encounter was with an older man whose health declined quickly.
No drugs were approved to treat this highly infectious virus, and there
was little Dr. Mina could do but provide supportive care.

Weeks later, Dr. Mina, the chief of pulmonary medicine at Lenox Hill, is
on the 16th revision of guidelines shared among doctors as they assess
the ways the virus is emerging and advancing in patients, and what
possible treatments should be applied.

Now most
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=STYLN_coronahub&variant=show&region=header&context=menu)
patients at Lenox Hill who are not on the verge of dying receive a
five-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine, the long-used malaria drug that
President Trump has repeatedly promoted as a “what have you got to lose”
remedy. While his own top health officials are more cautious — noting
there is limited evidence about the drug’s benefits — doctors across the
country have been prescribing the drug for weeks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Mina doesn’t know if the hydroxychloroquine is helping his patients.
He is well aware that there are no rigorous clinical trials showing that
the drug works. But he can’t wait for the evidence to come in, he said,
when people are dying.

“I think it’s a battle, and your options are very limited,” Dr. Mina
said. “You’re really looking for what you can do with whatever evidence
you have.”

Hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, have been used for
decades to treat and prevent malaria, and hydroxychloroquine has been
used by people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis because it is known
to calm the immune system. In laboratory tests, it has been shown to
block the coronavirus from invading cells, although it hasn’t been
proven in human trials. The drugs are not recommended for people who
have abnormal heart rhythms because it can make them worse.

Almost overnight, the hard-to-pronounce drug has become a litmus test
for support of the president. Conservative talk show hosts [and
supporters](https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservative-group-pushes-for-fda-approval-of-drug-to-treat-coronavirus-11585229415?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/5rakc6KA4h)
like his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, praise the drug’s potential,
while political opponents have scoffed at what they see as another way
that Mr. Trump has undermined scientific inquiry.

For weeks now, doctors around the country have been giving the drug to
patients at various stages of the disease, and as a preventive measure
to some if they’ve been exposed by family members or in health care
settings. But even after treating hundreds of patients with the
antimalarial drug, the doctors interviewed did not report clear results
or remarkable recoveries that can be traced to the drug.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to Lenox Hill, other major hospitals in outbreak hot spots
are using hydroxychloroquine as part of their protocol. They include
[Massachusetts General
Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/assets/MGH/pdf/news/coronavirus/mass-general-COVID-19-treatment-guidance.pdf)
in Boston and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, which each
recommend it on a case-by-case basis and when clinical trials are not
feasible, and Ochsner Health in Louisiana, which administers it
routinely to coronavirus
patients.

This week, [researchers in
China](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060558v1)
made public the results of another study of hydroxychloroquine, of 150
hospitalized patients. The study, which has not been peer-reviewed,
found that patients who were given the drug did not fare significantly
better than those who did not receive it, nor did they experience more
serious side effects.

Some medical societies have recently recommended against its regular
use. The [Infectious Diseases Society of
America](https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management/)
recently advised that use of hydroxychloroquine be limited to clinical
trials, [as did the American Thoracic
Society](https://www.thoracic.org/about/newsroom/press-releases/journal/2020/ats-publishes-new-guidance-on-covid-19-management.php).

At the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, [researchers are beginning
a 3,000-person](https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/04/hfhs-leads-national-study-to-determine-drugs-effectiveness-in-preventing-covid19)
clinical trial that will test whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent
infection in health care employees and other front-line workers. But
they have also given it to sick patients, outside of a trial, when there
is little other hope.

“In many ways we feel driven to help patients who are in front of us —
today — in the hour of their greatest need,” said Dr. Steven Kalkanis,
the chief academic officer of Henry Ford Health System. “And there is a
clamoring to use whatever we have at our disposal.”

But outside of a clinical trial, it can be hard to assess the drug’s
value, especially when it is being given to a variety of patients, of
different ages and medical conditions, and at different points in their
disease. Based on the hospital’s experience, Dr. Kalkanis said, the
drug’s benefits do not appear to be a slam dunk.

“For every anecdotal success story, we hear one where a patient
unfortunately died,” he said. “It’s not coalescing around, ‘Oh my gosh,
this is the answer.’”

The [drug has generated
excitement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html)
because a laboratory study, with cultured cells, found that chloroquine
could block the coronavirus from invading cells, which it must do to
replicate and cause illness. But drugs that show promise in the
laboratory do not always translate to success in the human body, and
other studies have found that it failed to prevent or treat influenza
and other viral illnesses.

Early reports from doctors in China and
[France](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996)
have said that hydroxychloroquine, sometimes combined with the
antibiotic azithromycin, seemed to help patients. But the studies were
small and did not use proper control groups — patients carefully
selected to match those in the experimental group but who are not given
the drug being tested. Research involving few patients and no controls
cannot determine whether a drug works.

At most hospitals in the Ochsner Health system in Louisiana, including
those in New Orleans, infected patients are routinely given a course of
hydroxychloroquine. Patients in the intensive care unit are also given
the drug if they have not received it earlier in their illness.

Dr. Leo Seoane, the chief academic officer at Ochsner Health, said the
health system had declined to participate in research trials that
included a placebo arm, in which some patients would be selected not to
receive the drug. “We didn’t think it was ethical at this point in the
crisis to withhold the therapies that could be beneficial,” he
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

But he acknowledged that even though the hospital gives the drug to
nearly everyone who is admitted, the percentage of people who end up in
the intensive care unit — about a third of those admitted — is similar
to reports in other places where the drug is not used. “From a gut
feeling, it’s hard for me to know that it is having an impact,” said Dr.
Seoane, who is also a pulmonologist and critical care physician.

Dr. Sarah Doernberg, an associate professor of infectious disease at
UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco, said she was selective about which
patients were given the drug. “It’s not an established therapy that
everyone should get,” she said. “I feel pretty strongly about that.”

A study of its effects in a clinical trial, versus a placebo, was
needed, she said. “We can figure out the answers to this question, so
that when people get sick months from now, we’ll know whether it will
work.”

Those trials are getting underway now, with[more than 100 studies of
hydroxychloroquine](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID&term=hydroxychloroquine&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=)
in patients with Covid-19 posted to a federal clinical trials registry.

A placebo-controlled trial financed by the National Institutes of Health
[began enrolling patients last
week](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine-potential-therapy-covid-19-begins)at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. That trial aims to
enroll more than 500 people who have been hospitalized. Several other
institutions around the country, including NYU Langone Health in New
York, are testing whether the drug can halt or prevent the infection in
people who are at high risk of getting it, or have been exposed.

The drug is also being dispersed more loosely through the Strategic
National Stockpile. Hospitals that administer drugs from the stockpile
must report on the patients who use them, but not through a formal
clinical trial.

Manufacturers have donated millions of pills to the stockpile, and are
ramping up production. But Mr. Trump’s promotion of the drugs [has also
led to
shortages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-chloroquine-trump.html),
and people who rely on hydroxychloroquine — like those with lupus and
rheumatoid arthritis — have had trouble refilling their prescriptions.

In an interview Thursday [with the Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2020/04/16/transcript-confronting-covid-19/),
the F.D.A.’s commissioner, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, said he has not felt
political pressure to favor hydroxychloroquine. “I can promise the
American people that F.D.A. will use science and data to drive our
decisions, always,” he said.

Those who favor conducting trials point to [several previous drugs or
therapies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-30/too-many-medicines-simply-don-t-work)
that were believed to show a benefit, until more evidence revealed the
opposite. In the 1990s, for example, [some states required insurers to
cover](https://www.cancernetwork.com/breast-cancer/health-insurance-coverage-autologous-bone-marrow-transplantation-breast-cancer)
stem cell transplants and high-dose chemotherapy treatments for breast
cancer, under pressure from patient groups and others. But those
interventions were later [shown not to be any better than less-invasive
treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3393031/).

Another risk, some said, was that if a drug were too readily available —
or portrayed in too positive a light — people may not want to chance
enrollment in a trial that risks getting a placebo, and not the drug.

Dr. David Boulware of the University of Minnesota said enrollment is
slowing in the national trial he
[is](https://med.umn.edu/news-events/covid-19-clinical-trial-launches-university-minnesota)overseeing
of up to 1,500 people to test whether hydroxychloroquine works
preventively.

He does not know why participation is slowing, but he added that Mr.
Trump’s message is not helping.

“He’s just saying, ‘You should take it, I should take it, everyone
should take it,’” Dr. Boulware said. “If he was promoting science and
promoting research, we would have had an answer weeks ago.”
