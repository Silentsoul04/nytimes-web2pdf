<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has repeatedly promised to fix New York’s archaic
unemployment-insurance system, which has been overwhelmed by an
[unprecedented wave of
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html).

The state has teamed up with Google to overhaul the online application,
added thousands of workers at call centers while expanded call-volume
capacity, and vowed to address outstanding unemployment claims within 72
hours.

Carly Keohane has yet to benefit from any of the improvements.

Ms. Keohane, who lost her waitressing job in Rochester, N.Y., has been
waiting a month to receive $2,124 in unemployment payments as a direct
deposit into her bank account.

But the state instead told her that the money had been deposited on a
state-issued debit card, which she never received. She cannot reach
anyone on the phone to find out where it is.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I call the Department of Labor every single day, and I know the options
by heart now,” said Ms. Keohane, 31, whose checking account was down to
$10.35. “It would be OK if I just knew where the money was.”

As the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-face-masks-andrew-cuomo.html)
and near-nationwide stay-at-home orders exact an astonishing toll on the
U.S. economy, [state unemployment systems have
cratered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-unemployment-benefits.html)
under a never-before-seen [deluge of jobless
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html).
In the past four weeks, [about 22 million workers filed jobless
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/business/economy/unemployment-numbers-coronavirus.html),
including about 1.2 million New Yorkers.

Unemployment systems, some of which rely on an antiquated computer
programming language that has largely gone the way of dinosaurs, were
not built for such a rush of claimants.

They also were not built for a new class of workers — independent
contractors and the self-employed — who are eligible for assistance
during the outbreak.

The results have been disastrous and maddening. Many people have had
their online applications crash before they could hit submit, requiring
them to start over from scratch. They have endured hourslong wait times
over several days only to be randomly disconnected, or connected with
representatives who say they cannot address their problems.

In other states, [including
Kansas](https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article242013491.html) and
Missouri, applicants say that they are still waiting for unemployment
payments to arrive, and that they have experienced long wait times on
the phone, as well as busy signals, disconnections and error-prone
online
applications.

Without unemployment assistance, they have relied on friends, family and
savings, if they have any, to survive.

For New York applicants lucky enough to get through and submit a claim,
some have been jolted awake at 2 a.m. by calls from the state Labor
Department seeking to confirm their identities.

Speaking in Albany on Thursday, the secretary to the governor, Melissa
DeRosa, said New York had been staggering under the weight of more than
a million claims for unemployment insurance, about four times the number
of people who lost jobs in the 2008 financial
crisis.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

“We are going to continue doing everything we can to bring the system up
to deal with this scale,” she said.

A Labor Department spokesman said on Friday that after the agency made
changes to its unemployment system, including updating its application,
its call center had made more than 470,000 follow-up calls to New
Yorkers who had not submitted completed claims.

Ms. Keohane was saving for a down payment on house. Instead, she has
withdrawn all of her money to pay for groceries and diapers and wipes
for her 2-year-old son.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She has debated whether to get groceries from a food pantry but she
cannot bring herself to do it.

“It’s not right for me to have to go there,” she said. “There are people
who are more needy than me.”

Amy Berryman, a playwright who was let go from a wine bar in Manhattan
last month, has not received the debit card the state said it sent her
weeks ago. Every week when she has to certify her unemployment claim,
she asks that her payment be deposited into her bank account. It never
has been.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

“I’m trying to spend $50 a week or less,” said Ms. Berryman, 31, as she
stood in line at a grocery store to buy fresh produce, which she has
been using to make lots of soup.

The $2.2 trillion federal stimulus that Congress passed last month set
aside especially generous benefits for those who recently lost jobs:
$600 a week on top of what states offer for unemployment. (The maximum
weekly unemployment in New York is $504.)

But the stimulus has exacerbated the problem for states, which are now
responsible for administering an enormous expansion of unemployment
benefits for previously ineligible workers. For the first time,
independent contractors and self-employed workers qualify
for<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>relief.

But in New York and other states, those workers are facing an extra set
of head-scratching bureaucratic obstacles.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Self-employed New Yorkers, for instance, must first apply for
traditional unemployment benefits even though they are not eligible.
Once the state denies their claim, they can then pursue the new
pandemic-related benefits available to them.

Jennifer Walsh, a self-employed hair stylist in upstate New York who
stopped working on March 14, submitted her application more than two
weeks ago. She is still waiting to be denied.

“Why is this even a step?” said Ms. Walsh, who added that many of her
friends in the hair business were in the same situation. “I understand
this is a new process for everyone, but in the meantime we are broke and
we have no answers.”

While she waits, Ms. Walsh has been using credit cards and her savings
to buy food and pay bills. “That will only go so far,” she
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

Ms. DeRosa said on Thursday that roughly 275,000 New Yorkers still had
outstanding unemployment claims, most of them self-employed, which
requires additional paperwork and confirmation.

State officials said on Friday that the federal government was requiring
New York State to confirm that those workers were not eligible for
traditional unemployment before processing their claims for pandemic
assistance. The state is working to create a single unemployment
application for such workers.

But challenges with New York’s unemployment system are just the start of
problems for many people who are out of work. More than a half-dozen New
Yorkers who recently lost their jobs told The New York Times that they
asked that unemployment payments be deposited in their checking
accounts, but received debit cards instead.

James Colón, who was let go from the Strand bookstore in Manhattan last
month, received one of the cards, issued by Key Bank, a regional bank
based in Cleveland. Its online banking system worked the first day, but
now shows an error message when he tries to log on.

Without access to Key Bank’s site, he cannot transfer the money into his
checking account to pay May rent. No one at Key Bank has been able to
resolve the problem, he said.

A Key Bank representative did not immediately respond to questions about
its unemployment benefits card. Other states, including Washington and
Indiana, also disperse unemployment assistance onto the bank’s cards.

The New York Labor Department had temporarily suspended direct deposit
payments because of back-end problems, state officials said. During that
period, the state issued the debit cards to ensure claimants received
payments.

“This situation is entirely unacceptable — we expect all our contractors
to responsibly and reliably deliver benefits for New Yorkers,” a Labor
Department spokesman said. “We will ensure every single New Yorker who
is entitled to unemployment benefits gets them.”

Bobbie de Matos, who lost her job as a server at a table-tennis themed
bar in Manhattan, received a Key Bank card, which she did not request.
It also does not work.

After calling the bank over many days, including holding for four hours
on one call, Ms. de Matos said she finally reached a representative who
told her that the card had not been assigned to her or anyone.

She needed to ask the state’s Labor Department to fix the issue, the
person told her. But the state said it was an error with the bank. A new
card is supposed to arrive in the mail soon.

She is hoping everything will be cleared up by next Friday, when she is
scheduled to move from Manhattan to Brooklyn and will need to pay the
movers.

“It’s a complete mess,” said Ms. de Matos, 23.

Long before the stay-at-home orders, Melvin Taylor II was let go from a
production position in New York City. He received a Key Bank card in the
mail late last year for his unemployment benefits.

Right as mass layoffs and furloughs began about a month ago, Key Bank
alerted him that it had detected potential fraud on his card and
automatically canceled it.

Mr. Taylor said he had not been able to reach a bank representative to
order a replacement card.

“You’d be on the phone three hours, 59 minutes and 27 seconds, and then
the phone would cut off,” Mr. Taylor said.

He has resorted to searching through coats and pants for loose change —
he found about $20 — and has experimented with cheap and filling rice
and pasta recipes.

“There are a lot of different spices that you can put in rice,” he said.
