*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Fernando Miteff liked his art so much, he gave it away.

Using the graffiti tag Nic 707, he was known for giving scraps of paper
adorned with his graceful letter designs and outlines to up-and-coming
artists to guide them, and to fans to thank them. And for the last
decade he did something most straphangers thought had vanished in the
late 1980s: He brought graffiti back to the New York City subway.

But this time, he did it by boarding a train, replacing ads with pieces
by some of the country’s best-known and most influential graffiti
artists, like Taki 183, and switching them back at the end of his ride.

“I wanted to bring a new ideology to graffiti,” he said in a [2015
interview](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/03/02/nyregion/a-graffiti-artist-turns-a-subway-car-into-a-gallery-until-the-end-of-the-line.html)
about his guerrilla subway car exhibits, which he called [InstaFame
Phantom Art](http://www.nic707.com/). “I didn’t want to leave a mark
that stays. I wanted to leave an impression. As long as you saw and
remembered it, I’m happy with that.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Miteff died on April 12 at his home in the Bronx. He was 60. The
cause was complications of Covid-19, said his younger brother Karim, who
managed his archives and was writing a book about Mr. Miteff’s graffiti
career.

In a culture known for egos and arguments, Mr. Miteff prided himself on
sharing his love of the art.

“He was always giving, giving and giving,” Karim Miteff recalled of his
brother’s early years. “He’d sit at McDonald’s doodling on napkins and
pass it out. He would be more apt to give away his work than to sell
it.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Miteff was born in Buenos Aires to Diana and Alexis Pablo Miteff, a
professional boxer who once fought Muhammad Ali and worked as a
television production manager after retiring. His parents had been
spending a year in Argentina before returning to New York.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Karim said his brother was raised in the Morrisania section of the
Bronx, where he started tagging at 12 after discovering a can of spray
paint in his home’s basement. He later founded the Out to Bomb crew, a
loose-knit group of collaborators, and influenced younger artists like
Serve and his protégé, NOC167, who went on to fame.

Though he spent much of his adult life working odd jobs, including
chauffeur and standup comic, he returned to the subways in 2009 after he
and a friend had a brainstorm; it led to his InstaFame project. His easy
personality and sense of humor helped him persuade collaborators — from
established to up-and-coming ones — even to paint pieces on the sidewalk
outside art openings.

“He was a funny dude, but he took a lot of people under his wing,” said
[Eric Felisbret, author of “Graffiti New
York,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/02/05/nyregion/05graffiti.html)
a survey of the city’s graffiti history. “He was completely into
graffiti for the love of it. All those panels he did, he could have only
written NIC and that would put him in the spotlight. Instead, he put his
love for the art in the
spotlight.”
