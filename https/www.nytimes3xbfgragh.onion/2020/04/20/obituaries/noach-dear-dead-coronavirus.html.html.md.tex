In pursuing his constituents' Orthodox Jewish agenda, he opposed
abortion rights and legislation to ban discrimination against gay
people.

Noach Dear, who served nearly two decades on the New York City Council
as an outlier, advocating on behalf of the conservative agenda of his
Orthodox Jewish constituents in Brooklyn while defending himself against
accusations of conflicts of interest, died on Sunday in Brooklyn. He was
66.

The cause was complications of the coronavirus. His death, at Maimonides
Medical Center, was confirmed in a statement by Frank V. Carone,
president of the Brooklyn Bar Association.

In 1986, Mr. Dear vigorously fought an anti-discrimination bill that gay
rights supporters had been seeking for 15 years. Among members of the
City Council's General Welfare Committee, his was the lone vote against
the bill,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1986/03/21/nyregion/homosexual-rights-bill-is-passed-by-city-council-in-21-to-14-vote.html}{which
was approved} by the full Council, 21 to 14. He was also an opponent of
abortion rights.

Mr. Dear was an outspoken critic of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/nyregion/david-dinkins-doesnt-think-he-failed-he-might-be-right.html}{David
N. Dinkins}, the city's first black mayor, accusing him of handcuffing
the police and letting black people riot in the Brooklyn neighborhood of
Crown Heights in 1991 after a car that was part of the entourage of the
Lubavitcher rebbe, or grand rabbi, swerved out of control and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1996/08/15/nyregion/the-case-that-rocked-crown-heights.html}{killed}
a 7-year-old black child, Gavin Cato.

The accident touched off a rampage in which a group of black youths
fatally stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum, an Orthodox Jewish scholar from
Australia.

Mr. Dinkins condemned what he called ``the lynching of Yankel
Rosenbaum'' and admitted that the police had made tactical errors, but
he denied that officers had been deliberately constrained.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1992/11/14/nyregion/dinkins-issues-appeal-on-crown-heights-debate.html}{Mr.
Dear} demanded an investigation of police tactics and later sought a
Council resolution denouncing the acquittal of the prime suspect.

Though enrolled as a Democrat, Mr. Dear was among those who bolted the
party to support the mayoral candidacy of Rudolph W. Giuliani, a
Republican, against Mayor Dinkins in 1993. Mr. Giuliani won narrowly.

Beginning in the 1990s, Mr. Dear raised millions of dollars for the
presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, as well as
soliciting contributions for himself.

Repeated
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1991/05/22/nyregion/noach-dear-master-of-overlapping-interests.html}{overlapping
interests} between his role as a councilman and politician and his
business investments and charitable activities prompted several
investigations into potential conflicts. His liberal allocation of
campaign funds for foreign trips and personal expenses also came under
scrutiny. No charges were ever filed.

In the 1980s, Mr. Dear opened a kosher restaurant that went bankrupt,
and in 1993 he agreed to repay more than \$37,000 to a private
foundation that had financed his home telephone and trips abroad for his
children.

As chairman of the Council's transportation committee, Mr. Dear
supported horse carriage drivers, many of whom were of Irish heritage,
over the objections of animal-rights advocates, who sought to bar the
carriages from city streets. He said he owed the Irish a great debt
because they had supported the founding of Israel.

In 1998, Mr. Dear sought the congressional seat vacated by Chuck Schumer
after Mr. Schumer's successful run for the United States Senate. But Mr.
Dear wound up third in the Democratic primary in which fellow Councilman
Anthony D. Weiner was nominated. (Mr. Weiner won the seat in the general
election.)

Term limits kept Mr. Dear from seeking re-election to the Council in
2001. The next year, he
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/08/22/nyregion/four-way-race-in-brooklyn-for-a-redrawn-senate-district.html}{lost
a primary} for the State Senate in a more racially diverse district. By
then he had so irked the party organization by repeatedly challenging
the seat's incumbent, Kevin S. Parker, that he had to wangle a
nomination to a judgeship on the Civil Court.

On the bench he handled as many as 100 credit card collection cases a
day, and estimated that in a vast majority of cases, credit card
companies and banks couldn't provide proof that any debt was actually
owed.

He also declared that a law against drinking alcohol in public
discriminated against racial minorities, and said the police would have
to prove through laboratory tests that a beverage contained alcohol
before serving a valid summons.

Mr. Dear was born on Nov. 20, 1953, the son of Sidney and Joan (Lipins)
Dear. After attending Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in Brooklyn, he graduated
from Brooklyn College with a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a master's in
social work in 1977. He received his law degree from Brooklyn Law School
in 1991.

Mr. Dear was district manager of the local community board, served on
the Taxi and Limousine Commission and was elected to the Civil Court in
2007 despite initially being
\href{https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/09/20/not-approved-but-noach-dear-is-victorious/}{rated
``not approved''} by the screening committee of the Brooklyn Bar
Association and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. He
was appointed an acting Supreme Court justice in 2010 and elected to a
15-year term on the State Supreme Court in 2015.

His survivors include his wife, Rickly (Neiman) Dear, a speech
pathologist, and four daughters, Rivka, Adina, Chaviva and Aliza.
