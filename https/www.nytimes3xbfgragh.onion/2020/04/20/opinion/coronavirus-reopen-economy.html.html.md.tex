\textbf{1.} Every day for the past two weeks,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{another
25,000 or so Americans} have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. It's
great news that number is no longer growing, but it's barely started to
fall.

\textbf{2.} Countries that have succeeded in containing the virus made
much more progress in reducing the number of new cases before
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/coronavirus-midwest-mayors-reopening.html}{reopening}.
``China did not allow Wuhan, Nanjing or other cities to reopen until
intensive surveillance found zero new cases for 14 straight days, the
virus's incubation period,'' as The Times's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html}{Donald
McNeil} writes.

\textbf{3.} The vast majority of the American population --- perhaps
about 90 percent --- has not yet been exposed to the virus. So there is
tremendous potential for outbreaks worse than any we have experienced so
far.

\textbf{4.} The testing program in the United States remains terribly
flawed. About a month ago, the Trump administration promised 27 million
tests would be available by the end of March. Late April ** is now
approaching, and yet only about 4 million tests have been conducted. The
current pace of testing needs to triple before the country can safely
reopen,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html?referringSource=articleShare}{Harvard
researchers estimate}.

\textbf{5.} We also haven't fixed our shortages of protective equipment
for health care workers. As a recent paper from the conservative-leaning
\href{https://www.mercatus.org/publications/covid-19-policy-brief-series/masks-all-using-purchase-guarantees-and-targeted}{Mercatus
Center} puts it: ``Demand has rapidly outstripped supply as the urgent
need for personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks,
respirators, gloves, and gowns, as well as for ventilators, continues to
grow apace with the COVID-19 global pandemic.''

\textbf{6.} Most places in the United States don't yet have a plan for
aggressive contact tracing --- the process of tracking people who may
have been exposed to the virus. ``Only a few states are recruiting and
training the army of public health workers who will be needed to track,
trace and isolate anyone exposed to the coronavirus,'' Politico's
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/18/trump-reopen-country-coronavirus-193182}{Joanne
Kenen} wrote. This kind of tracing has been vital to reducing the
virus's spread in South Korea and elsewhere.

\textbf{7.} The same goes for quarantining: We don't yet have anything
approaching a full plan. A recent Times Op-Ed, by the public health
experts
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart-quarantine.html}{Harvey
Fineberg, Jim Yong Kim and Jordan Shlain}, explains.

The bottom line: If the country reopened now, we would probably end up
in lockdown again soon, while also needlessly increasing the death toll
from the virus.
