ATLANTA — Residents of Georgia will be allowed on Friday to return to
the gym and get haircuts, pedicures, massages and tattoos. Next Monday,
they can dine again in restaurants and go to the movies.

With that announcement, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia on Monday joined
officials in other states who are moving ahead with plans to relax
restrictions intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, despite
signs that the outbreak is just beginning to strike some parts of the
country.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee said on Monday that he was not extending his
“safer-at-home” order that is set to expire on April 30. According to
his office, “the vast majority of businesses in 89 counties” will be
allowed to reopen on May 1. Businesses in Ohio are expected to reopen on
that date as well.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re going to do what we think is right — what I think is right — and
that is try to open this economy,” Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said Sunday
on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” “but do it very, very carefully so we don’t
get a lot of people killed.”

In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, said on Monday
that department stores and some other retail businesses that had
previously been deemed nonessential would be allowed to reopen on
Tuesday, but they must abide by social distancing guidelines. People
will also be able to gain access to public beaches on Tuesday.

Across the country, governors have been weighing steps toward lifting
orders and reviving their stalled economies. A lack of sufficient
widespread testing has been seen as one of the main obstacles.

At the White House’s coronavirus briefing on Monday, President Trump
reacted dismissively to governors who said they had scrambled to access
testing materials, such as nasal swabs and chemical reagents.

“Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand,” he
said. “That is a complex subject, but some of the governors did not
understand it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump specifically mentioned Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, a
Democrat, and Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican. He also framed
the debates around testing in political terms, saying that Democrats
wanted maximum testing “because they want to be able to criticize.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kemp, in his news conference on Monday, said that he had been
frustrated by the issue of testing capacity, but that he also believed
that the crisis had leveled off enough to ease restrictions and help
alleviate the economic anguish they have helped create. Georgia has had
more than 19,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 775 deaths,
according to state public health officials.

He said that stores were not reopening for “business as usual,” noting
that social distancing rules still must be enforced, and that businesses
should check employees’ temperatures for fevers and ramp up sanitation
efforts.

The move to reopen, he said, was “a small step forward and should be
treated as such.”

Mr. Kemp and Mr. Lee, both Republicans, were among the governors who
were criticized for being slow to impose statewide closure orders. Both
had expressed concerns about an invasion of civil liberties and the
economic strain that closing down large parts of the economy would
create.

Parts of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a string of barrier islands
whose beaches are popular with tourists, are also moving forward with
lifting restrictions for entry, officials said.

Emergency officials from Dare County, N.C., which includes the towns of
Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Southern Shores, said in a statement on Monday
that the decision was based on “careful consideration of the science,
trends, data and resource availability.” The county has had 15 diagnosed
cases, with one death, officials said.

In Ohio, even as plans were being put in place to reopen, a state prison
about an hour’s drive north of the capital became the largest-known
source of coronavirus infections in the United States, continuing a
trend of fast-moving outbreaks in crowded, confined spaces.

Officials said that at least 1,828 inmates — almost three-quarters of
the population — had tested positive for the coronavirus at the minimum-
and medium-security prison in Marion, Ohio. That is more than the number
of known cases from a [meatpacking plant in South
Dakota](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-south-dakota-meat-plant-refugees.html)
and a Navy [aircraft carrier docked in
Guam](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-navy-secretary-roosevelt-crozier.html).

“Once Covid-19 gets inside the gate, inside the door, it spreads, and it
spreads very significantly,” Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said at a news
conference on Monday.

Although there have been encouraging signs that the outbreak is
beginning to level off in some parts of the country, the threat is
continuing to grow in other states and regions.

Even in areas where the number of new cases is beginning to flatten,
they remain high: New York, which on Monday reported its fewest positive
tests in a month and its lowest one-day death toll in more than two
weeks, still had [4,726 new cases and 478 new
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html?type=styln-live-updates&label=new%20york&index=2&action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage).
And the country has added more than 25,000 new cases a day for the past
week.

In some parts of the country, there are signs that things are getting
worse, not better.

In Massachusetts, which has been particularly hard hit in recent days,
officials reported 1,705 new cases on Sunday, bringing the [state’s
total
to 38,077](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases.html).
Officials also reported 146 new deaths, which brought the death toll to
1,706.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Significant workplace-based clusters of known infections have been
reported in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Tennessee and other states, suggesting that the pandemic is just
beginning to sink into some communities.

[Nursing
homes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/19/nyregion/coronavirus-nj-andover-nursing-home-deaths.html)
and prisons also continue to be hot spots.

About one out of five confirmed cases in Ohio is now connected to the
state’s prison system, according to statewide numbers. The Department of
Rehabilitation and Correction said that as of Sunday, at least 2,400
inmates in the system had tested positive, and seven had died of either
confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infections.

No deaths have been reported among the inmates at the prison in Marion,
but one staff member there has died, and 103 employees have tested
positive. The prison [announced its first positive
case](https://www.drc.ohio.gov/Family/COVID-19-UPDATES), of an employee,
on March 29.

Pickaway Correctional Institution, southwest of Columbus, also had a
large number of confirmed cases, with 384 inmates and 64 employees
testing positive as of Sunday.

Despite warnings from health officials and attempts to [release some
inmates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-prisons-jails.html)
to prevent outbreaks, jails, prisons and detention centers have emerged
as major coronavirus spreaders. As of Monday, four of the 10
largest-known sources of infection in the United States were
correctional facilities, [according to national
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
collected by The New York Times.

More than half of the inmates at the Neuse Correctional Institution in
Goldsboro, N.C. — 458 — have tested positive for the virus, [county
officials said](https://www.waynegov.com/946/Coronavirus-COVID-19). And
there have been more than 600 cases involving inmates and staff members
at the Cook County Jail in Chicago, where [four inmates have
died](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-4th-ccj-covid19-death-20200420-fwwoavnzrzfznnymlebyq2umwi-story.html).

At one point last week, Chicago’s jail was the [top-known source of U.S.
infections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-chicago.html),
but other sources have since surpassed it.

The overall numbers inside prisons are most likely a vast undercount
because some state and local agencies have not released information
about cases behind bars, and others, including the federal Bureau of
Prisons, are not testing everyone who falls ill. In contrast, Ohio said
it was testing aggressively inside prisons where the virus has been
confirmed, extending tests even to prisoners who were not showing
symptoms.

“The reason that you’re seeing the numbers spike, of course, is because
we are massively testing now,” Mr. DeWine said. Prisons, or any place
where people were living together in close quarters, he said, present “a
very difficult situation.”

Dr. Amy Acton, the director of the Ohio Department of Health, said that
despite the large number of positive cases detected in the prison
system, many of the infected inmates were not sick.

“What was fascinating about some of that data was the amount of
asymptomatic cases we are picking up,” Dr. Acton said, adding that
neighboring states were getting similar results.

Rick Rojas reported from Atlanta and Michael Cooper from New York. Scott
Dodd, Sean Plambeck and Timothy Williams contributed reporting.
