MANILA --- Heherson Alvarez,who helped lead a campaign against the
brutal regime of the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and then went
on to serve in the national legislature after returning from exile in
the United States, died on Monday in Manila. He was 80.

The cause was complications of the coronavirus, said Joey Lina, a former
colleague in Congress.

Mr. Alvarez's wife, Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, an artist who was also
active in the anti-Marcos movement, contracted the virus as well. She
was reported to have responded better to treatment after the couple were
taken to a Manila hospital last month.

Heherson Turingan Alvarez, known as Sonny, was born on Oct. 26, 1939, in
Santiago, the Philippines. As a young activist, he participated in a
1971 constitutional convention at which he refused to sign the
Marcos-dictated Constitution.

After he and his wife fled to the United States, he helped organize the
opposition Movement for a Free Philippines. He was close to Benigno S.
Aquino Jr., Mr. Marcos's archrival, who was assassinated on an airport
tarmac in 1983 on returning from exile in the United States.

Public anger over Mr. Aquino's death snowballed into a popular revolt
three years later that ousted Mr. Marcos. He was replaced by Mr.
Aquino's widow,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/08/01/world/asia/01aquino.html}{Corazon
Aquino}, who was also close to the Alvarez family.

Mr. Alvarez was a member of the Philippine Senate from 1987 to 1998 and
promoted environmental causes there.

He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2001.
During that time he was the principal complainant in an impeachment case
against President Joseph Estrada, who was later removed in a
military-backed popular revolt over corruption charges.

Salvador Panelo, the chief spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said
his friendship with Mr. Alvarez had deepened during their time in the
streets opposing the Marcos regime.

Mr. Panelo said that Mr. Alvarez's activism had ``brought positive
changes in public administration, most especially in the field of human
rights,'' adding that Mr. Alvarez had been ``a passionate advocate of
the environment.''
