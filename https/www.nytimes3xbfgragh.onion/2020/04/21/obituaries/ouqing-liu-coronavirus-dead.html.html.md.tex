\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Liu Ouqing's life was one of service to his country. At a young age, he
joined the Chinese Army. He then worked in a state-owned factory, before
becoming a civil servant and a school administrator.

In the 1990s, as China was moving to open up its centrally planned
economy, Mr. Liu was party secretary of the Wuhan Grain Bureau,
responsible for ensuring that the city had enough to eat. Later, he
helped establish what is now known as Wuhan Business University.

Mr. Liu died of complications of the new coronavirus on Jan. 29 at a
hospital in Wuhan, said his son, Liu Pei'en. He was 78.

He developed symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, two
weeks after checking in to the hospital for his yearly health exam, and
died days later.

Not long after his death, local officials in Wuhan began pressuring Mr.
Liu's son to quickly bury his father, as the government was moving to
control the narrative of the outbreak. The younger Mr. Liu did not
protest, even though he resented being forced to share such a private
moment with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html}{government-appointed}
chaperones.

He did not want to ruin the reputation his father had built as an
upstanding public servant, he said. ``My father was a man of
integrity,'' the younger Mr. Liu said. ``All he wanted in his life was
to have a clean reputation.''

Liu Ouqing was born in 1941 into a poor family in Huanggang, a city in
the central Chinese province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital.

After finishing high school, Mr. Liu enlisted in the People's Liberation
Army in 1961 and built railways in the northeastern Chinese province of
Heilongjiang. In 1968, he went to Wuhan to work at a state-owned
machinery factory.

Mr. Liu joined the civil service in the late 1980s, and was soon
promoted to be party secretary of the Wuhan Grain Bureau. The job
involved frequent travel abroad, including a visit to the United Nations
headquarters in New York to negotiate prices on the import of grains and
oil to Wuhan.

Mr. Liu's life took a turn in 2000, when he was reassigned to work as a
manager at a vocational school. To Mr. Liu, it was a demotion --- ``the
consequence of offending the mayor,'' he later said in a memoir he was
writing for his family. His son said he had been punished for looking
into a bribery case involving a man connected to the Wuhan mayor at the
time.

Mr. Liu persevered in his new position, fighting to secure government
funding for the school, and playing a key role in merging the
institution with several others to establish what is now Wuhan Business
University.

He retired in 2006. In recent years, he and his wife began visiting
Sanya, a resort town popular among older Chinese for its sunny weather
and beaches.

On Jan. 6, before his annual trip to Sanya, Mr. Liu went to a hospital
in Wuhan for his health checkup. The day before, 59 cases of an
unexplained ``viral pneumonia'' had been reported in the city, but local
officials insisted there was no clear evidence of human-to-human
transmission.

By late January, he was hooked up to a ventilator and his blood oxygen
levels were plummeting. He knew that he would not be able to finish his
memoir, which he had hoped to give to his granddaughter as a life guide.
Without telling anyone, he ripped up the papers and stuffed them into
the pocket of his down jacket.

Not long after he died, his son found the scraps in his father's pocket.

``My life was that of an ordinary man,'' Mr. Liu had written. ``But it
has also been a life of striving.''
