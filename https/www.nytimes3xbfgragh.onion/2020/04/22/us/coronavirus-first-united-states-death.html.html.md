# Coronavirus Death in California Came Weeks Before First Known U.S. Death

The earliest U.S. deaths publicly attributed to the virus had been on
Feb. 26, when two people died in the Seattle area. Santa Clara County
said an autopsy showed a Feb. 6 death was also related.

SAN FRANCISCO — Officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., announced late
Tuesday that two residents there died of
the[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/science/ultraviolet-light-coronavirus.html)
in early and mid-February, making them the earliest known victims of the
pandemic in the United States.

The new information may shift the timeline of the
[virus’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/technology/coronavirus-treatment-benevolentai-baricitinib.html)

were infected with the virus. The presence of the disease Covid-19 was
determined by tissue samples and was confirmed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, county health officials said in a
statement.

“Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown
size,” Dr. Sara Cody, the county’s chief medical officer, said in an
interview. “It feels quite significant.”

Dr. Cody said the individuals who died in February did not have any
known travel histories that would have exposed them to the virus, which
first appeared in China. They are presumed to have contracted the virus
in the community, she said.

The newly reported deaths suggest that the coronavirus may have been
spreading in
[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-california-liberals.html)
much earlier than was previously known, said Dr. Jeffrey V. Smith, the
Santa Clara county executive and a medical doctor.

“It was probably around unrecognized for quite some time,” Dr. Smith

Much debate has centered on the question of when the virus arrived in
the United States and how early it began to spread among people.
Problems and delays slowed the availability of widespread testing for
the virus, which has [killed more than 40,000
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
nationwide.

In January, the authorities identified a series of coronavirus cases
from travelers abroad, but they did not identify any community spread of
the virus for several weeks.

The federal government had strict rules on who qualified for coronavirus
testing, and test kits developed by the C.D.C. — that public health labs
began receiving on Feb. 7 — [turned out to be
faulty](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html).
Strict definitions of who could be tested limited what local health
officials could do to find out how widespread the virus might
be.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“We had to ask the C.D.C. every single time: Does this person meet the
case definition? May we send a sample?” Dr. Cody said.

“We had this very, very uncomfortable feeling that we were hearing about
a lot of patients who really felt that they were cases but we couldn’t
test,” she said.

Other indications have emerged that the virus may have been spreading
earlier than previously known. The Grand Princess cruise ship that
departed San Francisco on Feb. 11 had passengers who developed the
coronavirus on board. Researchers believe that the virus also [began to
circulate in the New York
area](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html)
by mid-February. And in early March, researchers found a range of cases
with genetic similarities to each other in the Seattle area, suggesting
that it had been spreading undetected for weeks.

In Santa Clara County, Dr. Cody said that the picture of the spread was
becoming clearer but that there were still gaps.

“We had so few pixels you could hardly pick out the image,” she said.
“Suddenly we have many pixels that all of sudden that we didn’t even
realize that we were looking for.”

But, she added, “I can’t put the story together yet.”

On March 16, Santa Clara County was among the first counties in the
nation [to announce stay-at-home
orders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/us/california-covid-19.html).
“Clearly in retrospect that was a good decision,” Dr. Cody said. “Now we
see there was even more transmission than we recognized.”

Although California was an early state to report that individuals were
carrying the virus, it has had one-tenth the number of deaths as New
York State, [the hardest-hit place in
America](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
Officials believe that the early imposition of stay-at-home orders and
the state’s lower population density are among factors that [have helped
California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-shutdown.html)
avoid the worst so far.

Thomas Fuller reported from San Francisco and Mike Baker from Seattle.
