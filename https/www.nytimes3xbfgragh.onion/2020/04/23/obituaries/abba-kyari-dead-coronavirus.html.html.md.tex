As chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr. Kyari was a
``gatekeeper'' and ``loyal friend.''

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

DAKAR, Senegal --- Abba Kyari, the chief of staff of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/world/africa/aid-workers-executed-nigeria.html}{Nigeria}'s
president and one of the most powerful men in the country, died on April
17 in a cardiology hospital in Lagos. He was said to be 67.

The cause was complications of the new coronavirus, the Lagos state
government said. Senior government officials attended his burial the
next day in Abuja, the capital, and were criticized by medical officials
and health workers for doing so and for not practicing social
distancing.

Mr. Kyari amassed more power than any previous chief of staff in
Nigeria. Anyone who wanted to see President Muhammadu Buhari, including
ministers and Nigeria's influential state governors, had to go through
him.

``He acted forcefully as a crucial gatekeeper to the presidency,'' Mr.
Buhari said, who called him a ``loyal friend'' in
\href{https://twitter.com/MBuhari/status/1251567643909337089}{a tribute}
posted on Twitter.

Mr. Kyari also helped negotiate government deals and, according to
\href{https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/377757-updated-exclusive-buharis-team-in-disarray-as-nsa-monguno-declares-war-on-abba-kyari.html}{a
letter leaked} to a Nigerian newspaper, gave orders to security chiefs
without Mr. Buhari's knowledge. About a week before he tested positive
for the virus, he was in Germany meeting with energy officials at
Siemens on a deal to restore Nigeria's electricity grid.

Mr. Kyari was able to take on so much partly because Mr. Buhari, who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/26/world/africa/nigeria-election-results.html}{was
re-elected last year}, was frequently absent because of an unknown
illness. The two had met when Mr. Kyari was in his 20s.

A banker, lawyer and journalist before he went into politics, Mr. Kyari
was originally from Borno state in Nigeria's northeast. He studied
sociology and law in the United Kingdom, where he attended Warwick and
Cambridge universities. Geoffrey Onyeama, the country's foreign
minister,
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Q3uGqR3-s\&feature=youtu.be}{reminisced}
about attending discothèques and parties together at Warwick early in
their long friendship.

He was known as an erudite man with a ready wit and an open door. But he
was also known for being private, even secretive. He faced a variety of
allegations, including that he had taken a large bribe over a fine
imposed on a telecommunications company. He never responded in public.

Even his age --- 67, according to the president, who knew him for four
decades --- was the subject of much speculation.

He is survived by his wife, Hajiya Kulu Kyari, and their four children.

Being so influential brought power struggles.

When the first lady, Aisha Buhari, spoke cryptically of a ``few people''
who were controlling her husband's government, most Nigerians thought
she meant Mr. Kyari and Mamman Daura, the president's octogenarian
nephew.

On Saturday in a Twitter message offering condolences to Mr. Kyari's
family, Mrs. Buhari said she was praying that Allah would
``\href{https://twitter.com/aishambuhari/status/1251484410941255680}{forgive
his shortcomings}.''
