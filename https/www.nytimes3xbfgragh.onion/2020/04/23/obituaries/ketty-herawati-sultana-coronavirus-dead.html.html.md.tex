\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

A senior doctor at Medistra Hospital in Jakarta, Ketty Herawati Sultana
was known as a tireless physician who would treat anyone without regard
for her own welfare.

When Indonesia's transportation minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, arrived at
the hospital in mid-March with what appeared to be typhoid, she was part
of the team that treated him. His illness instead turned out to be one
of Indonesia's early cases of the new coronavirus.

Dr. Ketty and several other staff members soon contracted the virus
themselves, although its origin was never pinpointed. She died on April
3 at the hospital, said her daughter, Dr. Margareta Oktaviani. She was
60.

The death of Dr. Ketty, who spent her career at Medistra Hospital as a
general practitioner, highlighted concerns about the risks for medical
personnel treating coronavirus patients in Indonesia, where personal
protective equipment has been limited. She is one of at least 42
doctors, nurses and dentists in Indonesia who have died in the pandemic.

A native of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, Dr. Ketty had a reputation
for being kind and generous, but also for being strict and tenacious in
her work.

``Mama would treat any patient,'' her daughter said. ``She would not
think twice whether it's a patient with a contagious disease or not. If
it's a sick person who needs help, Mama would treat that patient right
away.''

Dr. Margareta, 29, said that her mother was a powerful influence and
that she had followed her example into medicine.

``I became a doctor because of Mama,'' she said. ``I saw how Mama helped
other people, how she was respected by other people and how she was
loved by her patients.''

A friend and fellow doctor, Anita Puspasari, recalled how one patient
was confused about whether to undergo a certain medical procedure. Dr.
Ketty personally took the patient to a doctor at another hospital to get
a second opinion.

``She wanted the patient to have a peace of mind,'' Dr. Anita said.
``She helped everybody.''

Dr. Ketty loved to cook and often brought food to the hospital that she
had prepared at home.

``She ordered us, her colleagues, to enjoy her cooking,'' Dr. Anita
said. ``She was a very pleasant person and kind. We all feel a very huge
loss with her passing.''

Dr. Ketty is survived by her husband and their three children.
