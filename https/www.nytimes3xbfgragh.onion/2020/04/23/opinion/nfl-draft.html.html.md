This year’s National Football League draft will begin tonight. As one of
the first normal sports events in months, it’s likely to get [huge
television
ratings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/sports/football/nfl-draft-virtual-past.html).
I realize that many readers of this newsletter may not be sports fans,
but I want to talk about the draft because it’s a fascinating window
into human irrationality, with lessons even for people who don’t like
football.

Here’s the brief version: Many people — including experts, with great
resources at their disposal — are shockingly overconfident about their
ability to forecast the future.

About 15 years ago, two economists, Richard Thaler (who has since [won a
Nobel
Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2017/thaler/facts/))
and Cade Massey, set out to study the history of the draft. They
analyzed where in the draft order different players were chosen and then
compared the order to the players’ later performance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Thaler and Massey discovered that, despite the time and money that
football teams devoted to studying players, the teams weren’t very good
at predicting who would be the best. Those chosen early often had less
impressive careers than those chosen later. The chance that a player at
a given position turns out to be better than the next player drafted at
that same position is only 52 percent, not much better than a coin flip.
Predicting the career paths of 22-year-olds in any field is hard.

Consider that neither of the past two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks
(Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady) were chosen at the very top, while
several recent \#1 picks (like Baker Mayfield and Jameis Winston) have
struggled.

And yet N.F.L. teams continue to treat the very top picks as far more
valuable than picks slightly further down. They’re often willing to
trade multiple picks later in a draft for a single pick near the top.
It’s irrational, and predictably so, but the N.F.L. teams can’t help
themselves.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Executives remember
the exceptions — the top picks who turned out to be as good as
advertised — and convince themselves that they can pull off another one.

“Even the smartest guys in the world, the guys who spend hours with game
film, can’t predict this with much success,” Massey has told me.
“There’s no crime in that. The crime is thinking you can predict
it.”

The savviest teams have realized they can exploit this irrationality by
trading one of their high picks for multiple picks lower down. They
effectively swap the ability to choose the one player they want for the
ability to take chances on multiple players. They embrace humility. The
Dallas Cowboys
[built](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/cowboys/2019/10/12/its-been-30-years-since-the-cowboys-traded-herschel-walker-to-the-vikings-fueling-a-dynasty/)
a championship team in the 1990s with this approach, and the New England
Patriots have done so over the past two decades.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Tonight, the teams with the most glaring opportunities to trade down are
the Detroit Lions (who pick third) and the New York Giants (fourth). The
Lions and Giants have also been two of the worst-run franchises in
recent years.

So allow me to suggest some [last-minute
reading](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&context=oid_papers)
for their executives — and for anyone who enjoys an unusually
well-written academic research paper. The official title is: “The
Loser’s Curse: Decision Making and Market Efficiency in the National
Football League Draft.”

**For more** …

  - The Massey-Thaler paper is part of a long line of research on human
    overconfidence. One famous experiment found that psychologists
    became more confident — [but no more
    accurate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/04/24/weekinreview/the-nfl-draft-a-study-in-cockeyed-overconfidence.html)
    — in their diagnoses as they received more information.

  - As [Maria
    Konnikova](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/lessons-from-sherlock-holmes-confidence-is-good-overconfidence-not-so-much/)
    wrote in Scientific American:

> We tend to be underconfident on easy problems and overconfident on
> difficult ones. In other words, we underestimate our ability to do
> well when all signs point to success, and we overestimate it when the
> signs become much less favorable, failing to adjust enough for the
> change in external circumstances. Second, it increases with
> familiarity. If I’m doing something for the first time, I will likely
> be cautious. But if I do it many times over, I am increasingly likely
> to trust in my ability and become complacent, even if the landscape
> should change (overconfident drivers, anyone?).

  - I spoke to Thaler yesterday, and he offered a prediction for
    tonight: If any high profile trades happen, the team that moves up
    in the draft will select a quarterback — and will pay the
    traditional market price in draft picks for doing so. (N.F.L. teams
    use a chart that describes [the supposed
    value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/draft_trade_value.htm)
    of each draft pick; the chart substantially exaggerates the value of
    top picks.)

  - The social psychologist Philip Tetlock has done extensive research
    into forecasting failures, including his book with Dan Gardner,
    [“Superforecasting.”](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227815/superforecasting-by-philip-e-tetlock-and-dan-gardner/)

  - “For more than a month, American culture has existed on a split
    screen. On one hand, movies and theater and travel and every other
    sport ground to a halt,” The Ringer’s [Bryan
    Curtis](https://www.theringer.com/2020/4/22/21230568/nfl-draft-quarantine-super-bowl-sports-media)
    writes. On the other hand, the N.F.L. keeps going — in part because
    it’s in its offseason. Curtis describes tonight’s draft as “the
    Quarantine Super Bowl.”
