## Halle Berry? Hallelujah.

### Hosted by Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham. Produced by Hans Buetow.

#### We come to terms with Halle Berry’s “Catwoman.”

Thursday, April 23rd, 2020

</div>

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m Jenna Wortham.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m Wesley Morris. We’re two culture writers at The New York Times,
    and we’ve got an experiment.

  - jenna wortham  
    And this is “Still Processing.”
    
    Get ready for a Still Processing watch-along.

  - wesley morris  
    It really is an experiment. We’re gonna —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    You and I are going to watch a movie together, and you guys who are
    listening to us are going to watch the movie with us.

  - jenna wortham  
    This week is very much about being in your living room, or your
    bedroom, or even your bathtub. Look, it’s up to you.

  - wesley morris  
    So Miss Wortham, what are we watching?

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. So there’s so many things we wanted to talk about, but
    ultimately, we were like, let’s pick something that’s definitely fun
    and funny, nothing bloody, nothing violent. There’s just way too
    much of that stress in the world right now. So, you know, something
    that’s incredibly low stakes, but also deeply, visually pleasurable.
    So Wesley —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    — who is the only celebrity that both you and I follow on Instagram
    right now?

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, it’s Halle Berry.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s Halle Berry. You know, so this is really a Halle Berry
    appreciation week, and we went through deep in her archives, and
    what did we pull out?

  - wesley morris  
    “Catwoman.” It came out in 2004. The Halle Berry, the Sharon Stone.

  - jenna wortham  
    Also, the looks, that leather outfit, their whips,
    rhinestone-studded acrylics. I mean, listen, there is a lot to get
    into here. Find a cozy place, get your favorite snacks.

  - wesley morris  
    It’s you, and Jenna, and me, and Halle Berry all on your sofa in
    your bed, wherever you’re watching this, and it’s going to get real
    intimate and real deep. Real deep. And I gotta say, this thing is
    going to be, you know, about two hours. Of all the things we’ve done
    on this show, this might actually be the blackest podcast thing you
    and I have ever done, Jenna Wortham, spending two hours talking.
    They’re going to fly. The fur is going to fly. The minutes are going
    to fly. You won’t even know the time has past. You’re gonna look up
    and be like, wait, this is over?
    
    All right. One second and we’ll be back with Pitof’s “Catwoman.”

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    So here’s how this is going to work. “Catwoman,” believe it or not,
    is on a ton of streaming services for the relatively low price of
    $1.99. So it’s on Amazon, YouTube, and iTunes, and a few other
    places. So the first thing you’re going to do is rent it. The next
    thing you’re going to do is queue it up on your TV or your laptop.
    It makes the most sense if you keep your phone handy with the
    podcast cued up and ready there. If you try to do both on the same
    device, it might be really challenging.

  - wesley morris  
    Once you’ve rented it, hit play, and then pause. Make sure that
    you’re set to zero minutes and zero seconds. And then we’ll tell
    you when to hit play so that we’re all watching the same thing at
    the same time. And don’t worry, if you have to pause or you think
    you’re off, we’ll be announcing the time code every once in a while
    so you can get back in sync with us. So hit pause on us, on the
    show, go get “Catwoman,” and then start us back up and we’ll all
    watch this thing together.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK? Everybody ready? Everybody good? Got your snacks? You got your
    drinks? You ready to do this? It’s going to be amazing\! So let’s
    all get ready for the 2004 — I can’t believe I’m saying this — super
    hero spectacular “Catwoman.”

  - wesley morris  
    This is going to be so good\!

  - jenna wortham  
    OK, on my count, we’re going to hit play. 3, 2, 1, hit play\! Wes,
    you rolling? I’m rolling. I’m seeing the Warner Brothers logo, the
    weird wavy undulations.

  - wesley morris  
    I can hear it in my headphones. I’m so excited.

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Your excitement is exciting me, I have to be honest.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] OK, y’all, we’re going back to 2004 when Halle Berry was
    essentially kind of still on top of the world. She had just won an
    Academy Award for her performance in “Monster’s Ball,” becoming the
    reigning only black Best Actress winner in the history of American
    movies.

  - jenna wortham  
    Still to this day.

  - wesley morris  
    Reigning champ. Reigning champ. Octavia can’t defeat her. \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Viola.

  - wesley morris  
    Viola can’t defeat her. Angela Bassett. Nope, can’t defeat Halle
    Berry. So she’s looking for something to do. She was just in the big
    James Bond movie, “Die Another Day.” She played Jinx.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. That’s right.

  - wesley morris  
    Famously arose from the ocean in the most delightful tangerine
    bathing suit. And you know, what are you going to do when you’re on
    top of the world and you have, the world is your oyster? You’ll want
    to make a statement, so what do you do? You’re going to do
    “Catwoman.” You’re going to break another barrier and become the
    first woman, in a long time, to star in your own superhero movie
    based on a comic book. And you’re going to be the first black woman
    to ever do that.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. That helps. That helps me understand the why for Halle. But can
    you help me understand the why it looks like this so far? Like, who
    is responsible for this?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, well, nobody can blame Halle Berry for how bad this movie looks.
    That would be —

  - jenna wortham  
    OK.

  - wesley morris  
    Jean-Christophe Comar, a.k.a. Pitof — P-I-T-O-F, the man credited
    with directing “Catwoman.” He’s a visual effects supervisor.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    And, you know, he did “The City of Lost Children,” he did one of
    your jams, “Alien Resurrection.” And he has been given the reins to
    Halle Berry’s make or break box office opportunity here. And I’m
    saying make or break because she is a woman and a black woman, and
    if this thing does not hit, her stuff might hit the rocks, and who
    knows what will happen if this movie bombs. We should be watching
    this movie thinking, is this what you do with your Oscar winner?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Is this —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — what you do with a woman at the peak of her career?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Is this it? Is this really it?

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. This is the million dollar question. You have all that talent,
    all that charisma, iconic hair, incredible physique, and this is
    what you do with it. Hm. Curious.
    
    It actually looks a lot like it belongs on the Beyonce album,
    though, like that imagery. Very familiar.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, you’re — this is —

  - jenna wortham  
    Very familiar.

  - wesley morris  
    You’re going to be saying that a lot during this movie, I suspect.
    
    What’s also, like what is remarkable — what is unremarkable about
    Halle Berry? Like, we’re supposed to believe she’s this shlubby,
    klutzy, average woman?

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s kind of her character from “Boomerang” though.

  - wesley morris  
    Yes, it’s true. It’s true.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s not that far from it.

  - wesley morris  
    For all you “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” watchers out there, that is Alex
    Borstein.

  - jenna wortham  
    Whoa, how old is Halle Berry here?

  - wesley morris  
    37 when the movie opens, and 32 when it ends.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    OK. We’re just going to stop talking right here because you’re going
    to get some really important villain exposition right here. So zip
    it, us.
    
    So in another movie, that’s what this would have been about, right?
    Old Sharon Stone being replaced by a younger model, and she turns
    into Catwoman and goes on a crime spree.

  - jenna wortham  
    I would watch that movie, too, though.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, I mean, it just doesn’t make — this, it doesn’t make any sense
    why — one of these women is extra. \[LAUGHS\] We don’t need Sharon
    Stone and Halle Berry in a Catwoman movie. We only need one.

  - jenna wortham  
    No, we need two. There could be more women. Why isn’t Angelina Jolie
    in this? Put May — like, put more people in this.

  - wesley morris  
    Were you going to say Maya Rudolph? Were you going to say put Maya
    Rudolph?

  - jenna wortham  
    I stopped myself. I did. I stopped myself. \[LAUGHS\] I stopped
    myself. I stopped myself. But J. Lo could have been in this, too.

  - wesley morris  
    What is about to happen right now — this is an Anne Hathaway moment.
    
    Jenna, can you talk about this outfit?

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s really setting us up for the reveal of the body-yody-yody in
    the costume, because we can’t see what’s going on underneath —

  - wesley morris  
    It’s a great point.

  - jenna wortham  
    — all those rags. It’s really setting it up —

  - wesley morris  
    It’s a good point.

  - jenna wortham  
    — for the makeover scene. But it’s hilarious. I mean, can you
    imagine, in any year, in any time, like, going to work dressed like
    that at an ad agency? I just don’t understand.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t understand.
    
    I miss Sharon Stone. This makes nostalgic for her.

  - wesley morris  
    We all do.

  - jenna wortham  
    Dang. She must be in New York City. That’s the truest thing about
    this movie.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, she’s not in Gotham. She’s not in Gotham, because at this
    point, that man would have long been here.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\].
    
    Wow.
    
    She’s so mousy.
    
    It’s so interesting, though, how the movies always equate, like —
    oh, wait. I got distracted. The cat — the first cat\!

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]. Wait, what were you going to say?

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, it’s just funny how the movies equate, like, a shlumpiness
    with, like, you know, like an unattractiveness? Like we’re supposed
    to believe that she’s a good person in this iteration of self
    because she doesn’t care about clothes, and she’s beautiful but
    doesn’t know it. She doesn’t know how to raise her voice, you know.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    My god, that apartment.

  - wesley morris  
    But again — again, where in Gotham is this?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. Let me enjoy the fantasy. It doesn’t matter. I just want
    to pretend I could live there, too.

  - wesley morris  
    But I mean, like, I don’t know what Gotham rents are, but I don’t —
    you know.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait, Wesley. This cat is sentient. It’s not a regular cat, right?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    This is the cat that came on the boat from Egypt.

  - wesley morris  
    Miss Wortham, just fasten your seat belt. Patience look out for all
    that bird poop\! Bird poop, Halle. Bird poop.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, don’t step on the AC\! That’s every New Yorker’s worst
    nightmare. No\! Oh, my gosh. I thought — oh, my god. I was promised
    this movie would be enjoyable and not stressful.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, who is that? Remind me his name.

  - wesley morris  
    Benjamin Bratt. That’s the Bratt right there.

  - jenna wortham  
    He’s so hot. Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    This is the nicest thing a cop’s ever done for a black woman since
    “Crash.”

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Actually, this is before “Crash.” This is the nicest thing a black
    woman’s ever done before “Crash.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Wow.
    
    He’s really jumping to a lot of conclusions. You know, it’s like —
    
    what?

  - wesley morris  
    OK, first of all —

  - jenna wortham  
    Is he supposed to be Batman?

  - wesley morris  
    How the hell did he get up to the fourth floor —

  - jenna wortham  
    That fast.

  - wesley morris  
    — of this building.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    And into the apartment, by the way, did she just leave the door
    open?

  - jenna wortham  
    We’re not supposed to ask questions. We’re just supposed to marvel
    at the miracle and the budding sexual chemistry between the two of
    them.
    
    What time of day is it, late for her job? What the hell?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t understand\! It is late afternoon, madam. We are — what did
    she drop? Oh, my god. Oh, wait. He’s going to get it. All right,
    cute. Cute. OK. This movie is full of deeply attractive people. I am
    more onboard than I thought I was going to be.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I mean, Benjamin Bratt is one of those people who’s so
    handsome, like, you don’t even know where to start speaking about
    how handsome he is.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. It doesn’t — like, I’m flabbergasted —

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, check this out.

  - jenna wortham  
    — when I look at him. Oh, here’s Sharon Stone again walking through
    this lobby looking like a whole ass snack. OK. OK. I — my only frame
    of reference for Sharon Stone is, I guess, most people’s frame of
    reference for Sharon Stone, which is “Basic Instinct.” But there’s
    so much more than that. Like, where is she at at this moment in
    time, Wesley? Can you help me — give me some context for her?

  - wesley morris  
    Well, I mean, you know, she was the face of American movies for
    about the first half of the 1990s. She essentially had one of the
    great five to six year runs of a lot of stars. Like unlikely, given
    how long she worked to get to the point where she was in “Basic
    Instinct.” She made “Casino” for Martin Scorsese in 1995.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Gets an Academy Award nomination. And she didn’t even win and it was
    all downhill for her after that.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hey.

  - wesley morris  
    And at this point, here she is 10 years after that “Casino”
    nomination, more or less, starring in a movie about being a
    washed-up beauty spokesmodel being replaced —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, no.

  - wesley morris  
    — by some unlikely brunette that her husband is sleeping with.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, Wesley. Can you imagine Ryan Murphy’s take, like a
    satirical take on the challenges of an aging Hollywood star who’s
    been wronged by her industry and turning it into primetime TV gold
    with the drama of his other properties, like “Pose” or “The
    Politician.” Ugh, chef’s kiss — like we need it.
    
    I love that this is what the movies think that office life is like.
    Just, like, hanging out in each other’s cubicles. I mean, they’re
    not wrong, but it just tickles me.

  - wesley morris  
    And now, Jenna, some “Catwoman” facts.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK, yeah. Because I’m riveted. I’m like, how much did this make in
    the box office? Like — I — yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, it made a grand total of $82 million, and cost, apparently,
    $100 million to make.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, yikes.

  - wesley morris  
    And they originally — I mean, it went through all of these different
    iterations of wanting different people to play Catwoman. Ashley Judd
    was mentioned at some point and didn’t do it. And eventually it just
    went to Halle Berry. It was made very quickly, by the way, because
    of all kinds of production problems, like getting it going.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mmm.

  - wesley morris  
    So I don’t know how many — I don’t know how much prep time Halle
    Berry even had to play the part.
    
    Oh, I hate — I love this effect. Remember, the director of this
    movie is a visual effects person. So he’s really bored out of his
    mind and needs something to do, and it’s not direct Halle Berry.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. He’s like, no —

  - wesley morris  
    So let’s make all the people disappear.

  - jenna wortham  
    — I want the time to be bouncing around. Yeah. And on the left,
    there’s a screen saver.
    
    Honey, why didn’t they film New York. What is going on right now?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Like why —

  - wesley morris  
    Because you’re working with a visual effects person. All he wants to
    do is, like, pee on the fire hydrant of this script.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. It’s very “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” You know,
    it’s like in another time, he would have had a lot of fun with that
    script. He’s way ahead of his time.

  - wesley morris  
    Yup. Meanwhile, when you were asking before if this is what office
    life is like, the answer is yes. Because anytime I come down to your
    desk and want to hang out, the punishment is I gotta stay at work
    till 9:00 at night.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    This is the corkscrew. This is what turns the crank. This becomes
    her — the driving engine, right, of Catwoman.

  - wesley morris  
    You know how, like, in real life those guys are probably really
    handsome, but in the movies they look generic? They just look like
    generic bad guys?

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. They put weird matte powder on their faces to make them less
    attractive. It’s like, if you splash them with warm water, you’d be
    like, damn.

  - wesley morris  
    You know, on the one hand it is kind of cool that Halle Berry is
    joining this lineage of catwomen. Now, the movie is making it seem
    like there is a lineage of actual cat women, but OK, the movie can
    do that.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    But on the other hand, she is joining this long family of other
    catwomen. It’s like, Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar on the TV show.
    And Michelle Pfeiffer perhaps most famously. And then there’s Anne
    Hathaway in the third Christopher Nolan batman movie, Batman —

  - jenna wortham  
    “The Dark Knight Rises.”

    “The Dark Knight Rises.” Thank you very much. On the other hand,
    Halle Berry is playing a Catwoman who has nothing to do with the DC
    universe. I don’t know where this woman is from. I don’t know what —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know what town this is. Like, we’re calling it Gotham, but
    we’re being real nice. Because, first of all, every other Catwoman,
    as far as I know, was named Selina Kyle. And they were all basically
    thieves and cat burglars. And they didn’t really have super powers.
    They just — like, it was a comic book. They just — they weren’t bad,
    they were just drawn that way, if you know what I’m saying.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    They were thieves who happened to have real agility and wall
    climbing prowess and that sort of stuff. And Batman was really into
    them.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. Yes, she does fall in chemicals, OK.

  - wesley morris  
    No\! Halle, no, no\!

  - jenna wortham  
    There we go. Is this how she becomes “Catwoman?” Is this the origin
    story? Does the cat have to fall in there with her, too? I mean.
    
    This is the only kind of suspense I like these days.

  - wesley morris  
    It’s not Spider-Man. It’s not Spider-Man or Spider Woman for that
    matter. Although, this might be up for debate when the action
    starts.

  - jenna wortham  
    But I feel like it’s a combination of Venom, and Mr. Manhattan, and
    like, I don’t know. Like it’s all of these things wrapped up in one.

  - wesley morris  
    He happened to be standing right next to the box, by the way.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god. He’s like a black woman in New York City? Nobody’ll miss
    her. It’s fine.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Just turn on the pipes.
    
    Well, honey, what underground labyrinth is this? Where —

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know. But you know what the truth is, Jenna, this is where
    they dump all the chemicals into the river. \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s not a water valve.
    
    That duct is for dumping the chemicals into whatever Gotham’s river
    is.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    That’s the villain bath.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wesley, doesn’t this part kind of remind you of “Lemonade” a little
    bit, Beyonce’s visual album? It looks very —

  - wesley morris  
    Uh-huh. Huh.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. It looks so similar. Do you think this was on Beyonce’s mood
    board for — oh, my god, a cat\! I mean, it’s entirely possible. Both
    characters, they are in this womb space. They are in this watery
    tunnel. They are going through this period of deep incubation,
    gestation. Halle Berry, just like Beyonce, journeying through an
    underworld. Dealing with Pluto. Dealing with Hades. I mean, very
    culty, very witchy. Look, I hope the link’s there. I approve. Into
    it.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh-huh. Huh.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s brilliant, Wes.

  - wesley morris  
    OK.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    So I do have some questions here. What are the real cats and what
    are the digital cats? And how long did Halle have to lay there until
    they all do what they were supposed to do?

  - jenna wortham  
    You know what I was just thinking though? This is the real “Cats,”
    and it’s better than “Cats,” you know.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] It’s better than “Cats.”

  - jenna wortham  
    These are the jellicles. Is that what they’re called, I forgot? This
    is the jellicle cats.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, that’s right.
    
    Oh.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s a real cat. That’s a real cat.

  - wesley morris  
    This is some cat wrangler’s proudest moment.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait, what’s it going to do to her?

  - wesley morris  
    Give her Covid.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] This is the origin story for Covid? No, that’s so dark.
    So I used to have a cat and it did this to me in the mornings. It
    loved sitting on my chest and breathe its cat breath into my face. I
    never had anything half this exciting happen as what’s happening
    right now.

  - wesley morris  
    So I wonder, if you’re Halle, you know, like, the reason you put up
    with being a mousy sort of klutz for the first 20 minutes of this
    movie, is that you know that you’re at some point going to get to
    kick some people and jump on some railings or something?

  - jenna wortham  
    I mean, Halle Berry had already been in superhero movies. I mean,
    she was in some of the best X-Men movies, in my opinion. “X-Men,”
    which came out, I guess, in 2000. And then “X2,” 2003, is that
    right?

  - wesley morris  
    Mm-hm.

  - jenna wortham  
    And she played Storm. You know, and it’s interesting actually to
    remember, because I love those movies. And in a way, she was kind of
    the weakest link there, too. And it’s not really her fault. They
    just didn’t really give her a lot to do in those movies. They gave
    her a bad white wig, and just made it really windy. \[LAUGHS\] Like
    remember, Cyclops is always like, Storm, a little cover, and she
    would grab the armrest and her eyes would roll back in her head, and
    then the fog would descend. And it’s like, word? OK.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. She was my favorite X-Man and —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    — that’s what happened to her.

  - jenna wortham  
    So maybe Halle read the script and was like, “I do want to crouch,
    crab walk down an alley, and look at some spiders in high def, yes\!
    I will do it.” Is this true to her origin story? Does she fall in a
    vat of chemicals. I’ve got to look this up.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m just like, does she get bit by the cat? Does she fall into the
    chemicals? I just need to know.

  - wesley morris  
    I love that you need to know this.

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m very curious.
    
    They do do that.

  - wesley morris  
    You would ask. You would ask. Let me rack my brain for a second. I
    don’t recall this happening to any Catwoman in any of Bob Kane’s
    editions of “Catwoman,” like even in subsequent editions. Catwoman,
    she just likes to steal things. She’s just a thief. No cats gave her
    a virus and turned her into an actual cat. As far as I know, the
    other women just liked to impersonate cats because it was a sexy
    thing to do, because she is the creation of men. No women had had
    any say in the creation of this character. She’s just being pulled
    on some strings by some dudes who — let me just read you what Bob
    Kane, the creator of Catwoman, thought he was doing when he invented
    this lady. This is Catwoman’s creator Bob Kane saying in his memoir,
    “Batman and Me,” “I felt that women were feline creatures and men
    were more like dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are
    cool, detached and reliable. Cats are as hard to understand as women
    are. You always need to keep a woman at arm’s length. We don’t want
    anyone talking —”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, god.

  - wesley morris  
    — over our souls. And women have a habit of doing that. So there’s a
    love/resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I’m
    being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel I’ve had better
    relationships with male friends than women.”

  - jenna wortham  
    I feel like this unnatural binary explains decades of sour
    relationships between men and women, and just, wow, it all goes back
    to the DC comic universe. I mean, this explains so much about the
    American psyche. \[SIGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, screw Jane Austen, we’re going for Bob Kane. Bob Kane started
    it all.

  - jenna wortham  
    Fully. Fully.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, is that not the house from “Up?” Isn’t that the “Up” house?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s the house from “Up\!”

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait. Who is this actress again? This is one of my favorite old
    scary ladies.

  - wesley morris  
    This is — \[LAUGHS\] Wait. Bite your tongue. This is Frances Conroy
    whose job it is now — I mean, between this movie and a couple of
    other horror movies and “Joker,” she was Joaquin Phoenix’s mother in
    “Joker.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, that’s right. That’s right. That’s where we last saw
    her.

  - wesley morris  
    But she’s most famous for playing the mother on “Six Feet Under.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh\!

  - wesley morris  
    This is one of the great parts, the “Six Feet Under” mother. But
    she’s just a cat lady in the movies. And I mean, literally, either
    like a sickly, crazy mom or a cat lady.
    
    I mean, I would love to hear Francis Conroy talk about this, because
    she’s a great stage actress. She’s very good on “Six Feet Under.”
    And she’s never had a part in any movie that’s as good as what she
    had on that TV show.
    
    Oh, no. Oh, boy.
    
    How do you act this?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    How do you act this? Like, if you’re Halle, how are you rehearsing
    this moment? Are you watching your cats do this?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Uff, uff.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. I’m trying to be on board with everything that’s happening in
    this movie, but can you riddle me this. Why is she turning into an
    actual cat? Like, no Batman in the history of Batman ever hung
    upside-down, right? I’m really trying to —

  - wesley morris  
    I believe Michael Keaton’s Batman does sleep upside-down —

  - jenna wortham  
    OK.

  - wesley morris  
    — to be fair. But he doesn’t eat, like —

  - jenna wortham  
    Flies.

  - wesley morris  
    Exactly. He can resist the urge to do other bat things.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK.

  - wesley morris  
    I do recall Michelle Pfeiffer in “Batman Returns,” bending over and,
    like, having herself some milk. Eartha Kitt has to growl or
    something, you know. It’s like, there is a small price to pay. But
    Halle Berry, the I.R.S. went after her on this one for the cat tax.

  - jenna wortham  
    She’s taking it to another level entirely.

  - wesley morris  
    This is my favorite Halle Berry version.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh dang. Oh.
    
    She’s like, I don’t care.

  - wesley morris  
    OK. We just saw Halle Berry do a thing that I enjoy when Halle Berry
    does, which is kind of tell somebody off and assert herself. And
    until that point, like, we have been waiting for her to do something
    to, I don’t know, kind of be the movie star we need her to be in a
    movie like this, and not this meek, passive, wet noodle of a person.

  - jenna wortham  
    But she still has so much less spice than when she does it in
    “Boomerang.” So, like, what is even going on here?

  - wesley morris  
    We’re coming up on a good minute to synchronize our watching just to
    make sure we’re all on the same page. So let’s get ready to check
    and see if that’s true. You ready? We’re going to be at 32 minutes
    and 45 seconds in 3, 2, 1, now. And we’ll do another one of those in
    about 20 minutes.
    
    I’ll just say at this point — we’ve been watching this movie for a
    minute.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Despite the things that we’re pointing out that aren’t right about
    it, there is one thing that I want to bring to our attention. She is
    surrounded by non-white people. Halle Berry is just living in a city
    where there are just some white people, and the white people who are
    there are just — are evil. Just planting that seed that Sharon Stone
    and Lambert Wilson are the bad guys, and everybody else, basically,
    is a peon who suffers because of them.

  - jenna wortham  
    Again, radical bones. Like, there are some interesting ideas in this
    superhero movie. It just feels like either they didn’t know what
    they had or they didn’t know what to do with it.

  - wesley morris  
    By the way, I want to say that Halle is channeling Janet Jackson in
    this first part of the movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, for sure. For sure.

  - wesley morris  
    She just seems shy in the way that Janet could pretend to be shy, or
    actually just be shy. Janet never pretended to be shy.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, boy. I love movie basketball kids.

  - jenna wortham  
    Definitely. It should be like a weird cliche and a trope but I just
    actually love it — oh, wait. I spoke too soon, because now we’re in
    a —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    What kind of music video is this? It’s like, it turns into a
    Destiny’s Child video.

  - wesley morris  
    Meanwhile, this is a Paula Abdul video.

  - jenna wortham  
    And these camera angles, what is going on here?

  - \[laughter\]

  - wesley morris  
    The editing and camera work here are just — this is not Halle
    Berry’s fault is what I’m saying.

  - jenna wortham  
    That dancing was her fault. I mean —

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, she did do some of this dancing. But I mean, she didn’t edit
    and shoot this movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    No, she didn’t. That’s not her job.

  - wesley morris  
    And that’s not her body either. \[LAUGHS\] She’s not doing those
    stunts.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s weird how no one’s reacting, though. Everyone’s just like,
    yeah, get it. Mm-hm. Fly through the air. It’s like, no.

  - wesley morris  
    Because it’s Gotham, Jenna. This happens all the time.

  - jenna wortham  
    True. The kids are used to seeing really weird things and just being
    like, it’s all good.
    
    But wait, Wesley. What kinds of movies were out around the time this
    movie was out? Was it really outrageous that a movie like this got
    made in 2004, or were people just kind of like, you know?

  - wesley morris  
    Well, what do you mean by a movie like this? Like a superhero movie?

  - jenna wortham  
    Everything we just saw —

  - wesley morris  
    Or just like a bad.

  - jenna wortham  
    Those camera angles. Yeah. Like a really cheesy, campy — oh, I love
    breakable glass. I love fake glass in movies.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]. I mean, this would have been the summer of 2004. So
    we’re talking like, “Kill Bill Volume 2” would have opened in
    April.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, OK.

  - wesley morris  
    The best of the Harry Potter movies, Alfonso Cuaron’s “Prisoner of
    Azkaban” —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — would have opened —

  - jenna wortham  
    Damn.

  - wesley morris  
    — I think, like, earlier in June. “Collateral” would have come out a
    couple weeks after this movie with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the
    great Michael Mann movie. And this was — I mean, just to give you a
    sense of what else was in the movies that whole year, 2004, if
    memory serves, is the year of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
    Mind” —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — “The Aviator,” “Million Dollar Baby” is that year.

  - jenna wortham  
    Dang, OK. So there were some high caliber pictures out. Like, the
    bar was set and it was a lot higher than an RC Cola commercial,
    which is what I feel like we just watched. So —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    To add insult to injury, Jenna, this is also the same summer as
    “Spider-Man 2,” which is the best of the Spider-Mans — of all the
    Spider-Mans I would say. And one of the great action sequences, in
    that train sequence, of all time.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh\! Is that the one where Tobey Maguire single-handedly zooms down
    and stops the train — the elevated train somewhere in Manhattan with
    one hand, and it’s just like, the most epic sequence ever?

  - wesley morris  
    Yes. Yes, that is it. And then he’s like totally spent. And the
    passengers in the train car hoist him up like he’s Jesus at the —
    it’s just like —

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s the most I heart —

  - wesley morris  
    It’s beautiful.

  - jenna wortham  
    — New York iconic scene ever. So good, so good.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.
    
    Oh, she’s about to go off.

  - jenna wortham  
    She’s not having it.

  - wesley morris  
    He looks like Gerard Butler.

  - jenna wortham  
    Everybody in this movie, except for Halle and Sharon, is like a
    budget version of something else. They spent all the money on the
    visual effects. They couldn’t afford casting anybody else.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, every ounce of this movie is a budget version of something
    else.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh gosh. I can’t stop thinking about the fact that “Kill Bill” was
    out at the same time. I mean, what does it say that this is, like,
    her ultimate first act of bad-assery. She sprays soda water on a
    speaker. Meanwhile, Uma is learning to, like, drive a car with her
    tongue or whatever happens in that movie. It’s just like —

  - wesley morris  
    Look —

  - jenna wortham  
    — jeez Louise.

  - wesley morris  
    — I think this is the first time she whips somebody.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, god.

  - wesley morris  
    The fizzer is where she gets this idea to start whipping people.
    
    I think that there’s something interesting about her becoming
    Catwoman and also becoming, like, black in a way.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know if you are feeling this the way I’m feeling it. But
    this is partially Halle Berry’s performance strategy in general. And
    it definitely creates this imbalance, in this particular
    performance, where whenever she gets angry, she gets more
    interesting. And that’s Halle Berry in a lot of things.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    When her back’s up against the wall, when she’s a cornered cat,
    basically, and she has to hiss at somebody, that is her best mode,
    anger. But having her go from mousy to catty —

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    — it’s not much of an acting challenge, and from a character
    development standpoint, it’s not that interesting under the
    circumstances.

  - jenna wortham  
    I feel like this is how you know, though, that those movies were
    written by men. OK, hashtag not all men. But I do feel like only
    those men can really understand a woman stepping into her power and
    a woman becoming embodied and more powerful and aware of herself.
    They can only read that as, like, a turn for the bitchy, a turn for
    the mean, a turn for the cold, which is really unimaginative and
    boring, but it sounds very true to what Bob Kane imagined. So look
    at the material, honey. Look at the material.

  - wesley morris  
    Now, I do have a question. Like, what kind of cat is she, by the
    way?
    
    Like, she’s both a feline cat, but also she’s a dominatrix cat.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Now, I don’t get it. Like, make up your minds, y’all. Now, there is
    in the DC universe, there is a dominatrix, prostitute —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    — version of Catwoman.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. But I would also argue that this is the only way they can
    imagine a very sexy woman. She has to be a hooker or a dominatrix.
    Like, it just can’t be something that is just naturally imbued into
    a woman. So most of the women, at least in the DC comic book
    universe who make it into the movies, they’re always deeply
    traumatized. They have really ugly histories of abuse. I’m thinking
    about Harley Quinn. I’m thinking about Poison Ivy, who was actually,
    low key, the coolest villain. Like, she’s an eco-terrorist. You
    know, I really, actually, shout out to Uma Thurman who also played
    her. But they always have these deep-seated issues that never,
    really, are dealt with. They only manifest as them acting out or
    being pathologized as sort of the motivation for their criminal
    intent. Whereas Halle Berry’s Catwoman, Patience, she’s outside of
    all of that, and she has a very different origin story that doesn’t
    place her as someone who was quote, “insane.” And the only other
    person, really, that comes to mind who had that same classification
    was Wonder Woman. But she’s literally not from planet Earth. She’s
    literally descended from a Greek god. So those are the dichotomies
    of women that make their way into these superhero movies.
    
    OK, wait, Wesley. Are there any women superheroes in either of the
    comic book universes who aren’t just obsessed with, like, narcissism
    or petty crime. I mean, I know there’s Captain Marvel. But I feel
    like this is, when I’m thinking of, like, Poison Ivy and Catwoman,
    they’re all just, like, petty thiefs who use their powers just to,
    like, go shopping, essentially.

  - wesley morris  
    This is a great —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    — question. But it’s funny that you mention this about the movies
    starring comic book characters. Because they don’t really have a
    world-saving purpose. This is the appeal of Wonder Woman, right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Wonder Woman is sort of aimed at a higher purpose. But my favorite —
    one of my — I mean, Storm is one of my favorite comic book
    characters. And as I’ve told you many times — you already know this
    — I think that there’s a whole Storm X-Men arc where she loses her
    powers and is basically marooned in the comic book, essentially,
    with this character named Forge, whose ability —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, right.

  - wesley morris  
    — he’s got this architectural mutant ability. Their love affair is
    so hot and steamy. Halle Berry is still old enough to play Storm.
    
    I would love to see that.

  - jenna wortham  
    I think this is the right thing to do. This is logical. It makes
    sense to me. We don’t know her backstory. We don’t know who her
    people are. She has no one she can trust. She’s, like, I gotta look
    up diabolical cats because I feel like I’m a witch. I feel like I’m
    seeing some things.

  - wesley morris  
    But bad filmmaking is basically telling us what we already know. We
    already know what her problem is. And now it has replay —

  - jenna wortham  
    I just don’t like when movies reuse —

  - wesley morris  
    — the opening —

  - jenna wortham  
    — the title sequence.

  - wesley morris  
    — title sequence?

  - jenna wortham  
    Exactly. Yes, I’m there with you\! That is a pet peeve. That is a
    movie pet peeve of mine. It is so lazy.

  - wesley morris  
    No pun intended, but it should be everybody’s pet peeve.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. Now we’re getting somewhere.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    She —

  - wesley morris  
    She’s just I need some answers.

  - jenna wortham  
    — found a clue. She found a clue.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m going back back —

  - jenna wortham  
    She’s back at the “Up” house.

  - wesley morris  
    — to the “Up” house.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] I love that actress, oh.

  - wesley morris  
    Frances Conroy. I’m telling you, man.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. Oh wait. Here we go. We’re about to learn something.
    
    Right. She did die.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, and this movie killed you.

  - jenna wortham  
    This movie killed more than your character.
    
    Yo, shout out to crazy cat ladies, though. They have a bad rap as an
    arch — oh, my god, this sequence. They have a bad rap as an
    archetype, but they always be knowing.
    
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh. What is this, downward cat?

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. All right. All right. I’m going to say something controversial.
    I’m actually kind of really into the mystical element. I’m into the
    idea that she’s part of this lineage of magical relationships
    between women and this Egyptian goddess, Bast. I actually kind of
    like that she gets her powers from cat breath. I like this. I like
    this better than the idea that they’re just a petty thief, like Anne
    Hathaway’s Catwoman or Eartha Kitt’s Catwoman. I’m appreciating
    this.
    
    Oh, man, I’m so deep in corona that I’m like, it’s the wrong kind of
    mask\!

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] But wait, can we just back up to talk about what Frances
    Conroy just said to Halle Berry? She said —

  - jenna wortham  
    No, what did she — Yeah, I mean, tell me.

  - wesley morris  
    Cat women are not controlled by the rules of society. You follow
    your own desires. This is both a blessing and a curse\! You’ll often
    be alone and misunderstood, but you’ll experience a freedom other
    women have never known.

  - jenna wortham  
    And how was that striking you?

  - wesley morris  
    As a bunch of BS. But I hear the movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    I’m not saying that what she’s saying isn’t true, but the movie,
    it’s not as though this is a story of Kelly Rowland finding her
    Michelle and Beyonce, right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right, right, right.

  - wesley morris  
    Again, speaking of which, more of that Beyonce knock-off.

  - jenna wortham  
    This is your movie pet peeve, actually. Oh, my god, wait. Just take
    in this whole outfit.
    
    Now, I think this is still a fire look. I love this one the first
    time I saw it, and I love it even now.

  - wesley morris  
    So if you’re Pitof at this point, how you use an Oscar winner is you
    turn her into a special effect, because that’s what you do. You
    don’t know how to direct actors. You know how to direct computer
    programming. So why not take a person and turn her into that?
    
    You know, it’s funny, right after this movie comes out, maybe like
    the next year, is “Aeon Flux” with Charlize Theron, which was
    directed by Karyn Kusama —

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    — and it was another bomb. I believe “Aeon Flux” is a movie you like
    a lot, right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. I was obsessed with the movie when it came out. And I still
    watch it regularly. I know it’s not good, but I still enjoy it.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, between that movie and this one, I mean, thank god for Uma
    Thurman. But the second “Kill Bill” was pretty much it.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know.

  - wesley morris  
    No more fighting for women at that point. We’re done. That’s not
    entirely true, but it just sort of lowered — it dimmed the prospects
    for women being able to fight for a long time, for at least a few
    years in movies.
    
    That is a sexy bartender. Sexy bartender alert.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] Wesley’s like, you know, I never thought I’d say this,
    but I’m excited to be in a bar again.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    Ew, she just wants a glass of milk. Ew.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I mean, the messed up part about this, though, is that the theory is
    that she’s going to be able to give in to her desires. But they’re
    not her desires. They’re these, like, ideas of what a cat wants.
    Tuna as much as you can eat out of a can, milk — a glass of milk.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    And you know, so.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, what is your favorite nightclub sequence in a movie, because
    there’s so many bad ones, and this is definitely one of them.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. This is one of the worst ones.

  - wesley morris  
    Who’s going to the club to do any of this stuff?
    
    Now seems like a pretty good time for a fun fact.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah, hit me.

  - wesley morris  
    You ready, Jenna? When “Black Panther” came out and Michelle Obama
    had tweeted how proud she was to have “Black Panther,” there was
    this, like, mini, tiny ripple of, like, well, where were all those
    people for “Catwoman” when that came out?

  - jenna wortham  
    Excusé moi\! I’m sorry. “Catwoman” does not have Winston Duke. It
    doesn’t have Letitia Wright. It doesn’t have Danai Gurira. I mean,
    should I keep going? It didn’t have Ruth Carter at the helm with the
    costumes. I mean, come on.

  - wesley morris  
    Lupita?

  - jenna wortham  
    Like, that’s not a one-to-one. We’re not dealing with apples to
    apples here, folks, at all.

  - wesley morris  
    So then one of the screenwriters of this, of “Catwoman,” this guy
    named John Rogers tweets, “As one of the credited screenwriters of
    ‘Catwoman,’ I believe I have the authority to say, because it was
    a shit movie dumped by the studio and had zero cultural relevance in
    front of or behind the camera.”

  - jenna wortham  
    It sounds defensive, and it sounds like he’s embarrassed, and it
    sounds like — it sounds like he’s got some P.T.S.D. to work through,
    and I wish him all the best in resolving it.

  - wesley morris  
    He does, because he complains in a different tweet that this kind of
    ruined his career and he barely worked after this movie came out.

  - jenna wortham  
    All I have to say is at least it wasn’t just Halle. At least —

  - wesley morris  
    No, white men suffered, too.

  - jenna wortham  
    There you go. At least the blast radius was big enough. And I know
    that’s unkind to say, but I often feel like usually the only people
    that suffer or pay the price for this kind of bomb are not the women
    or women of color. So at least, you know, it wasn’t just her.

  - wesley morris  
    OK. Another time check. We’re going to be at 57 minutes and 5
    seconds in 3, 2, 1, now.

  - jenna wortham  
    I feel like it’s also appropriate to tell you that I have a little
    bit of wine next to me and I just took a sip. OK, I just want you to
    know that. Once the alpha came on, I took a little bit of a sip of
    my white wine. OK. So I was waiting for that part because I just
    needed to feel — you know?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I knew I was going to get excited. OK. So in preparation for our
    watch-along, I was like, what do I need to know about Halle Berry?
    And then I was like, what happened with Halle Berry and Eric Benét
    again? So that was where my research took me. Nothing useful about
    her film career. I just was like, what happened in that
    relationship? And I found this interview with her and Oprah, and she
    was saying that right after she got the Oscar is when she found out
    that Eric was having all those affairs. And so she went into triage.
    She couldn’t even celebrate having the Oscar. She went into triage
    on her relationship. And it wasn’t just one woman. He was having
    affairs the whole time they were together. So I don’t know. Maybe
    she felt like she wanted to show him what he was missing. I mean,
    you’re Halle Berry and it’s all over the news that your man is
    cheating on you. That’s a real kick to the ego. So maybe she was
    like, Listen up, one word French director, I know I have an Oscar. I
    don’t care. I want to make this movie, and I want to be in the
    sexiest costume your budget can handle. And he was like, Oui, oui.
    OK. I mean —

  - wesley morris  
    I hear that. OK. \[LAUGHS\] I hear that. Uh-oh. Advice. Advice, here
    we go.
    
    You can say her hair — (SINGING) can buy her hair, but it won’t
    grow. You can fix your nose if he says so. You can buy all the
    makeup that Mac can make.

  - jenna wortham  
    (SINGING) But if —

  - wesley morris  
    You got to fill out your —

  - jenna wortham  
    Who is that?

  - wesley morris  
    Beau-Line It’ll turn you un-pretty.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, look. He solved the case just like that. He’s like —

  - wesley morris  
    No, no. No, Jenna. No, Jenna. No, he didn’t, actually.

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    They’re like, it’s not enough that we show you she’s changed. It’s
    not enough that we —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    — tell you she was brought back to life. We’re going to analyze her
    handwriting so that you know, in fact, there was a before and there
    is an after.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. City Side Community Center, by the way, which is just
    like movie talk for black and Latino.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    It’s just so weird what the close-ups are of. Do you know what I
    mean? Like, did we need a close-up of the bullseye and the bottles?
    
    Look at this. Look at this, Jenna. This is just some straight-up
    inner city sadness.

  - jenna wortham  
    Looks like New York, though. I mean — it looks like the kind of
    Ferris wheel you would never get on if you valued your life, you
    know. Like you would just, no.

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    You would not —

  - wesley morris  
    Look at this. It’s in a parking lot.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. Oh, no.

  - wesley morris  
    My question is what is he going to do?

  - jenna wortham  
    This is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I know, right?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] It is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I mean, even her moves
    at that — I mean, remember when she robbed — when she beat up the
    burglars at the jewelry store?

  - jenna wortham  
    Uh-huh.

  - wesley morris  
    All those moves were Spider-Man moves.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, yeah. That’s true. That’s true.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. That poor actor.

  - jenna wortham  
    I still think this looks cool. I’m just going to be honest. I think
    this looks cool.
    
    Oh, right. He escaped, so he actually didn’t see her do all that, so
    her powers are still secret.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s right.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. I mean, the purpose of the scene is just to let us know that
    she’s not just obsessed with petty crime. That there is kind of some
    sort of moral compass inside of her that does orient her towards
    doing good, even though she still wants to steal shiny jewels. Which
    I guess cats like, too. That was in the movie “Cats.” Cats like
    rings, so you know, can’t help them.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Can’t blame them.
    
    Do you remember how obsessed black women were with the Halle Berry
    haircut? It was like our Rachel. Like, that haircut —

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    — you know —

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    — my sister had it. I didn’t have the right texture for it so I
    couldn’t have it. But to have that, like, really short, feathered,
    pressed in the front, and like, windswept in the back. That was such
    a thing.

  - wesley morris  
    Mary J., T-Boz.
    
    By the way, for anybody who’s been wondering where Sharon Stone’s
    been the whole time, she’s been golfing.

  - jenna wortham  
    In a really gorgeous set of TLC satin pajamas.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, yes, Jenna\! It’s T-Boz’s crepe pajamas\! It’s worth pointing
    out that we’ve been spending all this time in a movie whose villain
    is ostensibly a beauty product and the people who make the beauty
    product.
    
    How many days do you think it took them to get this scene right in
    rehearsal?

  - jenna wortham  
    Not enough, if you ask me. I mean, I would spend the whole time on
    this scene.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I mean, this is the most exciting thing that’s happened in this
    movie.
    
    Oh, wait. Is she going to recruit Sharon Stone in her take-down
    mission?

  - wesley morris  
    Let’s see.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, this is so Batman, though.

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t trust her.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, oh, oh. What? Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    Meanwhile, this show is called Hydropolis.

  - jenna wortham  
    But this is the most Batman thing about this movie, though. There’s
    always —

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    — like a showdown at some big gala in the middle of Gotham. Whether
    it’s Uma Thurman, again, as Poison Ivy or whatever, there’s always a
    moment.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. This is very, like, Tim Burton — this is like Joel Schumacher
    Batman —

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    — quality.

  - jenna wortham  
    Is it racist they gave her acrylics? I don’t know.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    They gave her diamond acrylics. Hmm. I’m OK with it.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my lord. Oh, my lord.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh my god Cirque du Soleil\!

  - wesley morris  
    OK. This scene is just — this is like one of my number one
    complaints about the movies. You know you’re watching a lazy-ass
    movie when there are people fighting on some sort of light bridge,
    or like in the rafters of someplace. I know movies think this is
    exciting because it’s probably tough to choreograph, but boy, is it
    lazy. I mean, if you’re up there, I know it’s supposed to show off
    what the choreographer can do, but you know what the hell is going
    to happen. Somebody’s going to fall off the rafters. Or they’re
    going to get so shaky that somebody’s going to drop a weapon and
    then they’ll have to have hand-to-hand combat.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    It’s just so lame. It’s so lame.

  - jenna wortham  
    You’re saying it’s predictable and that’s what bores you.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I’m not impressed by this. That don’t impress me much.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s fair.
    
    Well, Wesley, I see your pet peeve and I raise you one, which is how
    do these people not know that the person that they’re fighting is
    their lover or their neighbor or their best friend? I mean, these
    costumes are not that concealing.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    You know what I mean? I’m just like, come on, y’all. Superman, Clark
    Kent, like, side by side for real. Spider-Man, OK, I get it. He’s
    fully covered. But also it’s clearly Halle Berry. It’s clearly your
    boo Ben. Get it together.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I mean, at least with Lois Lane, I could get it because Margot
    Kidder was just on some other stuff with Christopher Reeve Superman.

  - jenna wortham  
    Sure. OK, sure. Yeah, glasses really conceal a lot. Yeah, no, I get
    it.

  - wesley morris  
    I also think that Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane was into having two
    lovers, right? She was into —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    — into having this dual relationship. She didn’t need to tell us
    that that was what was on her mind, but I think she kind of knew.

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, that I’m on board for. That is fine.

  - wesley morris  
    But I don’t know. Benjamin Bratt, I think he just might not be smart
    in this movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    These spotlights are getting an awful lot of close-ups, by the way.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] I’m just blocking out all the close-ups.

  - wesley morris  
    Can cats see in the dark?

  - jenna wortham  
    I think so. I mean, they’re definitely nocturnal. They like to do
    things at night.

  - wesley morris  
    I do think if anybody did their research on anything, it was
    probably what things do cats do?

  - jenna wortham  
    I know.

  - wesley morris  
    It’s the only thing this thing gets right.
    
    Again —

  - jenna wortham  
    Wow.

  - wesley morris  
    — why is Sharon Stone getting the best clothes in the movie?

  - jenna wortham  
    That was in her contract, a hundred percent.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    She was like, I don’t care what Halle wears, but I will be in
    Versace knockoffs.

  - wesley morris  
    I think if it’s Sharon Stone, though, the budget might have gone to
    Versace.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know. I know. All the budget went to Versace and that leather top
    that Halle’s wearing. I’m fine with it.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh. She’s the terminator.

  - jenna wortham  
    What just happened there? Did I miss something? Is her face really
    hard?

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Beau-Line she’s like, she’s Beau-Line’d out. (SINGING)
    Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line. Please don’t make me hit
    you one more time.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wow.
    
    Gosh, I have such a hard time when Alex Bornstein talks because I
    just see the mom from “Family Guy.” It’s ridiculous.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    Because she does voice that character.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, boy.
    
    Halle, we need you to act like a cat looking at fish who just wants
    to get in the tank.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Can you do that?
    
    And now we need to really — we need you to really enjoy this sushi.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, no. Oh, no. I’m uncomfortable.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Exactly. So am I.

  - jenna wortham  
    I guess she hasn’t eaten the whole movie from the time we saw the
    tuna until now, so she is pretty hungry.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s weird that, like, the assumption is cats have no control of
    their impulses. Have you ever been around a cat? They are the most
    studious creatures.

  - wesley morris  
    But that’s — she’s going to age into Frances Conroy is what’s going
    to happen.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. That’s her future. Got it.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s her future. That’s my guess.
    
    Jenna, I don’t know what your temperature is right now. My blood
    pressure just is plummeting. So this seems like a pretty good time
    to talk about how Halle Berry’s best parts have come from either
    Oprah Winfrey or cable television.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, right.

  - wesley morris  
    Oprah got her to play Janie in her TV version of “Their Eyes Were
    Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s novel.

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m going to revisit that. That’s a good homework for me.

  - wesley morris  
    She’s good in it. And then she played Dorothy Dandridge for HBO.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know. My favorite TV movie.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh\!

  - jenna wortham  
    I loved that movie.

  - wesley morris  
    I did not know that.

  - jenna wortham  
    I thought it was so good. She’s so good in it.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, she needs to channel some Dorothy Dandridge up in here.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    But I feel like if you let her play a part that has a beginning and
    a middle and an end, someplace for her to go and to act, you know,
    those are things that basically any actor needs, by the way — a
    beginning and a middle and an end. Something to aspire to play. But
    she can do so much if you give her something that amuses her. Do you
    think there’s enough in this movie for her to sink her claws into?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] No. I mean, there’s no emotion. There’s not really a ton
    of drive. I mean, she needs a backstory. I mean, that’s what made
    her so good in Dorothy Dandridge. You understood that woman’s
    plight. You understood her tension. You understood her ambitions. I
    mean, give us some of that. Oh, my gosh, wait. Look at her freaking
    out because of the rain.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s what we want. We want Dorothy Dandridge, Catwoman. I would
    love to see that.
    
    Now we’re in a Janet Jackson video.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] So true.

  - wesley morris  
    And that’s all we get.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s all we get?

  - wesley morris  
    This seems like another good time to synchronize those clocks. We’re
    going to be at 1 hour, 15 minutes and 55 seconds in 3, 2, 1, now.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait. Was that a video phone call? Or what was that?

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know.

  - jenna wortham  
    You know, is this a good time to mention the Beyonce and Gaga video,
    video phone, that literally starts like that? I mean —

  - wesley morris  
    Yes.

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t know. I think this movie was a lot more influential than
    people give credit for.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I just feel like, Halle Berry’s character now has all — you know,
    she’s got a lot of wisdom, right? She understands she’s got these
    cat powers. She’s not doing anything with them. Why didn’t the movie
    at least let her — yeah. Like, Spider-Man gets to have fun. Usually
    the superheroes get to have fun. There’s always a sequence of them,
    like, running around town, playing with their powers. I guess she
    rode a motorcycle through town, but she didn’t need to be bitten by
    a cat to do that.

  - wesley morris  
    By the way, she didn’t do anything. That was also half stunt double
    —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    — half C.G.I. So —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    OK. This scene right here is exactly why I have been complaining for
    a lot of this movie about the problem of having Sharon Stone and
    Halle Berry in “Catwoman” at the same time. Because on the one hand,
    I love Halle Berry, and on the other hand, I love Sharon Stone. It
    isn’t that I can’t love both those people at the same time. But
    every time Sharon Stone’s in the movie, she takes the oxygen away
    from anybody else in the scene.

  - jenna wortham  
    Especially Halle.

  - wesley morris  
    And especially Halle Berry who has the disadvantage of looking
    ridiculous in this sexy costume in a room with Sharon Stone. I don’t
    know if that makes sense. \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    I’ll bet you anything, Sharon Stone had her own writers or
    something. Like —

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Sharon was like, I see your Oscar and I’ll raise you \[LAUGHS\] —

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    — this scene.

  - wesley morris  
    There is something kind of costumy about what Halle Berry is asked
    to do here, and there’s nothing costumy about what Sharon Stone is
    doing. She’s just playing your classic mean villain. It’s just
    Sharon Stone knows how to be in a movie, and she knows how to steal
    a scene from people who are vulnerable to having a scene stolen from
    them. \[LAUGHS\] And I think Halle Berry is so concentrating on one
    side of things that she doesn’t even notice the sneak attack that
    Sharon Stone is waging.
    
    I love in movies where, like, characters have to find out what’s
    going on in their lives by looking up at a giant monitor in public.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] And then hurry away and hope no one noticed that was them
    onscreen.

  - wesley morris  
    And hope nobody notices.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] Which is also how you know all these movies take place in
    a fictitious New York, because in a real New York, everyone would be
    like, That’s you, bro. Like, That’s you\!
    
    Oh, that’s her losing Isaiah in “Monster’s Ball” voice.

  - wesley morris  
    See, the thing about Halle Berry to me is in a lot of Halle Berry
    performances, there are these moments where you just get a sense of
    what she could be doing.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    She’s worked with not that many great directors.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm, interesting.

  - wesley morris  
    I have really been — like take something like “Jungle Fever” for
    instance.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hm.

  - wesley morris  
    She had a small part in that movie, but she’s really good in it.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Even “Monster’s Ball,” which we can talk about.

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, we don’t have to. I mean, I’ve always been curious about your
    response to it.

  - wesley morris  
    She had a good director. I mean, I don’t love that guy, but he’s
    good at directing actors, I’ll say that. And I mean, she’s evidently
    very good in that, right? But those parts are very hard to come by,
    and she’s fighting, at this point in her career, who’s she fighting
    for parts? She’s fighting Charlize Theron. She’s fighting Nicole
    Kidman, Angelina Jolie. She’s up against —
    
    I would love to hear Halle Berry talk about the parts she didn’t get
    during this period after she wins the Oscar. But I’m sure it’s lots
    of juicy things, or maybe she wasn’t even considered for them.

  - jenna wortham  
    I wonder. Yeah, I wonder.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, she can do lots of things. I just don’t think this movie
    really shows any of that off.
    
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. \[LAUGHS\] That was like, actually, like the perfect timing to
    illustrate your point. They just, you know. But are any superhero
    movies really well acted? Like, I’m just scanning my mind. I mean,
    it’s hard. It’s hard.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, some of them have their moments. I think that everybody in
    the first two Spider-Man movies is fantastic. I think that McKellen
    and Stewart in the X-Men movies —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah, I agree.

  - wesley morris  
    Hugh Jackman in “Wolverine.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, “Wolverine” is so good.

  - wesley morris  
    You know, like Heath Ledger ais Joker. I mean, these movies do have
    room for good performances.
    
    Best line in the movie right there. “Lassie would have brought me
    the key.”

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s also —

  - wesley morris  
    That’s a screenwriter right there.

  - jenna wortham  
    — the rudest, though. But that’s the rudest. I’m sorry. That cat
    brought you back to life. That cat is done working for you, honey.
    Like, come on. Oh, is she just really going to — we’re just going to
    pretend that she can fit through this — oh, OK. All right. I guess
    we’re still in an X-Men movie where people’s bodies rearrange, the
    molecules change. All right.

  - wesley morris  
    Is she Mystique or Catwoman?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right. Right. They don’t know. Honey, they don’t know.
    
    I mean, it would be a much more interesting movie if we saw what a
    person, or especially this woman, did with all that newfound power.
    But she’s like, No, I’m going to use every ounce of energy I have to
    take down this huge multinational corporation. I mean, good on you,
    but like, also is that what you want to be doing?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh. Pull up to my bumper, baby.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] That’s very J. Lo.

  - wesley morris  
    Now again, like what was the point of her fondling — oh, because
    it’s a cat. It’s a cat\! It’s a cat.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s a cat and she wants the car. She takes what she wants.
    
    I love how Sharon Stone was inspired by Catwoman. She was like, I
    can murder, too. Like, I’ll do what I want, too. Sharon Stone’s
    like, I didn’t need to die first. I didn’t need to get bit by a cat.
    I will take control of my own destiny and not be obsessed with milk
    and tuna.
    
    You know, Wesley, you’re right. I see what you’re saying. Sharon
    Stone, she really just knows how to be in a movie.
    
    I feel like that’s a challenge, though, for women like Halle. It’s
    like, she’s not sure which part of herself to play up. Is she
    playing up her physicality? Is she playing up her beauty? Is she
    playing up her steeliness? Like, I think she has always struck me as
    an actor who is so conscious of how she’s going to be perceived as a
    black woman, and how the different gazes will be falling on her,
    that she doesn’t really play to any of the aspects of herself. She
    kind of just lets herself get played. And you can really feel it
    here in contrast to someone like Sharon Stone who knows exactly what
    angle she’s working, exactly what she’s trying to do on screen. And
    that’s a luxury. I mean, that’s a privilege that she has. But she
    gets to kind of be as — take up as much space as she wants. And I
    don’t know that Halle’s ever really felt that in any of her roles.

  - wesley morris  
    I will also say, Sharon Stone, it took her a long time to even get
    to that moment —

  - jenna wortham  
    I was going to say, yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    — in “Catwoman“, if you know what I mean.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. I was realizing that in real time.

  - wesley morris  
    You know, this is a seasoned movie star, basically, with all of this
    experience. This is the thing about older actors, right? About
    especially women. Like, you spend your whole career building up some
    knowledge, and some vocabulary, and some natural way of presenting
    yourself in front of a camera.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    And the minute you figure that out, you get thrown over the side of
    the boat. And turned into, like, Meow Mix.

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Chum. You’re chum.

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know. Here is a woman who’s just got more experience and
    more charisma than a movie like this even needs. And Halle Berry
    just kind of is the unwitting victim of it.

  - jenna wortham  
    She gets very declawed around Sharon Stone, like defanged and
    declawed. Like, all the bad-assery just goes out the window when
    she’s next to Sharon Stone.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, the thing that’s exasperating about this, when you look at
    what is happening with the Sharon Stone character versus what’s
    happening with the Halle Berry character, is all of the writing is
    there for Sharon Stone. And Halle Berry, Patience has no real —
    she’s got a personality, but it’s a very generic personality.
    She’s just good. She’s a good person having a naughty moment. But
    every time Sharon Stone’s on screen, I just want to be with her.

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And that isn’t about Halle Berry per se, but it is about Halle Berry
    in this movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Which is that every time Sharon Stone shows up, I want to know
    whatever’s going on in that woman’s psyche.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Catwoman has no psyche. She’s got all these, like, personality
    traits that correspond with a house animal.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know. She was a do-gooder, and then doing good got her into
    trouble, and she got a second chance, and this is what she’s doing
    with it.

  - wesley morris  
    Do you think the lighting is the real lighting, or do you think
    everybody got touched up? Because —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] I’m like —

  - wesley morris  
    The only person who doesn’t look touched up is Benjamin Bratt. But
    Sharon Stone’s face looks —

  - jenna wortham  
    Fluorescent.

  - wesley morris  
    — extra creamy.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah, they’re all glowing. Yeah. Yeah.
    
    Like the insistence there’s a right way to do this. Or right way to
    — oh, whoa. But she didn’t, though, did she? Did I miss something?
    It wasn’t Sharon Stone.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna let me ask you a question right now.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hm.

  - wesley morris  
    Let’s just say that you just killed your husband —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    And —

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m there, keep going.

  - wesley morris  
    — this woman is just on your tail, and she’s dressed like a
    dominatrix from an En Vogue video.

  - jenna wortham  
    You’re describing, literally, my dreams. Go on.

  - wesley morris  
    Do you have time right now to really talk about your motivations for
    why you’ve become evil?

  - jenna wortham  
    I do.

  - wesley morris  
    You do?

  - jenna wortham  
    A hundred percent I do.

  - wesley morris  
    OK.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. Yes, because that’s part of the seduction. This is what’s — I’m
    like, let’s talk.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Let me see if I can get you on my side. Yes. I’m like, Halle Berry,
    come join me, boo. Like, we can rule this kingdom together.
    
    Now, that’s an act — like a very interesting super villain
    backstory. That’s fantastic.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, exactly. Exactly\!

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.
    
    It’s always so disappointing in these superhero movies, though, when
    the women superheroes can’t actually do anything. Like they always
    get bested. Do you know what I mean?

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    And you’re just like what’s the point of all those powers? What’s
    the point of all that painful transformation, giving up your old
    life, when it barely comes down — barely gets you anything in a
    one-to-one fist fight.

  - wesley morris  
    You know what I hate, I hate generic action setting finale. I hate
    warehouse showdown.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Like, I know we’re supposed to be in an office building, but this
    looks no different to me than like ye old dockyard shootout.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    That is a bad line.

  - wesley morris  
    That is a bad line.

  - jenna wortham  
    Abs of steel. She was like, I’ll be fine. Yeah, where was that whip
    hiding? Where was that whip hiding the whole time?

  - wesley morris  
    Also, from a physics standpoint, her being able to fling that thing
    around like that makes no sense.

  - jenna wortham  
    I agree.

  - wesley morris  
    She’d be hitting the ceilings and the walls and the pillar. It just
    —
    
    Oh, my god. Oh, Sharon. No\! No\!
    
    No, Sharon\!

  - jenna wortham  
    Sharon’s like, I would rather die than live with this face.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, that fall\! \[LAUGHS\] Jenna, have you ever seen a fall like
    that before in your life?

  - jenna wortham  
    I have not. This movie —

  - wesley morris  
    The flipping in the air. It was like a real person\! Oh, my god\!

  - jenna wortham  
    Where has he been this whole time?

  - wesley morris  
    He’s useless.

  - jenna wortham  
    He’s useless.

  - wesley morris  
    Funny, he got up to her apartment in, like, two seconds to save her
    the first time.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And now it takes him 20 minutes to get up there to help her fight
    Sharon Stone.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, he’s just going to pin them all on her?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. There is a tragedy right there.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know.

  - wesley morris  
    Tragedy.
    
    One of our least fulfilled movie stars just in a pile of glass on a
    logo. Oh, her dreams came true.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait. I missed this whole thing. All right.

  - wesley morris  
    He works at the hospital. I think he’s a doctor.

  - jenna wortham  
    And they got together, I guess.

  - wesley morris  
    They got together.

  - jenna wortham  
    You know, part of the reason we picked this movie is because we were
    kind of starting our own silent hashtag campaign, justice for Halle,
    because we didn’t feel like she’d ever been properly served by
    Hollywood, or ever had an opportunity to properly stretch her wings,
    right? I think that Halle’s struggle represents a bigger struggle
    within Hollywood, in any industry where you have to figure out how
    to present yourself, or they’ll figure it out for you, and they’ll
    fail, right? Like Halle, they couldn’t figure out if Halle should be
    the sex symbol, or is she a serious actor, is she an action figure.
    I mean, she just let them make her into whatever the picture needed.
    I mean, the real coup would be for Halle to come back, know exactly
    — like pull a Reese Witherspoon and start producing and making the
    movies she wants to be in and being a part of it. But honestly, I
    kind of feel like she’s playing the role that she wants to play,
    which is if you go to her Instagram, she’s just hanging out with her
    kids, easing into her 50s, nothing left to prove. I mean, I wonder
    if she still thinks about cat person. I’m going to say cat person in
    this movie instead of Catwoman. But I wonder if she still thinks
    about this movie.

  - \[music\]

  - wesley morris  
    That is our show\! We did it\!

  - jenna wortham  
    We did it\!

  - wesley morris  
    We made it through the whole way\! And before we go, next week,
    y’all fetch them bolt cutters. Talking about Fiona Apple. “Still

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m Jenna Wortham.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m Wesley Morris. We’re two culture writers at The New York Times,
    and we’ve got an experiment.

  - jenna wortham  
    And this is “Still Processing.”
    
    Get ready for a Still Processing watch-along.

  - wesley morris  
    It really is an experiment. We’re gonna —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    You and I are going to watch a movie together, and you guys who are
    listening to us are going to watch the movie with us.

  - jenna wortham  
    This week is very much about being in your living room, or your
    bedroom, or even your bathtub. Look, it’s up to you.

  - wesley morris  
    So Miss Wortham, what are we watching?

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. So there’s so many things we wanted to talk about, but
    ultimately, we were like, let’s pick something that’s definitely fun
    and funny, nothing bloody, nothing violent. There’s just way too
    much of that stress in the world right now. So, you know, something
    that’s incredibly low stakes, but also deeply, visually pleasurable.
    So Wesley —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    — who is the only celebrity that both you and I follow on Instagram
    right now?

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, it’s Halle Berry.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s Halle Berry. You know, so this is really a Halle Berry
    appreciation week, and we went through deep in her archives, and
    what did we pull out?

  - wesley morris  
    “Catwoman.” It came out in 2004. The Halle Berry, the Sharon Stone.

  - jenna wortham  
    Also, the looks, that leather outfit, their whips,
    rhinestone-studded acrylics. I mean, listen, there is a lot to get
    into here. Find a cozy place, get your favorite snacks.

  - wesley morris  
    It’s you, and Jenna, and me, and Halle Berry all on your sofa in
    your bed, wherever you’re watching this, and it’s going to get real
    intimate and real deep. Real deep. And I gotta say, this thing is
    going to be, you know, about two hours. Of all the things we’ve done
    on this show, this might actually be the blackest podcast thing you
    and I have ever done, Jenna Wortham, spending two hours talking.
    They’re going to fly. The fur is going to fly. The minutes are going
    to fly. You won’t even know the time has past. You’re gonna look up
    and be like, wait, this is over?
    
    All right. One second and we’ll be back with Pitof’s “Catwoman.”

  - \[music\]

  - jenna wortham  
    So here’s how this is going to work. “Catwoman,” believe it or not,
    is on a ton of streaming services for the relatively low price of
    $1.99. So it’s on Amazon, YouTube, and iTunes, and a few other
    places. So the first thing you’re going to do is rent it. The next
    thing you’re going to do is queue it up on your TV or your laptop.
    It makes the most sense if you keep your phone handy with the
    podcast cued up and ready there. If you try to do both on the same
    device, it might be really challenging.

  - wesley morris  
    Once you’ve rented it, hit play, and then pause. Make sure that
    you’re set to zero minutes and zero seconds. And then we’ll tell
    you when to hit play so that we’re all watching the same thing at
    the same time. And don’t worry, if you have to pause or you think
    you’re off, we’ll be announcing the time code every once in a while
    so you can get back in sync with us. So hit pause on us, on the
    show, go get “Catwoman,” and then start us back up and we’ll all
    watch this thing together.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK? Everybody ready? Everybody good? Got your snacks? You got your
    drinks? You ready to do this? It’s going to be amazing\! So let’s
    all get ready for the 2004 — I can’t believe I’m saying this — super
    hero spectacular “Catwoman.”

  - wesley morris  
    This is going to be so good\!

  - jenna wortham  
    OK, on my count, we’re going to hit play. 3, 2, 1, hit play\! Wes,
    you rolling? I’m rolling. I’m seeing the Warner Brothers logo, the
    weird wavy undulations.

  - wesley morris  
    I can hear it in my headphones. I’m so excited.

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Your excitement is exciting me, I have to be honest.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] OK, y’all, we’re going back to 2004 when Halle Berry was
    essentially kind of still on top of the world. She had just won an
    Academy Award for her performance in “Monster’s Ball,” becoming the
    reigning only black Best Actress winner in the history of American
    movies.

  - jenna wortham  
    Still to this day.

  - wesley morris  
    Reigning champ. Reigning champ. Octavia can’t defeat her. \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Viola.

  - wesley morris  
    Viola can’t defeat her. Angela Bassett. Nope, can’t defeat Halle
    Berry. So she’s looking for something to do. She was just in the big
    James Bond movie, “Die Another Day.” She played Jinx.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. That’s right.

  - wesley morris  
    Famously arose from the ocean in the most delightful tangerine
    bathing suit. And you know, what are you going to do when you’re on
    top of the world and you have, the world is your oyster? You’ll want
    to make a statement, so what do you do? You’re going to do
    “Catwoman.” You’re going to break another barrier and become the
    first woman, in a long time, to star in your own superhero movie
    based on a comic book. And you’re going to be the first black woman
    to ever do that.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. That helps. That helps me understand the why for Halle. But can
    you help me understand the why it looks like this so far? Like, who
    is responsible for this?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, well, nobody can blame Halle Berry for how bad this movie looks.
    That would be —

  - jenna wortham  
    OK.

  - wesley morris  
    Jean-Christophe Comar, a.k.a. Pitof — P-I-T-O-F, the man credited
    with directing “Catwoman.” He’s a visual effects supervisor.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    And, you know, he did “The City of Lost Children,” he did one of
    your jams, “Alien Resurrection.” And he has been given the reins to
    Halle Berry’s make or break box office opportunity here. And I’m
    saying make or break because she is a woman and a black woman, and
    if this thing does not hit, her stuff might hit the rocks, and who
    knows what will happen if this movie bombs. We should be watching
    this movie thinking, is this what you do with your Oscar winner?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Is this —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — what you do with a woman at the peak of her career?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Is this it? Is this really it?

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. This is the million dollar question. You have all that talent,
    all that charisma, iconic hair, incredible physique, and this is
    what you do with it. Hm. Curious.
    
    It actually looks a lot like it belongs on the Beyonce album,
    though, like that imagery. Very familiar.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, you’re — this is —

  - jenna wortham  
    Very familiar.

  - wesley morris  
    You’re going to be saying that a lot during this movie, I suspect.
    
    What’s also, like what is remarkable — what is unremarkable about
    Halle Berry? Like, we’re supposed to believe she’s this shlubby,
    klutzy, average woman?

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s kind of her character from “Boomerang” though.

  - wesley morris  
    Yes, it’s true. It’s true.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s not that far from it.

  - wesley morris  
    For all you “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” watchers out there, that is Alex
    Borstein.

  - jenna wortham  
    Whoa, how old is Halle Berry here?

  - wesley morris  
    37 when the movie opens, and 32 when it ends.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    OK. We’re just going to stop talking right here because you’re going
    to get some really important villain exposition right here. So zip
    it, us.
    
    So in another movie, that’s what this would have been about, right?
    Old Sharon Stone being replaced by a younger model, and she turns
    into Catwoman and goes on a crime spree.

  - jenna wortham  
    I would watch that movie, too, though.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, I mean, it just doesn’t make — this, it doesn’t make any sense
    why — one of these women is extra. \[LAUGHS\] We don’t need Sharon
    Stone and Halle Berry in a Catwoman movie. We only need one.

  - jenna wortham  
    No, we need two. There could be more women. Why isn’t Angelina Jolie
    in this? Put May — like, put more people in this.

  - wesley morris  
    Were you going to say Maya Rudolph? Were you going to say put Maya
    Rudolph?

  - jenna wortham  
    I stopped myself. I did. I stopped myself. \[LAUGHS\] I stopped
    myself. I stopped myself. But J. Lo could have been in this, too.

  - wesley morris  
    What is about to happen right now — this is an Anne Hathaway moment.
    
    Jenna, can you talk about this outfit?

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s really setting us up for the reveal of the body-yody-yody in
    the costume, because we can’t see what’s going on underneath —

  - wesley morris  
    It’s a great point.

  - jenna wortham  
    — all those rags. It’s really setting it up —

  - wesley morris  
    It’s a good point.

  - jenna wortham  
    — for the makeover scene. But it’s hilarious. I mean, can you
    imagine, in any year, in any time, like, going to work dressed like
    that at an ad agency? I just don’t understand.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t understand.
    
    I miss Sharon Stone. This makes nostalgic for her.

  - wesley morris  
    We all do.

  - jenna wortham  
    Dang. She must be in New York City. That’s the truest thing about
    this movie.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, she’s not in Gotham. She’s not in Gotham, because at this
    point, that man would have long been here.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\].
    
    Wow.
    
    She’s so mousy.
    
    It’s so interesting, though, how the movies always equate, like —
    oh, wait. I got distracted. The cat — the first cat\!

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]. Wait, what were you going to say?

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, it’s just funny how the movies equate, like, a shlumpiness
    with, like, you know, like an unattractiveness? Like we’re supposed
    to believe that she’s a good person in this iteration of self
    because she doesn’t care about clothes, and she’s beautiful but
    doesn’t know it. She doesn’t know how to raise her voice, you know.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    My god, that apartment.

  - wesley morris  
    But again — again, where in Gotham is this?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. Let me enjoy the fantasy. It doesn’t matter. I just want
    to pretend I could live there, too.

  - wesley morris  
    But I mean, like, I don’t know what Gotham rents are, but I don’t —
    you know.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait, Wesley. This cat is sentient. It’s not a regular cat, right?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    This is the cat that came on the boat from Egypt.

  - wesley morris  
    Miss Wortham, just fasten your seat belt. Patience look out for all
    that bird poop\! Bird poop, Halle. Bird poop.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, don’t step on the AC\! That’s every New Yorker’s worst
    nightmare. No\! Oh, my gosh. I thought — oh, my god. I was promised
    this movie would be enjoyable and not stressful.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, who is that? Remind me his name.

  - wesley morris  
    Benjamin Bratt. That’s the Bratt right there.

  - jenna wortham  
    He’s so hot. Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    This is the nicest thing a cop’s ever done for a black woman since
    “Crash.”

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Actually, this is before “Crash.” This is the nicest thing a black
    woman’s ever done before “Crash.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Wow.
    
    He’s really jumping to a lot of conclusions. You know, it’s like —
    
    what?

  - wesley morris  
    OK, first of all —

  - jenna wortham  
    Is he supposed to be Batman?

  - wesley morris  
    How the hell did he get up to the fourth floor —

  - jenna wortham  
    That fast.

  - wesley morris  
    — of this building.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    And into the apartment, by the way, did she just leave the door
    open?

  - jenna wortham  
    We’re not supposed to ask questions. We’re just supposed to marvel
    at the miracle and the budding sexual chemistry between the two of
    them.
    
    What time of day is it, late for her job? What the hell?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t understand\! It is late afternoon, madam. We are — what did
    she drop? Oh, my god. Oh, wait. He’s going to get it. All right,
    cute. Cute. OK. This movie is full of deeply attractive people. I am
    more onboard than I thought I was going to be.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I mean, Benjamin Bratt is one of those people who’s so
    handsome, like, you don’t even know where to start speaking about
    how handsome he is.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. It doesn’t — like, I’m flabbergasted —

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, check this out.

  - jenna wortham  
    — when I look at him. Oh, here’s Sharon Stone again walking through
    this lobby looking like a whole ass snack. OK. OK. I — my only frame
    of reference for Sharon Stone is, I guess, most people’s frame of
    reference for Sharon Stone, which is “Basic Instinct.” But there’s
    so much more than that. Like, where is she at at this moment in
    time, Wesley? Can you help me — give me some context for her?

  - wesley morris  
    Well, I mean, you know, she was the face of American movies for
    about the first half of the 1990s. She essentially had one of the
    great five to six year runs of a lot of stars. Like unlikely, given
    how long she worked to get to the point where she was in “Basic
    Instinct.” She made “Casino” for Martin Scorsese in 1995.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s right. Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Gets an Academy Award nomination. And she didn’t even win and it was
    all downhill for her after that.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hey.

  - wesley morris  
    And at this point, here she is 10 years after that “Casino”
    nomination, more or less, starring in a movie about being a
    washed-up beauty spokesmodel being replaced —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, no.

  - wesley morris  
    — by some unlikely brunette that her husband is sleeping with.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, Wesley. Can you imagine Ryan Murphy’s take, like a
    satirical take on the challenges of an aging Hollywood star who’s
    been wronged by her industry and turning it into primetime TV gold
    with the drama of his other properties, like “Pose” or “The
    Politician.” Ugh, chef’s kiss — like we need it.
    
    I love that this is what the movies think that office life is like.
    Just, like, hanging out in each other’s cubicles. I mean, they’re
    not wrong, but it just tickles me.

  - wesley morris  
    And now, Jenna, some “Catwoman” facts.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK, yeah. Because I’m riveted. I’m like, how much did this make in
    the box office? Like — I — yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, it made a grand total of $82 million, and cost, apparently,
    $100 million to make.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, yikes.

  - wesley morris  
    And they originally — I mean, it went through all of these different
    iterations of wanting different people to play Catwoman. Ashley Judd
    was mentioned at some point and didn’t do it. And eventually it just
    went to Halle Berry. It was made very quickly, by the way, because
    of all kinds of production problems, like getting it going.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mmm.

  - wesley morris  
    So I don’t know how many — I don’t know how much prep time Halle
    Berry even had to play the part.
    
    Oh, I hate — I love this effect. Remember, the director of this
    movie is a visual effects person. So he’s really bored out of his
    mind and needs something to do, and it’s not direct Halle Berry.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. He’s like, no —

  - wesley morris  
    So let’s make all the people disappear.

  - jenna wortham  
    — I want the time to be bouncing around. Yeah. And on the left,
    there’s a screen saver.
    
    Honey, why didn’t they film New York. What is going on right now?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Like why —

  - wesley morris  
    Because you’re working with a visual effects person. All he wants to
    do is, like, pee on the fire hydrant of this script.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. It’s very “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” You know,
    it’s like in another time, he would have had a lot of fun with that
    script. He’s way ahead of his time.

  - wesley morris  
    Yup. Meanwhile, when you were asking before if this is what office
    life is like, the answer is yes. Because anytime I come down to your
    desk and want to hang out, the punishment is I gotta stay at work
    till 9:00 at night.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    This is the corkscrew. This is what turns the crank. This becomes
    her — the driving engine, right, of Catwoman.

  - wesley morris  
    You know how, like, in real life those guys are probably really
    handsome, but in the movies they look generic? They just look like
    generic bad guys?

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. They put weird matte powder on their faces to make them less
    attractive. It’s like, if you splash them with warm water, you’d be
    like, damn.

  - wesley morris  
    You know, on the one hand it is kind of cool that Halle Berry is
    joining this lineage of catwomen. Now, the movie is making it seem
    like there is a lineage of actual cat women, but OK, the movie can
    do that.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    But on the other hand, she is joining this long family of other
    catwomen. It’s like, Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar on the TV show.
    And Michelle Pfeiffer perhaps most famously. And then there’s Anne
    Hathaway in the third Christopher Nolan batman movie, Batman —

  - jenna wortham  
    “The Dark Knight Rises.”

  - wesley morris  
    “The Dark Knight Rises.” Thank you very much. On the other hand,
    Halle Berry is playing a Catwoman who has nothing to do with the DC
    universe. I don’t know where this woman is from. I don’t know what —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know what town this is. Like, we’re calling it Gotham, but
    we’re being real nice. Because, first of all, every other Catwoman,
    as far as I know, was named Selina Kyle. And they were all basically
    thieves and cat burglars. And they didn’t really have super powers.
    They just — like, it was a comic book. They just — they weren’t bad,
    they were just drawn that way, if you know what I’m saying.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    They were thieves who happened to have real agility and wall
    climbing prowess and that sort of stuff. And Batman was really into
    them.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. Yes, she does fall in chemicals, OK.

  - wesley morris  
    No\! Halle, no, no\!

  - jenna wortham  
    There we go. Is this how she becomes “Catwoman?” Is this the origin
    story? Does the cat have to fall in there with her, too? I mean.
    
    This is the only kind of suspense I like these days.

  - wesley morris  
    It’s not Spider-Man. It’s not Spider-Man or Spider Woman for that
    matter. Although, this might be up for debate when the action
    starts.

  - jenna wortham  
    But I feel like it’s a combination of Venom, and Mr. Manhattan, and
    like, I don’t know. Like it’s all of these things wrapped up in one.

  - wesley morris  
    He happened to be standing right next to the box, by the way.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god. He’s like a black woman in New York City? Nobody’ll miss
    her. It’s fine.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Just turn on the pipes.
    
    Well, honey, what underground labyrinth is this? Where —

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know. But you know what the truth is, Jenna, this is where
    they dump all the chemicals into the river. \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s not a water valve.
    
    That duct is for dumping the chemicals into whatever Gotham’s river
    is.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    That’s the villain bath.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wesley, doesn’t this part kind of remind you of “Lemonade” a little
    bit, Beyonce’s visual album? It looks very —

  - wesley morris  
    Uh-huh. Huh.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. It looks so similar. Do you think this was on Beyonce’s mood
    board for — oh, my god, a cat\! I mean, it’s entirely possible. Both
    characters, they are in this womb space. They are in this watery
    tunnel. They are going through this period of deep incubation,
    gestation. Halle Berry, just like Beyonce, journeying through an
    underworld. Dealing with Pluto. Dealing with Hades. I mean, very
    culty, very witchy. Look, I hope the link’s there. I approve. Into
    it.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh-huh. Huh.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s brilliant, Wes.

  - wesley morris  
    OK.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    So I do have some questions here. What are the real cats and what
    are the digital cats? And how long did Halle have to lay there until
    they all do what they were supposed to do?

  - jenna wortham  
    You know what I was just thinking though? This is the real “Cats,”
    and it’s better than “Cats,” you know.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] It’s better than “Cats.”

  - jenna wortham  
    These are the jellicles. Is that what they’re called, I forgot? This
    is the jellicle cats.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, that’s right.
    
    Oh.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s a real cat. That’s a real cat.

  - wesley morris  
    This is some cat wrangler’s proudest moment.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait, what’s it going to do to her?

  - wesley morris  
    Give her Covid.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] This is the origin story for Covid? No, that’s so dark.
    So I used to have a cat and it did this to me in the mornings. It
    loved sitting on my chest and breathe its cat breath into my face. I
    never had anything half this exciting happen as what’s happening
    right now.

  - wesley morris  
    So I wonder, if you’re Halle, you know, like, the reason you put up
    with being a mousy sort of klutz for the first 20 minutes of this
    movie, is that you know that you’re at some point going to get to
    kick some people and jump on some railings or something?

  - jenna wortham  
    I mean, Halle Berry had already been in superhero movies. I mean,
    she was in some of the best X-Men movies, in my opinion. “X-Men,”
    which came out, I guess, in 2000. And then “X2,” 2003, is that
    right?

  - wesley morris  
    Mm-hm.

  - jenna wortham  
    And she played Storm. You know, and it’s interesting actually to
    remember, because I love those movies. And in a way, she was kind of
    the weakest link there, too. And it’s not really her fault. They
    just didn’t really give her a lot to do in those movies. They gave
    her a bad white wig, and just made it really windy. \[LAUGHS\] Like
    remember, Cyclops is always like, Storm, a little cover, and she
    would grab the armrest and her eyes would roll back in her head, and
    then the fog would descend. And it’s like, word? OK.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. She was my favorite X-Man and —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    — that’s what happened to her.

  - jenna wortham  
    So maybe Halle read the script and was like, “I do want to crouch,
    crab walk down an alley, and look at some spiders in high def, yes\!
    I will do it.” Is this true to her origin story? Does she fall in a
    vat of chemicals. I’ve got to look this up.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m just like, does she get bit by the cat? Does she fall into the
    chemicals? I just need to know.

  - wesley morris  
    I love that you need to know this.

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m very curious.
    
    They do do that.

  - wesley morris  
    You would ask. You would ask. Let me rack my brain for a second. I
    don’t recall this happening to any Catwoman in any of Bob Kane’s
    editions of “Catwoman,” like even in subsequent editions. Catwoman,
    she just likes to steal things. She’s just a thief. No cats gave her
    a virus and turned her into an actual cat. As far as I know, the
    other women just liked to impersonate cats because it was a sexy
    thing to do, because she is the creation of men. No women had had
    any say in the creation of this character. She’s just being pulled
    on some strings by some dudes who — let me just read you what Bob
    Kane, the creator of Catwoman, thought he was doing when he invented
    this lady. This is Catwoman’s creator Bob Kane saying in his memoir,
    “Batman and Me,” “I felt that women were feline creatures and men
    were more like dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are
    cool, detached and reliable. Cats are as hard to understand as women
    are. You always need to keep a woman at arm’s length. We don’t want
    anyone talking —”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, god.

  - wesley morris  
    — over our souls. And women have a habit of doing that. So there’s a
    love/resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I’m
    being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel I’ve had better
    relationships with male friends than women.”

  - jenna wortham  
    I feel like this unnatural binary explains decades of sour
    relationships between men and women, and just, wow, it all goes back
    to the DC comic universe. I mean, this explains so much about the
    American psyche. \[SIGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, screw Jane Austen, we’re going for Bob Kane. Bob Kane started
    it all.

  - jenna wortham  
    Fully. Fully.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, is that not the house from “Up?” Isn’t that the “Up” house?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]. Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s the house from “Up\!”

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait. Who is this actress again? This is one of my favorite old
    scary ladies.

  - wesley morris  
    This is — \[LAUGHS\] Wait. Bite your tongue. This is Frances Conroy
    whose job it is now — I mean, between this movie and a couple of
    other horror movies and “Joker,” she was Joaquin Phoenix’s mother in
    “Joker.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, that’s right. That’s right. That’s where we last saw
    her.

  - wesley morris  
    But she’s most famous for playing the mother on “Six Feet Under.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh\!

  - wesley morris  
    This is one of the great parts, the “Six Feet Under” mother. But
    she’s just a cat lady in the movies. And I mean, literally, either
    like a sickly, crazy mom or a cat lady.
    
    I mean, I would love to hear Francis Conroy talk about this, because
    she’s a great stage actress. She’s very good on “Six Feet Under.”
    And she’s never had a part in any movie that’s as good as what she
    had on that TV show.
    
    Oh, no. Oh, boy.
    
    How do you act this?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    How do you act this? Like, if you’re Halle, how are you rehearsing
    this moment? Are you watching your cats do this?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Uff, uff.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. I’m trying to be on board with everything that’s happening in
    this movie, but can you riddle me this. Why is she turning into an
    actual cat? Like, no Batman in the history of Batman ever hung
    upside-down, right? I’m really trying to —

  - wesley morris  
    I believe Michael Keaton’s Batman does sleep upside-down —

  - jenna wortham  
    OK.

  - wesley morris  
    — to be fair. But he doesn’t eat, like —

  - jenna wortham  
    Flies.

  - wesley morris  
    Exactly. He can resist the urge to do other bat things.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK.

  - wesley morris  
    I do recall Michelle Pfeiffer in “Batman Returns,” bending over and,
    like, having herself some milk. Eartha Kitt has to growl or
    something, you know. It’s like, there is a small price to pay. But
    Halle Berry, the I.R.S. went after her on this one for the cat tax.

  - jenna wortham  
    She’s taking it to another level entirely.

  - wesley morris  
    This is my favorite Halle Berry version.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh dang. Oh.
    
    She’s like, I don’t care.

  - wesley morris  
    OK. We just saw Halle Berry do a thing that I enjoy when Halle Berry
    does, which is kind of tell somebody off and assert herself. And
    until that point, like, we have been waiting for her to do something
    to, I don’t know, kind of be the movie star we need her to be in a
    movie like this, and not this meek, passive, wet noodle of a person.

  - jenna wortham  
    But she still has so much less spice than when she does it in
    “Boomerang.” So, like, what is even going on here?

  - wesley morris  
    We’re coming up on a good minute to synchronize our watching just to
    make sure we’re all on the same page. So let’s get ready to check
    and see if that’s true. You ready? We’re going to be at 32 minutes
    and 45 seconds in 3, 2, 1, now. And we’ll do another one of those in
    about 20 minutes.
    
    I’ll just say at this point — we’ve been watching this movie for a
    minute.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Despite the things that we’re pointing out that aren’t right about
    it, there is one thing that I want to bring to our attention. She is
    surrounded by non-white people. Halle Berry is just living in a city
    where there are just some white people, and the white people who are
    there are just — are evil. Just planting that seed that Sharon Stone
    and Lambert Wilson are the bad guys, and everybody else, basically,
    is a peon who suffers because of them.

  - jenna wortham  
    Again, radical bones. Like, there are some interesting ideas in this
    superhero movie. It just feels like either they didn’t know what
    they had or they didn’t know what to do with it.

  - wesley morris  
    By the way, I want to say that Halle is channeling Janet Jackson in
    this first part of the movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, for sure. For sure.

  - wesley morris  
    She just seems shy in the way that Janet could pretend to be shy, or
    actually just be shy. Janet never pretended to be shy.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, boy. I love movie basketball kids.

  - jenna wortham  
    Definitely. It should be like a weird cliche and a trope but I just
    actually love it — oh, wait. I spoke too soon, because now we’re in
    a —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    What kind of music video is this? It’s like, it turns into a
    Destiny’s Child video.

  - wesley morris  
    Meanwhile, this is a Paula Abdul video.

  - jenna wortham  
    And these camera angles, what is going on here?

  - \[laughter\]

  - wesley morris  
    The editing and camera work here are just — this is not Halle
    Berry’s fault is what I’m saying.

  - jenna wortham  
    That dancing was her fault. I mean —

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, she did do some of this dancing. But I mean, she didn’t edit
    and shoot this movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    No, she didn’t. That’s not her job.

  - wesley morris  
    And that’s not her body either. \[LAUGHS\] She’s not doing those
    stunts.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s weird how no one’s reacting, though. Everyone’s just like,
    yeah, get it. Mm-hm. Fly through the air. It’s like, no.

  - wesley morris  
    Because it’s Gotham, Jenna. This happens all the time.

  - jenna wortham  
    True. The kids are used to seeing really weird things and just being
    like, it’s all good.
    
    But wait, Wesley. What kinds of movies were out around the time this
    movie was out? Was it really outrageous that a movie like this got
    made in 2004, or were people just kind of like, you know?

  - wesley morris  
    Well, what do you mean by a movie like this? Like a superhero movie?

  - jenna wortham  
    Everything we just saw —

  - wesley morris  
    Or just like a bad.

  - jenna wortham  
    Those camera angles. Yeah. Like a really cheesy, campy — oh, I love
    breakable glass. I love fake glass in movies.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]. I mean, this would have been the summer of 2004. So
    we’re talking like, “Kill Bill Volume 2” would have opened in
    April.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, OK.

  - wesley morris  
    The best of the Harry Potter movies, Alfonso Cuaron’s “Prisoner of
    Azkaban” —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — would have opened —

  - jenna wortham  
    Damn.

  - wesley morris  
    — I think, like, earlier in June. “Collateral” would have come out a
    couple weeks after this movie with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the
    great Michael Mann movie. And this was — I mean, just to give you a
    sense of what else was in the movies that whole year, 2004, if
    memory serves, is the year of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
    Mind” —

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    — “The Aviator,” “Million Dollar Baby” is that year.

  - jenna wortham  
    Dang, OK. So there were some high caliber pictures out. Like, the
    bar was set and it was a lot higher than an RC Cola commercial,
    which is what I feel like we just watched. So —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    To add insult to injury, Jenna, this is also the same summer as
    “Spider-Man 2,” which is the best of the Spider-Mans — of all the
    Spider-Mans I would say. And one of the great action sequences, in
    that train sequence, of all time.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh\! Is that the one where Tobey Maguire single-handedly zooms down
    and stops the train — the elevated train somewhere in Manhattan with
    one hand, and it’s just like, the most epic sequence ever?

  - wesley morris  
    Yes. Yes, that is it. And then he’s like totally spent. And the
    passengers in the train car hoist him up like he’s Jesus at the —
    it’s just like —

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s the most I heart —

  - wesley morris  
    It’s beautiful.

  - jenna wortham  
    — New York iconic scene ever. So good, so good.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.
    
    Oh, she’s about to go off.

  - jenna wortham  
    She’s not having it.

  - wesley morris  
    He looks like Gerard Butler.

  - jenna wortham  
    Everybody in this movie, except for Halle and Sharon, is like a
    budget version of something else. They spent all the money on the
    visual effects. They couldn’t afford casting anybody else.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, every ounce of this movie is a budget version of something
    else.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh gosh. I can’t stop thinking about the fact that “Kill Bill” was
    out at the same time. I mean, what does it say that this is, like,
    her ultimate first act of bad-assery. She sprays soda water on a
    speaker. Meanwhile, Uma is learning to, like, drive a car with her
    tongue or whatever happens in that movie. It’s just like —

  - wesley morris  
    Look —

  - jenna wortham  
    — jeez Louise.

  - wesley morris  
    — I think this is the first time she whips somebody.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, god.

  - wesley morris  
    The fizzer is where she gets this idea to start whipping people.
    
    I think that there’s something interesting about her becoming
    Catwoman and also becoming, like, black in a way.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know if you are feeling this the way I’m feeling it. But
    this is partially Halle Berry’s performance strategy in general. And
    it definitely creates this imbalance, in this particular
    performance, where whenever she gets angry, she gets more
    interesting. And that’s Halle Berry in a lot of things.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    When her back’s up against the wall, when she’s a cornered cat,
    basically, and she has to hiss at somebody, that is her best mode,
    anger. But having her go from mousy to catty —

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    — it’s not much of an acting challenge, and from a character
    development standpoint, it’s not that interesting under the
    circumstances.

  - jenna wortham  
    I feel like this is how you know, though, that those movies were
    written by men. OK, hashtag not all men. But I do feel like only
    those men can really understand a woman stepping into her power and
    a woman becoming embodied and more powerful and aware of herself.
    They can only read that as, like, a turn for the bitchy, a turn for
    the mean, a turn for the cold, which is really unimaginative and
    boring, but it sounds very true to what Bob Kane imagined. So look
    at the material, honey. Look at the material.

  - wesley morris  
    Now, I do have a question. Like, what kind of cat is she, by the
    way?
    
    Like, she’s both a feline cat, but also she’s a dominatrix cat.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Now, I don’t get it. Like, make up your minds, y’all. Now, there is
    in the DC universe, there is a dominatrix, prostitute —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes.

  - wesley morris  
    — version of Catwoman.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. But I would also argue that this is the only way they can
    imagine a very sexy woman. She has to be a hooker or a dominatrix.
    Like, it just can’t be something that is just naturally imbued into
    a woman. So most of the women, at least in the DC comic book
    universe who make it into the movies, they’re always deeply
    traumatized. They have really ugly histories of abuse. I’m thinking
    about Harley Quinn. I’m thinking about Poison Ivy, who was actually,
    low key, the coolest villain. Like, she’s an eco-terrorist. You
    know, I really, actually, shout out to Uma Thurman who also played
    her. But they always have these deep-seated issues that never,
    really, are dealt with. They only manifest as them acting out or
    being pathologized as sort of the motivation for their criminal
    intent. Whereas Halle Berry’s Catwoman, Patience, she’s outside of
    all of that, and she has a very different origin story that doesn’t
    place her as someone who was quote, “insane.” And the only other
    person, really, that comes to mind who had that same classification
    was Wonder Woman. But she’s literally not from planet Earth. She’s
    literally descended from a Greek god. So those are the dichotomies
    of women that make their way into these superhero movies.
    
    OK, wait, Wesley. Are there any women superheroes in either of the
    comic book universes who aren’t just obsessed with, like, narcissism
    or petty crime. I mean, I know there’s Captain Marvel. But I feel
    like this is, when I’m thinking of, like, Poison Ivy and Catwoman,
    they’re all just, like, petty thiefs who use their powers just to,
    like, go shopping, essentially.

  - wesley morris  
    This is a great —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    — question. But it’s funny that you mention this about the movies
    starring comic book characters. Because they don’t really have a
    world-saving purpose. This is the appeal of Wonder Woman, right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Wonder Woman is sort of aimed at a higher purpose. But my favorite —
    one of my — I mean, Storm is one of my favorite comic book
    characters. And as I’ve told you many times — you already know this
    — I think that there’s a whole Storm X-Men arc where she loses her
    powers and is basically marooned in the comic book, essentially,
    with this character named Forge, whose ability —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, right.

  - wesley morris  
    — he’s got this architectural mutant ability. Their love affair is
    so hot and steamy. Halle Berry is still old enough to play Storm.
    
    I would love to see that.

  - jenna wortham  
    I think this is the right thing to do. This is logical. It makes
    sense to me. We don’t know her backstory. We don’t know who her
    people are. She has no one she can trust. She’s, like, I gotta look
    up diabolical cats because I feel like I’m a witch. I feel like I’m
    seeing some things.

  - wesley morris  
    But bad filmmaking is basically telling us what we already know. We
    already know what her problem is. And now it has replay —

  - jenna wortham  
    I just don’t like when movies reuse —

  - wesley morris  
    — the opening —

  - jenna wortham  
    — the title sequence.

  - wesley morris  
    — title sequence?

  - jenna wortham  
    Exactly. Yes, I’m there with you\! That is a pet peeve. That is a
    movie pet peeve of mine. It is so lazy.

  - wesley morris  
    No pun intended, but it should be everybody’s pet peeve.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. Now we’re getting somewhere.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    She —

  - wesley morris  
    She’s just I need some answers.

  - jenna wortham  
    — found a clue. She found a clue.

  - wesley morris  
    I’m going back back —

  - jenna wortham  
    She’s back at the “Up” house.

  - wesley morris  
    — to the “Up” house.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] I love that actress, oh.

  - wesley morris  
    Frances Conroy. I’m telling you, man.

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. Oh wait. Here we go. We’re about to learn something.
    
    Right. She did die.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, and this movie killed you.

  - jenna wortham  
    This movie killed more than your character.
    
    Yo, shout out to crazy cat ladies, though. They have a bad rap as an
    arch — oh, my god, this sequence. They have a bad rap as an
    archetype, but they always be knowing.
    
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh. What is this, downward cat?

  - jenna wortham  
    OK. All right. All right. I’m going to say something controversial.
    I’m actually kind of really into the mystical element. I’m into the
    idea that she’s part of this lineage of magical relationships
    between women and this Egyptian goddess, Bast. I actually kind of
    like that she gets her powers from cat breath. I like this. I like
    this better than the idea that they’re just a petty thief, like Anne
    Hathaway’s Catwoman or Eartha Kitt’s Catwoman. I’m appreciating
    this.
    
    Oh, man, I’m so deep in corona that I’m like, it’s the wrong kind of
    mask\!

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] But wait, can we just back up to talk about what Frances
    Conroy just said to Halle Berry? She said —

  - jenna wortham  
    No, what did she — Yeah, I mean, tell me.

  - wesley morris  
    Cat women are not controlled by the rules of society. You follow
    your own desires. This is both a blessing and a curse\! You’ll often
    be alone and misunderstood, but you’ll experience a freedom other
    women have never known.

  - jenna wortham  
    And how was that striking you?

  - wesley morris  
    As a bunch of BS. But I hear the movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    I’m not saying that what she’s saying isn’t true, but the movie,
    it’s not as though this is a story of Kelly Rowland finding her
    Michelle and Beyonce, right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right, right, right.

  - wesley morris  
    Again, speaking of which, more of that Beyonce knock-off.

  - jenna wortham  
    This is your movie pet peeve, actually. Oh, my god, wait. Just take
    in this whole outfit.
    
    Now, I think this is still a fire look. I love this one the first
    time I saw it, and I love it even now.

  - wesley morris  
    So if you’re Pitof at this point, how you use an Oscar winner is you
    turn her into a special effect, because that’s what you do. You
    don’t know how to direct actors. You know how to direct computer
    programming. So why not take a person and turn her into that?
    
    You know, it’s funny, right after this movie comes out, maybe like
    the next year, is “Aeon Flux” with Charlize Theron, which was
    directed by Karyn Kusama —

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    — and it was another bomb. I believe “Aeon Flux” is a movie you like
    a lot, right?

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. I was obsessed with the movie when it came out. And I still
    watch it regularly. I know it’s not good, but I still enjoy it.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, between that movie and this one, I mean, thank god for Uma
    Thurman. But the second “Kill Bill” was pretty much it.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know.

  - wesley morris  
    No more fighting for women at that point. We’re done. That’s not
    entirely true, but it just sort of lowered — it dimmed the prospects
    for women being able to fight for a long time, for at least a few
    years in movies.
    
    That is a sexy bartender. Sexy bartender alert.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] Wesley’s like, you know, I never thought I’d say this,
    but I’m excited to be in a bar again.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    Ew, she just wants a glass of milk. Ew.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I mean, the messed up part about this, though, is that the theory is
    that she’s going to be able to give in to her desires. But they’re
    not her desires. They’re these, like, ideas of what a cat wants.
    Tuna as much as you can eat out of a can, milk — a glass of milk.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    And you know, so.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna, what is your favorite nightclub sequence in a movie, because
    there’s so many bad ones, and this is definitely one of them.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. This is one of the worst ones.

  - wesley morris  
    Who’s going to the club to do any of this stuff?
    
    Now seems like a pretty good time for a fun fact.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah, hit me.

  - wesley morris  
    You ready, Jenna? When “Black Panther” came out and Michelle Obama
    had tweeted how proud she was to have “Black Panther,” there was
    this, like, mini, tiny ripple of, like, well, where were all those
    people for “Catwoman” when that came out?

  - jenna wortham  
    Excusé moi\! I’m sorry. “Catwoman” does not have Winston Duke. It
    doesn’t have Letitia Wright. It doesn’t have Danai Gurira. I mean,
    should I keep going? It didn’t have Ruth Carter at the helm with the
    costumes. I mean, come on.

  - wesley morris  
    Lupita?

  - jenna wortham  
    Like, that’s not a one-to-one. We’re not dealing with apples to
    apples here, folks, at all.

  - wesley morris  
    So then one of the screenwriters of this, of “Catwoman,” this guy
    named John Rogers tweets, “As one of the credited screenwriters of
    ‘Catwoman,’ I believe I have the authority to say, because it was
    a shit movie dumped by the studio and had zero cultural relevance in
    front of or behind the camera.”

  - jenna wortham  
    It sounds defensive, and it sounds like he’s embarrassed, and it
    sounds like — it sounds like he’s got some P.T.S.D. to work through,
    and I wish him all the best in resolving it.

  - wesley morris  
    He does, because he complains in a different tweet that this kind of
    ruined his career and he barely worked after this movie came out.

  - jenna wortham  
    All I have to say is at least it wasn’t just Halle. At least —

  - wesley morris  
    No, white men suffered, too.

  - jenna wortham  
    There you go. At least the blast radius was big enough. And I know
    that’s unkind to say, but I often feel like usually the only people
    that suffer or pay the price for this kind of bomb are not the women
    or women of color. So at least, you know, it wasn’t just her.

  - wesley morris  
    OK. Another time check. We’re going to be at 57 minutes and 5
    seconds in 3, 2, 1, now.

  - jenna wortham  
    I feel like it’s also appropriate to tell you that I have a little
    bit of wine next to me and I just took a sip. OK, I just want you to
    know that. Once the alpha came on, I took a little bit of a sip of
    my white wine. OK. So I was waiting for that part because I just
    needed to feel — you know?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I knew I was going to get excited. OK. So in preparation for our
    watch-along, I was like, what do I need to know about Halle Berry?
    And then I was like, what happened with Halle Berry and Eric Benét
    again? So that was where my research took me. Nothing useful about
    her film career. I just was like, what happened in that
    relationship? And I found this interview with her and Oprah, and she
    was saying that right after she got the Oscar is when she found out
    that Eric was having all those affairs. And so she went into triage.
    She couldn’t even celebrate having the Oscar. She went into triage
    on her relationship. And it wasn’t just one woman. He was having
    affairs the whole time they were together. So I don’t know. Maybe
    she felt like she wanted to show him what he was missing. I mean,
    you’re Halle Berry and it’s all over the news that your man is
    cheating on you. That’s a real kick to the ego. So maybe she was
    like, Listen up, one word French director, I know I have an Oscar. I
    don’t care. I want to make this movie, and I want to be in the
    sexiest costume your budget can handle. And he was like, Oui, oui.
    OK. I mean —

  - wesley morris  
    I hear that. OK. \[LAUGHS\] I hear that. Uh-oh. Advice. Advice, here
    we go.
    
    You can say her hair — (SINGING) can buy her hair, but it won’t
    grow. You can fix your nose if he says so. You can buy all the
    makeup that Mac can make.

  - jenna wortham  
    (SINGING) But if —

  - wesley morris  
    You got to fill out your —

  - jenna wortham  
    Who is that?

  - wesley morris  
    Beau-Line It’ll turn you un-pretty.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, look. He solved the case just like that. He’s like —

  - wesley morris  
    No, no. No, Jenna. No, Jenna. No, he didn’t, actually.

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    They’re like, it’s not enough that we show you she’s changed. It’s
    not enough that we —

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    — tell you she was brought back to life. We’re going to analyze her
    handwriting so that you know, in fact, there was a before and there
    is an after.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. City Side Community Center, by the way, which is just
    like movie talk for black and Latino.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    It’s just so weird what the close-ups are of. Do you know what I
    mean? Like, did we need a close-up of the bullseye and the bottles?
    
    Look at this. Look at this, Jenna. This is just some straight-up
    inner city sadness.

  - jenna wortham  
    Looks like New York, though. I mean — it looks like the kind of
    Ferris wheel you would never get on if you valued your life, you
    know. Like you would just, no.

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    You would not —

  - wesley morris  
    Look at this. It’s in a parking lot.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. Oh, no.

  - wesley morris  
    My question is what is he going to do?

  - jenna wortham  
    This is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I know, right?

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\] It is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I mean, even her moves
    at that — I mean, remember when she robbed — when she beat up the
    burglars at the jewelry store?

  - jenna wortham  
    Uh-huh.

  - wesley morris  
    All those moves were Spider-Man moves.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, yeah. That’s true. That’s true.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. That poor actor.

  - jenna wortham  
    I still think this looks cool. I’m just going to be honest. I think
    this looks cool.
    
    Oh, right. He escaped, so he actually didn’t see her do all that, so
    her powers are still secret.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s right.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. I mean, the purpose of the scene is just to let us know that
    she’s not just obsessed with petty crime. That there is kind of some
    sort of moral compass inside of her that does orient her towards
    doing good, even though she still wants to steal shiny jewels. Which
    I guess cats like, too. That was in the movie “Cats.” Cats like
    rings, so you know, can’t help them.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Can’t blame them.
    
    Do you remember how obsessed black women were with the Halle Berry
    haircut? It was like our Rachel. Like, that haircut —

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    — you know —

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    — my sister had it. I didn’t have the right texture for it so I
    couldn’t have it. But to have that, like, really short, feathered,
    pressed in the front, and like, windswept in the back. That was such
    a thing.

  - wesley morris  
    Mary J., T-Boz.
    
    By the way, for anybody who’s been wondering where Sharon Stone’s
    been the whole time, she’s been golfing.

  - jenna wortham  
    In a really gorgeous set of TLC satin pajamas.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, yes, Jenna\! It’s T-Boz’s crepe pajamas\! It’s worth pointing
    out that we’ve been spending all this time in a movie whose villain
    is ostensibly a beauty product and the people who make the beauty
    product.
    
    How many days do you think it took them to get this scene right in
    rehearsal?

  - jenna wortham  
    Not enough, if you ask me. I mean, I would spend the whole time on
    this scene.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I mean, this is the most exciting thing that’s happened in this
    movie.
    
    Oh, wait. Is she going to recruit Sharon Stone in her take-down
    mission?

  - wesley morris  
    Let’s see.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, this is so Batman, though.

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t trust her.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    Uh.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, oh, oh. What? Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    Meanwhile, this show is called Hydropolis.

  - jenna wortham  
    But this is the most Batman thing about this movie, though. There’s
    always —

  - wesley morris  
    Yup.

  - jenna wortham  
    — like a showdown at some big gala in the middle of Gotham. Whether
    it’s Uma Thurman, again, as Poison Ivy or whatever, there’s always a
    moment.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. This is very, like, Tim Burton — this is like Joel Schumacher
    Batman —

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    — quality.

  - jenna wortham  
    Is it racist they gave her acrylics? I don’t know.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    They gave her diamond acrylics. Hmm. I’m OK with it.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my lord. Oh, my lord.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh my god Cirque du Soleil\!

  - wesley morris  
    OK. This scene is just — this is like one of my number one
    complaints about the movies. You know you’re watching a lazy-ass
    movie when there are people fighting on some sort of light bridge,
    or like in the rafters of someplace. I know movies think this is
    exciting because it’s probably tough to choreograph, but boy, is it
    lazy. I mean, if you’re up there, I know it’s supposed to show off
    what the choreographer can do, but you know what the hell is going
    to happen. Somebody’s going to fall off the rafters. Or they’re
    going to get so shaky that somebody’s going to drop a weapon and
    then they’ll have to have hand-to-hand combat.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    It’s just so lame. It’s so lame.

  - jenna wortham  
    You’re saying it’s predictable and that’s what bores you.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I’m not impressed by this. That don’t impress me much.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s fair.
    
    Well, Wesley, I see your pet peeve and I raise you one, which is how
    do these people not know that the person that they’re fighting is
    their lover or their neighbor or their best friend? I mean, these
    costumes are not that concealing.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    You know what I mean? I’m just like, come on, y’all. Superman, Clark
    Kent, like, side by side for real. Spider-Man, OK, I get it. He’s
    fully covered. But also it’s clearly Halle Berry. It’s clearly your
    boo Ben. Get it together.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. I mean, at least with Lois Lane, I could get it because Margot
    Kidder was just on some other stuff with Christopher Reeve Superman.

  - jenna wortham  
    Sure. OK, sure. Yeah, glasses really conceal a lot. Yeah, no, I get
    it.

  - wesley morris  
    I also think that Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane was into having two
    lovers, right? She was into —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    — into having this dual relationship. She didn’t need to tell us
    that that was what was on her mind, but I think she kind of knew.

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, that I’m on board for. That is fine.

  - wesley morris  
    But I don’t know. Benjamin Bratt, I think he just might not be smart
    in this movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    These spotlights are getting an awful lot of close-ups, by the way.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] I’m just blocking out all the close-ups.

  - wesley morris  
    Can cats see in the dark?

  - jenna wortham  
    I think so. I mean, they’re definitely nocturnal. They like to do
    things at night.

  - wesley morris  
    I do think if anybody did their research on anything, it was
    probably what things do cats do?

  - jenna wortham  
    I know.

  - wesley morris  
    It’s the only thing this thing gets right.
    
    Again —

  - jenna wortham  
    Wow.

  - wesley morris  
    — why is Sharon Stone getting the best clothes in the movie?

  - jenna wortham  
    That was in her contract, a hundred percent.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    She was like, I don’t care what Halle wears, but I will be in
    Versace knockoffs.

  - wesley morris  
    I think if it’s Sharon Stone, though, the budget might have gone to
    Versace.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know. I know. All the budget went to Versace and that leather top
    that Halle’s wearing. I’m fine with it.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh. She’s the terminator.

  - jenna wortham  
    What just happened there? Did I miss something? Is her face really
    hard?

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Beau-Line she’s like, she’s Beau-Line’d out. (SINGING)
    Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line. Please don’t make me hit
    you one more time.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wow.
    
    Gosh, I have such a hard time when Alex Bornstein talks because I
    just see the mom from “Family Guy.” It’s ridiculous.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    Because she does voice that character.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, boy.
    
    Halle, we need you to act like a cat looking at fish who just wants
    to get in the tank.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Can you do that?
    
    And now we need to really — we need you to really enjoy this sushi.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, no. Oh, no. I’m uncomfortable.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah. Exactly. So am I.

  - jenna wortham  
    I guess she hasn’t eaten the whole movie from the time we saw the
    tuna until now, so she is pretty hungry.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s weird that, like, the assumption is cats have no control of
    their impulses. Have you ever been around a cat? They are the most
    studious creatures.

  - wesley morris  
    But that’s — she’s going to age into Frances Conroy is what’s going
    to happen.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. That’s her future. Got it.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s her future. That’s my guess.
    
    Jenna, I don’t know what your temperature is right now. My blood
    pressure just is plummeting. So this seems like a pretty good time
    to talk about how Halle Berry’s best parts have come from either
    Oprah Winfrey or cable television.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, right.

  - wesley morris  
    Oprah got her to play Janie in her TV version of “Their Eyes Were
    Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s novel.

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m going to revisit that. That’s a good homework for me.

  - wesley morris  
    She’s good in it. And then she played Dorothy Dandridge for HBO.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know. My favorite TV movie.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh\!

  - jenna wortham  
    I loved that movie.

  - wesley morris  
    I did not know that.

  - jenna wortham  
    I thought it was so good. She’s so good in it.

  - wesley morris  
    Well, she needs to channel some Dorothy Dandridge up in here.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    But I feel like if you let her play a part that has a beginning and
    a middle and an end, someplace for her to go and to act, you know,
    those are things that basically any actor needs, by the way — a
    beginning and a middle and an end. Something to aspire to play. But
    she can do so much if you give her something that amuses her. Do you
    think there’s enough in this movie for her to sink her claws into?

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] No. I mean, there’s no emotion. There’s not really a ton
    of drive. I mean, she needs a backstory. I mean, that’s what made
    her so good in Dorothy Dandridge. You understood that woman’s
    plight. You understood her tension. You understood her ambitions. I
    mean, give us some of that. Oh, my gosh, wait. Look at her freaking
    out because of the rain.

  - wesley morris  
    That’s what we want. We want Dorothy Dandridge, Catwoman. I would
    love to see that.
    
    Now we’re in a Janet Jackson video.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] So true.

  - wesley morris  
    And that’s all we get.

  - jenna wortham  
    That’s all we get?

  - wesley morris  
    This seems like another good time to synchronize those clocks. We’re
    going to be at 1 hour, 15 minutes and 55 seconds in 3, 2, 1, now.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait. Was that a video phone call? Or what was that?

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know.

  - jenna wortham  
    You know, is this a good time to mention the Beyonce and Gaga video,
    video phone, that literally starts like that? I mean —

  - wesley morris  
    Yes.

  - jenna wortham  
    I don’t know. I think this movie was a lot more influential than
    people give credit for.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    I just feel like, Halle Berry’s character now has all — you know,
    she’s got a lot of wisdom, right? She understands she’s got these
    cat powers. She’s not doing anything with them. Why didn’t the movie
    at least let her — yeah. Like, Spider-Man gets to have fun. Usually
    the superheroes get to have fun. There’s always a sequence of them,
    like, running around town, playing with their powers. I guess she
    rode a motorcycle through town, but she didn’t need to be bitten by
    a cat to do that.

  - wesley morris  
    By the way, she didn’t do anything. That was also half stunt double
    —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    — half C.G.I. So —

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh.

  - wesley morris  
    OK. This scene right here is exactly why I have been complaining for
    a lot of this movie about the problem of having Sharon Stone and
    Halle Berry in “Catwoman” at the same time. Because on the one hand,
    I love Halle Berry, and on the other hand, I love Sharon Stone. It
    isn’t that I can’t love both those people at the same time. But
    every time Sharon Stone’s in the movie, she takes the oxygen away
    from anybody else in the scene.

  - jenna wortham  
    Especially Halle.

  - wesley morris  
    And especially Halle Berry who has the disadvantage of looking
    ridiculous in this sexy costume in a room with Sharon Stone. I don’t
    know if that makes sense. \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god.

  - wesley morris  
    I’ll bet you anything, Sharon Stone had her own writers or
    something. Like —

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Sharon was like, I see your Oscar and I’ll raise you \[LAUGHS\] —

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    — this scene.

  - wesley morris  
    There is something kind of costumy about what Halle Berry is asked
    to do here, and there’s nothing costumy about what Sharon Stone is
    doing. She’s just playing your classic mean villain. It’s just
    Sharon Stone knows how to be in a movie, and she knows how to steal
    a scene from people who are vulnerable to having a scene stolen from
    them. \[LAUGHS\] And I think Halle Berry is so concentrating on one
    side of things that she doesn’t even notice the sneak attack that
    Sharon Stone is waging.
    
    I love in movies where, like, characters have to find out what’s
    going on in their lives by looking up at a giant monitor in public.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] And then hurry away and hope no one noticed that was them
    onscreen.

  - wesley morris  
    And hope nobody notices.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] Which is also how you know all these movies take place in
    a fictitious New York, because in a real New York, everyone would be
    like, That’s you, bro. Like, That’s you\!
    
    Oh, that’s her losing Isaiah in “Monster’s Ball” voice.

  - wesley morris  
    See, the thing about Halle Berry to me is in a lot of Halle Berry
    performances, there are these moments where you just get a sense of
    what she could be doing.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    She’s worked with not that many great directors.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm, interesting.

  - wesley morris  
    I have really been — like take something like “Jungle Fever” for
    instance.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hm.

  - wesley morris  
    She had a small part in that movie, but she’s really good in it.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    Even “Monster’s Ball,” which we can talk about.

  - jenna wortham  
    Well, we don’t have to. I mean, I’ve always been curious about your
    response to it.

  - wesley morris  
    She had a good director. I mean, I don’t love that guy, but he’s
    good at directing actors, I’ll say that. And I mean, she’s evidently
    very good in that, right? But those parts are very hard to come by,
    and she’s fighting, at this point in her career, who’s she fighting
    for parts? She’s fighting Charlize Theron. She’s fighting Nicole
    Kidman, Angelina Jolie. She’s up against —
    
    I would love to hear Halle Berry talk about the parts she didn’t get
    during this period after she wins the Oscar. But I’m sure it’s lots
    of juicy things, or maybe she wasn’t even considered for them.

  - jenna wortham  
    I wonder. Yeah, I wonder.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, she can do lots of things. I just don’t think this movie
    really shows any of that off.
    
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh. \[LAUGHS\] That was like, actually, like the perfect timing to
    illustrate your point. They just, you know. But are any superhero
    movies really well acted? Like, I’m just scanning my mind. I mean,
    it’s hard. It’s hard.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, some of them have their moments. I think that everybody in
    the first two Spider-Man movies is fantastic. I think that McKellen
    and Stewart in the X-Men movies —

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah, I agree.

  - wesley morris  
    Hugh Jackman in “Wolverine.”

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, my god, “Wolverine” is so good.

  - wesley morris  
    You know, like Heath Ledger ais Joker. I mean, these movies do have
    room for good performances.
    
    Best line in the movie right there. “Lassie would have brought me
    the key.”

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s also —

  - wesley morris  
    That’s a screenwriter right there.

  - jenna wortham  
    — the rudest, though. But that’s the rudest. I’m sorry. That cat
    brought you back to life. That cat is done working for you, honey.
    Like, come on. Oh, is she just really going to — we’re just going to
    pretend that she can fit through this — oh, OK. All right. I guess
    we’re still in an X-Men movie where people’s bodies rearrange, the
    molecules change. All right.

  - wesley morris  
    Is she Mystique or Catwoman?

  - jenna wortham  
    Right. Right. They don’t know. Honey, they don’t know.
    
    I mean, it would be a much more interesting movie if we saw what a
    person, or especially this woman, did with all that newfound power.
    But she’s like, No, I’m going to use every ounce of energy I have to
    take down this huge multinational corporation. I mean, good on you,
    but like, also is that what you want to be doing?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh. Pull up to my bumper, baby.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] That’s very J. Lo.

  - wesley morris  
    Now again, like what was the point of her fondling — oh, because
    it’s a cat. It’s a cat\! It’s a cat.

  - jenna wortham  
    It’s a cat and she wants the car. She takes what she wants.
    
    I love how Sharon Stone was inspired by Catwoman. She was like, I
    can murder, too. Like, I’ll do what I want, too. Sharon Stone’s
    like, I didn’t need to die first. I didn’t need to get bit by a cat.
    I will take control of my own destiny and not be obsessed with milk
    and tuna.
    
    You know, Wesley, you’re right. I see what you’re saying. Sharon
    Stone, she really just knows how to be in a movie.
    
    I feel like that’s a challenge, though, for women like Halle. It’s
    like, she’s not sure which part of herself to play up. Is she
    playing up her physicality? Is she playing up her beauty? Is she
    playing up her steeliness? Like, I think she has always struck me as
    an actor who is so conscious of how she’s going to be perceived as a
    black woman, and how the different gazes will be falling on her,
    that she doesn’t really play to any of the aspects of herself. She
    kind of just lets herself get played. And you can really feel it
    here in contrast to someone like Sharon Stone who knows exactly what
    angle she’s working, exactly what she’s trying to do on screen. And
    that’s a luxury. I mean, that’s a privilege that she has. But she
    gets to kind of be as — take up as much space as she wants. And I
    don’t know that Halle’s ever really felt that in any of her roles.

  - wesley morris  
    I will also say, Sharon Stone, it took her a long time to even get
    to that moment —

  - jenna wortham  
    I was going to say, yeah.

  - wesley morris  
    — in “Catwoman“, if you know what I mean.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah. I was realizing that in real time.

  - wesley morris  
    You know, this is a seasoned movie star, basically, with all of this
    experience. This is the thing about older actors, right? About
    especially women. Like, you spend your whole career building up some
    knowledge, and some vocabulary, and some natural way of presenting
    yourself in front of a camera.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    And the minute you figure that out, you get thrown over the side of
    the boat. And turned into, like, Meow Mix.

  - \[laughter\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Chum. You’re chum.

  - wesley morris  
    I don’t know. Here is a woman who’s just got more experience and
    more charisma than a movie like this even needs. And Halle Berry
    just kind of is the unwitting victim of it.

  - jenna wortham  
    She gets very declawed around Sharon Stone, like defanged and
    declawed. Like, all the bad-assery just goes out the window when
    she’s next to Sharon Stone.

  - wesley morris  
    I mean, the thing that’s exasperating about this, when you look at
    what is happening with the Sharon Stone character versus what’s
    happening with the Halle Berry character, is all of the writing is
    there for Sharon Stone. And Halle Berry, Patience has no real —
    she’s got a personality, but it’s a very generic personality.
    She’s just good. She’s a good person having a naughty moment. But
    every time Sharon Stone’s on screen, I just want to be with her.

  - jenna wortham  
    Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And that isn’t about Halle Berry per se, but it is about Halle Berry
    in this movie.

  - jenna wortham  
    Hmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Which is that every time Sharon Stone shows up, I want to know
    whatever’s going on in that woman’s psyche.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    Catwoman has no psyche. She’s got all these, like, personality
    traits that correspond with a house animal.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know. She was a do-gooder, and then doing good got her into
    trouble, and she got a second chance, and this is what she’s doing
    with it.

  - wesley morris  
    Do you think the lighting is the real lighting, or do you think
    everybody got touched up? Because —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] I’m like —

  - wesley morris  
    The only person who doesn’t look touched up is Benjamin Bratt. But
    Sharon Stone’s face looks —

  - jenna wortham  
    Fluorescent.

  - wesley morris  
    — extra creamy.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah, they’re all glowing. Yeah. Yeah.
    
    Like the insistence there’s a right way to do this. Or right way to
    — oh, whoa. But she didn’t, though, did she? Did I miss something?
    It wasn’t Sharon Stone.

  - wesley morris  
    Jenna let me ask you a question right now.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mm-hm.

  - wesley morris  
    Let’s just say that you just killed your husband —

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - wesley morris  
    And —

  - jenna wortham  
    I’m there, keep going.

  - wesley morris  
    — this woman is just on your tail, and she’s dressed like a
    dominatrix from an En Vogue video.

  - jenna wortham  
    You’re describing, literally, my dreams. Go on.

  - wesley morris  
    Do you have time right now to really talk about your motivations for
    why you’ve become evil?

  - jenna wortham  
    I do.

  - wesley morris  
    You do?

  - jenna wortham  
    A hundred percent I do.

  - wesley morris  
    OK.

  - jenna wortham  
    Yes. Yes, because that’s part of the seduction. This is what’s — I’m
    like, let’s talk.

  - wesley morris  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - jenna wortham  
    Let me see if I can get you on my side. Yes. I’m like, Halle Berry,
    come join me, boo. Like, we can rule this kingdom together.
    
    Now, that’s an act — like a very interesting super villain
    backstory. That’s fantastic.

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah, exactly. Exactly\!

  - jenna wortham  
    Yeah.
    
    It’s always so disappointing in these superhero movies, though, when
    the women superheroes can’t actually do anything. Like they always
    get bested. Do you know what I mean?

  - wesley morris  
    Yeah.

  - jenna wortham  
    And you’re just like what’s the point of all those powers? What’s
    the point of all that painful transformation, giving up your old
    life, when it barely comes down — barely gets you anything in a
    one-to-one fist fight.

  - wesley morris  
    You know what I hate, I hate generic action setting finale. I hate
    warehouse showdown.

  - jenna wortham  
    Mmm.

  - wesley morris  
    Like, I know we’re supposed to be in an office building, but this
    looks no different to me than like ye old dockyard shootout.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    That is a bad line.

  - wesley morris  
    That is a bad line.

  - jenna wortham  
    Abs of steel. She was like, I’ll be fine. Yeah, where was that whip
    hiding? Where was that whip hiding the whole time?

  - wesley morris  
    Also, from a physics standpoint, her being able to fling that thing
    around like that makes no sense.

  - jenna wortham  
    I agree.

  - wesley morris  
    She’d be hitting the ceilings and the walls and the pillar. It just
    —
    
    Oh, my god. Oh, Sharon. No\! No\!
    
    No, Sharon\!

  - jenna wortham  
    Sharon’s like, I would rather die than live with this face.

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, that fall\! \[LAUGHS\] Jenna, have you ever seen a fall like
    that before in your life?

  - jenna wortham  
    I have not. This movie —

  - wesley morris  
    The flipping in the air. It was like a real person\! Oh, my god\!

  - jenna wortham  
    Where has he been this whole time?

  - wesley morris  
    He’s useless.

  - jenna wortham  
    He’s useless.

  - wesley morris  
    Funny, he got up to her apartment in, like, two seconds to save her
    the first time.

  - jenna wortham  
    \[LAUGHS\] Right.

  - wesley morris  
    And now it takes him 20 minutes to get up there to help her fight
    Sharon Stone.

  - jenna wortham  
    Oh, he’s just going to pin them all on her?

  - wesley morris  
    Oh, my god. There is a tragedy right there.

  - jenna wortham  
    I know.

  - wesley morris  
    Tragedy.
    
    One of our least fulfilled movie stars just in a pile of glass on a
    logo. Oh, her dreams came true.

  - jenna wortham  
    Wait. I missed this whole thing. All right.

  - wesley morris  
    He works at the hospital. I think he’s a doctor.

  - jenna wortham  
    And they got together, I guess.

  - wesley morris  
    They got together.

  - jenna wortham  
    You know, part of the reason we picked this movie is because we were
    kind of starting our own silent hashtag campaign, justice for Halle,
    because we didn’t feel like she’d ever been properly served by
    Hollywood, or ever had an opportunity to properly stretch her wings,
    right? I think that Halle’s struggle represents a bigger struggle
    within Hollywood, in any industry where you have to figure out how
    to present yourself, or they’ll figure it out for you, and they’ll
    fail, right? Like Halle, they couldn’t figure out if Halle should be
    the sex symbol, or is she a serious actor, is she an action figure.
    I mean, she just let them make her into whatever the picture needed.
    I mean, the real coup would be for Halle to come back, know exactly
    — like pull a Reese Witherspoon and start producing and making the
    movies she wants to be in and being a part of it. But honestly, I
    kind of feel like she’s playing the role that she wants to play,
    which is if you go to her Instagram, she’s just hanging out with her
    kids, easing into her 50s, nothing left to prove. I mean, I wonder
    if she still thinks about cat person. I’m going to say cat person in
    this movie instead of Catwoman. But I wonder if she still thinks
    about this movie.

  - \[music\]

  - wesley morris  
    That is our show\! We did it\!

  - jenna wortham  
    We did it\!

  - wesley morris  
    We made it through the whole way\! And before we go, next week,
    y’all fetch them bolt cutters. Talking about Fiona Apple. “Still

We’re trying something new this week. We want you to watch a movie with
us. And not just any movie, but the 2004 superhero bomb “Catwoman,”
starring two of our favorites: Halle Berry and Sharon Stone. We’ve got
fun facts, some questions and a little bit of, um, cattiness.
