\begin{itemize}
\item
  {[}music{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm Jenna Wortham.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'm Wesley Morris. We're two culture writers at The New York Times,
  and we've got an experiment.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And this is ``Still Processing.''

  Get ready for a Still Processing watch-along.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It really is an experiment. We're gonna ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You and I are going to watch a movie together, and you guys who are
  listening to us are going to watch the movie with us.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This week is very much about being in your living room, or your
  bedroom, or even your bathtub. Look, it's up to you.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So Miss Wortham, what are we watching?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. So there's so many things we wanted to talk about, but ultimately,
  we were like, let's pick something that's definitely fun and funny,
  nothing bloody, nothing violent. There's just way too much of that
  stress in the world right now. So, you know, something that's
  incredibly low stakes, but also deeply, visually pleasurable. So
  Wesley ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- who is the only celebrity that both you and I follow on Instagram
  right now?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, it's Halle Berry.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's Halle Berry. You know, so this is really a Halle Berry
  appreciation week, and we went through deep in her archives, and what
  did we pull out?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  ``Catwoman.'' It came out in 2004. The Halle Berry, the Sharon Stone.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Also, the looks, that leather outfit, their whips, rhinestone-studded
  acrylics. I mean, listen, there is a lot to get into here. Find a cozy
  place, get your favorite snacks.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's you, and Jenna, and me, and Halle Berry all on your sofa in your
  bed, wherever you're watching this, and it's going to get real
  intimate and real deep. Real deep. And I gotta say, this thing is
  going to be, you know, about two hours. Of all the things we've done
  on this show, this might actually be the blackest podcast thing you
  and I have ever done, Jenna Wortham, spending two hours talking.
  They're going to fly. The fur is going to fly. The minutes are going
  to fly. You won't even know the time has past. You're gonna look up
  and be like, wait, this is over?

  All right. One second and we'll be back with Pitof's ``Catwoman.''
\item
  {[}music{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  So here's how this is going to work. ``Catwoman,'' believe it or not,
  is on a ton of streaming services for the relatively low price of
  \$1.99. So it's on Amazon, YouTube, and iTunes, and a few other
  places. So the first thing you're going to do is rent it. The next
  thing you're going to do is queue it up on your TV or your laptop. It
  makes the most sense if you keep your phone handy with the podcast
  cued up and ready there. If you try to do both on the same device, it
  might be really challenging.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Once you've rented it, hit play, and then pause. Make sure that you're
  set to zero minutes and zero seconds. And then we'll tell you when to
  hit play so that we're all watching the same thing at the same time.
  And don't worry, if you have to pause or you think you're off, we'll
  be announcing the time code every once in a while so you can get back
  in sync with us. So hit pause on us, on the show, go get ``Catwoman,''
  and then start us back up and we'll all watch this thing together.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK? Everybody ready? Everybody good? Got your snacks? You got your
  drinks? You ready to do this? It's going to be amazing! So let's all
  get ready for the 2004 --- I can't believe I'm saying this --- super
  hero spectacular ``Catwoman.''
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is going to be so good!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK, on my count, we're going to hit play. 3, 2, 1, hit play! Wes, you
  rolling? I'm rolling. I'm seeing the Warner Brothers logo, the weird
  wavy undulations.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I can hear it in my headphones. I'm so excited.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Your excitement is exciting me, I have to be honest.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} OK, y'all, we're going back to 2004 when Halle Berry was
  essentially kind of still on top of the world. She had just won an
  Academy Award for her performance in ``Monster's Ball,'' becoming the
  reigning only black Best Actress winner in the history of American
  movies.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Still to this day.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Reigning champ. Reigning champ. Octavia can't defeat her. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Viola.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Viola can't defeat her. Angela Bassett. Nope, can't defeat Halle
  Berry. So she's looking for something to do. She was just in the big
  James Bond movie, ``Die Another Day.'' She played Jinx.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's right. That's right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Famously arose from the ocean in the most delightful tangerine bathing
  suit. And you know, what are you going to do when you're on top of the
  world and you have, the world is your oyster? You'll want to make a
  statement, so what do you do? You're going to do ``Catwoman.'' You're
  going to break another barrier and become the first woman, in a long
  time, to star in your own superhero movie based on a comic book. And
  you're going to be the first black woman to ever do that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. That helps. That helps me understand the why for Halle. But can
  you help me understand the why it looks like this so far? Like, who is
  responsible for this?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, well, nobody can blame Halle Berry for how bad this movie looks.
  That would be ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jean-Christophe Comar, a.k.a. Pitof --- P-I-T-O-F, the man credited
  with directing ``Catwoman.'' He's a visual effects supervisor.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And, you know, he did ``The City of Lost Children,'' he did one of
  your jams, ``Alien Resurrection.'' And he has been given the reins to
  Halle Berry's make or break box office opportunity here. And I'm
  saying make or break because she is a woman and a black woman, and if
  this thing does not hit, her stuff might hit the rocks, and who knows
  what will happen if this movie bombs. We should be watching this movie
  thinking, is this what you do with your Oscar winner?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Is this ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- what you do with a woman at the peak of her career?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Is this it? Is this really it?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. This is the million dollar question. You have all that talent,
  all that charisma, iconic hair, incredible physique, and this is what
  you do with it. Hm. Curious.

  It actually looks a lot like it belongs on the Beyonce album, though,
  like that imagery. Very familiar.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, you're --- this is ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Very familiar.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You're going to be saying that a lot during this movie, I suspect.

  What's also, like what is remarkable --- what is unremarkable about
  Halle Berry? Like, we're supposed to believe she's this shlubby,
  klutzy, average woman?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's kind of her character from ``Boomerang'' though.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yes, it's true. It's true.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's not that far from it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  For all you ``Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'' watchers out there, that is Alex
  Borstein.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Whoa, how old is Halle Berry here?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  37 when the movie opens, and 32 when it ends.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. We're just going to stop talking right here because you're going
  to get some really important villain exposition right here. So zip it,
  us.

  So in another movie, that's what this would have been about, right?
  Old Sharon Stone being replaced by a younger model, and she turns into
  Catwoman and goes on a crime spree.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I would watch that movie, too, though.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, I mean, it just doesn't make --- this, it doesn't make any sense
  why --- one of these women is extra. {[}LAUGHS{]} We don't need Sharon
  Stone and Halle Berry in a Catwoman movie. We only need one.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  No, we need two. There could be more women. Why isn't Angelina Jolie
  in this? Put May --- like, put more people in this.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Were you going to say Maya Rudolph? Were you going to say put Maya
  Rudolph?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I stopped myself. I did. I stopped myself. {[}LAUGHS{]} I stopped
  myself. I stopped myself. But J. Lo could have been in this, too.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  What is about to happen right now --- this is an Anne Hathaway moment.

  Jenna, can you talk about this outfit?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's really setting us up for the reveal of the body-yody-yody in the
  costume, because we can't see what's going on underneath ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's a great point.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- all those rags. It's really setting it up ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's a good point.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- for the makeover scene. But it's hilarious. I mean, can you
  imagine, in any year, in any time, like, going to work dressed like
  that at an ad agency? I just don't understand.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I don't understand.

  I miss Sharon Stone. This makes nostalgic for her.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  We all do.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Dang. She must be in New York City. That's the truest thing about this
  movie.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, she's not in Gotham. She's not in Gotham, because at this point,
  that man would have long been here.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}.

  Wow.

  She's so mousy.

  It's so interesting, though, how the movies always equate, like ---
  oh, wait. I got distracted. The cat --- the first cat!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. Wait, what were you going to say?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Well, it's just funny how the movies equate, like, a shlumpiness with,
  like, you know, like an unattractiveness? Like we're supposed to
  believe that she's a good person in this iteration of self because she
  doesn't care about clothes, and she's beautiful but doesn't know it.
  She doesn't know how to raise her voice, you know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  My god, that apartment.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But again --- again, where in Gotham is this?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. Let me enjoy the fantasy. It doesn't matter. I just want
  to pretend I could live there, too.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But I mean, like, I don't know what Gotham rents are, but I don't ---
  you know.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait, Wesley. This cat is sentient. It's not a regular cat, right?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This is the cat that came on the boat from Egypt.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Miss Wortham, just fasten your seat belt. Patience look out for all
  that bird poop! Bird poop, Halle. Bird poop.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, don't step on the AC! That's every New Yorker's worst
  nightmare. No! Oh, my gosh. I thought --- oh, my god. I was promised
  this movie would be enjoyable and not stressful.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, who is that? Remind me his name.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Benjamin Bratt. That's the Bratt right there.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  He's so hot. Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is the nicest thing a cop's ever done for a black woman since
  ``Crash.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Actually, this is before ``Crash.'' This is the nicest thing a black
  woman's ever done before ``Crash.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wow.

  He's really jumping to a lot of conclusions. You know, it's like ---

  what?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK, first of all ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Is he supposed to be Batman?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  How the hell did he get up to the fourth floor ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That fast.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- of this building.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And into the apartment, by the way, did she just leave the door open?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  We're not supposed to ask questions. We're just supposed to marvel at
  the miracle and the budding sexual chemistry between the two of them.

  What time of day is it, late for her job? What the hell?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I don't understand! It is late afternoon, madam. We are --- what did
  she drop? Oh, my god. Oh, wait. He's going to get it. All right, cute.
  Cute. OK. This movie is full of deeply attractive people. I am more
  onboard than I thought I was going to be.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. I mean, Benjamin Bratt is one of those people who's so handsome,
  like, you don't even know where to start speaking about how handsome
  he is.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. It doesn't --- like, I'm flabbergasted ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, check this out.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- when I look at him. Oh, here's Sharon Stone again walking through
  this lobby looking like a whole ass snack. OK. OK. I --- my only frame
  of reference for Sharon Stone is, I guess, most people's frame of
  reference for Sharon Stone, which is ``Basic Instinct.'' But there's
  so much more than that. Like, where is she at at this moment in time,
  Wesley? Can you help me --- give me some context for her?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, I mean, you know, she was the face of American movies for about
  the first half of the 1990s. She essentially had one of the great five
  to six year runs of a lot of stars. Like unlikely, given how long she
  worked to get to the point where she was in ``Basic Instinct.'' She
  made ``Casino'' for Martin Scorsese in 1995.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's right. Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Gets an Academy Award nomination. And she didn't even win and it was
  all downhill for her after that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hey.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And at this point, here she is 10 years after that ``Casino''
  nomination, more or less, starring in a movie about being a washed-up
  beauty spokesmodel being replaced ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- by some unlikely brunette that her husband is sleeping with.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, Wesley. Can you imagine Ryan Murphy's take, like a
  satirical take on the challenges of an aging Hollywood star who's been
  wronged by her industry and turning it into primetime TV gold with the
  drama of his other properties, like ``Pose'' or ``The Politician.''
  Ugh, chef's kiss --- like we need it.

  I love that this is what the movies think that office life is like.
  Just, like, hanging out in each other's cubicles. I mean, they're not
  wrong, but it just tickles me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And now, Jenna, some ``Catwoman'' facts.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK, yeah. Because I'm riveted. I'm like, how much did this make in the
  box office? Like --- I --- yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, it made a grand total of \$82 million, and cost, apparently,
  \$100 million to make.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, yikes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And they originally --- I mean, it went through all of these different
  iterations of wanting different people to play Catwoman. Ashley Judd
  was mentioned at some point and didn't do it. And eventually it just
  went to Halle Berry. It was made very quickly, by the way, because of
  all kinds of production problems, like getting it going.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So I don't know how many --- I don't know how much prep time Halle
  Berry even had to play the part.

  Oh, I hate --- I love this effect. Remember, the director of this
  movie is a visual effects person. So he's really bored out of his mind
  and needs something to do, and it's not direct Halle Berry.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. He's like, no ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So let's make all the people disappear.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- I want the time to be bouncing around. Yeah. And on the left,
  there's a screen saver.

  Honey, why didn't they film New York. What is going on right now?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Like why ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Because you're working with a visual effects person. All he wants to
  do is, like, pee on the fire hydrant of this script.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. It's very ``Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.'' You
  know, it's like in another time, he would have had a lot of fun with
  that script. He's way ahead of his time.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup. Meanwhile, when you were asking before if this is what office
  life is like, the answer is yes. Because anytime I come down to your
  desk and want to hang out, the punishment is I gotta stay at work till
  9:00 at night.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}

  This is the corkscrew. This is what turns the crank. This becomes her
  --- the driving engine, right, of Catwoman.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know how, like, in real life those guys are probably really
  handsome, but in the movies they look generic? They just look like
  generic bad guys?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. They put weird matte powder on their faces to make them less
  attractive. It's like, if you splash them with warm water, you'd be
  like, damn.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know, on the one hand it is kind of cool that Halle Berry is
  joining this lineage of catwomen. Now, the movie is making it seem
  like there is a lineage of actual cat women, but OK, the movie can do
  that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But on the other hand, she is joining this long family of other
  catwomen. It's like, Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar on the TV show. And
  Michelle Pfeiffer perhaps most famously. And then there's Anne
  Hathaway in the third Christopher Nolan batman movie, Batman ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  ``The Dark Knight Rises.''
\item
  wesley morris\\
  ``The Dark Knight Rises.'' Thank you very much. On the other hand,
  Halle Berry is playing a Catwoman who has nothing to do with the DC
  universe. I don't know where this woman is from. I don't know what ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know what town this is. Like, we're calling it Gotham, but
  we're being real nice. Because, first of all, every other Catwoman, as
  far as I know, was named Selina Kyle. And they were all basically
  thieves and cat burglars. And they didn't really have super powers.
  They just --- like, it was a comic book. They just --- they weren't
  bad, they were just drawn that way, if you know what I'm saying.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  They were thieves who happened to have real agility and wall climbing
  prowess and that sort of stuff. And Batman was really into them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. Yes, she does fall in chemicals, OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No! Halle, no, no!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  There we go. Is this how she becomes ``Catwoman?'' Is this the origin
  story? Does the cat have to fall in there with her, too? I mean.

  This is the only kind of suspense I like these days.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's not Spider-Man. It's not Spider-Man or Spider Woman for that
  matter. Although, this might be up for debate when the action starts.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  But I feel like it's a combination of Venom, and Mr. Manhattan, and
  like, I don't know. Like it's all of these things wrapped up in one.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He happened to be standing right next to the box, by the way.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god. He's like a black woman in New York City? Nobody'll miss
  her. It's fine.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Just turn on the pipes.

  Well, honey, what underground labyrinth is this? Where ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know. But you know what the truth is, Jenna, this is where
  they dump all the chemicals into the river. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's not a water valve.

  That duct is for dumping the chemicals into whatever Gotham's river
  is.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's the villain bath.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wesley, doesn't this part kind of remind you of ``Lemonade'' a little
  bit, Beyonce's visual album? It looks very ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh-huh. Huh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. It looks so similar. Do you think this was on Beyonce's mood
  board for --- oh, my god, a cat! I mean, it's entirely possible. Both
  characters, they are in this womb space. They are in this watery
  tunnel. They are going through this period of deep incubation,
  gestation. Halle Berry, just like Beyonce, journeying through an
  underworld. Dealing with Pluto. Dealing with Hades. I mean, very
  culty, very witchy. Look, I hope the link's there. I approve. Into it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh-huh. Huh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's brilliant, Wes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So I do have some questions here. What are the real cats and what are
  the digital cats? And how long did Halle have to lay there until they
  all do what they were supposed to do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know what I was just thinking though? This is the real ``Cats,''
  and it's better than ``Cats,'' you know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} It's better than ``Cats.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  These are the jellicles. Is that what they're called, I forgot? This
  is the jellicle cats.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, that's right.

  Oh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's a real cat. That's a real cat.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is some cat wrangler's proudest moment.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait, what's it going to do to her?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Give her Covid.

  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} This is the origin story for Covid? No, that's so dark.
  So I used to have a cat and it did this to me in the mornings. It
  loved sitting on my chest and breathe its cat breath into my face. I
  never had anything half this exciting happen as what's happening right
  now.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So I wonder, if you're Halle, you know, like, the reason you put up
  with being a mousy sort of klutz for the first 20 minutes of this
  movie, is that you know that you're at some point going to get to kick
  some people and jump on some railings or something?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I mean, Halle Berry had already been in superhero movies. I mean, she
  was in some of the best X-Men movies, in my opinion. ``X-Men,'' which
  came out, I guess, in 2000. And then ``X2,'' 2003, is that right?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And she played Storm. You know, and it's interesting actually to
  remember, because I love those movies. And in a way, she was kind of
  the weakest link there, too. And it's not really her fault. They just
  didn't really give her a lot to do in those movies. They gave her a
  bad white wig, and just made it really windy. {[}LAUGHS{]} Like
  remember, Cyclops is always like, Storm, a little cover, and she would
  grab the armrest and her eyes would roll back in her head, and then
  the fog would descend. And it's like, word? OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. She was my favorite X-Man and ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- that's what happened to her.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  So maybe Halle read the script and was like, ``I do want to crouch,
  crab walk down an alley, and look at some spiders in high def, yes! I
  will do it.'' Is this true to her origin story? Does she fall in a vat
  of chemicals. I've got to look this up.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm just like, does she get bit by the cat? Does she fall into the
  chemicals? I just need to know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I love that you need to know this.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm very curious.

  They do do that.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You would ask. You would ask. Let me rack my brain for a second. I
  don't recall this happening to any Catwoman in any of Bob Kane's
  editions of ``Catwoman,'' like even in subsequent editions. Catwoman,
  she just likes to steal things. She's just a thief. No cats gave her a
  virus and turned her into an actual cat. As far as I know, the other
  women just liked to impersonate cats because it was a sexy thing to
  do, because she is the creation of men. No women had had any say in
  the creation of this character. She's just being pulled on some
  strings by some dudes who --- let me just read you what Bob Kane, the
  creator of Catwoman, thought he was doing when he invented this lady.
  This is Catwoman's creator Bob Kane saying in his memoir, ``Batman and
  Me,'' ``I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like
  dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are cool, detached
  and reliable. Cats are as hard to understand as women are. You always
  need to keep a woman at arm's length. We don't want anyone talking
  ---''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- over our souls. And women have a habit of doing that. So there's a
  love/resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I'm
  being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel I've had better
  relationships with male friends than women.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I feel like this unnatural binary explains decades of sour
  relationships between men and women, and just, wow, it all goes back
  to the DC comic universe. I mean, this explains so much about the
  American psyche. {[}SIGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, screw Jane Austen, we're going for Bob Kane. Bob Kane started it
  all.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Fully. Fully.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, is that not the house from ``Up?'' Isn't that the ``Up'' house?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's the house from ``Up!''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait. Who is this actress again? This is one of my favorite old scary
  ladies.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is --- {[}LAUGHS{]} Wait. Bite your tongue. This is Frances
  Conroy whose job it is now --- I mean, between this movie and a couple
  of other horror movies and ``Joker,'' she was Joaquin Phoenix's mother
  in ``Joker.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, that's right. That's right. That's where we last saw her.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But she's most famous for playing the mother on ``Six Feet Under.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is one of the great parts, the ``Six Feet Under'' mother. But
  she's just a cat lady in the movies. And I mean, literally, either
  like a sickly, crazy mom or a cat lady.

  I mean, I would love to hear Francis Conroy talk about this, because
  she's a great stage actress. She's very good on ``Six Feet Under.''
  And she's never had a part in any movie that's as good as what she had
  on that TV show.

  Oh, no. Oh, boy.

  How do you act this?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  How do you act this? Like, if you're Halle, how are you rehearsing
  this moment? Are you watching your cats do this?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uff, uff.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. I'm trying to be on board with everything that's happening in this
  movie, but can you riddle me this. Why is she turning into an actual
  cat? Like, no Batman in the history of Batman ever hung upside-down,
  right? I'm really trying to ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I believe Michael Keaton's Batman does sleep upside-down ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- to be fair. But he doesn't eat, like ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Flies.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Exactly. He can resist the urge to do other bat things.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I do recall Michelle Pfeiffer in ``Batman Returns,'' bending over and,
  like, having herself some milk. Eartha Kitt has to growl or something,
  you know. It's like, there is a small price to pay. But Halle Berry,
  the I.R.S. went after her on this one for the cat tax.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She's taking it to another level entirely.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is my favorite Halle Berry version.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh dang. Oh.

  She's like, I don't care.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. We just saw Halle Berry do a thing that I enjoy when Halle Berry
  does, which is kind of tell somebody off and assert herself. And until
  that point, like, we have been waiting for her to do something to, I
  don't know, kind of be the movie star we need her to be in a movie
  like this, and not this meek, passive, wet noodle of a person.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  But she still has so much less spice than when she does it in
  ``Boomerang.'' So, like, what is even going on here?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  We're coming up on a good minute to synchronize our watching just to
  make sure we're all on the same page. So let's get ready to check and
  see if that's true. You ready? We're going to be at 32 minutes and 45
  seconds in 3, 2, 1, now. And we'll do another one of those in about 20
  minutes.

  I'll just say at this point --- we've been watching this movie for a
  minute.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Despite the things that we're pointing out that aren't right about it,
  there is one thing that I want to bring to our attention. She is
  surrounded by non-white people. Halle Berry is just living in a city
  where there are just some white people, and the white people who are
  there are just --- are evil. Just planting that seed that Sharon Stone
  and Lambert Wilson are the bad guys, and everybody else, basically, is
  a peon who suffers because of them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Again, radical bones. Like, there are some interesting ideas in this
  superhero movie. It just feels like either they didn't know what they
  had or they didn't know what to do with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  By the way, I want to say that Halle is channeling Janet Jackson in
  this first part of the movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, for sure. For sure.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She just seems shy in the way that Janet could pretend to be shy, or
  actually just be shy. Janet never pretended to be shy.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, boy. I love movie basketball kids.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Definitely. It should be like a weird cliche and a trope but I just
  actually love it --- oh, wait. I spoke too soon, because now we're in
  a ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  What kind of music video is this? It's like, it turns into a Destiny's
  Child video.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Meanwhile, this is a Paula Abdul video.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And these camera angles, what is going on here?
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The editing and camera work here are just --- this is not Halle
  Berry's fault is what I'm saying.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That dancing was her fault. I mean ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, she did do some of this dancing. But I mean, she didn't edit
  and shoot this movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  No, she didn't. That's not her job.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And that's not her body either. {[}LAUGHS{]} She's not doing those
  stunts.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's weird how no one's reacting, though. Everyone's just like, yeah,
  get it. Mm-hm. Fly through the air. It's like, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Because it's Gotham, Jenna. This happens all the time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  True. The kids are used to seeing really weird things and just being
  like, it's all good.

  But wait, Wesley. What kinds of movies were out around the time this
  movie was out? Was it really outrageous that a movie like this got
  made in 2004, or were people just kind of like, you know?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, what do you mean by a movie like this? Like a superhero movie?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Everything we just saw ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Or just like a bad.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Those camera angles. Yeah. Like a really cheesy, campy --- oh, I love
  breakable glass. I love fake glass in movies.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. I mean, this would have been the summer of 2004. So
  we're talking like, ``Kill Bill Volume 2'' would have opened in April.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The best of the Harry Potter movies, Alfonso Cuaron's ``Prisoner of
  Azkaban'' ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- would have opened ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Damn.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- I think, like, earlier in June. ``Collateral'' would have come out
  a couple weeks after this movie with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the
  great Michael Mann movie. And this was --- I mean, just to give you a
  sense of what else was in the movies that whole year, 2004, if memory
  serves, is the year of ``Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- ``The Aviator,'' ``Million Dollar Baby'' is that year.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Dang, OK. So there were some high caliber pictures out. Like, the bar
  was set and it was a lot higher than an RC Cola commercial, which is
  what I feel like we just watched. So ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}

  To add insult to injury, Jenna, this is also the same summer as
  ``Spider-Man 2,'' which is the best of the Spider-Mans --- of all the
  Spider-Mans I would say. And one of the great action sequences, in
  that train sequence, of all time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh! Is that the one where Tobey Maguire single-handedly zooms down and
  stops the train --- the elevated train somewhere in Manhattan with one
  hand, and it's just like, the most epic sequence ever?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yes. Yes, that is it. And then he's like totally spent. And the
  passengers in the train car hoist him up like he's Jesus at the ---
  it's just like ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's the most I heart ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's beautiful.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- New York iconic scene ever. So good, so good.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.

  Oh, she's about to go off.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She's not having it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He looks like Gerard Butler.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Everybody in this movie, except for Halle and Sharon, is like a budget
  version of something else. They spent all the money on the visual
  effects. They couldn't afford casting anybody else.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, every ounce of this movie is a budget version of something
  else.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh gosh. I can't stop thinking about the fact that ``Kill Bill'' was
  out at the same time. I mean, what does it say that this is, like, her
  ultimate first act of bad-assery. She sprays soda water on a speaker.
  Meanwhile, Uma is learning to, like, drive a car with her tongue or
  whatever happens in that movie. It's just like ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Look ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- jeez Louise.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- I think this is the first time she whips somebody.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The fizzer is where she gets this idea to start whipping people.

  I think that there's something interesting about her becoming Catwoman
  and also becoming, like, black in a way.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know if you are feeling this the way I'm feeling it. But this
  is partially Halle Berry's performance strategy in general. And it
  definitely creates this imbalance, in this particular performance,
  where whenever she gets angry, she gets more interesting. And that's
  Halle Berry in a lot of things.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  When her back's up against the wall, when she's a cornered cat,
  basically, and she has to hiss at somebody, that is her best mode,
  anger. But having her go from mousy to catty ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- it's not much of an acting challenge, and from a character
  development standpoint, it's not that interesting under the
  circumstances.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I feel like this is how you know, though, that those movies were
  written by men. OK, hashtag not all men. But I do feel like only those
  men can really understand a woman stepping into her power and a woman
  becoming embodied and more powerful and aware of herself. They can
  only read that as, like, a turn for the bitchy, a turn for the mean, a
  turn for the cold, which is really unimaginative and boring, but it
  sounds very true to what Bob Kane imagined. So look at the material,
  honey. Look at the material.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Now, I do have a question. Like, what kind of cat is she, by the way?

  Like, she's both a feline cat, but also she's a dominatrix cat.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Now, I don't get it. Like, make up your minds, y'all. Now, there is in
  the DC universe, there is a dominatrix, prostitute ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- version of Catwoman.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes. But I would also argue that this is the only way they can imagine
  a very sexy woman. She has to be a hooker or a dominatrix. Like, it
  just can't be something that is just naturally imbued into a woman. So
  most of the women, at least in the DC comic book universe who make it
  into the movies, they're always deeply traumatized. They have really
  ugly histories of abuse. I'm thinking about Harley Quinn. I'm thinking
  about Poison Ivy, who was actually, low key, the coolest villain.
  Like, she's an eco-terrorist. You know, I really, actually, shout out
  to Uma Thurman who also played her. But they always have these
  deep-seated issues that never, really, are dealt with. They only
  manifest as them acting out or being pathologized as sort of the
  motivation for their criminal intent. Whereas Halle Berry's Catwoman,
  Patience, she's outside of all of that, and she has a very different
  origin story that doesn't place her as someone who was quote,
  ``insane.'' And the only other person, really, that comes to mind who
  had that same classification was Wonder Woman. But she's literally not
  from planet Earth. She's literally descended from a Greek god. So
  those are the dichotomies of women that make their way into these
  superhero movies.

  OK, wait, Wesley. Are there any women superheroes in either of the
  comic book universes who aren't just obsessed with, like, narcissism
  or petty crime. I mean, I know there's Captain Marvel. But I feel like
  this is, when I'm thinking of, like, Poison Ivy and Catwoman, they're
  all just, like, petty thiefs who use their powers just to, like, go
  shopping, essentially.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is a great ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- question. But it's funny that you mention this about the movies
  starring comic book characters. Because they don't really have a
  world-saving purpose. This is the appeal of Wonder Woman, right?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Wonder Woman is sort of aimed at a higher purpose. But my favorite ---
  one of my --- I mean, Storm is one of my favorite comic book
  characters. And as I've told you many times --- you already know this
  --- I think that there's a whole Storm X-Men arc where she loses her
  powers and is basically marooned in the comic book, essentially, with
  this character named Forge, whose ability ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- he's got this architectural mutant ability. Their love affair is
  so hot and steamy. Halle Berry is still old enough to play Storm.

  I would love to see that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I think this is the right thing to do. This is logical. It makes sense
  to me. We don't know her backstory. We don't know who her people are.
  She has no one she can trust. She's, like, I gotta look up diabolical
  cats because I feel like I'm a witch. I feel like I'm seeing some
  things.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But bad filmmaking is basically telling us what we already know. We
  already know what her problem is. And now it has replay ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I just don't like when movies reuse ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- the opening ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- the title sequence.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- title sequence?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Exactly. Yes, I'm there with you! That is a pet peeve. That is a movie
  pet peeve of mine. It is so lazy.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No pun intended, but it should be everybody's pet peeve.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. Now we're getting somewhere.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She's just I need some answers.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- found a clue. She found a clue.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'm going back back ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She's back at the ``Up'' house.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- to the ``Up'' house.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I love that actress, oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Frances Conroy. I'm telling you, man.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. Oh wait. Here we go. We're about to learn something.

  Right. She did die.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, and this movie killed you.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This movie killed more than your character.

  Yo, shout out to crazy cat ladies, though. They have a bad rap as an
  arch --- oh, my god, this sequence. They have a bad rap as an
  archetype, but they always be knowing.

  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh. What is this, downward cat?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. All right. All right. I'm going to say something controversial.
  I'm actually kind of really into the mystical element. I'm into the
  idea that she's part of this lineage of magical relationships between
  women and this Egyptian goddess, Bast. I actually kind of like that
  she gets her powers from cat breath. I like this. I like this better
  than the idea that they're just a petty thief, like Anne Hathaway's
  Catwoman or Eartha Kitt's Catwoman. I'm appreciating this.

  Oh, man, I'm so deep in corona that I'm like, it's the wrong kind of
  mask!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} But wait, can we just back up to talk about what Frances
  Conroy just said to Halle Berry? She said ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  No, what did she --- Yeah, I mean, tell me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Cat women are not controlled by the rules of society. You follow your
  own desires. This is both a blessing and a curse! You'll often be
  alone and misunderstood, but you'll experience a freedom other women
  have never known.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And how was that striking you?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  As a bunch of BS. But I hear the movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'm not saying that what she's saying isn't true, but the movie, it's
  not as though this is a story of Kelly Rowland finding her Michelle
  and Beyonce, right?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right, right, right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Again, speaking of which, more of that Beyonce knock-off.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This is your movie pet peeve, actually. Oh, my god, wait. Just take in
  this whole outfit.

  Now, I think this is still a fire look. I love this one the first time
  I saw it, and I love it even now.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So if you're Pitof at this point, how you use an Oscar winner is you
  turn her into a special effect, because that's what you do. You don't
  know how to direct actors. You know how to direct computer
  programming. So why not take a person and turn her into that?

  You know, it's funny, right after this movie comes out, maybe like the
  next year, is ``Aeon Flux'' with Charlize Theron, which was directed
  by Karyn Kusama ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- and it was another bomb. I believe ``Aeon Flux'' is a movie you
  like a lot, right?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes. I was obsessed with the movie when it came out. And I still watch
  it regularly. I know it's not good, but I still enjoy it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, between that movie and this one, I mean, thank god for Uma
  Thurman. But the second ``Kill Bill'' was pretty much it.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No more fighting for women at that point. We're done. That's not
  entirely true, but it just sort of lowered --- it dimmed the prospects
  for women being able to fight for a long time, for at least a few
  years in movies.

  That is a sexy bartender. Sexy bartender alert.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} Wesley's like, you know, I never thought I'd say this,
  but I'm excited to be in a bar again.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Ew, she just wants a glass of milk. Ew.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I mean, the messed up part about this, though, is that the theory is
  that she's going to be able to give in to her desires. But they're not
  her desires. They're these, like, ideas of what a cat wants. Tuna as
  much as you can eat out of a can, milk --- a glass of milk.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And you know, so.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, what is your favorite nightclub sequence in a movie, because
  there's so many bad ones, and this is definitely one of them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. This is one of the worst ones.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Who's going to the club to do any of this stuff?

  Now seems like a pretty good time for a fun fact.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah, hit me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You ready, Jenna? When ``Black Panther'' came out and Michelle Obama
  had tweeted how proud she was to have ``Black Panther,'' there was
  this, like, mini, tiny ripple of, like, well, where were all those
  people for ``Catwoman'' when that came out?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Excusé moi! I'm sorry. ``Catwoman'' does not have Winston Duke. It
  doesn't have Letitia Wright. It doesn't have Danai Gurira. I mean,
  should I keep going? It didn't have Ruth Carter at the helm with the
  costumes. I mean, come on.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Lupita?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Like, that's not a one-to-one. We're not dealing with apples to apples
  here, folks, at all.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So then one of the screenwriters of this, of ``Catwoman,'' this guy
  named John Rogers tweets, ``As one of the credited screenwriters of
  `Catwoman,' I believe I have the authority to say, because it was a
  shit movie dumped by the studio and had zero cultural relevance in
  front of or behind the camera.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It sounds defensive, and it sounds like he's embarrassed, and it
  sounds like --- it sounds like he's got some P.T.S.D. to work through,
  and I wish him all the best in resolving it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He does, because he complains in a different tweet that this kind of
  ruined his career and he barely worked after this movie came out.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  All I have to say is at least it wasn't just Halle. At least ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No, white men suffered, too.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  There you go. At least the blast radius was big enough. And I know
  that's unkind to say, but I often feel like usually the only people
  that suffer or pay the price for this kind of bomb are not the women
  or women of color. So at least, you know, it wasn't just her.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. Another time check. We're going to be at 57 minutes and 5 seconds
  in 3, 2, 1, now.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I feel like it's also appropriate to tell you that I have a little bit
  of wine next to me and I just took a sip. OK, I just want you to know
  that. Once the alpha came on, I took a little bit of a sip of my white
  wine. OK. So I was waiting for that part because I just needed to feel
  --- you know?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I knew I was going to get excited. OK. So in preparation for our
  watch-along, I was like, what do I need to know about Halle Berry? And
  then I was like, what happened with Halle Berry and Eric Benét again?
  So that was where my research took me. Nothing useful about her film
  career. I just was like, what happened in that relationship? And I
  found this interview with her and Oprah, and she was saying that right
  after she got the Oscar is when she found out that Eric was having all
  those affairs. And so she went into triage. She couldn't even
  celebrate having the Oscar. She went into triage on her relationship.
  And it wasn't just one woman. He was having affairs the whole time
  they were together. So I don't know. Maybe she felt like she wanted to
  show him what he was missing. I mean, you're Halle Berry and it's all
  over the news that your man is cheating on you. That's a real kick to
  the ego. So maybe she was like, Listen up, one word French director, I
  know I have an Oscar. I don't care. I want to make this movie, and I
  want to be in the sexiest costume your budget can handle. And he was
  like, Oui, oui. OK. I mean ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I hear that. OK. {[}LAUGHS{]} I hear that. Uh-oh. Advice. Advice, here
  we go.

  You can say her hair --- (SINGING) can buy her hair, but it won't
  grow. You can fix your nose if he says so. You can buy all the makeup
  that Mac can make.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  (SINGING) But if ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You got to fill out your ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Who is that?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Beau-Line It'll turn you un-pretty.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, look. He solved the case just like that. He's like ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No, no. No, Jenna. No, Jenna. No, he didn't, actually.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  They're like, it's not enough that we show you she's changed. It's not
  enough that we ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- tell you she was brought back to life. We're going to analyze her
  handwriting so that you know, in fact, there was a before and there is
  an after.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. City Side Community Center, by the way, which is just like
  movie talk for black and Latino.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's just so weird what the close-ups are of. Do you know what I mean?
  Like, did we need a close-up of the bullseye and the bottles?

  Look at this. Look at this, Jenna. This is just some straight-up inner
  city sadness.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Looks like New York, though. I mean --- it looks like the kind of
  Ferris wheel you would never get on if you valued your life, you know.
  Like you would just, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You would not ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Look at this. It's in a parking lot.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. Oh, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  My question is what is he going to do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I know, right?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} It is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I mean, even her moves
  at that --- I mean, remember when she robbed --- when she beat up the
  burglars at the jewelry store?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Uh-huh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  All those moves were Spider-Man moves.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, yeah. That's true. That's true.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. That poor actor.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I still think this looks cool. I'm just going to be honest. I think
  this looks cool.

  Oh, right. He escaped, so he actually didn't see her do all that, so
  her powers are still secret.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's right.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. I mean, the purpose of the scene is just to let us know that
  she's not just obsessed with petty crime. That there is kind of some
  sort of moral compass inside of her that does orient her towards doing
  good, even though she still wants to steal shiny jewels. Which I guess
  cats like, too. That was in the movie ``Cats.'' Cats like rings, so
  you know, can't help them.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Can't blame them.

  Do you remember how obsessed black women were with the Halle Berry
  haircut? It was like our Rachel. Like, that haircut ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- you know ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- my sister had it. I didn't have the right texture for it so I
  couldn't have it. But to have that, like, really short, feathered,
  pressed in the front, and like, windswept in the back. That was such a
  thing.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Mary J., T-Boz.

  By the way, for anybody who's been wondering where Sharon Stone's been
  the whole time, she's been golfing.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  In a really gorgeous set of TLC satin pajamas.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, yes, Jenna! It's T-Boz's crepe pajamas! It's worth pointing out
  that we've been spending all this time in a movie whose villain is
  ostensibly a beauty product and the people who make the beauty
  product.

  How many days do you think it took them to get this scene right in
  rehearsal?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Not enough, if you ask me. I mean, I would spend the whole time on
  this scene.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I mean, this is the most exciting thing that's happened in this movie.

  Oh, wait. Is she going to recruit Sharon Stone in her take-down
  mission?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Let's see.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, this is so Batman, though.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't trust her.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, oh, oh. What? Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Meanwhile, this show is called Hydropolis.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  But this is the most Batman thing about this movie, though. There's
  always ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- like a showdown at some big gala in the middle of Gotham. Whether
  it's Uma Thurman, again, as Poison Ivy or whatever, there's always a
  moment.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. This is very, like, Tim Burton --- this is like Joel Schumacher
  Batman ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- quality.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Is it racist they gave her acrylics? I don't know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  They gave her diamond acrylics. Hmm. I'm OK with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my lord. Oh, my lord.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh my god Cirque du Soleil!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. This scene is just --- this is like one of my number one
  complaints about the movies. You know you're watching a lazy-ass movie
  when there are people fighting on some sort of light bridge, or like
  in the rafters of someplace. I know movies think this is exciting
  because it's probably tough to choreograph, but boy, is it lazy. I
  mean, if you're up there, I know it's supposed to show off what the
  choreographer can do, but you know what the hell is going to happen.
  Somebody's going to fall off the rafters. Or they're going to get so
  shaky that somebody's going to drop a weapon and then they'll have to
  have hand-to-hand combat.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's just so lame. It's so lame.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You're saying it's predictable and that's what bores you.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. I'm not impressed by this. That don't impress me much.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's fair.

  Well, Wesley, I see your pet peeve and I raise you one, which is how
  do these people not know that the person that they're fighting is
  their lover or their neighbor or their best friend? I mean, these
  costumes are not that concealing.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know what I mean? I'm just like, come on, y'all. Superman, Clark
  Kent, like, side by side for real. Spider-Man, OK, I get it. He's
  fully covered. But also it's clearly Halle Berry. It's clearly your
  boo Ben. Get it together.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. I mean, at least with Lois Lane, I could get it because Margot
  Kidder was just on some other stuff with Christopher Reeve Superman.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Sure. OK, sure. Yeah, glasses really conceal a lot. Yeah, no, I get
  it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I also think that Margot Kidder's Lois Lane was into having two
  lovers, right? She was into ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- into having this dual relationship. She didn't need to tell us
  that that was what was on her mind, but I think she kind of knew.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Well, that I'm on board for. That is fine.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But I don't know. Benjamin Bratt, I think he just might not be smart
  in this movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  These spotlights are getting an awful lot of close-ups, by the way.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I'm just blocking out all the close-ups.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Can cats see in the dark?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I think so. I mean, they're definitely nocturnal. They like to do
  things at night.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I do think if anybody did their research on anything, it was probably
  what things do cats do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's the only thing this thing gets right.

  Again ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wow.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- why is Sharon Stone getting the best clothes in the movie?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That was in her contract, a hundred percent.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She was like, I don't care what Halle wears, but I will be in Versace
  knockoffs.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I think if it's Sharon Stone, though, the budget might have gone to
  Versace.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know. I know. All the budget went to Versace and that leather top
  that Halle's wearing. I'm fine with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh. She's the terminator.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  What just happened there? Did I miss something? Is her face really
  hard?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Beau-Line she's like, she's Beau-Line'd out. (SINGING)
  Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line. Please don't make me hit
  you one more time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wow.

  Gosh, I have such a hard time when Alex Bornstein talks because I just
  see the mom from ``Family Guy.'' It's ridiculous.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Because she does voice that character.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, boy.

  Halle, we need you to act like a cat looking at fish who just wants to
  get in the tank.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Can you do that?

  And now we need to really --- we need you to really enjoy this sushi.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm uncomfortable.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Exactly. So am I.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I guess she hasn't eaten the whole movie from the time we saw the tuna
  until now, so she is pretty hungry.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's weird that, like, the assumption is cats have no control of their
  impulses. Have you ever been around a cat? They are the most studious
  creatures.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But that's --- she's going to age into Frances Conroy is what's going
  to happen.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. That's her future. Got it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's her future. That's my guess.

  Jenna, I don't know what your temperature is right now. My blood
  pressure just is plummeting. So this seems like a pretty good time to
  talk about how Halle Berry's best parts have come from either Oprah
  Winfrey or cable television.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oprah got her to play Janie in her TV version of ``Their Eyes Were
  Watching God,'' Zora Neale Hurston's novel.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm going to revisit that. That's a good homework for me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She's good in it. And then she played Dorothy Dandridge for HBO.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know. My favorite TV movie.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I loved that movie.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I did not know that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I thought it was so good. She's so good in it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, she needs to channel some Dorothy Dandridge up in here.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But I feel like if you let her play a part that has a beginning and a
  middle and an end, someplace for her to go and to act, you know, those
  are things that basically any actor needs, by the way --- a beginning
  and a middle and an end. Something to aspire to play. But she can do
  so much if you give her something that amuses her. Do you think
  there's enough in this movie for her to sink her claws into?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} No. I mean, there's no emotion. There's not really a ton
  of drive. I mean, she needs a backstory. I mean, that's what made her
  so good in Dorothy Dandridge. You understood that woman's plight. You
  understood her tension. You understood her ambitions. I mean, give us
  some of that. Oh, my gosh, wait. Look at her freaking out because of
  the rain.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's what we want. We want Dorothy Dandridge, Catwoman. I would love
  to see that.

  Now we're in a Janet Jackson video.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} So true.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And that's all we get.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's all we get?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This seems like another good time to synchronize those clocks. We're
  going to be at 1 hour, 15 minutes and 55 seconds in 3, 2, 1, now.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait. Was that a video phone call? Or what was that?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know, is this a good time to mention the Beyonce and Gaga video,
  video phone, that literally starts like that? I mean ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yes.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I don't know. I think this movie was a lot more influential than
  people give credit for.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I just feel like, Halle Berry's character now has all --- you know,
  she's got a lot of wisdom, right? She understands she's got these cat
  powers. She's not doing anything with them. Why didn't the movie at
  least let her --- yeah. Like, Spider-Man gets to have fun. Usually the
  superheroes get to have fun. There's always a sequence of them, like,
  running around town, playing with their powers. I guess she rode a
  motorcycle through town, but she didn't need to be bitten by a cat to
  do that.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  By the way, she didn't do anything. That was also half stunt double
  ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- half C.G.I. So ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. This scene right here is exactly why I have been complaining for a
  lot of this movie about the problem of having Sharon Stone and Halle
  Berry in ``Catwoman'' at the same time. Because on the one hand, I
  love Halle Berry, and on the other hand, I love Sharon Stone. It isn't
  that I can't love both those people at the same time. But every time
  Sharon Stone's in the movie, she takes the oxygen away from anybody
  else in the scene.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Especially Halle.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And especially Halle Berry who has the disadvantage of looking
  ridiculous in this sexy costume in a room with Sharon Stone. I don't
  know if that makes sense. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'll bet you anything, Sharon Stone had her own writers or something.
  Like ---
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Sharon was like, I see your Oscar and I'll raise you {[}LAUGHS{]} ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- this scene.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  There is something kind of costumy about what Halle Berry is asked to
  do here, and there's nothing costumy about what Sharon Stone is doing.
  She's just playing your classic mean villain. It's just Sharon Stone
  knows how to be in a movie, and she knows how to steal a scene from
  people who are vulnerable to having a scene stolen from them.
  {[}LAUGHS{]} And I think Halle Berry is so concentrating on one side
  of things that she doesn't even notice the sneak attack that Sharon
  Stone is waging.

  I love in movies where, like, characters have to find out what's going
  on in their lives by looking up at a giant monitor in public.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} And then hurry away and hope no one noticed that was them
  onscreen.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And hope nobody notices.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} Which is also how you know all these movies take place in
  a fictitious New York, because in a real New York, everyone would be
  like, That's you, bro. Like, That's you!

  Oh, that's her losing Isaiah in ``Monster's Ball'' voice.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  See, the thing about Halle Berry to me is in a lot of Halle Berry
  performances, there are these moments where you just get a sense of
  what she could be doing.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She's worked with not that many great directors.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm, interesting.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I have really been --- like take something like ``Jungle Fever'' for
  instance.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She had a small part in that movie, but she's really good in it.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Even ``Monster's Ball,'' which we can talk about.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Well, we don't have to. I mean, I've always been curious about your
  response to it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She had a good director. I mean, I don't love that guy, but he's good
  at directing actors, I'll say that. And I mean, she's evidently very
  good in that, right? But those parts are very hard to come by, and
  she's fighting, at this point in her career, who's she fighting for
  parts? She's fighting Charlize Theron. She's fighting Nicole Kidman,
  Angelina Jolie. She's up against ---

  I would love to hear Halle Berry talk about the parts she didn't get
  during this period after she wins the Oscar. But I'm sure it's lots of
  juicy things, or maybe she wasn't even considered for them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I wonder. Yeah, I wonder.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, she can do lots of things. I just don't think this movie
  really shows any of that off.

  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. {[}LAUGHS{]} That was like, actually, like the perfect timing to
  illustrate your point. They just, you know. But are any superhero
  movies really well acted? Like, I'm just scanning my mind. I mean,
  it's hard. It's hard.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, some of them have their moments. I think that everybody in the
  first two Spider-Man movies is fantastic. I think that McKellen and
  Stewart in the X-Men movies ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah, I agree.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Hugh Jackman in ``Wolverine.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, ``Wolverine'' is so good.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know, like Heath Ledger ais Joker. I mean, these movies do have
  room for good performances.

  Best line in the movie right there. ``Lassie would have brought me the
  key.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's also ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's a screenwriter right there.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- the rudest, though. But that's the rudest. I'm sorry. That cat
  brought you back to life. That cat is done working for you, honey.
  Like, come on. Oh, is she just really going to --- we're just going to
  pretend that she can fit through this --- oh, OK. All right. I guess
  we're still in an X-Men movie where people's bodies rearrange, the
  molecules change. All right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Is she Mystique or Catwoman?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right. Right. They don't know. Honey, they don't know.

  I mean, it would be a much more interesting movie if we saw what a
  person, or especially this woman, did with all that newfound power.
  But she's like, No, I'm going to use every ounce of energy I have to
  take down this huge multinational corporation. I mean, good on you,
  but like, also is that what you want to be doing?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh. Pull up to my bumper, baby.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} That's very J. Lo.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Now again, like what was the point of her fondling --- oh, because
  it's a cat. It's a cat! It's a cat.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's a cat and she wants the car. She takes what she wants.

  I love how Sharon Stone was inspired by Catwoman. She was like, I can
  murder, too. Like, I'll do what I want, too. Sharon Stone's like, I
  didn't need to die first. I didn't need to get bit by a cat. I will
  take control of my own destiny and not be obsessed with milk and tuna.

  You know, Wesley, you're right. I see what you're saying. Sharon
  Stone, she really just knows how to be in a movie.

  I feel like that's a challenge, though, for women like Halle. It's
  like, she's not sure which part of herself to play up. Is she playing
  up her physicality? Is she playing up her beauty? Is she playing up
  her steeliness? Like, I think she has always struck me as an actor who
  is so conscious of how she's going to be perceived as a black woman,
  and how the different gazes will be falling on her, that she doesn't
  really play to any of the aspects of herself. She kind of just lets
  herself get played. And you can really feel it here in contrast to
  someone like Sharon Stone who knows exactly what angle she's working,
  exactly what she's trying to do on screen. And that's a luxury. I
  mean, that's a privilege that she has. But she gets to kind of be as
  --- take up as much space as she wants. And I don't know that Halle's
  ever really felt that in any of her roles.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I will also say, Sharon Stone, it took her a long time to even get to
  that moment ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I was going to say, yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- in ``Catwoman``, if you know what I mean.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. I was realizing that in real time.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know, this is a seasoned movie star, basically, with all of this
  experience. This is the thing about older actors, right? About
  especially women. Like, you spend your whole career building up some
  knowledge, and some vocabulary, and some natural way of presenting
  yourself in front of a camera.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And the minute you figure that out, you get thrown over the side of
  the boat. And turned into, like, Meow Mix.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Chum. You're chum.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know. Here is a woman who's just got more experience and more
  charisma than a movie like this even needs. And Halle Berry just kind
  of is the unwitting victim of it.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She gets very declawed around Sharon Stone, like defanged and
  declawed. Like, all the bad-assery just goes out the window when she's
  next to Sharon Stone.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, the thing that's exasperating about this, when you look at
  what is happening with the Sharon Stone character versus what's
  happening with the Halle Berry character, is all of the writing is
  there for Sharon Stone. And Halle Berry, Patience has no real ---
  she's got a personality, but it's a very generic personality. She's
  just good. She's a good person having a naughty moment. But every time
  Sharon Stone's on screen, I just want to be with her.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And that isn't about Halle Berry per se, but it is about Halle Berry
  in this movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Which is that every time Sharon Stone shows up, I want to know
  whatever's going on in that woman's psyche.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Catwoman has no psyche. She's got all these, like, personality traits
  that correspond with a house animal.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know. She was a do-gooder, and then doing good got her into trouble,
  and she got a second chance, and this is what she's doing with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Do you think the lighting is the real lighting, or do you think
  everybody got touched up? Because ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I'm like ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The only person who doesn't look touched up is Benjamin Bratt. But
  Sharon Stone's face looks ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Fluorescent.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- extra creamy.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah, they're all glowing. Yeah. Yeah.

  Like the insistence there's a right way to do this. Or right way to
  --- oh, whoa. But she didn't, though, did she? Did I miss something?
  It wasn't Sharon Stone.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna let me ask you a question right now.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Let's just say that you just killed your husband ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm there, keep going.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- this woman is just on your tail, and she's dressed like a
  dominatrix from an En Vogue video.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You're describing, literally, my dreams. Go on.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Do you have time right now to really talk about your motivations for
  why you've become evil?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I do.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  A hundred percent I do.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes. Yes, because that's part of the seduction. This is what's --- I'm
  like, let's talk.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Let me see if I can get you on my side. Yes. I'm like, Halle Berry,
  come join me, boo. Like, we can rule this kingdom together.

  Now, that's an act --- like a very interesting super villain
  backstory. That's fantastic.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, exactly. Exactly!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah.

  It's always so disappointing in these superhero movies, though, when
  the women superheroes can't actually do anything. Like they always get
  bested. Do you know what I mean?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And you're just like what's the point of all those powers? What's the
  point of all that painful transformation, giving up your old life,
  when it barely comes down --- barely gets you anything in a one-to-one
  fist fight.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know what I hate, I hate generic action setting finale. I hate
  warehouse showdown.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Like, I know we're supposed to be in an office building, but this
  looks no different to me than like ye old dockyard shootout.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}

  That is a bad line.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That is a bad line.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Abs of steel. She was like, I'll be fine. Yeah, where was that whip
  hiding? Where was that whip hiding the whole time?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Also, from a physics standpoint, her being able to fling that thing
  around like that makes no sense.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I agree.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She'd be hitting the ceilings and the walls and the pillar. It just
  ---

  Oh, my god. Oh, Sharon. No! No!

  No, Sharon!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Sharon's like, I would rather die than live with this face.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, that fall! {[}LAUGHS{]} Jenna, have you ever seen a fall like that
  before in your life?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I have not. This movie ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The flipping in the air. It was like a real person! Oh, my god!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Where has he been this whole time?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He's useless.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  He's useless.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Funny, he got up to her apartment in, like, two seconds to save her
  the first time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And now it takes him 20 minutes to get up there to help her fight
  Sharon Stone.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, he's just going to pin them all on her?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. There is a tragedy right there.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Tragedy.

  One of our least fulfilled movie stars just in a pile of glass on a
  logo. Oh, her dreams came true.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait. I missed this whole thing. All right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He works at the hospital. I think he's a doctor.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And they got together, I guess.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  They got together.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know, part of the reason we picked this movie is because we were
  kind of starting our own silent hashtag campaign, justice for Halle,
  because we didn't feel like she'd ever been properly served by
  Hollywood, or ever had an opportunity to properly stretch her wings,
  right? I think that Halle's struggle represents a bigger struggle
  within Hollywood, in any industry where you have to figure out how to
  present yourself, or they'll figure it out for you, and they'll fail,
  right? Like Halle, they couldn't figure out if Halle should be the sex
  symbol, or is she a serious actor, is she an action figure. I mean,
  she just let them make her into whatever the picture needed. I mean,
  the real coup would be for Halle to come back, know exactly --- like
  pull a Reese Witherspoon and start producing and making the movies she
  wants to be in and being a part of it. But honestly, I kind of feel
  like she's playing the role that she wants to play, which is if you go
  to her Instagram, she's just hanging out with her kids, easing into
  her 50s, nothing left to prove. I mean, I wonder if she still thinks
  about cat person. I'm going to say cat person in this movie instead of
  Catwoman. But I wonder if she still thinks about this movie.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {[}music{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm Jenna Wortham.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'm Wesley Morris. We're two culture writers at The New York Times,
  and we've got an experiment.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And this is ``Still Processing.''

  Get ready for a Still Processing watch-along.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It really is an experiment. We're gonna ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You and I are going to watch a movie together, and you guys who are
  listening to us are going to watch the movie with us.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This week is very much about being in your living room, or your
  bedroom, or even your bathtub. Look, it's up to you.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So Miss Wortham, what are we watching?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. So there's so many things we wanted to talk about, but ultimately,
  we were like, let's pick something that's definitely fun and funny,
  nothing bloody, nothing violent. There's just way too much of that
  stress in the world right now. So, you know, something that's
  incredibly low stakes, but also deeply, visually pleasurable. So
  Wesley ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- who is the only celebrity that both you and I follow on Instagram
  right now?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, it's Halle Berry.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's Halle Berry. You know, so this is really a Halle Berry
  appreciation week, and we went through deep in her archives, and what
  did we pull out?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  ``Catwoman.'' It came out in 2004. The Halle Berry, the Sharon Stone.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Also, the looks, that leather outfit, their whips, rhinestone-studded
  acrylics. I mean, listen, there is a lot to get into here. Find a cozy
  place, get your favorite snacks.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's you, and Jenna, and me, and Halle Berry all on your sofa in your
  bed, wherever you're watching this, and it's going to get real
  intimate and real deep. Real deep. And I gotta say, this thing is
  going to be, you know, about two hours. Of all the things we've done
  on this show, this might actually be the blackest podcast thing you
  and I have ever done, Jenna Wortham, spending two hours talking.
  They're going to fly. The fur is going to fly. The minutes are going
  to fly. You won't even know the time has past. You're gonna look up
  and be like, wait, this is over?

  All right. One second and we'll be back with Pitof's ``Catwoman.''
\item
  {[}music{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  So here's how this is going to work. ``Catwoman,'' believe it or not,
  is on a ton of streaming services for the relatively low price of
  \$1.99. So it's on Amazon, YouTube, and iTunes, and a few other
  places. So the first thing you're going to do is rent it. The next
  thing you're going to do is queue it up on your TV or your laptop. It
  makes the most sense if you keep your phone handy with the podcast
  cued up and ready there. If you try to do both on the same device, it
  might be really challenging.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Once you've rented it, hit play, and then pause. Make sure that you're
  set to zero minutes and zero seconds. And then we'll tell you when to
  hit play so that we're all watching the same thing at the same time.
  And don't worry, if you have to pause or you think you're off, we'll
  be announcing the time code every once in a while so you can get back
  in sync with us. So hit pause on us, on the show, go get ``Catwoman,''
  and then start us back up and we'll all watch this thing together.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK? Everybody ready? Everybody good? Got your snacks? You got your
  drinks? You ready to do this? It's going to be amazing! So let's all
  get ready for the 2004 --- I can't believe I'm saying this --- super
  hero spectacular ``Catwoman.''
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is going to be so good!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK, on my count, we're going to hit play. 3, 2, 1, hit play! Wes, you
  rolling? I'm rolling. I'm seeing the Warner Brothers logo, the weird
  wavy undulations.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I can hear it in my headphones. I'm so excited.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Your excitement is exciting me, I have to be honest.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} OK, y'all, we're going back to 2004 when Halle Berry was
  essentially kind of still on top of the world. She had just won an
  Academy Award for her performance in ``Monster's Ball,'' becoming the
  reigning only black Best Actress winner in the history of American
  movies.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Still to this day.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Reigning champ. Reigning champ. Octavia can't defeat her. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Viola.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Viola can't defeat her. Angela Bassett. Nope, can't defeat Halle
  Berry. So she's looking for something to do. She was just in the big
  James Bond movie, ``Die Another Day.'' She played Jinx.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's right. That's right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Famously arose from the ocean in the most delightful tangerine bathing
  suit. And you know, what are you going to do when you're on top of the
  world and you have, the world is your oyster? You'll want to make a
  statement, so what do you do? You're going to do ``Catwoman.'' You're
  going to break another barrier and become the first woman, in a long
  time, to star in your own superhero movie based on a comic book. And
  you're going to be the first black woman to ever do that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. That helps. That helps me understand the why for Halle. But can
  you help me understand the why it looks like this so far? Like, who is
  responsible for this?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, well, nobody can blame Halle Berry for how bad this movie looks.
  That would be ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jean-Christophe Comar, a.k.a. Pitof --- P-I-T-O-F, the man credited
  with directing ``Catwoman.'' He's a visual effects supervisor.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And, you know, he did ``The City of Lost Children,'' he did one of
  your jams, ``Alien Resurrection.'' And he has been given the reins to
  Halle Berry's make or break box office opportunity here. And I'm
  saying make or break because she is a woman and a black woman, and if
  this thing does not hit, her stuff might hit the rocks, and who knows
  what will happen if this movie bombs. We should be watching this movie
  thinking, is this what you do with your Oscar winner?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Is this ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- what you do with a woman at the peak of her career?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Is this it? Is this really it?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. This is the million dollar question. You have all that talent,
  all that charisma, iconic hair, incredible physique, and this is what
  you do with it. Hm. Curious.

  It actually looks a lot like it belongs on the Beyonce album, though,
  like that imagery. Very familiar.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, you're --- this is ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Very familiar.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You're going to be saying that a lot during this movie, I suspect.

  What's also, like what is remarkable --- what is unremarkable about
  Halle Berry? Like, we're supposed to believe she's this shlubby,
  klutzy, average woman?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's kind of her character from ``Boomerang'' though.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yes, it's true. It's true.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's not that far from it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  For all you ``Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'' watchers out there, that is Alex
  Borstein.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Whoa, how old is Halle Berry here?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  37 when the movie opens, and 32 when it ends.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. We're just going to stop talking right here because you're going
  to get some really important villain exposition right here. So zip it,
  us.

  So in another movie, that's what this would have been about, right?
  Old Sharon Stone being replaced by a younger model, and she turns into
  Catwoman and goes on a crime spree.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I would watch that movie, too, though.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, I mean, it just doesn't make --- this, it doesn't make any sense
  why --- one of these women is extra. {[}LAUGHS{]} We don't need Sharon
  Stone and Halle Berry in a Catwoman movie. We only need one.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  No, we need two. There could be more women. Why isn't Angelina Jolie
  in this? Put May --- like, put more people in this.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Were you going to say Maya Rudolph? Were you going to say put Maya
  Rudolph?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I stopped myself. I did. I stopped myself. {[}LAUGHS{]} I stopped
  myself. I stopped myself. But J. Lo could have been in this, too.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  What is about to happen right now --- this is an Anne Hathaway moment.

  Jenna, can you talk about this outfit?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's really setting us up for the reveal of the body-yody-yody in the
  costume, because we can't see what's going on underneath ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's a great point.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- all those rags. It's really setting it up ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's a good point.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- for the makeover scene. But it's hilarious. I mean, can you
  imagine, in any year, in any time, like, going to work dressed like
  that at an ad agency? I just don't understand.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I don't understand.

  I miss Sharon Stone. This makes nostalgic for her.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  We all do.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Dang. She must be in New York City. That's the truest thing about this
  movie.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, she's not in Gotham. She's not in Gotham, because at this point,
  that man would have long been here.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}.

  Wow.

  She's so mousy.

  It's so interesting, though, how the movies always equate, like ---
  oh, wait. I got distracted. The cat --- the first cat!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. Wait, what were you going to say?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Well, it's just funny how the movies equate, like, a shlumpiness with,
  like, you know, like an unattractiveness? Like we're supposed to
  believe that she's a good person in this iteration of self because she
  doesn't care about clothes, and she's beautiful but doesn't know it.
  She doesn't know how to raise her voice, you know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  My god, that apartment.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But again --- again, where in Gotham is this?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. Let me enjoy the fantasy. It doesn't matter. I just want
  to pretend I could live there, too.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But I mean, like, I don't know what Gotham rents are, but I don't ---
  you know.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait, Wesley. This cat is sentient. It's not a regular cat, right?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This is the cat that came on the boat from Egypt.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Miss Wortham, just fasten your seat belt. Patience look out for all
  that bird poop! Bird poop, Halle. Bird poop.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, don't step on the AC! That's every New Yorker's worst
  nightmare. No! Oh, my gosh. I thought --- oh, my god. I was promised
  this movie would be enjoyable and not stressful.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, who is that? Remind me his name.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Benjamin Bratt. That's the Bratt right there.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  He's so hot. Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is the nicest thing a cop's ever done for a black woman since
  ``Crash.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Actually, this is before ``Crash.'' This is the nicest thing a black
  woman's ever done before ``Crash.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wow.

  He's really jumping to a lot of conclusions. You know, it's like ---

  what?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK, first of all ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Is he supposed to be Batman?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  How the hell did he get up to the fourth floor ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That fast.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- of this building.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And into the apartment, by the way, did she just leave the door open?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  We're not supposed to ask questions. We're just supposed to marvel at
  the miracle and the budding sexual chemistry between the two of them.

  What time of day is it, late for her job? What the hell?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I don't understand! It is late afternoon, madam. We are --- what did
  she drop? Oh, my god. Oh, wait. He's going to get it. All right, cute.
  Cute. OK. This movie is full of deeply attractive people. I am more
  onboard than I thought I was going to be.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. I mean, Benjamin Bratt is one of those people who's so handsome,
  like, you don't even know where to start speaking about how handsome
  he is.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. It doesn't --- like, I'm flabbergasted ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, check this out.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- when I look at him. Oh, here's Sharon Stone again walking through
  this lobby looking like a whole ass snack. OK. OK. I --- my only frame
  of reference for Sharon Stone is, I guess, most people's frame of
  reference for Sharon Stone, which is ``Basic Instinct.'' But there's
  so much more than that. Like, where is she at at this moment in time,
  Wesley? Can you help me --- give me some context for her?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, I mean, you know, she was the face of American movies for about
  the first half of the 1990s. She essentially had one of the great five
  to six year runs of a lot of stars. Like unlikely, given how long she
  worked to get to the point where she was in ``Basic Instinct.'' She
  made ``Casino'' for Martin Scorsese in 1995.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's right. Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Gets an Academy Award nomination. And she didn't even win and it was
  all downhill for her after that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hey.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And at this point, here she is 10 years after that ``Casino''
  nomination, more or less, starring in a movie about being a washed-up
  beauty spokesmodel being replaced ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- by some unlikely brunette that her husband is sleeping with.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, Wesley. Can you imagine Ryan Murphy's take, like a
  satirical take on the challenges of an aging Hollywood star who's been
  wronged by her industry and turning it into primetime TV gold with the
  drama of his other properties, like ``Pose'' or ``The Politician.''
  Ugh, chef's kiss --- like we need it.

  I love that this is what the movies think that office life is like.
  Just, like, hanging out in each other's cubicles. I mean, they're not
  wrong, but it just tickles me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And now, Jenna, some ``Catwoman'' facts.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK, yeah. Because I'm riveted. I'm like, how much did this make in the
  box office? Like --- I --- yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, it made a grand total of \$82 million, and cost, apparently,
  \$100 million to make.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, yikes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And they originally --- I mean, it went through all of these different
  iterations of wanting different people to play Catwoman. Ashley Judd
  was mentioned at some point and didn't do it. And eventually it just
  went to Halle Berry. It was made very quickly, by the way, because of
  all kinds of production problems, like getting it going.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So I don't know how many --- I don't know how much prep time Halle
  Berry even had to play the part.

  Oh, I hate --- I love this effect. Remember, the director of this
  movie is a visual effects person. So he's really bored out of his mind
  and needs something to do, and it's not direct Halle Berry.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. He's like, no ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So let's make all the people disappear.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- I want the time to be bouncing around. Yeah. And on the left,
  there's a screen saver.

  Honey, why didn't they film New York. What is going on right now?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Like why ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Because you're working with a visual effects person. All he wants to
  do is, like, pee on the fire hydrant of this script.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. It's very ``Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.'' You
  know, it's like in another time, he would have had a lot of fun with
  that script. He's way ahead of his time.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup. Meanwhile, when you were asking before if this is what office
  life is like, the answer is yes. Because anytime I come down to your
  desk and want to hang out, the punishment is I gotta stay at work till
  9:00 at night.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}

  This is the corkscrew. This is what turns the crank. This becomes her
  --- the driving engine, right, of Catwoman.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know how, like, in real life those guys are probably really
  handsome, but in the movies they look generic? They just look like
  generic bad guys?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. They put weird matte powder on their faces to make them less
  attractive. It's like, if you splash them with warm water, you'd be
  like, damn.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know, on the one hand it is kind of cool that Halle Berry is
  joining this lineage of catwomen. Now, the movie is making it seem
  like there is a lineage of actual cat women, but OK, the movie can do
  that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But on the other hand, she is joining this long family of other
  catwomen. It's like, Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar on the TV show. And
  Michelle Pfeiffer perhaps most famously. And then there's Anne
  Hathaway in the third Christopher Nolan batman movie, Batman ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  ``The Dark Knight Rises.''
\item
  wesley morris\\
  ``The Dark Knight Rises.'' Thank you very much. On the other hand,
  Halle Berry is playing a Catwoman who has nothing to do with the DC
  universe. I don't know where this woman is from. I don't know what ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know what town this is. Like, we're calling it Gotham, but
  we're being real nice. Because, first of all, every other Catwoman, as
  far as I know, was named Selina Kyle. And they were all basically
  thieves and cat burglars. And they didn't really have super powers.
  They just --- like, it was a comic book. They just --- they weren't
  bad, they were just drawn that way, if you know what I'm saying.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  They were thieves who happened to have real agility and wall climbing
  prowess and that sort of stuff. And Batman was really into them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. Yes, she does fall in chemicals, OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No! Halle, no, no!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  There we go. Is this how she becomes ``Catwoman?'' Is this the origin
  story? Does the cat have to fall in there with her, too? I mean.

  This is the only kind of suspense I like these days.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's not Spider-Man. It's not Spider-Man or Spider Woman for that
  matter. Although, this might be up for debate when the action starts.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  But I feel like it's a combination of Venom, and Mr. Manhattan, and
  like, I don't know. Like it's all of these things wrapped up in one.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He happened to be standing right next to the box, by the way.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god. He's like a black woman in New York City? Nobody'll miss
  her. It's fine.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Just turn on the pipes.

  Well, honey, what underground labyrinth is this? Where ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know. But you know what the truth is, Jenna, this is where
  they dump all the chemicals into the river. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's not a water valve.

  That duct is for dumping the chemicals into whatever Gotham's river
  is.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's the villain bath.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wesley, doesn't this part kind of remind you of ``Lemonade'' a little
  bit, Beyonce's visual album? It looks very ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh-huh. Huh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. It looks so similar. Do you think this was on Beyonce's mood
  board for --- oh, my god, a cat! I mean, it's entirely possible. Both
  characters, they are in this womb space. They are in this watery
  tunnel. They are going through this period of deep incubation,
  gestation. Halle Berry, just like Beyonce, journeying through an
  underworld. Dealing with Pluto. Dealing with Hades. I mean, very
  culty, very witchy. Look, I hope the link's there. I approve. Into it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh-huh. Huh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's brilliant, Wes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So I do have some questions here. What are the real cats and what are
  the digital cats? And how long did Halle have to lay there until they
  all do what they were supposed to do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know what I was just thinking though? This is the real ``Cats,''
  and it's better than ``Cats,'' you know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} It's better than ``Cats.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  These are the jellicles. Is that what they're called, I forgot? This
  is the jellicle cats.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, that's right.

  Oh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's a real cat. That's a real cat.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is some cat wrangler's proudest moment.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait, what's it going to do to her?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Give her Covid.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} This is the origin story for Covid? No, that's so dark.
  So I used to have a cat and it did this to me in the mornings. It
  loved sitting on my chest and breathe its cat breath into my face. I
  never had anything half this exciting happen as what's happening right
  now.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So I wonder, if you're Halle, you know, like, the reason you put up
  with being a mousy sort of klutz for the first 20 minutes of this
  movie, is that you know that you're at some point going to get to kick
  some people and jump on some railings or something?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I mean, Halle Berry had already been in superhero movies. I mean, she
  was in some of the best X-Men movies, in my opinion. ``X-Men,'' which
  came out, I guess, in 2000. And then ``X2,'' 2003, is that right?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And she played Storm. You know, and it's interesting actually to
  remember, because I love those movies. And in a way, she was kind of
  the weakest link there, too. And it's not really her fault. They just
  didn't really give her a lot to do in those movies. They gave her a
  bad white wig, and just made it really windy. {[}LAUGHS{]} Like
  remember, Cyclops is always like, Storm, a little cover, and she would
  grab the armrest and her eyes would roll back in her head, and then
  the fog would descend. And it's like, word? OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. She was my favorite X-Man and ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- that's what happened to her.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  So maybe Halle read the script and was like, ``I do want to crouch,
  crab walk down an alley, and look at some spiders in high def, yes! I
  will do it.'' Is this true to her origin story? Does she fall in a vat
  of chemicals. I've got to look this up.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm just like, does she get bit by the cat? Does she fall into the
  chemicals? I just need to know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I love that you need to know this.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm very curious.

  They do do that.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You would ask. You would ask. Let me rack my brain for a second. I
  don't recall this happening to any Catwoman in any of Bob Kane's
  editions of ``Catwoman,'' like even in subsequent editions. Catwoman,
  she just likes to steal things. She's just a thief. No cats gave her a
  virus and turned her into an actual cat. As far as I know, the other
  women just liked to impersonate cats because it was a sexy thing to
  do, because she is the creation of men. No women had had any say in
  the creation of this character. She's just being pulled on some
  strings by some dudes who --- let me just read you what Bob Kane, the
  creator of Catwoman, thought he was doing when he invented this lady.
  This is Catwoman's creator Bob Kane saying in his memoir, ``Batman and
  Me,'' ``I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like
  dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are cool, detached
  and reliable. Cats are as hard to understand as women are. You always
  need to keep a woman at arm's length. We don't want anyone talking
  ---''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- over our souls. And women have a habit of doing that. So there's a
  love/resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I'm
  being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel I've had better
  relationships with male friends than women.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I feel like this unnatural binary explains decades of sour
  relationships between men and women, and just, wow, it all goes back
  to the DC comic universe. I mean, this explains so much about the
  American psyche. {[}SIGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, screw Jane Austen, we're going for Bob Kane. Bob Kane started it
  all.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Fully. Fully.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, is that not the house from ``Up?'' Isn't that the ``Up'' house?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's the house from ``Up!''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait. Who is this actress again? This is one of my favorite old scary
  ladies.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is --- {[}LAUGHS{]} Wait. Bite your tongue. This is Frances
  Conroy whose job it is now --- I mean, between this movie and a couple
  of other horror movies and ``Joker,'' she was Joaquin Phoenix's mother
  in ``Joker.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, that's right. That's right. That's where we last saw her.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But she's most famous for playing the mother on ``Six Feet Under.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is one of the great parts, the ``Six Feet Under'' mother. But
  she's just a cat lady in the movies. And I mean, literally, either
  like a sickly, crazy mom or a cat lady.

  I mean, I would love to hear Francis Conroy talk about this, because
  she's a great stage actress. She's very good on ``Six Feet Under.''
  And she's never had a part in any movie that's as good as what she had
  on that TV show.

  Oh, no. Oh, boy.

  How do you act this?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  How do you act this? Like, if you're Halle, how are you rehearsing
  this moment? Are you watching your cats do this?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uff, uff.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. I'm trying to be on board with everything that's happening in this
  movie, but can you riddle me this. Why is she turning into an actual
  cat? Like, no Batman in the history of Batman ever hung upside-down,
  right? I'm really trying to ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I believe Michael Keaton's Batman does sleep upside-down ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- to be fair. But he doesn't eat, like ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Flies.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Exactly. He can resist the urge to do other bat things.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I do recall Michelle Pfeiffer in ``Batman Returns,'' bending over and,
  like, having herself some milk. Eartha Kitt has to growl or something,
  you know. It's like, there is a small price to pay. But Halle Berry,
  the I.R.S. went after her on this one for the cat tax.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She's taking it to another level entirely.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is my favorite Halle Berry version.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh dang. Oh.

  She's like, I don't care.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. We just saw Halle Berry do a thing that I enjoy when Halle Berry
  does, which is kind of tell somebody off and assert herself. And until
  that point, like, we have been waiting for her to do something to, I
  don't know, kind of be the movie star we need her to be in a movie
  like this, and not this meek, passive, wet noodle of a person.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  But she still has so much less spice than when she does it in
  ``Boomerang.'' So, like, what is even going on here?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  We're coming up on a good minute to synchronize our watching just to
  make sure we're all on the same page. So let's get ready to check and
  see if that's true. You ready? We're going to be at 32 minutes and 45
  seconds in 3, 2, 1, now. And we'll do another one of those in about 20
  minutes.

  I'll just say at this point --- we've been watching this movie for a
  minute.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Despite the things that we're pointing out that aren't right about it,
  there is one thing that I want to bring to our attention. She is
  surrounded by non-white people. Halle Berry is just living in a city
  where there are just some white people, and the white people who are
  there are just --- are evil. Just planting that seed that Sharon Stone
  and Lambert Wilson are the bad guys, and everybody else, basically, is
  a peon who suffers because of them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Again, radical bones. Like, there are some interesting ideas in this
  superhero movie. It just feels like either they didn't know what they
  had or they didn't know what to do with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  By the way, I want to say that Halle is channeling Janet Jackson in
  this first part of the movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, for sure. For sure.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She just seems shy in the way that Janet could pretend to be shy, or
  actually just be shy. Janet never pretended to be shy.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, boy. I love movie basketball kids.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Definitely. It should be like a weird cliche and a trope but I just
  actually love it --- oh, wait. I spoke too soon, because now we're in
  a ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  What kind of music video is this? It's like, it turns into a Destiny's
  Child video.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Meanwhile, this is a Paula Abdul video.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And these camera angles, what is going on here?
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The editing and camera work here are just --- this is not Halle
  Berry's fault is what I'm saying.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That dancing was her fault. I mean ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, she did do some of this dancing. But I mean, she didn't edit
  and shoot this movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  No, she didn't. That's not her job.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And that's not her body either. {[}LAUGHS{]} She's not doing those
  stunts.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's weird how no one's reacting, though. Everyone's just like, yeah,
  get it. Mm-hm. Fly through the air. It's like, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Because it's Gotham, Jenna. This happens all the time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  True. The kids are used to seeing really weird things and just being
  like, it's all good.

  But wait, Wesley. What kinds of movies were out around the time this
  movie was out? Was it really outrageous that a movie like this got
  made in 2004, or were people just kind of like, you know?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, what do you mean by a movie like this? Like a superhero movie?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Everything we just saw ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Or just like a bad.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Those camera angles. Yeah. Like a really cheesy, campy --- oh, I love
  breakable glass. I love fake glass in movies.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}. I mean, this would have been the summer of 2004. So
  we're talking like, ``Kill Bill Volume 2'' would have opened in April.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, OK.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The best of the Harry Potter movies, Alfonso Cuaron's ``Prisoner of
  Azkaban'' ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- would have opened ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Damn.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- I think, like, earlier in June. ``Collateral'' would have come out
  a couple weeks after this movie with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the
  great Michael Mann movie. And this was --- I mean, just to give you a
  sense of what else was in the movies that whole year, 2004, if memory
  serves, is the year of ``Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- ``The Aviator,'' ``Million Dollar Baby'' is that year.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Dang, OK. So there were some high caliber pictures out. Like, the bar
  was set and it was a lot higher than an RC Cola commercial, which is
  what I feel like we just watched. So ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}

  To add insult to injury, Jenna, this is also the same summer as
  ``Spider-Man 2,'' which is the best of the Spider-Mans --- of all the
  Spider-Mans I would say. And one of the great action sequences, in
  that train sequence, of all time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh! Is that the one where Tobey Maguire single-handedly zooms down and
  stops the train --- the elevated train somewhere in Manhattan with one
  hand, and it's just like, the most epic sequence ever?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yes. Yes, that is it. And then he's like totally spent. And the
  passengers in the train car hoist him up like he's Jesus at the ---
  it's just like ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's the most I heart ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's beautiful.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- New York iconic scene ever. So good, so good.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.

  Oh, she's about to go off.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She's not having it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He looks like Gerard Butler.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Everybody in this movie, except for Halle and Sharon, is like a budget
  version of something else. They spent all the money on the visual
  effects. They couldn't afford casting anybody else.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, every ounce of this movie is a budget version of something
  else.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh gosh. I can't stop thinking about the fact that ``Kill Bill'' was
  out at the same time. I mean, what does it say that this is, like, her
  ultimate first act of bad-assery. She sprays soda water on a speaker.
  Meanwhile, Uma is learning to, like, drive a car with her tongue or
  whatever happens in that movie. It's just like ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Look ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- jeez Louise.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- I think this is the first time she whips somebody.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The fizzer is where she gets this idea to start whipping people.

  I think that there's something interesting about her becoming Catwoman
  and also becoming, like, black in a way.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know if you are feeling this the way I'm feeling it. But this
  is partially Halle Berry's performance strategy in general. And it
  definitely creates this imbalance, in this particular performance,
  where whenever she gets angry, she gets more interesting. And that's
  Halle Berry in a lot of things.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  When her back's up against the wall, when she's a cornered cat,
  basically, and she has to hiss at somebody, that is her best mode,
  anger. But having her go from mousy to catty ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- it's not much of an acting challenge, and from a character
  development standpoint, it's not that interesting under the
  circumstances.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I feel like this is how you know, though, that those movies were
  written by men. OK, hashtag not all men. But I do feel like only those
  men can really understand a woman stepping into her power and a woman
  becoming embodied and more powerful and aware of herself. They can
  only read that as, like, a turn for the bitchy, a turn for the mean, a
  turn for the cold, which is really unimaginative and boring, but it
  sounds very true to what Bob Kane imagined. So look at the material,
  honey. Look at the material.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Now, I do have a question. Like, what kind of cat is she, by the way?

  Like, she's both a feline cat, but also she's a dominatrix cat.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Now, I don't get it. Like, make up your minds, y'all. Now, there is in
  the DC universe, there is a dominatrix, prostitute ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- version of Catwoman.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes. But I would also argue that this is the only way they can imagine
  a very sexy woman. She has to be a hooker or a dominatrix. Like, it
  just can't be something that is just naturally imbued into a woman. So
  most of the women, at least in the DC comic book universe who make it
  into the movies, they're always deeply traumatized. They have really
  ugly histories of abuse. I'm thinking about Harley Quinn. I'm thinking
  about Poison Ivy, who was actually, low key, the coolest villain.
  Like, she's an eco-terrorist. You know, I really, actually, shout out
  to Uma Thurman who also played her. But they always have these
  deep-seated issues that never, really, are dealt with. They only
  manifest as them acting out or being pathologized as sort of the
  motivation for their criminal intent. Whereas Halle Berry's Catwoman,
  Patience, she's outside of all of that, and she has a very different
  origin story that doesn't place her as someone who was quote,
  ``insane.'' And the only other person, really, that comes to mind who
  had that same classification was Wonder Woman. But she's literally not
  from planet Earth. She's literally descended from a Greek god. So
  those are the dichotomies of women that make their way into these
  superhero movies.

  OK, wait, Wesley. Are there any women superheroes in either of the
  comic book universes who aren't just obsessed with, like, narcissism
  or petty crime. I mean, I know there's Captain Marvel. But I feel like
  this is, when I'm thinking of, like, Poison Ivy and Catwoman, they're
  all just, like, petty thiefs who use their powers just to, like, go
  shopping, essentially.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This is a great ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- question. But it's funny that you mention this about the movies
  starring comic book characters. Because they don't really have a
  world-saving purpose. This is the appeal of Wonder Woman, right?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Wonder Woman is sort of aimed at a higher purpose. But my favorite ---
  one of my --- I mean, Storm is one of my favorite comic book
  characters. And as I've told you many times --- you already know this
  --- I think that there's a whole Storm X-Men arc where she loses her
  powers and is basically marooned in the comic book, essentially, with
  this character named Forge, whose ability ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- he's got this architectural mutant ability. Their love affair is
  so hot and steamy. Halle Berry is still old enough to play Storm.

  I would love to see that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I think this is the right thing to do. This is logical. It makes sense
  to me. We don't know her backstory. We don't know who her people are.
  She has no one she can trust. She's, like, I gotta look up diabolical
  cats because I feel like I'm a witch. I feel like I'm seeing some
  things.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But bad filmmaking is basically telling us what we already know. We
  already know what her problem is. And now it has replay ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I just don't like when movies reuse ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- the opening ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- the title sequence.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- title sequence?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Exactly. Yes, I'm there with you! That is a pet peeve. That is a movie
  pet peeve of mine. It is so lazy.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No pun intended, but it should be everybody's pet peeve.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. Now we're getting somewhere.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She's just I need some answers.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- found a clue. She found a clue.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'm going back back ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She's back at the ``Up'' house.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- to the ``Up'' house.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I love that actress, oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Frances Conroy. I'm telling you, man.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. Oh wait. Here we go. We're about to learn something.

  Right. She did die.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, and this movie killed you.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This movie killed more than your character.

  Yo, shout out to crazy cat ladies, though. They have a bad rap as an
  arch --- oh, my god, this sequence. They have a bad rap as an
  archetype, but they always be knowing.

  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh. What is this, downward cat?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  OK. All right. All right. I'm going to say something controversial.
  I'm actually kind of really into the mystical element. I'm into the
  idea that she's part of this lineage of magical relationships between
  women and this Egyptian goddess, Bast. I actually kind of like that
  she gets her powers from cat breath. I like this. I like this better
  than the idea that they're just a petty thief, like Anne Hathaway's
  Catwoman or Eartha Kitt's Catwoman. I'm appreciating this.

  Oh, man, I'm so deep in corona that I'm like, it's the wrong kind of
  mask!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} But wait, can we just back up to talk about what Frances
  Conroy just said to Halle Berry? She said ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  No, what did she --- Yeah, I mean, tell me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Cat women are not controlled by the rules of society. You follow your
  own desires. This is both a blessing and a curse! You'll often be
  alone and misunderstood, but you'll experience a freedom other women
  have never known.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And how was that striking you?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  As a bunch of BS. But I hear the movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'm not saying that what she's saying isn't true, but the movie, it's
  not as though this is a story of Kelly Rowland finding her Michelle
  and Beyonce, right?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right, right, right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Again, speaking of which, more of that Beyonce knock-off.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This is your movie pet peeve, actually. Oh, my god, wait. Just take in
  this whole outfit.

  Now, I think this is still a fire look. I love this one the first time
  I saw it, and I love it even now.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So if you're Pitof at this point, how you use an Oscar winner is you
  turn her into a special effect, because that's what you do. You don't
  know how to direct actors. You know how to direct computer
  programming. So why not take a person and turn her into that?

  You know, it's funny, right after this movie comes out, maybe like the
  next year, is ``Aeon Flux'' with Charlize Theron, which was directed
  by Karyn Kusama ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- and it was another bomb. I believe ``Aeon Flux'' is a movie you
  like a lot, right?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes. I was obsessed with the movie when it came out. And I still watch
  it regularly. I know it's not good, but I still enjoy it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, between that movie and this one, I mean, thank god for Uma
  Thurman. But the second ``Kill Bill'' was pretty much it.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No more fighting for women at that point. We're done. That's not
  entirely true, but it just sort of lowered --- it dimmed the prospects
  for women being able to fight for a long time, for at least a few
  years in movies.

  That is a sexy bartender. Sexy bartender alert.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} Wesley's like, you know, I never thought I'd say this,
  but I'm excited to be in a bar again.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Ew, she just wants a glass of milk. Ew.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I mean, the messed up part about this, though, is that the theory is
  that she's going to be able to give in to her desires. But they're not
  her desires. They're these, like, ideas of what a cat wants. Tuna as
  much as you can eat out of a can, milk --- a glass of milk.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And you know, so.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna, what is your favorite nightclub sequence in a movie, because
  there's so many bad ones, and this is definitely one of them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. This is one of the worst ones.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Who's going to the club to do any of this stuff?

  Now seems like a pretty good time for a fun fact.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah, hit me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You ready, Jenna? When ``Black Panther'' came out and Michelle Obama
  had tweeted how proud she was to have ``Black Panther,'' there was
  this, like, mini, tiny ripple of, like, well, where were all those
  people for ``Catwoman'' when that came out?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Excusé moi! I'm sorry. ``Catwoman'' does not have Winston Duke. It
  doesn't have Letitia Wright. It doesn't have Danai Gurira. I mean,
  should I keep going? It didn't have Ruth Carter at the helm with the
  costumes. I mean, come on.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Lupita?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Like, that's not a one-to-one. We're not dealing with apples to apples
  here, folks, at all.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  So then one of the screenwriters of this, of ``Catwoman,'' this guy
  named John Rogers tweets, ``As one of the credited screenwriters of
  `Catwoman,' I believe I have the authority to say, because it was a
  shit movie dumped by the studio and had zero cultural relevance in
  front of or behind the camera.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It sounds defensive, and it sounds like he's embarrassed, and it
  sounds like --- it sounds like he's got some P.T.S.D. to work through,
  and I wish him all the best in resolving it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He does, because he complains in a different tweet that this kind of
  ruined his career and he barely worked after this movie came out.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  All I have to say is at least it wasn't just Halle. At least ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No, white men suffered, too.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  There you go. At least the blast radius was big enough. And I know
  that's unkind to say, but I often feel like usually the only people
  that suffer or pay the price for this kind of bomb are not the women
  or women of color. So at least, you know, it wasn't just her.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. Another time check. We're going to be at 57 minutes and 5 seconds
  in 3, 2, 1, now.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I feel like it's also appropriate to tell you that I have a little bit
  of wine next to me and I just took a sip. OK, I just want you to know
  that. Once the alpha came on, I took a little bit of a sip of my white
  wine. OK. So I was waiting for that part because I just needed to feel
  --- you know?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I knew I was going to get excited. OK. So in preparation for our
  watch-along, I was like, what do I need to know about Halle Berry? And
  then I was like, what happened with Halle Berry and Eric Benét again?
  So that was where my research took me. Nothing useful about her film
  career. I just was like, what happened in that relationship? And I
  found this interview with her and Oprah, and she was saying that right
  after she got the Oscar is when she found out that Eric was having all
  those affairs. And so she went into triage. She couldn't even
  celebrate having the Oscar. She went into triage on her relationship.
  And it wasn't just one woman. He was having affairs the whole time
  they were together. So I don't know. Maybe she felt like she wanted to
  show him what he was missing. I mean, you're Halle Berry and it's all
  over the news that your man is cheating on you. That's a real kick to
  the ego. So maybe she was like, Listen up, one word French director, I
  know I have an Oscar. I don't care. I want to make this movie, and I
  want to be in the sexiest costume your budget can handle. And he was
  like, Oui, oui. OK. I mean ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I hear that. OK. {[}LAUGHS{]} I hear that. Uh-oh. Advice. Advice, here
  we go.

  You can say her hair --- (SINGING) can buy her hair, but it won't
  grow. You can fix your nose if he says so. You can buy all the makeup
  that Mac can make.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  (SINGING) But if ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You got to fill out your ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Who is that?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Beau-Line It'll turn you un-pretty.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, look. He solved the case just like that. He's like ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  No, no. No, Jenna. No, Jenna. No, he didn't, actually.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  They're like, it's not enough that we show you she's changed. It's not
  enough that we ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- tell you she was brought back to life. We're going to analyze her
  handwriting so that you know, in fact, there was a before and there is
  an after.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. City Side Community Center, by the way, which is just like
  movie talk for black and Latino.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's just so weird what the close-ups are of. Do you know what I mean?
  Like, did we need a close-up of the bullseye and the bottles?

  Look at this. Look at this, Jenna. This is just some straight-up inner
  city sadness.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Looks like New York, though. I mean --- it looks like the kind of
  Ferris wheel you would never get on if you valued your life, you know.
  Like you would just, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You would not ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Look at this. It's in a parking lot.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. Oh, no.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  My question is what is he going to do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  This is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I know, right?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} It is a very Spider-Man dilemma. I mean, even her moves
  at that --- I mean, remember when she robbed --- when she beat up the
  burglars at the jewelry store?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Uh-huh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  All those moves were Spider-Man moves.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, yeah. That's true. That's true.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. That poor actor.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I still think this looks cool. I'm just going to be honest. I think
  this looks cool.

  Oh, right. He escaped, so he actually didn't see her do all that, so
  her powers are still secret.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's right.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. I mean, the purpose of the scene is just to let us know that
  she's not just obsessed with petty crime. That there is kind of some
  sort of moral compass inside of her that does orient her towards doing
  good, even though she still wants to steal shiny jewels. Which I guess
  cats like, too. That was in the movie ``Cats.'' Cats like rings, so
  you know, can't help them.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Can't blame them.

  Do you remember how obsessed black women were with the Halle Berry
  haircut? It was like our Rachel. Like, that haircut ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- you know ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- my sister had it. I didn't have the right texture for it so I
  couldn't have it. But to have that, like, really short, feathered,
  pressed in the front, and like, windswept in the back. That was such a
  thing.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Mary J., T-Boz.

  By the way, for anybody who's been wondering where Sharon Stone's been
  the whole time, she's been golfing.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  In a really gorgeous set of TLC satin pajamas.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, yes, Jenna! It's T-Boz's crepe pajamas! It's worth pointing out
  that we've been spending all this time in a movie whose villain is
  ostensibly a beauty product and the people who make the beauty
  product.

  How many days do you think it took them to get this scene right in
  rehearsal?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Not enough, if you ask me. I mean, I would spend the whole time on
  this scene.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I mean, this is the most exciting thing that's happened in this movie.

  Oh, wait. Is she going to recruit Sharon Stone in her take-down
  mission?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Let's see.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, this is so Batman, though.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't trust her.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Uh.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, oh, oh. What? Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Meanwhile, this show is called Hydropolis.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  But this is the most Batman thing about this movie, though. There's
  always ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yup.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- like a showdown at some big gala in the middle of Gotham. Whether
  it's Uma Thurman, again, as Poison Ivy or whatever, there's always a
  moment.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. This is very, like, Tim Burton --- this is like Joel Schumacher
  Batman ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- quality.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Is it racist they gave her acrylics? I don't know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  They gave her diamond acrylics. Hmm. I'm OK with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my lord. Oh, my lord.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh my god Cirque du Soleil!
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. This scene is just --- this is like one of my number one
  complaints about the movies. You know you're watching a lazy-ass movie
  when there are people fighting on some sort of light bridge, or like
  in the rafters of someplace. I know movies think this is exciting
  because it's probably tough to choreograph, but boy, is it lazy. I
  mean, if you're up there, I know it's supposed to show off what the
  choreographer can do, but you know what the hell is going to happen.
  Somebody's going to fall off the rafters. Or they're going to get so
  shaky that somebody's going to drop a weapon and then they'll have to
  have hand-to-hand combat.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's just so lame. It's so lame.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You're saying it's predictable and that's what bores you.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. I'm not impressed by this. That don't impress me much.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's fair.

  Well, Wesley, I see your pet peeve and I raise you one, which is how
  do these people not know that the person that they're fighting is
  their lover or their neighbor or their best friend? I mean, these
  costumes are not that concealing.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know what I mean? I'm just like, come on, y'all. Superman, Clark
  Kent, like, side by side for real. Spider-Man, OK, I get it. He's
  fully covered. But also it's clearly Halle Berry. It's clearly your
  boo Ben. Get it together.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. I mean, at least with Lois Lane, I could get it because Margot
  Kidder was just on some other stuff with Christopher Reeve Superman.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Sure. OK, sure. Yeah, glasses really conceal a lot. Yeah, no, I get
  it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I also think that Margot Kidder's Lois Lane was into having two
  lovers, right? She was into ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- into having this dual relationship. She didn't need to tell us
  that that was what was on her mind, but I think she kind of knew.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Well, that I'm on board for. That is fine.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But I don't know. Benjamin Bratt, I think he just might not be smart
  in this movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  These spotlights are getting an awful lot of close-ups, by the way.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I'm just blocking out all the close-ups.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Can cats see in the dark?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I think so. I mean, they're definitely nocturnal. They like to do
  things at night.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I do think if anybody did their research on anything, it was probably
  what things do cats do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  It's the only thing this thing gets right.

  Again ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wow.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- why is Sharon Stone getting the best clothes in the movie?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That was in her contract, a hundred percent.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She was like, I don't care what Halle wears, but I will be in Versace
  knockoffs.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I think if it's Sharon Stone, though, the budget might have gone to
  Versace.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know. I know. All the budget went to Versace and that leather top
  that Halle's wearing. I'm fine with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh. She's the terminator.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  What just happened there? Did I miss something? Is her face really
  hard?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Beau-Line she's like, she's Beau-Line'd out. (SINGING)
  Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line, Beau-Line. Please don't make me hit
  you one more time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wow.

  Gosh, I have such a hard time when Alex Bornstein talks because I just
  see the mom from ``Family Guy.'' It's ridiculous.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Because she does voice that character.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, boy.

  Halle, we need you to act like a cat looking at fish who just wants to
  get in the tank.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Can you do that?

  And now we need to really --- we need you to really enjoy this sushi.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm uncomfortable.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah. Exactly. So am I.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I guess she hasn't eaten the whole movie from the time we saw the tuna
  until now, so she is pretty hungry.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's weird that, like, the assumption is cats have no control of their
  impulses. Have you ever been around a cat? They are the most studious
  creatures.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But that's --- she's going to age into Frances Conroy is what's going
  to happen.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. That's her future. Got it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's her future. That's my guess.

  Jenna, I don't know what your temperature is right now. My blood
  pressure just is plummeting. So this seems like a pretty good time to
  talk about how Halle Berry's best parts have come from either Oprah
  Winfrey or cable television.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oprah got her to play Janie in her TV version of ``Their Eyes Were
  Watching God,'' Zora Neale Hurston's novel.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm going to revisit that. That's a good homework for me.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She's good in it. And then she played Dorothy Dandridge for HBO.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know. My favorite TV movie.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I loved that movie.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I did not know that.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I thought it was so good. She's so good in it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Well, she needs to channel some Dorothy Dandridge up in here.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  But I feel like if you let her play a part that has a beginning and a
  middle and an end, someplace for her to go and to act, you know, those
  are things that basically any actor needs, by the way --- a beginning
  and a middle and an end. Something to aspire to play. But she can do
  so much if you give her something that amuses her. Do you think
  there's enough in this movie for her to sink her claws into?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} No. I mean, there's no emotion. There's not really a ton
  of drive. I mean, she needs a backstory. I mean, that's what made her
  so good in Dorothy Dandridge. You understood that woman's plight. You
  understood her tension. You understood her ambitions. I mean, give us
  some of that. Oh, my gosh, wait. Look at her freaking out because of
  the rain.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's what we want. We want Dorothy Dandridge, Catwoman. I would love
  to see that.

  Now we're in a Janet Jackson video.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} So true.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And that's all we get.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  That's all we get?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  This seems like another good time to synchronize those clocks. We're
  going to be at 1 hour, 15 minutes and 55 seconds in 3, 2, 1, now.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait. Was that a video phone call? Or what was that?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know, is this a good time to mention the Beyonce and Gaga video,
  video phone, that literally starts like that? I mean ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yes.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I don't know. I think this movie was a lot more influential than
  people give credit for.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I just feel like, Halle Berry's character now has all --- you know,
  she's got a lot of wisdom, right? She understands she's got these cat
  powers. She's not doing anything with them. Why didn't the movie at
  least let her --- yeah. Like, Spider-Man gets to have fun. Usually the
  superheroes get to have fun. There's always a sequence of them, like,
  running around town, playing with their powers. I guess she rode a
  motorcycle through town, but she didn't need to be bitten by a cat to
  do that.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  By the way, she didn't do anything. That was also half stunt double
  ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- half C.G.I. So ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK. This scene right here is exactly why I have been complaining for a
  lot of this movie about the problem of having Sharon Stone and Halle
  Berry in ``Catwoman'' at the same time. Because on the one hand, I
  love Halle Berry, and on the other hand, I love Sharon Stone. It isn't
  that I can't love both those people at the same time. But every time
  Sharon Stone's in the movie, she takes the oxygen away from anybody
  else in the scene.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Especially Halle.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And especially Halle Berry who has the disadvantage of looking
  ridiculous in this sexy costume in a room with Sharon Stone. I don't
  know if that makes sense. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I'll bet you anything, Sharon Stone had her own writers or something.
  Like ---
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Sharon was like, I see your Oscar and I'll raise you {[}LAUGHS{]} ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- this scene.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  There is something kind of costumy about what Halle Berry is asked to
  do here, and there's nothing costumy about what Sharon Stone is doing.
  She's just playing your classic mean villain. It's just Sharon Stone
  knows how to be in a movie, and she knows how to steal a scene from
  people who are vulnerable to having a scene stolen from them.
  {[}LAUGHS{]} And I think Halle Berry is so concentrating on one side
  of things that she doesn't even notice the sneak attack that Sharon
  Stone is waging.

  I love in movies where, like, characters have to find out what's going
  on in their lives by looking up at a giant monitor in public.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} And then hurry away and hope no one noticed that was them
  onscreen.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And hope nobody notices.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} Which is also how you know all these movies take place in
  a fictitious New York, because in a real New York, everyone would be
  like, That's you, bro. Like, That's you!

  Oh, that's her losing Isaiah in ``Monster's Ball'' voice.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  See, the thing about Halle Berry to me is in a lot of Halle Berry
  performances, there are these moments where you just get a sense of
  what she could be doing.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She's worked with not that many great directors.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm, interesting.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I have really been --- like take something like ``Jungle Fever'' for
  instance.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She had a small part in that movie, but she's really good in it.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Even ``Monster's Ball,'' which we can talk about.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Well, we don't have to. I mean, I've always been curious about your
  response to it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She had a good director. I mean, I don't love that guy, but he's good
  at directing actors, I'll say that. And I mean, she's evidently very
  good in that, right? But those parts are very hard to come by, and
  she's fighting, at this point in her career, who's she fighting for
  parts? She's fighting Charlize Theron. She's fighting Nicole Kidman,
  Angelina Jolie. She's up against ---

  I would love to hear Halle Berry talk about the parts she didn't get
  during this period after she wins the Oscar. But I'm sure it's lots of
  juicy things, or maybe she wasn't even considered for them.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I wonder. Yeah, I wonder.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, she can do lots of things. I just don't think this movie
  really shows any of that off.

  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh. {[}LAUGHS{]} That was like, actually, like the perfect timing to
  illustrate your point. They just, you know. But are any superhero
  movies really well acted? Like, I'm just scanning my mind. I mean,
  it's hard. It's hard.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, some of them have their moments. I think that everybody in the
  first two Spider-Man movies is fantastic. I think that McKellen and
  Stewart in the X-Men movies ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah, I agree.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Hugh Jackman in ``Wolverine.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, my god, ``Wolverine'' is so good.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know, like Heath Ledger ais Joker. I mean, these movies do have
  room for good performances.

  Best line in the movie right there. ``Lassie would have brought me the
  key.''
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's also ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That's a screenwriter right there.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  --- the rudest, though. But that's the rudest. I'm sorry. That cat
  brought you back to life. That cat is done working for you, honey.
  Like, come on. Oh, is she just really going to --- we're just going to
  pretend that she can fit through this --- oh, OK. All right. I guess
  we're still in an X-Men movie where people's bodies rearrange, the
  molecules change. All right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Is she Mystique or Catwoman?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right. Right. They don't know. Honey, they don't know.

  I mean, it would be a much more interesting movie if we saw what a
  person, or especially this woman, did with all that newfound power.
  But she's like, No, I'm going to use every ounce of energy I have to
  take down this huge multinational corporation. I mean, good on you,
  but like, also is that what you want to be doing?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh. Pull up to my bumper, baby.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} That's very J. Lo.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Now again, like what was the point of her fondling --- oh, because
  it's a cat. It's a cat! It's a cat.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  It's a cat and she wants the car. She takes what she wants.

  I love how Sharon Stone was inspired by Catwoman. She was like, I can
  murder, too. Like, I'll do what I want, too. Sharon Stone's like, I
  didn't need to die first. I didn't need to get bit by a cat. I will
  take control of my own destiny and not be obsessed with milk and tuna.

  You know, Wesley, you're right. I see what you're saying. Sharon
  Stone, she really just knows how to be in a movie.

  I feel like that's a challenge, though, for women like Halle. It's
  like, she's not sure which part of herself to play up. Is she playing
  up her physicality? Is she playing up her beauty? Is she playing up
  her steeliness? Like, I think she has always struck me as an actor who
  is so conscious of how she's going to be perceived as a black woman,
  and how the different gazes will be falling on her, that she doesn't
  really play to any of the aspects of herself. She kind of just lets
  herself get played. And you can really feel it here in contrast to
  someone like Sharon Stone who knows exactly what angle she's working,
  exactly what she's trying to do on screen. And that's a luxury. I
  mean, that's a privilege that she has. But she gets to kind of be as
  --- take up as much space as she wants. And I don't know that Halle's
  ever really felt that in any of her roles.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I will also say, Sharon Stone, it took her a long time to even get to
  that moment ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I was going to say, yeah.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- in ``Catwoman``, if you know what I mean.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah. I was realizing that in real time.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know, this is a seasoned movie star, basically, with all of this
  experience. This is the thing about older actors, right? About
  especially women. Like, you spend your whole career building up some
  knowledge, and some vocabulary, and some natural way of presenting
  yourself in front of a camera.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And the minute you figure that out, you get thrown over the side of
  the boat. And turned into, like, Meow Mix.
\item
  {[}laughter{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Chum. You're chum.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I don't know. Here is a woman who's just got more experience and more
  charisma than a movie like this even needs. And Halle Berry just kind
  of is the unwitting victim of it.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  She gets very declawed around Sharon Stone, like defanged and
  declawed. Like, all the bad-assery just goes out the window when she's
  next to Sharon Stone.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  I mean, the thing that's exasperating about this, when you look at
  what is happening with the Sharon Stone character versus what's
  happening with the Halle Berry character, is all of the writing is
  there for Sharon Stone. And Halle Berry, Patience has no real ---
  she's got a personality, but it's a very generic personality. She's
  just good. She's a good person having a naughty moment. But every time
  Sharon Stone's on screen, I just want to be with her.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And that isn't about Halle Berry per se, but it is about Halle Berry
  in this movie.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Hmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Which is that every time Sharon Stone shows up, I want to know
  whatever's going on in that woman's psyche.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Catwoman has no psyche. She's got all these, like, personality traits
  that correspond with a house animal.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know. She was a do-gooder, and then doing good got her into trouble,
  and she got a second chance, and this is what she's doing with it.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Do you think the lighting is the real lighting, or do you think
  everybody got touched up? Because ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I'm like ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The only person who doesn't look touched up is Benjamin Bratt. But
  Sharon Stone's face looks ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Fluorescent.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- extra creamy.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah, they're all glowing. Yeah. Yeah.

  Like the insistence there's a right way to do this. Or right way to
  --- oh, whoa. But she didn't, though, did she? Did I miss something?
  It wasn't Sharon Stone.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Jenna let me ask you a question right now.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mm-hm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Let's just say that you just killed your husband ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And ---
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I'm there, keep going.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  --- this woman is just on your tail, and she's dressed like a
  dominatrix from an En Vogue video.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You're describing, literally, my dreams. Go on.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Do you have time right now to really talk about your motivations for
  why you've become evil?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I do.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You do?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  A hundred percent I do.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  OK.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yes. Yes, because that's part of the seduction. This is what's --- I'm
  like, let's talk.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Let me see if I can get you on my side. Yes. I'm like, Halle Berry,
  come join me, boo. Like, we can rule this kingdom together.

  Now, that's an act --- like a very interesting super villain
  backstory. That's fantastic.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah, exactly. Exactly!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Yeah.

  It's always so disappointing in these superhero movies, though, when
  the women superheroes can't actually do anything. Like they always get
  bested. Do you know what I mean?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Yeah.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And you're just like what's the point of all those powers? What's the
  point of all that painful transformation, giving up your old life,
  when it barely comes down --- barely gets you anything in a one-to-one
  fist fight.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  You know what I hate, I hate generic action setting finale. I hate
  warehouse showdown.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Mmm.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Like, I know we're supposed to be in an office building, but this
  looks no different to me than like ye old dockyard shootout.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}

  That is a bad line.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  That is a bad line.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Abs of steel. She was like, I'll be fine. Yeah, where was that whip
  hiding? Where was that whip hiding the whole time?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Also, from a physics standpoint, her being able to fling that thing
  around like that makes no sense.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I agree.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  She'd be hitting the ceilings and the walls and the pillar. It just
  ---

  Oh, my god. Oh, Sharon. No! No!

  No, Sharon!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Sharon's like, I would rather die than live with this face.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, that fall! {[}LAUGHS{]} Jenna, have you ever seen a fall like that
  before in your life?
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I have not. This movie ---
\item
  wesley morris\\
  The flipping in the air. It was like a real person! Oh, my god!
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Where has he been this whole time?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He's useless.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  He's useless.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Funny, he got up to her apartment in, like, two seconds to save her
  the first time.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} Right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  And now it takes him 20 minutes to get up there to help her fight
  Sharon Stone.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Oh, he's just going to pin them all on her?
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Oh, my god. There is a tragedy right there.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  I know.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  Tragedy.

  One of our least fulfilled movie stars just in a pile of glass on a
  logo. Oh, her dreams came true.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  Wait. I missed this whole thing. All right.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  He works at the hospital. I think he's a doctor.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  And they got together, I guess.
\item
  wesley morris\\
  They got together.
\item
  jenna wortham\\
  You know, part of the reason we picked this movie is because we were
  kind of starting our own silent hashtag campaign, justice for Halle,
  because we didn't feel like she'd ever been properly served by
  Hollywood, or ever had an opportunity to properly stretch her wings,
  right? I think that Halle's struggle represents a bigger struggle
  within Hollywood, in any industry where you have to figure out how to
  present yourself, or they'll figure it out for you, and they'll fail,
  right? Like Halle, they couldn't figure out if Halle should be the sex
  symbol, or is she a serious actor, is she an action figure. I mean,
  she just let them make her into whatever the picture needed. I mean,
  the real coup would be for Halle to come back, know exactly --- like
  pull a Reese Witherspoon and start producing and making the movies she
  wants to be in and being a part of it. But honestly, I kind of feel
  like she's playing the role that she wants to play, which is if you go
  to her Instagram, she's just hanging out with her kids, easing into
  her 50s, nothing left to prove. I mean, I wonder if she still thinks
  about cat person. I'm going to say cat person in this movie instead of
  Catwoman. But I wonder if she still thinks about this movie.

We're trying something new this week. We want you to watch a movie with
us. And not just any movie, but the 2004 superhero bomb ``Catwoman,''
starring two of our favorites: Halle Berry and Sharon Stone. We've got
fun facts, some questions and a little bit of, um, cattiness.
