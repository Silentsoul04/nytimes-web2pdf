Donald Reed Herring, the oldest brother of Senator Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts, died of Covid-19 on Tuesday in Norman, Okla. He was 86.

Ms. Warren confirmed the death on Twitter on Thursday,

\begin{quote}
My oldest brother, Don Reed, died from coronavirus on Tuesday evening.
He joined the Air Force at 19 and spent his career in the military,
including five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam. He was
charming and funny, a natural leader. \url{https://t.co/b8m0xKzAmM}

``What made him extra special was his smile --- quick and crooked, it
always seemed to generate its own light, one that lit up everyone around
him,'' Ms. Warren wrote. ``I'm grateful to the nurses and front-line
staff who took care of him, but it's hard to know that there was no
family to hold his hand or to say `I love you' one more time --- and no
funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close.''

Mr. Herring was born on June 11, 1933, to Donald and Pauline (Reed)
Herring. He was a career officer in the Air Force, reaching the rank of
lieutenant colonel, and flew combat missions in Vietnam before retiring
from the military in 1973 and starting an auto-detailing business.

In addition to Ms. Warren, he is survived by his wife, Judith Anne Hart;
two sons, John and Jeffrey; and two brothers, David and John Herring.
His first wife, Nancy, died of cancer.

Ms. Warren spoke about her brothers frequently during her presidential
campaign --- often noting their military service and that two of the
three were Republicans --- and they appeared prominently in one of her
campaign ads.
