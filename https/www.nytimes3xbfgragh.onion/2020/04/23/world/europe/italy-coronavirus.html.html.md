MILAN — As the infection curve in
[Italy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening-parents.html)
flattens and the government [moves gingerly toward reopening the
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/05/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-reopen.html),
more Italians, fueled by growing anger over thousands of deaths and what
they see as health officials’ failures in handing the crisis, are
seeking to hold someone accountable.

Some analysts foresee a litigious phase as victims’ families rally in
anger in Facebook groups and prosecutors weigh manslaughter charges over
deaths at some nursing homes. Italy’s
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening-parents.html)
epidemic was [among the world’s
deadliest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html),
with an official toll of more than 25,000. And the grievances are
emerging as the government wrestles with lifting the lockdown, what it
calls Phase 2.

“Phase 3 is going to be the criminalization of the contagion,” the
journalist Nicola Mirenzi [wrote on the news website
Linkiesta](https://www.linkiesta.it/2020/04/la-fase-tre-sara-la-criminalizzazione-del-contagio/).
“The pandemic is going to turn into a big collective trial.”

Prosecutors have begun investigating whether errors by the authorities
had contributed to or caused Italy’s deadliest clusters. Liberal members
of Parliament have accused the conservative government in the Lombardy
region, where the country’s outbreak first appeared, of exacerbating the
contagion. About 45,000 relatives of coronavirus victims have joined
“NOI Denunceremo” (“We Will Denounce You”), a Facebook group for
people who believe not enough was done to save their relatives.

Lawyers have begun advertising their services to mourning families in
response to allegations of mistakes committed by health care workers in
treating coronavirus patients. The president of Italy’s main doctors’
association has denounced the marketing campaigns.

But many Italians seek to hold the authorities accountable for what they
call negligence and the lack of timely treatment many said they had
witnessed.

But when another doctor at the Ponte San Pietro Hospital told her that

She added that, at this point, she would not know whom to sue.

Diego Federici, 35, said that his mother had the coronavirus and died on
March 25 after doctors in a hospital in Treviglio, near Milan, decided
not to intubate her. His father, who was never admitted to an intensive
care unit, had died four days earlier.

Mr. Federici said he had joined the NOI Denunceremo Facebook group,
adding that he could not accept that two healthy people had died within
four days.

“Nobody is going to give me my parents back,” he said, “but if someone
did something wrong, they should pay for it.”

Luca Fusco, the founder of the Facebook group, initially posted his
email address for members to send their stories anonymously, but dozens
of members soon started directly publishing their testimonies every day.
The authors do not directly accuse health care workers of malfeasance.

As the painful stories of the epidemic pile up on Facebook, the
judiciary authorities began searching for someone to blame. Prosecutors
started an investigation into what they call an “involuntary epidemic”
at a hospital in Alzano, near Bergamo, where the virus spread through
the medical wards.

Maria Cristina Rota, Bergamo’s prosecutor, told the news agency Ansa
that a pool of prosecutors would “take care of all the investigations
about the epidemic in the Bergamo area.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

A ski resort hotel in the Dolomites also presented a subpoena in an
Italian court seeking compensation from China’s Health Ministry for loss
of business after the outbreak, Marco Vignola, the lawyer for the hotel,
told news outlets.

“The early and sudden closure led to disastrous consequences, including
the dismissal of all staff and the cancellation of contracts with
suppliers,” the lawyer was quoted as saying.

On April 15, lawmakers from the governing Democratic Party blamed
Lombardy’s conservative government for the high number of deaths in the
region’s retirement homes. Lia Quartapelle, a lawmaker with the
center-left party, accused the authorities there of having “worsened the
contagion.”

Even as frustration grows, Italy is still mourning its losses and facing
an uncertain future. Honoring health care workers is still foremost in
most Italians’ minds, and not everyone supports the prosecutorial shift.

A 24-year-old nurse wrote a letter in the Repubblica newspaper in
response to the criticism heaped on the authorities in Lombardy. She
said that in the months she spent in a Covid-19 ward, she had learned
the value of sacrifice, waiting and forgiving.

“How can your position toward the future,” she asked, “be summarized by
accusations?”
