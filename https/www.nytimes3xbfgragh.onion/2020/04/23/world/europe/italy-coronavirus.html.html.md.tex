``The pandemic is going to turn into a big collective trial,'' one
journalist predicted as the hardest-hit country in Europe assesses the
fallout.

MILAN --- As the infection curve in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening-parents.html}{Italy}
flattens and the government
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/05/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-reopen.html}{moves
gingerly toward reopening the country}, more Italians, fueled by growing
anger over thousands of deaths and what they see as health officials'
failures in handing the crisis, are seeking to hold someone accountable.

Some analysts foresee a litigious phase as victims' families rally in
anger in Facebook groups and prosecutors weigh manslaughter charges over
deaths at some nursing homes. Italy's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening-parents.html}{coronavirus}
epidemic was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{among
the world's deadliest}, with an official toll of more than 25,000. And
the grievances are emerging as the government wrestles with lifting the
lockdown, what it calls Phase 2.

``Phase 3 is going to be the criminalization of the contagion,'' the
journalist Nicola Mirenzi
\href{https://www.linkiesta.it/2020/04/la-fase-tre-sara-la-criminalizzazione-del-contagio/}{wrote
on the news website Linkiesta}. ``The pandemic is going to turn into a
big collective trial.''

Prosecutors have begun investigating whether errors by the authorities
had contributed to or caused Italy's deadliest clusters. Liberal members
of Parliament have accused the conservative government in the Lombardy
region, where the country's outbreak first appeared, of exacerbating the
contagion. About 45,000 relatives of coronavirus victims have joined
``NOI Denunceremo'' (``We Will Denounce You''), a Facebook group for
people who believe not enough was done to save their relatives.

Lawyers have begun advertising their services to mourning families in
response to allegations of mistakes committed by health care workers in
treating coronavirus patients. The president of Italy's main doctors'
association has denounced the marketing campaigns.

But many Italians seek to hold the authorities accountable for what they
call negligence and the lack of timely treatment many said they had
witnessed.

Laura Capelli, a 48-year-old office worker, said doctors in a town near
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html}{Bergamo,
the area of Italy hit the hardest by the coronavirus}, had told her they
had decided to sedate her uncle because he kept clawing at the mask on
his face. He died soon after.

But when another doctor at the Ponte San Pietro Hospital told her that
the choice to sedate her uncle had been motivated by a need to make room
for younger patients, Ms. Capelli joined NOI Denunceremo.

``I have the impression they are trying to silence everything,'' Ms.
Capelli said on Thursday. ``Now it's a moment of common pain, but for
the future, I want justice.''

She added that, at this point, she would not know whom to sue.

Diego Federici, 35, said that his mother had the coronavirus and died on
March 25 after doctors in a hospital in Treviglio, near Milan, decided
not to intubate her. His father, who was never admitted to an intensive
care unit, had died four days earlier.

Mr. Federici said he had joined the NOI Denunceremo Facebook group,
adding that he could not accept that two healthy people had died within
four days.

``Nobody is going to give me my parents back,'' he said, ``but if
someone did something wrong, they should pay for it.''

Luca Fusco, the founder of the Facebook group, initially posted his
email address for members to send their stories anonymously, but dozens
of members soon started directly publishing their testimonies every day.
The authors do not directly accuse health care workers of malfeasance.

As the painful stories of the epidemic pile up on Facebook, the
judiciary authorities began searching for someone to blame. Prosecutors
started an investigation into what they call an ``involuntary epidemic''
at a hospital in Alzano, near Bergamo, where the virus spread through
the medical wards.

Maria Cristina Rota, Bergamo's prosecutor, told the news agency Ansa
that a pool of prosecutors would ``take care of all the investigations
about the epidemic in the Bergamo area.''

They are also considering manslaughter charges against the directors of
retirement homes where hundreds of residents died and where the full
death toll may have been hidden.

Italians are not the only ones seeking some form of accountability for
the pandemic. In the United States, the state of Missouri filed a
lawsuit against the Chinese government on Tuesday, saying its response
to the outbreak that emerged in the city of Wuhan had led to devastating
economic losses in the state.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

A ski resort hotel in the Dolomites also presented a subpoena in an
Italian court seeking compensation from China's Health Ministry for loss
of business after the outbreak, Marco Vignola, the lawyer for the hotel,
told news outlets.

``The early and sudden closure led to disastrous consequences, including
the dismissal of all staff and the cancellation of contracts with
suppliers,'' the lawyer was quoted as saying.

On April 15, lawmakers from the governing Democratic Party blamed
Lombardy's conservative government for the high number of deaths in the
region's retirement homes. Lia Quartapelle, a lawmaker with the
center-left party, accused the authorities there of having ``worsened
the contagion.''

Even as frustration grows, Italy is still mourning its losses and facing
an uncertain future. Honoring health care workers is still foremost in
most Italians' minds, and not everyone supports the prosecutorial shift.

A 24-year-old nurse wrote a letter in the Repubblica newspaper in
response to the criticism heaped on the authorities in Lombardy. She
said that in the months she spent in a Covid-19 ward, she had learned
the value of sacrifice, waiting and forgiving.

``How can your position toward the future,'' she asked, ``be summarized
by accusations?''
