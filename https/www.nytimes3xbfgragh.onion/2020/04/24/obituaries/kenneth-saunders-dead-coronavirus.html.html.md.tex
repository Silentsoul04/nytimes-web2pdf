at
43}\label{kenneth-saunders-iii-civic-leader-with-a-mediating-touch-dies-at-43}}

He joined his first local board at 18 and never stopped trying to
improve his suburban Atlanta community. Mr. Saunders died of the
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Kenneth Saunders III was the kind of friend who knew the best new place
to eat, and had the technological skills to find a coupon on his
cellphone to slice a couple of dollars off the tab. Then, after the
meal, he would send you the selfies he took along the way.

He was civic-minded, too, making a name for himself as an optimistic
peacemaker in the sometimes heated world of neighborhood politics,
especially in sprawling Dekalb County, east of Atlanta, where he lived.

``I don't think he had biased eyes in any direction at all,'' said
Kenneth Saunders Jr., his father. ``You have the issues that come
between the white and black politicians, but he had friends on both
sides. Even if he was opposed to them,
\href{https://decaturish.com/2020/04/zba-and-south-dekalb-improvement-association-member-kenneth-saunders-iii-dies-from-covid-19/}{he
would work with them}.''

Mr. Saunders died on April 18 at Emory Decatur Hospital in Decatur, Ga.
He was 43. The cause was Covid-19, his father said.

Mr. Saunders was admitted to the hospital on April 3, the same day his
father, a civil engineer, was released after his own battle with the
disease. Two days after he died, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/us/coronavirus-georgia-south-carolina.html}{announced}
that the state would allow businesses like hair salons, gyms and
restaurants to begin operating again, making it the first in the nation
to begin a widespread relaxing of restrictions aimed at preventing the
spread of the coronavirus.

Mr. Saunders was born on July 2, 1976, in New Orleans. His father moved
the family to the Atlanta area when his son was 4.

From an early age, Mr. Saunders had a special aptitude for data,
computers and music. He played the trumpet, and was a member of the band
that performed during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

``He's still got the uniform in his closet signed by
\href{https://wyntonmarsalis.org/about/bio}{Wynton Marsalis},'' his
father said, referring to the musician.

Mr. Saunders graduated from Redan High School and for three years
studied civil engineering at the Southern Polytechnic College of
Engineering and Engineering Technology at Kennesaw State University
before leaving to start his own technology and travel businesses.

Politics drew him in early. At 18, he joined the board of the Hidden
Hills Civic Association, which represents about 1,650 homeowners in the
community near Stone Mountain, Ga., where he lived. He would become its
vice president, as well as the president of the South DeKalb Improvement
Association and a member of the DeKalb County Zoning Board of Appeals.

He had his eye on higher office but mostly, he just wanted to make the
world better for the people around him, said
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/TheRiceReport/?ref=nf\&hc_ref=ARTAfj43umcC9a0YgYNFwAP0Vu6zu40LE-Cck2XEECe7ULkeo6efNe-3v7g758qJt-k}{Kathryn
Rice}, who knew him for 20 years and had worked with him on several
civic projects.

``A lot of people who run for office have very sincere feelings before
they get in, but once you get in, the system can fold you up,'' she
said. ``That wasn't Kenneth. He was a peacemaker who always seemed to
work toward what was best for everybody.''
