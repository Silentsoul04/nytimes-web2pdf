\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Mario César Romero was the son of a house painter and seamstress from
Puerto Rico who grew up in a housing project next to where Lincoln
Center and its cultural institutions would one day rise.

Though blessed with neither good health nor fortune, he always carried
himself with a certain élan, holding forth on art history at the counter
of a home-style Puerto Rican restaurant downstairs from his apartment in
East Harlem.

``His life transcended the most astonishing challenges with dignity,''
said
\href{https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/about/board_of_trustees}{Susana}\href{https://www.imls.gov/susana-torruella-leval}{Torruella
Leva}l, a friend who is on the Brooklyn Museum's
\href{https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/brooklyn-museum-adds-three-to-board-of-trustees-9241/}{board
of trustees}. ``He was truly a 19th century gentleman. I always thought
of him as being in the court of some great king advising him on the
arts.''

Mr. Romero,
an\href{https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/centrovoices/current-affairs/remembering-mario-cesar-romero}{art
historian, curator, consultant and lecturer,} died on April 17 in
Manhattan of complications of the coronavirus, his sister, Migdalia
Romero, said. He was 78 and had spent the last decade living in an
assisted-living center until this summer, when health problems resulted
in his entering palliative care.

Mr. Romero was a familiar sight in East Harlem, where he lived in an
art-filled apartment on East 106th Street off Third Avenue. Educated in
Catholic schools, he graduated from Fordham University with a degree in
art history and also studied at the University of Puerto Rico.

As East Harlem's borough-appointed official historian, he led walking
tours and held forth on the artists who made the neighborhood home,
including the pioneering 20th century portraitist Alice Neel and the
street artist James de la Vega.

``He talked about art in East Harlem in the larger context of art
history,'' said Warren James, an architect and friend. ``By his lens, by
placing them in the larger context, he could see and understand the
significance of someone like de la Vega along the lines of Keith
Haring.''

Ms. Torruella Leval met Mr. Romero in 1970, when both were art history
graduate students, a rarity, she said, for Puerto Ricans like them whose
interests went beyond the European canon. When she was named director of
El Museo del Barrio in 1990, she hired him as a consultant.

Among his lasting contributions to his beloved Barrio are the costumes
he made for El Museo's annual Three Kings Day parade. Like him, the
costumes were elegant and with touches of all the cultural traditions of
Puerto Rico.

``He saw so many dimensions at once,'' Ms. Torruella Leval said.
``Because he had exquisite taste, the fabric and the sewing, which he
probably did himself, were extraordinary.''

Maybe he was fated to do this. After all, he was born on Three Kings
Day.
