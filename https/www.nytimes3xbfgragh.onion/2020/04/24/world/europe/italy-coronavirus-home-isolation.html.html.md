ROME — When her middle-aged son got sick, Ruffina Pompei did what she
had done for decades, bringing vegetable soup and freshly squeezed
orange juice to his room. She slept in an armchair outside his room and
changed his clothes. She told her husband, 89, to steer clear.

But the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening-parents.html)
tore through the apartment.

Her son died in a hospital in the region of Abruzzo on March 29. Her
husband died the next day in the same hospital. Ms. Pompei, 82, was also
diagnosed with the virus.

“I could not leave him alone,” she said of her son.

Before everyone else in the West, Italians received and largely obeyed
an order to stay at home. “I’m staying home” became a hashtag, then the
name of a national ordinance and then a motto hung from balconies and
windows. But while staying home has worked, reducing the rate of
infections, bringing down the daily toll of the dead and creating
breathing room for hospitals, home has become a dangerous place for many
[Italians](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/world/europe/italy-young-people-coronavirus.html).

Italian households represent “the biggest reservoir of infections,” said
Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious diseases department at
Luigi Sacco University Hospital in Milan. He called the cases “the
possible restarting point of the epidemic in case of a reopening.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The family acts as a multiplier, said Andrea Crisanti, the top
scientific consultant on the virus in the Veneto region. “This is a
ticking time bomb,” he said.

The predicament of home infections is emerging not just in
[Italy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening-parents.html)
but in hot spots across the globe, [in
Queens](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/nyregion/coronavirus-queens-corona-jackson-heights-elmhurst.html)
and the [Paris
suburbs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/world/europe/coronavirus-paris-suburbs.html),
as well as the working-class neighborhoods of Rome and Milan. It is also
a problem that local officials and epidemiologists say is getting too
little attention, particularly as the government has announced tentative
steps toward reopening in early May.

Italy’s leading virologists now consider home infections, alongside
clusters in retirement homes, to be a stubborn source of the country’s
contagion. Living together in close quarters and the failure to move the
infected into dedicated quarantine facilities have, they say,
paradoxically propped up the curve of infections that “stay home”
measures were designed to suppress.

The problem is one the Chinese government bludgeoned quickly. It
[ordered the roundup of all residents in Wuhan
infected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
with the coronavirus, warehousing them in quarantine camps, sometimes
with little care. While that approach may have helped contain the virus,
ripping people apart from their homes is anathema to Western
democracies, especially Italy, where tight-knit families are the rule.

Italy, like other Western democracies, has wrestled with the difficulty
of balancing the containment of the virus with the economic, social and
political costs of removing people without symptoms from their own
homes. The government has not made isolating patients outside their
homes a
priority.

“As a doctor I would say let’s put tanks in the streets and let’s do a
police state,” said Guido Marinoni, the president of the Bergamo
doctors’ association. “But the Western world has different realities.”

Italy has not enacted, or articulated, a clear national effort to
prevent contagious people from infecting their households. The country
has essentially accepted a controlled tragedy at home as it focuses on
preventing a contagion from running like wildfire through the society at
large.

“Domestic contagion is the lesser evil,” said Giorgio Palù, a former
professor of virology and microbiology of the University of Padova and
the former head of the European and Italian Society for Virology.
Compared to unleashing the contagion on the streets, it was better to
keep the virus in the family. “At home,” he said, “I block
it.”

Silvio Brusaferro, the president of Italy’s national health institute,
and one of the leading advisers to the Italian government in the crisis,
acknowledged that homes were “higher-risk places,” and on Friday,
demonstrated that family infections accounted for up to 25 percent of
new cases. But he said that what was essential was that home infections
“do not spread further.”

But that offers little solace to the close-knit, multigenerational
families decimated by the virus in their own homes — to the infected
sisters who lost their father and then saw their grandfather
hospitalized in hard-hit

Experts have estimated that more than a million people in Italy could be
infected with the virus at home. The persistence of cases is telling.
Despite a nationwide drop in the number of new infections and deaths,
Lombardy, which remains the Italian epicenter, announced more than 5,000
new cases this week alone, with nearly 900 deaths.

Many public health officials say that the actual number of infections
could be as many as 10 times that.

Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, a scientist at the University of Rome La
Sapienza who specializes in theoretical modeling, said that stemming the
contagion required facilities like in China dedicated to isolating
positive cases.

“Staying home is not the solution, not for the economy or for the
epidemic,” he said. “To reopen without having this in place is very
risky. It’s probable that the epidemic will start up again.”

When a delegation of Chinese doctors came to Italy in March, they
emphasized the importance of prefabricated structures with a high number
of beds to isolate all the positive cases.

“They explained that it was essential to separate positive cases from
the family,” recalled Giampietro Rupolo, the president of the Red Cross
in Padua, who was among those who greeted them. “Otherwise it was harder
to contain.”

But Italian officials have clearly determined that housing the infected
in dedicated facilities is not feasible.

that the government is considering making the lifting of lockdowns in
Italy’s regions contingent on local authorities providing quarantine
facilities for the infected. Experts have also emphasized the importance
of contact tracing and early diagnoses, since contagion can also happen
before a patient starts showing symptoms.

For now, however, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has largely steered
clear of the issue of home infection. A government decree in March
allowed local authorities to seize hotels to host patients who cannot
safely self-isolate at home. But, as is the case with many of the
government decrees, it is being interpreted and implemented differently
around the
country.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In most cases, only people with confirmed cases can go to dedicated
hotel rooms. But the hotel rooms are not available everywhere, and
neither are tests for the virus, which in the hardest-hit places are
given only to people who have been hospitalized.

Officials in Tuscany have urged people who left the hospital with mild
symptoms to isolate in converted hotels. But urge is all they could do,
and by mid-April only 200 had chosen the facilities. Others preferred to
sign a document declaring they would self-isolate at home. In Milan, the
Michelangelo Hotel, set aside for residents with positive coronavirus
test results, was far from full.

In Bergamo, the hardest-hit part of Italy, there are only 400 spots set
aside in local hotels for an infected population at home estimated to be
around 65,000, according to the local doctors’ association.

Working-class Italians often face the hardest choices.

In the southern region of Calabria, Paolina Mazza, 63, who has the
coronavirus, self-isolated at home after her husband was hospitalized
with the virus. She expressed frustration that authorities gave her no
alternative but to go home, where she tried to keep some distance from
her son, 39.

“We don’t have a second house to isolate and they live in a tiny
apartment,” her daughter Daniela said. “We are constantly scared.”

Even some doctors considered the infection of their own families as
inevitable.

Federica Brena, a 35-year-old doctor in the coronavirus ward of
Bergamo’s Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital, came down with symptoms and
immediately diagnosed herself and self-isolated at home, with her
husband and 1-year-old son.

“The ideal option would have been to never go back home,” she said. “It
was obvious that I would infect the two of them.”

Her son came down with a fever and a cough. Her husband also got sick a
few days later, and his fever did not go down for 12 days. “Living in a
home with other people, for as much as one tries to isolate, it’s hard,”
she said, adding everyone was improving. “Especially if you don’t live
in a palace.”

Self-isolating was also especially difficult for older people, who often
need special care and attention.

In late February, Emanuele Visigalli and his brother looked after their
mother, 79, who had come down with a cough and temperature in the
Lombardy town of Fombio, near the country’s initial
outbreak.

He tried to get her hospitalized, but dispatchers from the coronavirus
hotline suggested she self-isolate at home. The idea of abandoning them,
he said, was impossible.

An ambulance first came for his mother. Then for his father, 81. Then, a
week later, another came for him. Both his parents died in the hospital,
but he improved and doctors sent him home.

He said he did not hug his children or kiss his wife when he got back,
and started sleeping in a separate room that his wife disinfected every
day.

“At the dinner table, I sit on one side of the table and they all sit on
the other side,” he said. Looking out his window, he said he grew upset
by the people walking the streets. “What is their problem with staying
at home?”
