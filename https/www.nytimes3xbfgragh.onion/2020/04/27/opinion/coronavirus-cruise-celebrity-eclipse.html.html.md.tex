I wrote recently about some of the companies that have been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/opinion/business-coronavirus.html}{mistreating
their employees and customers} during the pandemic, and I want to tell
you today about another case study. It comes from the cruise industry.

If you've ever been on a cruise, you've probably heard the captain and
crew claim that their top priority is the safety of their passengers.
It's a staple of the announcements that go over a ship's loudspeakers.
But the recent actions of several major cruise lines aren't consistent
with those claims: The companies put a higher priority on continuing to
operate their ships --- and make money --- than on protecting their
passengers and employees.

I'm going to focus on a single ship in today's newsletter: the Eclipse,
which is operated by Celebrity Cruises, part of the Royal Caribbean
Cruise company. But the pattern extends to some other ships and
companies, as well. To read more on the subject, check out recent
coverage in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/us/coronavirus-cruise-ships-zandaam.html}{The
Times},
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/09/revealed-6000-passengers-on-cruise-ships-at-sea-despite-coronavirus-crisis}{The
Guardian} and
\href{https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article241640166.html}{The
Miami Herald}.

As The Herald has written, the cruise industry ``downplayed the dangers
to consumers and kept sending out ships despite outbreaks on board and
warnings from public health officials.'' Since then, industry officials
have ``largely stayed silent about the toll.''

Below is a timeline of the events involving the Eclipse, based largely
on
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/cruise-ships-coronavirus/?nid=top_pb_signin}{a
story in The Washington Post}, which has been doing excellent
investigative work on this subject:

\textbf{February:} It becomes clear that the virus can spread very
quickly on cruise ships. An outbreak on the Diamond Princess receives
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/22/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html}{worldwide
attention}. ``People on a large ship, all together, at the same time,
all the time --- you couldn't ask for a better incubator for
infection,'' Anthony Fauci, the immunologist, says.

\textbf{March 1}: The Eclipse departs on its voyage from Buenos Aires.

\textbf{March 7:} Executives in the cruise industry meet with Vice
President Mike Pence and argue that they can contain the virus while
continuing to sail.

\textbf{March 8:} Fauci warns older people and anyone with a medical
issue to stay away from cruise ships. The State Department
\href{https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/cruise-ship-passengers.html?fbclid=IwAR23mRlu4-382HLuSM8i0KWQBSaZ4heDniggmxR3kBR6e2EgWiKr6B0EseM\#.XmVnwRnDlCU.twitter}{goes
further}: ``U.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health
conditions, should not travel by cruise ship.''

\textbf{March 13:} The cruise industry agrees to stop operations in the
United States for 30 days.

\textbf{Mid-March:} All the while, the Eclipse sails on, with the ship's
officers telling passengers that there are no virus cases on board. The
ship's captain uses the phrase ``healthy ship,'' according to one
passenger. In fact, multiple passengers are reporting flulike symptoms,
which the ship's medical staff tells them are not serious.

\textbf{March 21:} The Eclipse holds a packed celebration on its pool
deck. (You can see a photo by scrolling down just a bit
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/cruise-ships-coronavirus/?nid=top_pb_signin}{here}.)
Amazingly, the celebration was meant to honor health care workers
battling the virus around the world. The ship holds multiple other
packed events, as well. ``They actually made more activities, to keep
people occupied,'' Vivian Miller, 77, a passenger, said.

\textbf{March 30}: The ships docks in San Diego. It's now clear that
dozens of people on it have the coronavirus. At least one will die,
according to
\href{https://www.kusi.com/sister-of-celebrity-cruise-ship-eclipse-passenger-who-died-from-covid-19-speaks-about-how-it-was-handled/}{KUSI
in San Diego}. ``If they honestly thought that all these people who were
getting sick had colds and bronchitis and pneumonia,'' David Nystrom,
75, whose wife got sick on the ship, told The Post, ``I don't know what
to say.''

As The Post story --- which is by Rosalind S. Helderman, Hannah Sampson,
Dalton Bennett and Andrew Ba Tran --- concludes: The Eclipse was ``among
scores of ships that continued voyages even after early outbreaks on
other vessels, carrying thousands of international passengers to
far-flung ports and helping seed the virus around the globe, health
officials say.''
