It was the actor Bruce Myers's voice, above all, that people tended to
remember. ``His deep lion's voice will resonate no more,'' was how the
\href{https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2020/04/16/la-mort-de-bruce-myers-fidele-compagnon-de-theatre-de-peter-brook_6036824_3382.html}{French
newspaper Le Monde opened its tribute to Mr. Myers}, who died of the new
coronavirus in Paris on April 15 at 78.

A favorite of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/18/theater/peter-brook-interview.html}{the
great international director Peter Brook,} with whom he worked for
nearly 50 years, Mr. Myers, with his elegant diction and reverberant
tones, inspired comparisons to the famously mellifluous John Gielgud.

Writing about Mr. Myers's performance in an evening of short works
directed by Mr. Brook in 2011, Charles McNulty of The Los Angeles Times
called him
\href{https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/04/theater-review-an-evening-of-peter-brook-at-the-broad-stage.html}{``a
human Stradivarius,''} with his ``lush caress of vowels and precise
choreography of consonants.''

Bruce Myers was born on April 12, 1942, in Radcliffe, a town north of
Manchester, England, to Maurice and Mitzi Myers. His father was a
solicitor, his mother a secretary in her husband's law firm. He attended
Trinity College, Dublin, and studied acting at the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Arts in London.

Mr. Myers met Mr. Brook in about 1970 and became one of the most
enduring members of the Paris-based International Center for Theater
Research, founded that year by Mr. Brook and the producer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/19/obituaries/micheline-rozan-dead.html}{Micheline
Rozan} to stage productions but also to examine the purpose of theater.
Mr. Myers toured the world, from cosmopolitan capitals to African
villages, with many of its most celebrated productions.

These included such signature Brook pieces as the nine-hour ``The
Mahabharata,'' based on the epic Hindu poem, in which he played the
deities Ganesha and Krishna; ``The Man Who\ldots{},'' inspired by a book
by the neurologist Oliver Sacks; and ``The Conference of the Birds,''
based on the 12th-century Persian poem.

Mr. Myers notably appeared in Shakespeare roles for the company,
including the misanthropic Alcibiades in ``Timon of Athens,'' the piece
with which Mr. Brook opened the renovated Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in
Paris in 1974; and as Polonius in a streamlined adaptation of
``Hamlet,'' seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2001.

In addition to his stage work, Mr. Myers appeared in films, including
Mr. Brook's screen adaptations of
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-va1S1cT1s4}{``The Mahabharata''}
and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfRZmNPHoE}{``Hamlet,''} and
had supporting roles in more mainstream movie fare like ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being'' and ``Henry and June.'' He also worked as a
director and conducted acting workshops throughout the world.

He is survived by his wife, Ivanka Polchenko, who confirmed the death;
two daughters, Lea and Samia, from his previous marriage, to the actress
Corinne Jaber; and three siblings.
