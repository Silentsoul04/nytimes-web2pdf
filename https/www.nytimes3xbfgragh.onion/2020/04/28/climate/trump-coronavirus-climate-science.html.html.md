WASHINGTON — At a March visit with doctors and researchers at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health agency at
the heart of the fight against the coronavirus, President Trump [spoke
words of
praise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-tour-centers-disease-control-prevention-atlanta-ga/)
for the scientific acumen in the building — particularly his own.

“Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’
Maybe I have a natural ability,” Mr. Trump said.

It was a striking boast, even amid a grave health crisis in which Mr.
Trump has repeatedly contradicted medical experts in favor of his own
judgment. But a disregard for scientific advice has been a [defining
characteristic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html)
of Mr. Trump’s administration.

As the nation confronts one of its worst public health disasters in
generations, a moment that demands a leader willing to marshal the full
might of the American scientific establishment, the White House is
occupied by a president whose administration, critics say, has
diminished the conclusions of scientists in formulating policy, who
personally harbors a suspicion of expert knowledge, and who often puts
his political instincts ahead of the facts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Donald Trump is the most anti-science and anti-environment president
we’ve ever had,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at
Rice University. The president’s actions, he said, have eroded one of
the United States’s most enviable assets: the government’s deep
scientific expertise, built over decades. “It’s extraordinarily crazy
and reckless,” he said.

Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Mr.
Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak “has put the full power
of the federal government to work to slow the spread, save lives, and
place this great country on a data-driven path to opening up again.”

Well before winning the presidency, Mr. Trump had publicly questioned
science by [expressing skepticism about
vaccines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/09/health/trump-vaccines.html)
and [suggesting climate change was a
hoax](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/)
fabricated by China.

Once in office, Mr. Trump’s administration quickly began work on one of
its most far-reaching policies — the systematic downplaying or ignoring
of science in order to weaken environmental health and global warming
regulations. Automakers, farmers and others had sought regulatory
relief, saying that more flexible rules would still ensure progress on
environmental protection while avoiding bureaucratic mandates. However,
in implementing the rollbacks, the administration has [marginalized key
scientists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/09/climate/trump-administration-science.html),
disbanded expert advisory boards and
[suppressed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/08/climate/rod-schoonover-testimony.html)
or
[altered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/climate/goks-uncertainty-language-interior.html)
findings that make clear the dangers of pollution and global warming.

More recently, as the coronavirus outbreak engulfed the nation, Mr.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

promoted the use of various drugs to fight the virus even as [scientists
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/health/nih-covid-19-treatment.html)
there was no proof they would be effective. On Thursday, he suggested
that [injecting
disinfectants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/sunlight-coronavirus-trump.html)
might help defeat Covid-19, drawing global condemnation and
ridicule.

And last week Mr. Trump publicly [downplayed a
warning](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/politics/fauci-testing-capacity-not-overly-confident/index.html)
by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the administration’s most visible medical expert,
that the United States still lacked adequate capacity to test for the
coronavirus. “I don’t agree with him on that, no,” Mr. Trump said. “I
think we’re doing a great job on testing.”

The president also suggested that the virus might be gone by the fall, a
line that [was immediately
countered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-fall.html)
by Dr. Fauci, who said: “We will have coronavirus in the fall. I am
convinced of that.”

Historians and foreign policy experts said the administration’s
disregard for scientific expertise — combined with the nation’s broader
retreat from international trade agreements and cross-border defense
alliances like NATO — is diminishing the nation’s status on the world
stage. “America’s friends feel like they don’t even recognize us,” said
Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy studies at the
American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization.

Other critics noted that Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw the United
States from the Paris Agreement, a 2015 pact among nations to combat
climate change, has left the world adrift on one of the biggest
challenges to face humanity. And now, amid a sweeping global pandemic,
Mr. Trump has said he will halt funding for the World Health
Organization.

Part of what elevated America after World War II, Dr. Schake said, was
that “we represented modernity in all its advantages,” whether by
creating a polio vaccine or landing a man on the moon. “It will be a
real struggle to restore the admiration for the United States that is
such an important part of our power in the world,” she said.

The administration faces immense challenges in navigating the
coronavirus outbreak. Shutdowns nationwide have already pushed 26
million people into unemployment. But health experts [have converged on
a broad
agreement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/upshot/coronavirus-four-benchmarks-reopening.html)
that sending people back to work too soon, before measures like a robust
testing system are in place, risks causing a surge of new infections,
deepening the crisis.

In many cases, the administration’s guidance broadly follows that
scientific understanding. But experts have also warned that Mr. Trump’s
[frequent exhortations to quickly reopen the
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/12/us/when-lockdown-ending-coronavirus.html)
threaten to muddle a vital public health message at a precarious
time.

“It’s precisely because we’re in this uncertain and perilous moment that
it’s all the more important to rely on the best scientific advice,” said
Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown
University.

Mr. Deere, the White House spokesman, said any suggestion that Mr. Trump
hasn’t consulted and relied upon health experts and scientific advisers
“is just false.” On Friday Mr. Trump announced a [phased
approach](https://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/1254904154977337345) to
reopening the economy that the White House said is “based on the advice
of public health experts.”

Past administrations have, to varying degrees, disregarded scientific
findings that conflicted with political or policy priorities. For
example, the Reagan administration was criticized by health experts for
being slow to respond to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. And in 2011,
President Barack Obama’s top health official overruled Food and Drug
Administration scientists who had found that over-the-counter emergency
contraceptives were safe for minors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But within the Trump administration, the [attacks on
science](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html)
and expertise have been far more broad.

“Scientists tell them inconvenient things,” said Jerry Taylor, president
of the Niskanen Center, a centrist research organization, and former
climate change denialist who now advocates for the acceptance of climate
science. “Whether we’re talking about the E.P.A. or we’re talking about
climate change broadly speaking, or we’re talking about the coronavirus,
his administration is constantly engaged in magical thinking.”

Critics of the administration’s actions both on environmental matters
and the virus say that federal policy has been shaped to favor
short-term economic gain at the expense of public health.

With much of the nation sheltering at home from the coronavirus —
bringing commerce to a halt, sending unemployment skyrocketing and
causing turmoil in the financial markets — the motivations to restart
the economy are powerful. But Mr. Taylor of the Niskanen Center said
that some conservatives were incorrectly diagnosing the stay-at-home
orders as the main driver of the nation’s woes rather than the virus
itself.

Mr. Taylor likened it to the argument that government action to fight
climate change would be too costly in various ways — an argument that
overlooks the [significant
costs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/19/climate/climate-disasters.html)
of inaction. “If we leave the underlying problem unattended,” he said,
“the economic cost will be far
greater.”

Meanwhile, the pandemic hasn’t slowed the administration’s environmental
rollbacks.

Over the past month the Environmental Protection Agency has issued
several deregulatory policies, including on [mercury
pollution](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/climate/epa-mercury-coal.html)
and [automobile
emissions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/climate/trump-fuel-economy.html),
overruling advice from the agency’s own independent advisory board that
such findings [lacked scientific
rigor](https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/MeetingCalBOARD/D87AC6491A9811C1852584CD006F3CC6?OpenDocument).
The E.P.A. also [refused to tighten air quality
standards](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/climate/coronavirus-soot-clean-air-regulations.html),
despite [preliminary
research](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html)
suggesting that long-term exposure to dirty air could exacerbate the
risk of death from the coronavirus.

The administration has maintained that it can safeguard health and the
environment while loosening restrictions on industry. Andrea Woods, a
spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said, “We have never ignored the science in
making the very tough policy decisions required of the agency.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The parallels between the administration’s environmental rollbacks and
its coronavirus response are not exact. When it comes to the coronavirus
outbreak, there is still an important counterweight to many of Mr.
Trump’s impulses, most notably Dr. Fauci. Asked last week if he felt
that experts at the National Institutes of Health were unable to speak
their minds or oppose Mr. Trump, Dr. Fauci was unequivocal. “Absolutely
no,” he said.

That stands in contrast to the administration’s approach on issues like
climate change, where officials who have spoken out have found
themselves sidelined.

In July, Rod Schoonover, a State Department intelligence analyst,
[resigned in
protest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/10/climate/rod-schoonover-resigns.html)
after the White House blocked his discussion of climate science in
Congressional testimony. In other instances, the administration has
[promoted climate denialists’
work](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/20/climate/climate-national-security-threat.html)
and [allowed them to insert misrepresentations of scientific
facts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/climate/goks-uncertainty-language-interior.html)
into federal
documents.

Still, there have been some prominent staff shake-ups at health
agencies.

Before the pandemic began, the C.D.C. [had reduced its staff in
Beijing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv/exclusive-u-s-slashed-cdc-staff-inside-china-prior-to-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN21C3N5)
from approximately 47 to 14 under the Trump administration, a move that
critics have said may have complicated its ability to confront the
outbreak earlier. An agency spokesman said it had been done to focus
more on “technical collaboration” with China, which requires fewer
people.

In February, Nancy Messonnier, a top C.D.C. official, was removed from
overseeing the agency’s coronavirus response. Dr. Messonnier [had
warned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
that Americans need to prepare for a “significant disruption” at a time
when Mr. Trump was insisting that the virus was “very well under control
in our country.”

Last week, Rick Bright [was
dismissed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/us/politics/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)
as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
Authority, the agency involved in work on coronavirus treatments. Mr.
Bright said he had been removed after urging caution in expanding access
to hydroxychloroquine, the controversial treatment embraced by Mr.
Trump. He also said the administration had put “politics and cronyism
ahead of science.”

Mr. Trump has said he “never heard” of Dr. Bright. Mr. Deere, the White
House spokesman, accused critics of waging a campaign “to criticize this
president for discussing anything that might provide hope to the
American people.”
