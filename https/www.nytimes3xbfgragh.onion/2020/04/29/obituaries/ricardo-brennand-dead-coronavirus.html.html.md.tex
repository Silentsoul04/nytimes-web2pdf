He amassed a vast trove of art and artifacts and built a castle-like
repository so the public could see it, partly because his family wasn't
happy with his collecting.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Ricardo Brennand's life as a collector started at age 12 with the gift
of a pocketknife from his father. He went on to amass thousands of
antique weapons, pieces of armor, clocks, keys, and a trove of art and
artifacts from Brazil's colonial era.

The pocketknife was still in the collection at his death, 80 years
later. Mr. Brennand died on April 25 at the Hospital Portugues in
Recife, the capital of Pernambuco State. The cause was complications of
Covid-19, a family spokeswoman, Sonia Lopes, said. He was 92.

An engineer by training, Mr. Brennand at one point owned more than 20
factories. They produced steel, glass, cement, ceramics and sugar,
making him one of the richest men in Brazil's poor northeast.

He designed and oversaw construction of the factories almost from
scratch. He often traveled abroad to learn the latest manufacturing
techniques and brought in foreign talent to help transform the region
--- whose economy for centuries relied on cheap labor and sugar cane ---
into an industrial hub.

Ricardo Coimbra de Almeida Brennand was born in Cabo Santo Agostinho, in
Pernambuco State, on May 27, 1927, to Antonio Luiz Brennand, an
industrial engineer, and Dulce Padilha Coimbra. He is survived by his
wife, Graca Maria; eight children; and a number of grandchildren.

He sold off many of his business interests in 1999 to build the Ricardo
Brennand Institute, a giant castle-like structure on the outskirts of
Recife designed to house his collection.

The sprawling institute contains Brazil's largest gathering of artifacts
relating to the period when northern Brazil belonged to the Dutch, who
were expelled by the Portuguese in 1654.

The institute houses a large collection of work by Frans Post, the
17th-century Dutch painter whose vivid canvases provided European
audiences with some of the first glimpses of the newly discovered lands
across the sea.

Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands attended the inauguration of the
institute's permanent exhibition, ``Frans Post and Dutch Brazil,'' in
2003. The museum has since become a popular tourist destination,
receiving more than three million visitors since opening, according to
the institute.

Mr. Brennand, in a 2017 television interview, said he had established
the museum as a gift to the public because his family didn't appreciate
his collecting.

``Unhappily, my wife has been left stunned by it. My children don't like
it because I spend so much on it, but what can I do?'' he said. ``It's
instinctual.''
