\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Soon after World War II began, some of Tadashi Tsufura's friends in
Parlier, Calif., turned against him. He was 11 when one classmate mocked
him for his Japanese heritage.

```Hey, you're a Jap, you're an enemy,' and I knocked a kid down,''
\href{https://www.tessaku.com/oral-histories//2017/03/15/tadashi-tsufura}{Mr.
Tsufura told Tessaku}, an oral history project about Japanese-Americans,
in 2017. ``The principal came and knocked \emph{me} down.''

Less than a year later, on his 12th birthday --- he, his parents and two
older brothers were forced by the United States to move to one of the
two \href{https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Gila_River/}{Gila River
internment camps}in a desert valley in Arizona, one family among about
120,000 people of Japanese ancestry interned during the war.

``It was an ego-destroying experience,'' he told The Daily News of New
York in 1966, ``and it is this that has made me determined to help
others to use their suffering as youths for constructive goals.''

Mr. Tsufura found his avenue to help youngsters as a teacher in New York
City public schools and one of the system's first Japanese-American
principals. (He once said he was the only Asian-American principal in
the United States.)

Mr. Tsufura died of the novel coronavirus on March 29 at Mount Sinai
Queens Hospital in Astoria, five days after his wife, Mabel (Murakami)
Tsufura, a home economics teacher, became
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html}{one
of 13 people to die of the disease}over a 24-hour period at Elmhurst
Hospital, said their daughter, Lisa Tsufura. He was 89.

He is also survived by another daughter, Eve Tsufura, and a grandson.

Mr. Tsufura was born on Sept. 17, 1930, in Los Angeles and moved to
Parlier, a farming community near Fresno, when he was about six. His
father, Shosetsu Tsufura, a Buddhist minister, and his mother, Midori
(Kamamoto) Tsufura, a teacher, were born in Japan.

He and his parents left the camp after two years and moved to Seabrook,
N.J., where an industrialist employed former internees in a vegetable
farming and packing business.

Mr. Tsufura fought in the Army on the front lines of the Korean War from
1951 to 1953. After his discharge, he earned a bachelor's degree in
chemical engineering from Fenn College (now Cleveland State University).

Unhappy as a chemical engineer, he left for New York City, where one of
his brothers lived. Learning of a teacher shortage in the public schools
in the early 1960s, he took education courses at Brooklyn College and
started a new career. He taught math in two Manhattan schools and was
named the principal of\href{https://www.ps41.org/}{P.S. 41 in Greenwich
Village,}where he stayed for eight years before becoming a deputy
superintendent of District 3 on the Upper West Side. He retired in 1988.

Nancy Tenenberg, a former student who is an acting teacher in
Pittsburgh, said by phone that Mr. Tsufura was more than just a great
algebra teacher. He had, Ms. Tenenberg said, ``a nose for the kids who
were on the fringe, like a `Good Will Hunting' thing, kids who needed an
adult.''
