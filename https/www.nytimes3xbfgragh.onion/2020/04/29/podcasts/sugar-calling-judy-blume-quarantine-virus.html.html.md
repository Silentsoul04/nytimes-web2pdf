  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Judy Blume. She taught me a lot about being
    a teenager and a young woman in her books, “Are You There God? It’s
    Me, Margaret,” “Deenie,” “Tiger Eyes,” “Forever.” Really, there’s
    such a long list. I could go on and on. In fact, I distinctly
    remember the exact shelf that her books occupied in Chaska Middle
    School. I visited often, checked out every single book on that shelf
    at least one, sometimes two or three times. I can’t think of anyone
    better to call when seeking wisdom at this really confusing moment
    in our lives, so I’m going to give her a call.

  - \[music\]

  - \[dial tone\]

  - judy blume  
    Hello?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, is this Judy?

  - judy blume  
    It is Judy.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, Judy. It’s Cheryl Strayed.

  - judy blume  
    Hi, Cheryl. How nice to talk to you.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh. I mean, honestly, Judy, in all of the dreams of my life as a
    writer, I never, ever, ever thought I would get to talk to you. I
    have loved you for so long, since I was a little child.

  - judy blume  
    Well, I’m so glad that I’m still here so we can do this.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m so glad you’re here too. We’ve made it this far, that I can
    finally reach you. So where are you?

  - judy blume  
    Well, we live in Key West, which is a lovely place to live. It’s
    summer all the time, and I’m a summer girl. And I’m here with my
    husband George, and we live in a old low-rise condo, and we’re on
    the second floor. And so we’re on the ocean with the birds, and it’s
    feeding time in the afternoon, and we get to watch all the changes.
    I know it’s good for me in normal time, so I’m assuming that it’s
    good for me in these times too. I love the sea. I love everything
    about it. I like to go to sleep at night listening to it, so I’m
    lucky.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So is it just the two of you? Have you been socially isolating for
    some time now?

  - judy blume  
    Since March 12.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Wow.

  - judy blume  
    So yes, it’s been a long time. The last day — I think that may be
    the last day we went to the bookstore. I know it was on a Thursday.
    And it’s so interesting, this role reversal with grown kids, and
    I’ve heard it from so many of my friends, but I know we’re not the
    only ones, where they call — they’re worried. It’s a very tender
    kind of worry, because I guess they think we’re old. \[LAUGHS\] I
    guess we are old, but we don’t see ourselves that way. We’re 82. We
    think of ourselves as young, but we’re not. And Larry called, and he
    said, you cannot be going to work at the bookstore with everybody
    coming into that store is a tourist from all over the place. You
    can’t do it anymore. And we looked at each other, George and I,
    and we knew he was right. We knew he was right. And of course, the
    store closed. But we did stop. That was our last day. And that’s
    been very hard, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh. And so you own a bookstore, right? It’s called Books & Books in
    Key West.

  - judy blume  
    Well, we started it. We don’t own it. It’s nonprofit. But we’re the
    founders. And it’s four years old, and it’s our baby. And going to
    work four days a week in the bookstore is like this huge joy for me.
    It’s my reward after 50 years of writing, which, for me, was enough.
    It’s not enough for everybody. But for me, 50 years was enough —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right.

  - \[laughter\]

  - judy blume  
    — I said, of being locked up in that little room, and here I’m right
    back. I’m right back living the way I lived when I was writing full
    time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. That’s so interesting you say that, because the other writers
    I’ve talked to are all saying, well, you know, it’s not as hard for
    me because, of course, as a writer, I have to socially isolate in
    order to get work done. And you’re, I guess, retired as a writer,
    and then you were happily —

  - judy blume  
    No, no, no. No, never say retired. I’ve never retired. No, no, no.

  - cheryl strayed  
    But you’re just not writing right now. Is that what you mean?

  - judy blume  
    I’m not writing right now. And I would have to be doing something.
    I’m a worker. I’m a worker bee. So having a bookstore to go to and
    run, and do all the things that one does in a bookstore, and I love
    them all. And I loved being allowed out after 50 years of not being
    allowed out. And now I’m back. But I know how to do this, because
    this is the way I lived. Except, except for the constant — or I
    should say, the coming and going of anxiety.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm-hm.

  - judy blume  
    You know, it’s just so different.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. So what are you anxious about, Judy?

  - judy blume  
    Oh. What am I anxious about?

  - cheryl strayed  
    \[LAUGHS\] Let’s make a list.

  - judy blume  
    I’m anxious about what’s happening around the world. I’m anxious
    about the virus. I’m anxious about what it’s doing. It’s just a very
    scary thing.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah.

  - judy blume  
    And maybe it is that the older you are, the more afraid you are.
    Maybe we’re not supposed to be afraid. I don’t know. But I’m a
    mixture of the anxiety but the optimist. I’m scared one minute, and
    then it’s like, oh, everything is going to be OK. Let’s dance. That
    will help me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And how do you make that shift? How do you go from that anxiety that
    you feel to, let’s dance, or to that sense of, it’s going to be OK?

  - judy blume  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    You know, I grew up with a wonderful father. I adored my father.
    Sadly, he died when he was 54, and I was just 21. And so we didn’t
    get to know each other as adults. But he was a philosopher. He was
    the guy who everyone came to with their problems. As I became a
    teenager, of course, I didn’t turn to him, because he was my father,
    and you know how that goes. You have to go someplace else.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Of course.

  - judy blume  
    But in our family, he was the youngest of seven children. Nobody
    lived to be 60. All of his siblings. So there was always another
    death, another shiva, which is — when a Jewish person dies, you call
    it sitting shiva, and people come and visit. That was going on all
    the time I was growing up. And he would always, when I was young,
    take me on his lap and say, life is for the living, and life goes
    on. Life will go on. And yeah, that’s true. Life goes on.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So you reach back for that sense of — to me, when he’s saying to
    you, life goes on even in the face of death, that to me is the
    ultimate lesson in essentially embracing that suffering exists, and
    that even in our joy, there is always a piece of sorrow.

  - judy blume  
    Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I find that to be a calming thing. That’s helped me shift from
    anxiety to calm, and sometimes all the way to let’s dance, if you
    put that on the continuum.

  - judy blume  
    \[LAUGHS\] Let’s dance is because moving around, moving — we go for
    morning walks. We have not given up our morning walk, thank
    goodness. We wear masks now, but we go for a two-mile walk every
    morning. And that is so, so important. And the physical activity for
    me — George is much more mellow, much more relaxed and cavalier
    personality. And he doesn’t worry, which is nice, but if — there’s
    always one — maybe there are couples where no one worries. But the
    couples I know have one who’s anxious and a worrier, and the other
    one who isn’t. Two worriers in one family would be too much.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I agree.

  - judy blume  
    Right? But it’s the one with all the imagination. He often will say
    to me, you have too much imagination. Well, if you’re a fiction
    writer, you can’t have too much imagination.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s right. It’s come in handy for you, I would say, Judy, that
    imagination.

  - judy blume  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    So many of those books that you’ve written, all of them, really,
    they always — I think one of the most important things that you and
    your books have contributed is really teaching children and
    teenagers about how important it is to have that sense of honesty
    and integrity, and to be sensitive to our own needs and desires and
    thoughts, and those of others as well. How was it that you came to
    write these books that were so much about openness, and honesty, and
    honoring our emotional lives?

  - judy blume  
    Yeah, but let’s just — I just have to tell you the truth here. I had
    no idea what I was doing. When I sat down to write books, I was in
    my very late 20s. Maybe I was 30 when “Margaret” was published. I
    had no idea what I was doing. And where does that stuff come from? I
    don’t know. I don’t understand it. I’ve given up trying to
    understand it. But it’s there when I write. And it may not be there
    when I have a conversation with you. It’s there somewhere deep
    inside, and it comes out when I’m writing. I just — I have a couple
    of things I wanted to share with you, but — and the other one is not
    from a book of mine, but this is so apropos of what we’re saying.
    “In the Unlikely Event,” when I was writing that — that’s my last
    novel, and it’s going to be my last novel. And it took five years,
    and it took a lot out of me. But it’s all based on a series of
    tragedies that happened in my hometown when I was 14. And although
    it’s not autobiographical in terms of the characters, it is very
    much, was a part of my life.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And it’s Elizabeth, New Jersey, is that right?

  - judy blume  
    Elizabeth, New Jersey, yeah. In, I can’t remember how many days,
    50-something days, we had three major airlines crash.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Into your town.

  - judy blume  
    Yeah, into our town. Into Elizabeth. I did not see any of it. I
    remember it very clearly. And the only thing that surprises me now,
    that, as a fiction writer, I never wrote about it for 40 years, I
    think. But anyway, there was just this one tiny little line in it
    that I remember after I wrote it, I said to myself, where did that
    come from? And how did you know that? Because it just came. And it’s
    the night after the first crash, when Miri, who is 15, is in bed
    with her single mom, Rusty, and neither one of them can sleep. And
    this is from Rusty’s point of view.
    
    “When Miri asked if she believed in God, what was she supposed to
    say? Of course I believe in God, she told her. But how could God let
    such a terrible thing happen? It’s not God’s job to decide what
    happens, Rusty said. It’s his job to help you get through it. Oh, if
    only she really believed that.”
    
    And that makes me cry, because I don’t know where that came from. I
    do remember after a series of tragedies in our family, my father,
    who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, but from the time he married my
    mother — I mean, she wasn’t, and so we weren’t. We were Jews, but we
    weren’t observant Jews in any way. But my father — I think it was
    very, very hard for him. This was when his — my 25-year-old cousin
    was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and she had a two-year-old
    baby. And on the night that the doctors told her parents this, my
    father’s last surviving sibling, who was her father, died on the
    spot in the hospital. And then a few months later, Elsie, my cousin,
    died. And my father was sitting on the stairs, and I was sitting
    with him. And he said, you know, I just can’t believe anymore. I
    just think I have lost my belief in God. It’s not there anymore.
    I’ve lost it. And you know what? A few months later, my father
    died very quickly and suddenly, and I was with him. And all of this
    was tough. Very tough. And I wasn’t writing then, of course. So you
    ask, how do you get through things? And after I became a writer,
    that’s how I got through things.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, writing became your healing.

  - judy blume  
    Well, yeah, it did.

  - cheryl strayed  
    But back there, when your father said, I don’t believe in God, and
    then he died, you were a young woman. How old were you when he died?
    21?

  - judy blume  
    21\. I was about to get married, believe it or not. The invitations
    were out to the wedding. Way too young, but we did that then. You
    know.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm-hm. Yeah. I did that too. Too young.

  - judy blume  
    Too young.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How did you find your way through that darkness?

  - judy blume  
    That was very dark.
    
    That was very dark. I think I — I don’t know, because I had no one
    to talk to. My mother never spoke about that day. Never. My father
    was the nurturing parent, and the one you could go to, and the one
    who would help you through things. And my mother just couldn’t do
    anything like that. And she didn’t want us to show anything in
    public. And that’s hard.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s incredibly, and I think too — you know obviously, it sounds
    like there was this personality difference between your mother and
    father. But I would say that your mother’s values around loss and
    grief — saying, don’t show it in public, let’s not speak of it again
    — is very much aligned with the times and the ways that we used to
    think about grief and loss. And I guess that’s what I was trying to
    drive at when I was so struck by how brave you were as a writer to
    decide to break those codes of silence about subjects that are
    difficult. Grief, divorce, sexuality, masturbation, racism. All of
    these things that I was so drawn to, like many others, because you
    were speaking honestly with this deep emotional intelligence and
    compassion about things that we’re many times told, do not speak of
    these things.
    
    Did it come alive on the page, and in your real life, you didn’t —
    did you obey your mother when she said, don’t speak of it?

  - judy blume  
    Well, I mean, what was I going to do? My mother wasn’t going to talk
    to me. One time I went into her room, and she was crying. And I felt
    that, oh my god, I’ve invaded her privacy. And I felt terrible.
    Terrible. And so I left, instead of going and sitting down and
    crying. I knew that she just couldn’t do that. And I felt, I think,
    kind of abandoned then. I felt — and maybe that’s where it came out,
    in the writing. Because it was there. It was there, inside me. And
    that was the way I let it out. But none of what you said just now
    was deliberate. When I look back, I think, oh, for a fearful person
    — or I was a very fearful child, an anxious child with eczema and
    other anxiety-caused problems —
    
    I was courageous in my writing. I was brave in my writing, if not in
    my life.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm. And then it sounds like you became braver over time.

  - judy blume  
    Yeah, I think so. I certainly hope so. Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s like —

  - judy blume  
    You know what, I’m a doer. I like to take action. So when I had
    breast cancer, I was told I had breast cancer. OK. OK. Let’s get
    this thing done. Let’s get this taken care of. And I do my research,
    and I call people, and then I did it. That was it. Let’s just do
    this. And I think what’s so difficult this time is, there’s no
    action that I can take. I can’t control this coronavirus all over
    the world. There’s nothing I can do. I can vote, but there’s really
    nothing much that I can do. Which is kind of why I’m talking to you.
    \[LAUGHS\] I feel like this is something I can do. This is something
    I can do. It may never help anybody, but I can get this out, and
    it’s not just sitting here and doing nothing.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I actually think you’re doing a lot, Judy, in the form of all those
    books that you’ve written. Think of all the teenagers right now who
    are reading those words that you wrote so long ago, and feeling
    consoled by them during what is probably an incredibly hard time for
    them. I have two teenagers myself, and I know mine are challenged by
    having to be socially distant from their friends during this time
    when they really are wanting more and more independence. And my
    husband and I have gotten used to giving them independence. They get
    to roam the neighborhood or the city, and now suddenly, we’re
    saying, nope. It’s like you’re little kids again. You have to stay
    with us at our side. If not at our side, it’s certainly in our
    house. And that’s been rather tricky. My joke is that my teenagers
    have been socially distancing from my husband and me for some time
    now.

  - judy blume  
    Which is what teenagers are supposed to do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Exactly. Developmentally, that’s their job. And now, what we have to
    say to them is, you have to be here with us all the time. And it’s
    hard. And so I’m asking, do you have maybe some wisdom to share with
    them? Um, and also to share with the parents. How do we do a good
    job at this? How do we respect those boundaries while also obeying
    the rules of social isolation?

  - judy blume  
    Oh, it’s a very hard — I mean, I wish I had answers for you. One
    thing I’m sharing with parents who have kids, teenage kids, is — or
    I would say this directly to the kids. Acknowledge your feelings.
    And you don’t have to discuss it with your parents either. Write it
    down. What I always did through the hardest times of my adult life —
    I just got rid of all these books a year or two ago when I moved. I
    probably shouldn’t have, but I did. I had notebooks. They weren’t
    fancy, they were nothing, but they were whatever was around at the
    time. And through the hardest times — I never wrote about the happy
    times, but through the hardest times, I would just write things
    down, not fancy. Just — I’m a doodler. So even with doodles, I would
    write the word “annoyed,” and I would doodle all around it. Angry,
    sad, lost, lonely, wishing, missing. All the things that they may be
    feeling. Jot it down. If you can draw it, even better. I never
    could, but I decorated words with my doodles. Because someday when
    this ends, and it will end, then they will have this so that they
    can remember. And they never have to share it. I think that’s the
    most important thing. It’s theirs. It’s private. It’s off limits.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. You know, I just want to pause and say, wait a minute, did you
    — when you say you got rid of your notebooks, did you donate them to
    the library that’s keeping your papers?

  - judy blume  
    Oh, no. No, no, no —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Judy\!

  - judy blume  
    — no, no, no. They —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, come on.

  - judy blume  
    No\! No, this was stuff so private. I mean, my papers went, but
    these notebooks were shredded. Yes, under my supervision, shredded.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Judy.

  - judy blume  
    I read them, I saved them. Every year, I took them out. And then I
    thought, you know, I don’t want to die with these notebooks out
    there. I don’t want anyone I love — my kids, my husband — I don’t
    want them to read this. Because this was for me.
    
    While some of it may have been about them, this release was for me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right.

  - judy blume  
    And then I didn’t need it anymore. And I didn’t feel that it
    belonged out there in the world either, because this was who I was
    at a moment in time. Just like this is who your kids are right now.
    And they may not need to do this, because again, they have friends
    that they’re sharing with. I don’t know. Are they sharing their most
    intimate, dark feelings? Do they want to do that? Then they do that
    for themselves. I never did that when I was growing up. I had a best
    friend. And we are still best friends, god knows how many years
    later.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s so nice.

  - judy blume  
    12 to 82. It’s a lot of years. And we talk about that now, how we
    loved each other, we enjoyed each other’s company so much.
    Everything was perfect just being together. But we never really told
    each other what was deep, deep inside. Never. Never shared that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Why do you think you didn’t?

  - judy blume  
    Why. I don’t know. Was it the times? Are kids more able to do that
    now?

  - cheryl strayed  
    You know, I don’t know. I had that same experience when I got back
    in touch with some of my high school friends, maybe a decade or so
    ago. And some of my best, best friends. And it was only then that we
    shared difficult things. That I shared that my father had physically
    abused my mother, for example. Or shared the economic hardship. I
    grew up in poverty, and how stressful that was for me, and how hard
    I worked as a teenager to conceal that. And all of that — here we
    were, dear friends, and all of that, I was trying to make it
    invisible. And I think that for me, my theory is that it’s just too
    painful. It’s too painful, and so much about being a teenager, as
    you well know, that you’ve written about again and again, is just
    wanting everyone to think that you’re normal. And we all have this
    bizarre idea of what normal is, and so we do everything we can to
    pretend to be that way. And what your books always reveal is, none
    of us are normal. We’re all our original selves. And that’s really
    the most beautiful face we can show the world, but it’s really hard
    to do that when you’re a teenager. And I think it’s hard for my kids
    too. My son — I think especially maybe in this case for boys,
    because I asked them that same question. I think my daughter does
    talk to her friends, at least to some degree, about her struggles.
    But my son has said, mom, we just don’t operate that way. What he
    wants to do is go skateboarding with his friends. And they speak
    with a kind of body language that’s not about words so much.

  - judy blume  
    There’s a little — I mean, there is a male-female thing there too.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, yeah.

  - judy blume  
    I mean, that’s like George. But — oh, Cheryl, can I read you
    something that I absolutely adore?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yes, please do.

  - judy blume  
    And this is not mine. This is something I just love. It’s from Maira
    Kalman. Do you know who she is?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I do.

  - judy blume  
    She is my favorite Illustrator. And oh my gosh, I wish I could show
    you the glorious illustrations that are in this book. And the book
    is called “Beloved Dog.” And for some reason, I come to it again and
    again and again. And her words are simple, yet not simple. So this
    is it, OK?

  - cheryl strayed  
    OK.

  - judy blume  
    “When I go out for a walk, there’s so much I see that makes me happy
    to be alive — breathing, not thinking, observing. I am grateful
    beyond measure to be a part of it all. There are people, of course,
    heroic and heartbreaking, going about their business in splendid
    fashion. There are trees, glorious and consoling, changing with the
    seasons, reminders that all things change and change again. There
    are flowers, birds, babies, buildings. I love all these things. But
    above all, I am besotted by dogs. They are constant reminders that
    life reveals the best of itself when we live fully in the moment and
    extend our unconditional love. And it is very true that the most
    tender, uncomplicated, most generous part of our being blossoms
    without any effort when it comes to the love of a dog.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm. Wow. That is so beautiful, Judy.

  - judy blume  
    I have one fantasy left as a professional, as a writer. My one
    fantasy is that I would love to collaborate with Maira Kalman. I
    just think she is brilliant and wonderful. And now you have to ask
    me, do I have a dog?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Do you have a dog, since you read that?

  - judy blume  
    No.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Why did you choose that passage?

  - judy blume  
    I don’t have a dog. And I love that in this book, she tells us that
    she was terrified of dogs because her mother and grandmother, I
    think, said, be careful, they’ll lunge for your neck and bite your
    head off, something like that. And my mother was terrified of dogs,
    so I didn’t grow up with a dog. But then my son got a dog. And I
    fell in love with this dog. I called Lukie my granddog. And I
    learned what it is about loving a dog. It was just so unconditional
    and satisfying, and very, very sad when Lukie died. She was 16. And
    I always thought that Larry would get another dog, but he never has.
    And of course, I watch them here in Key West, and I just love
    watching them. But I don’t have my own dog.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, why don’t you get one, Judy?

  - judy blume  
    Because George says, you have me, Judy. If you don’t have me, you
    should definitely get a dog. But as long as you have me, you’re OK.
    You don’t need a dog.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’ll just say — I don’t have a vote in this, so I can express my
    opinion. I have two dogs and a husband. And trust me, the things
    that the dogs give me are very different than the things my husband
    gives me.

  - judy blume  
    Oh, I know. I know. But I agree with him that we are probably so
    different that we should not try to have a dog together. And you
    know, this is not just, of course, about the love of a dog. This
    also could be the love for a friend, or the love for a family
    member. It just seems to me to be a lovely piece. I just like
    opening this book and reading.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, and to me, it seems to be about the pleasure we take in the
    small things. The way that we find beauty or wonder in every day.
    Are you finding wonder and beauty every day in the midst of these
    difficult times?

  - judy blume  
    I think it’s hard. I do love when we go out walking. I don’t know if
    you know this about Key West, but chickens roam freely in Key West,
    and they’re protected. And I don’t always love the chickens, but
    this time of year, with their little babies walking behind them,
    that’s wonder right there. You know, the world goes on. This
    terrible thing is happening, but the world goes on.

  - cheryl strayed  
    There will always be little yellow baby birds, no matter what.

  - \[laughter\]

  - judy blume  
    I guess so. I hope so.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I do too. So Judy, it’s been wonderful to speak to you, and thank
    you so much for sharing yourself with me.

  - judy blume  
    Thank you. OK. Stay well.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye bye, hon.

  - judy blume  
    Bye.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Today, I’m going to call Judy Blume. She taught me a lot about being
    a teenager and a young woman in her books, “Are You There God? It’s
    Me, Margaret,” “Deenie,” “Tiger Eyes,” “Forever.” Really, there’s
    such a long list. I could go on and on. In fact, I distinctly
    remember the exact shelf that her books occupied in Chaska Middle
    School. I visited often, checked out every single book on that shelf
    at least one, sometimes two or three times. I can’t think of anyone
    better to call when seeking wisdom at this really confusing moment
    in our lives, so I’m going to give her a call.

  - \[music\]

  - \[dial tone\]

  - judy blume  
    Hello?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, is this Judy?

  - judy blume  
    It is Judy.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Hi, Judy. It’s Cheryl Strayed.

  - judy blume  
    Hi, Cheryl. How nice to talk to you.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh. I mean, honestly, Judy, in all of the dreams of my life as a
    writer, I never, ever, ever thought I would get to talk to you. I
    have loved you for so long, since I was a little child.

  - judy blume  
    Well, I’m so glad that I’m still here so we can do this.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’m so glad you’re here too. We’ve made it this far, that I can
    finally reach you. So where are you?

  - judy blume  
    Well, we live in Key West, which is a lovely place to live. It’s
    summer all the time, and I’m a summer girl. And I’m here with my
    husband George, and we live in a old low-rise condo, and we’re on
    the second floor. And so we’re on the ocean with the birds, and it’s
    feeding time in the afternoon, and we get to watch all the changes.
    I know it’s good for me in normal time, so I’m assuming that it’s
    good for me in these times too. I love the sea. I love everything
    about it. I like to go to sleep at night listening to it, so I’m
    lucky.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So is it just the two of you? Have you been socially isolating for
    some time now?

  - judy blume  
    Since March 12.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Wow.

  - judy blume  
    So yes, it’s been a long time. The last day — I think that may be
    the last day we went to the bookstore. I know it was on a Thursday.
    And it’s so interesting, this role reversal with grown kids, and
    I’ve heard it from so many of my friends, but I know we’re not the
    only ones, where they call — they’re worried. It’s a very tender
    kind of worry, because I guess they think we’re old. \[LAUGHS\] I
    guess we are old, but we don’t see ourselves that way. We’re 82. We
    think of ourselves as young, but we’re not. And Larry called, and he
    said, you cannot be going to work at the bookstore with everybody
    coming into that store is a tourist from all over the place. You
    can’t do it anymore. And we looked at each other, George and I,
    and we knew he was right. We knew he was right. And of course, the
    store closed. But we did stop. That was our last day. And that’s
    been very hard, Cheryl.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh. And so you own a bookstore, right? It’s called Books & Books in
    Key West.

  - judy blume  
    Well, we started it. We don’t own it. It’s nonprofit. But we’re the
    founders. And it’s four years old, and it’s our baby. And going to
    work four days a week in the bookstore is like this huge joy for me.
    It’s my reward after 50 years of writing, which, for me, was enough.
    It’s not enough for everybody. But for me, 50 years was enough —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right.

  - \[laughter\]

  - judy blume  
    — I said, of being locked up in that little room, and here I’m right
    back. I’m right back living the way I lived when I was writing full
    time.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. That’s so interesting you say that, because the other writers
    I’ve talked to are all saying, well, you know, it’s not as hard for
    me because, of course, as a writer, I have to socially isolate in
    order to get work done. And you’re, I guess, retired as a writer,
    and then you were happily —

  - judy blume  
    No, no, no. No, never say retired. I’ve never retired. No, no, no.

  - cheryl strayed  
    But you’re just not writing right now. Is that what you mean?

  - judy blume  
    I’m not writing right now. And I would have to be doing something.
    I’m a worker. I’m a worker bee. So having a bookstore to go to and
    run, and do all the things that one does in a bookstore, and I love
    them all. And I loved being allowed out after 50 years of not being
    allowed out. And now I’m back. But I know how to do this, because
    this is the way I lived. Except, except for the constant — or I
    should say, the coming and going of anxiety.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm-hm.

  - judy blume  
    You know, it’s just so different.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. So what are you anxious about, Judy?

  - judy blume  
    Oh. What am I anxious about?

  - cheryl strayed  
    \[LAUGHS\] Let’s make a list.

  - judy blume  
    I’m anxious about what’s happening around the world. I’m anxious
    about the virus. I’m anxious about what it’s doing. It’s just a very
    scary thing.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah.

  - judy blume  
    And maybe it is that the older you are, the more afraid you are.
    Maybe we’re not supposed to be afraid. I don’t know. But I’m a
    mixture of the anxiety but the optimist. I’m scared one minute, and
    then it’s like, oh, everything is going to be OK. Let’s dance. That
    will help me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    And how do you make that shift? How do you go from that anxiety that
    you feel to, let’s dance, or to that sense of, it’s going to be OK?

  - judy blume  
    \[LAUGHS\]
    
    You know, I grew up with a wonderful father. I adored my father.
    Sadly, he died when he was 54, and I was just 21. And so we didn’t
    get to know each other as adults. But he was a philosopher. He was
    the guy who everyone came to with their problems. As I became a
    teenager, of course, I didn’t turn to him, because he was my father,
    and you know how that goes. You have to go someplace else.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. Of course.

  - judy blume  
    But in our family, he was the youngest of seven children. Nobody
    lived to be 60. All of his siblings. So there was always another
    death, another shiva, which is — when a Jewish person dies, you call
    it sitting shiva, and people come and visit. That was going on all
    the time I was growing up. And he would always, when I was young,
    take me on his lap and say, life is for the living, and life goes
    on. Life will go on. And yeah, that’s true. Life goes on.

  - cheryl strayed  
    So you reach back for that sense of — to me, when he’s saying to
    you, life goes on even in the face of death, that to me is the
    ultimate lesson in essentially embracing that suffering exists, and
    that even in our joy, there is always a piece of sorrow.

  - judy blume  
    Yes.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I find that to be a calming thing. That’s helped me shift from
    anxiety to calm, and sometimes all the way to let’s dance, if you
    put that on the continuum.

  - judy blume  
    \[LAUGHS\] Let’s dance is because moving around, moving — we go for
    morning walks. We have not given up our morning walk, thank
    goodness. We wear masks now, but we go for a two-mile walk every
    morning. And that is so, so important. And the physical activity for
    me — George is much more mellow, much more relaxed and cavalier
    personality. And he doesn’t worry, which is nice, but if — there’s
    always one — maybe there are couples where no one worries. But the
    couples I know have one who’s anxious and a worrier, and the other
    one who isn’t. Two worriers in one family would be too much.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I agree.

  - judy blume  
    Right? But it’s the one with all the imagination. He often will say
    to me, you have too much imagination. Well, if you’re a fiction
    writer, you can’t have too much imagination.

  - cheryl strayed  
    That’s right. It’s come in handy for you, I would say, Judy, that
    imagination.

  - judy blume  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - cheryl strayed  
    So many of those books that you’ve written, all of them, really,
    they always — I think one of the most important things that you and
    your books have contributed is really teaching children and
    teenagers about how important it is to have that sense of honesty
    and integrity, and to be sensitive to our own needs and desires and
    thoughts, and those of others as well. How was it that you came to
    write these books that were so much about openness, and honesty, and
    honoring our emotional lives?

  - judy blume  
    Yeah, but let’s just — I just have to tell you the truth here. I had
    no idea what I was doing. When I sat down to write books, I was in
    my very late 20s. Maybe I was 30 when “Margaret” was published. I
    had no idea what I was doing. And where does that stuff come from? I
    don’t know. I don’t understand it. I’ve given up trying to
    understand it. But it’s there when I write. And it may not be there
    when I have a conversation with you. It’s there somewhere deep
    inside, and it comes out when I’m writing. I just — I have a couple
    of things I wanted to share with you, but — and the other one is not
    from a book of mine, but this is so apropos of what we’re saying.
    “In the Unlikely Event,” when I was writing that — that’s my last
    novel, and it’s going to be my last novel. And it took five years,
    and it took a lot out of me. But it’s all based on a series of
    tragedies that happened in my hometown when I was 14. And although
    it’s not autobiographical in terms of the characters, it is very
    much, was a part of my life.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right. And it’s Elizabeth, New Jersey, is that right?

  - judy blume  
    Elizabeth, New Jersey, yeah. In, I can’t remember how many days,
    50-something days, we had three major airlines crash.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Into your town.

  - judy blume  
    Yeah, into our town. Into Elizabeth. I did not see any of it. I
    remember it very clearly. And the only thing that surprises me now,
    that, as a fiction writer, I never wrote about it for 40 years, I
    think. But anyway, there was just this one tiny little line in it
    that I remember after I wrote it, I said to myself, where did that
    come from? And how did you know that? Because it just came. And it’s
    the night after the first crash, when Miri, who is 15, is in bed
    with her single mom, Rusty, and neither one of them can sleep. And
    this is from Rusty’s point of view.
    
    “When Miri asked if she believed in God, what was she supposed to
    say? Of course I believe in God, she told her. But how could God let
    such a terrible thing happen? It’s not God’s job to decide what
    happens, Rusty said. It’s his job to help you get through it. Oh, if
    only she really believed that.”
    
    And that makes me cry, because I don’t know where that came from. I
    do remember after a series of tragedies in our family, my father,
    who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, but from the time he married my
    mother — I mean, she wasn’t, and so we weren’t. We were Jews, but we
    weren’t observant Jews in any way. But my father — I think it was
    very, very hard for him. This was when his — my 25-year-old cousin
    was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and she had a two-year-old
    baby. And on the night that the doctors told her parents this, my
    father’s last surviving sibling, who was her father, died on the
    spot in the hospital. And then a few months later, Elsie, my cousin,
    died. And my father was sitting on the stairs, and I was sitting
    with him. And he said, you know, I just can’t believe anymore. I
    just think I have lost my belief in God. It’s not there anymore.
    I’ve lost it. And you know what? A few months later, my father
    died very quickly and suddenly, and I was with him. And all of this
    was tough. Very tough. And I wasn’t writing then, of course. So you
    ask, how do you get through things? And after I became a writer,
    that’s how I got through things.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, writing became your healing.

  - judy blume  
    Well, yeah, it did.

  - cheryl strayed  
    But back there, when your father said, I don’t believe in God, and
    then he died, you were a young woman. How old were you when he died?
    21?

  - judy blume  
    21\. I was about to get married, believe it or not. The invitations
    were out to the wedding. Way too young, but we did that then. You
    know.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm-hm. Yeah. I did that too. Too young.

  - judy blume  
    Too young.

  - cheryl strayed  
    How did you find your way through that darkness?

  - judy blume  
    That was very dark.
    
    That was very dark. I think I — I don’t know, because I had no one
    to talk to. My mother never spoke about that day. Never. My father
    was the nurturing parent, and the one you could go to, and the one
    who would help you through things. And my mother just couldn’t do
    anything like that. And she didn’t want us to show anything in
    public. And that’s hard.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s incredibly, and I think too — you know obviously, it sounds
    like there was this personality difference between your mother and
    father. But I would say that your mother’s values around loss and
    grief — saying, don’t show it in public, let’s not speak of it again
    — is very much aligned with the times and the ways that we used to
    think about grief and loss. And I guess that’s what I was trying to
    drive at when I was so struck by how brave you were as a writer to
    decide to break those codes of silence about subjects that are
    difficult. Grief, divorce, sexuality, masturbation, racism. All of
    these things that I was so drawn to, like many others, because you
    were speaking honestly with this deep emotional intelligence and
    compassion about things that we’re many times told, do not speak of
    these things.
    
    Did it come alive on the page, and in your real life, you didn’t —
    did you obey your mother when she said, don’t speak of it?

  - judy blume  
    Well, I mean, what was I going to do? My mother wasn’t going to talk
    to me. One time I went into her room, and she was crying. And I felt
    that, oh my god, I’ve invaded her privacy. And I felt terrible.
    Terrible. And so I left, instead of going and sitting down and
    crying. I knew that she just couldn’t do that. And I felt, I think,
    kind of abandoned then. I felt — and maybe that’s where it came out,
    in the writing. Because it was there. It was there, inside me. And
    that was the way I let it out. But none of what you said just now
    was deliberate. When I look back, I think, oh, for a fearful person
    — or I was a very fearful child, an anxious child with eczema and
    other anxiety-caused problems —
    
    I was courageous in my writing. I was brave in my writing, if not in
    my life.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm. And then it sounds like you became braver over time.

  - judy blume  
    Yeah, I think so. I certainly hope so. Yeah.

  - cheryl strayed  
    It’s like —

  - judy blume  
    You know what, I’m a doer. I like to take action. So when I had
    breast cancer, I was told I had breast cancer. OK. OK. Let’s get
    this thing done. Let’s get this taken care of. And I do my research,
    and I call people, and then I did it. That was it. Let’s just do
    this. And I think what’s so difficult this time is, there’s no
    action that I can take. I can’t control this coronavirus all over
    the world. There’s nothing I can do. I can vote, but there’s really
    nothing much that I can do. Which is kind of why I’m talking to you.
    \[LAUGHS\] I feel like this is something I can do. This is something
    I can do. It may never help anybody, but I can get this out, and
    it’s not just sitting here and doing nothing.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I actually think you’re doing a lot, Judy, in the form of all those
    books that you’ve written. Think of all the teenagers right now who
    are reading those words that you wrote so long ago, and feeling
    consoled by them during what is probably an incredibly hard time for
    them. I have two teenagers myself, and I know mine are challenged by
    having to be socially distant from their friends during this time
    when they really are wanting more and more independence. And my
    husband and I have gotten used to giving them independence. They get
    to roam the neighborhood or the city, and now suddenly, we’re
    saying, nope. It’s like you’re little kids again. You have to stay
    with us at our side. If not at our side, it’s certainly in our
    house. And that’s been rather tricky. My joke is that my teenagers
    have been socially distancing from my husband and me for some time
    now.

  - judy blume  
    Which is what teenagers are supposed to do.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Exactly. Developmentally, that’s their job. And now, what we have to
    say to them is, you have to be here with us all the time. And it’s
    hard. And so I’m asking, do you have maybe some wisdom to share with
    them? Um, and also to share with the parents. How do we do a good
    job at this? How do we respect those boundaries while also obeying
    the rules of social isolation?

  - judy blume  
    Oh, it’s a very hard — I mean, I wish I had answers for you. One
    thing I’m sharing with parents who have kids, teenage kids, is — or
    I would say this directly to the kids. Acknowledge your feelings.
    And you don’t have to discuss it with your parents either. Write it
    down. What I always did through the hardest times of my adult life —
    I just got rid of all these books a year or two ago when I moved. I
    probably shouldn’t have, but I did. I had notebooks. They weren’t
    fancy, they were nothing, but they were whatever was around at the
    time. And through the hardest times — I never wrote about the happy
    times, but through the hardest times, I would just write things
    down, not fancy. Just — I’m a doodler. So even with doodles, I would
    write the word “annoyed,” and I would doodle all around it. Angry,
    sad, lost, lonely, wishing, missing. All the things that they may be
    feeling. Jot it down. If you can draw it, even better. I never
    could, but I decorated words with my doodles. Because someday when
    this ends, and it will end, then they will have this so that they
    can remember. And they never have to share it. I think that’s the
    most important thing. It’s theirs. It’s private. It’s off limits.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah. You know, I just want to pause and say, wait a minute, did you
    — when you say you got rid of your notebooks, did you donate them to
    the library that’s keeping your papers?

  - judy blume  
    Oh, no. No, no, no —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Judy\!

  - judy blume  
    — no, no, no. They —

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, come on.

  - judy blume  
    No\! No, this was stuff so private. I mean, my papers went, but
    these notebooks were shredded. Yes, under my supervision, shredded.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, Judy.

  - judy blume  
    I read them, I saved them. Every year, I took them out. And then I
    thought, you know, I don’t want to die with these notebooks out
    there. I don’t want anyone I love — my kids, my husband — I don’t
    want them to read this. Because this was for me.
    
    While some of it may have been about them, this release was for me.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Right.

  - judy blume  
    And then I didn’t need it anymore. And I didn’t feel that it
    belonged out there in the world either, because this was who I was
    at a moment in time. Just like this is who your kids are right now.
    And they may not need to do this, because again, they have friends
    that they’re sharing with. I don’t know. Are they sharing their most
    intimate, dark feelings? Do they want to do that? Then they do that
    for themselves. I never did that when I was growing up. I had a best
    friend. And we are still best friends, god knows how many years
    later.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Oh, that’s so nice.

  - judy blume  
    12 to 82. It’s a lot of years. And we talk about that now, how we
    loved each other, we enjoyed each other’s company so much.
    Everything was perfect just being together. But we never really told
    each other what was deep, deep inside. Never. Never shared that.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Why do you think you didn’t?

  - judy blume  
    Why. I don’t know. Was it the times? Are kids more able to do that
    now?

  - cheryl strayed  
    You know, I don’t know. I had that same experience when I got back
    in touch with some of my high school friends, maybe a decade or so
    ago. And some of my best, best friends. And it was only then that we
    shared difficult things. That I shared that my father had physically
    abused my mother, for example. Or shared the economic hardship. I
    grew up in poverty, and how stressful that was for me, and how hard
    I worked as a teenager to conceal that. And all of that — here we
    were, dear friends, and all of that, I was trying to make it
    invisible. And I think that for me, my theory is that it’s just too
    painful. It’s too painful, and so much about being a teenager, as
    you well know, that you’ve written about again and again, is just
    wanting everyone to think that you’re normal. And we all have this
    bizarre idea of what normal is, and so we do everything we can to
    pretend to be that way. And what your books always reveal is, none
    of us are normal. We’re all our original selves. And that’s really
    the most beautiful face we can show the world, but it’s really hard
    to do that when you’re a teenager. And I think it’s hard for my kids
    too. My son — I think especially maybe in this case for boys,
    because I asked them that same question. I think my daughter does
    talk to her friends, at least to some degree, about her struggles.
    But my son has said, mom, we just don’t operate that way. What he
    wants to do is go skateboarding with his friends. And they speak
    with a kind of body language that’s not about words so much.

  - judy blume  
    There’s a little — I mean, there is a male-female thing there too.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yeah, yeah.

  - judy blume  
    I mean, that’s like George. But — oh, Cheryl, can I read you
    something that I absolutely adore?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Yes, please do.

  - judy blume  
    And this is not mine. This is something I just love. It’s from Maira
    Kalman. Do you know who she is?

  - cheryl strayed  
    I do.

  - judy blume  
    She is my favorite Illustrator. And oh my gosh, I wish I could show
    you the glorious illustrations that are in this book. And the book
    is called “Beloved Dog.” And for some reason, I come to it again and
    again and again. And her words are simple, yet not simple. So this
    is it, OK?

  - cheryl strayed  
    OK.

  - judy blume  
    “When I go out for a walk, there’s so much I see that makes me happy
    to be alive — breathing, not thinking, observing. I am grateful
    beyond measure to be a part of it all. There are people, of course,
    heroic and heartbreaking, going about their business in splendid
    fashion. There are trees, glorious and consoling, changing with the
    seasons, reminders that all things change and change again. There
    are flowers, birds, babies, buildings. I love all these things. But
    above all, I am besotted by dogs. They are constant reminders that
    life reveals the best of itself when we live fully in the moment and
    extend our unconditional love. And it is very true that the most
    tender, uncomplicated, most generous part of our being blossoms
    without any effort when it comes to the love of a dog.”

  - cheryl strayed  
    Mm. Wow. That is so beautiful, Judy.

  - judy blume  
    I have one fantasy left as a professional, as a writer. My one
    fantasy is that I would love to collaborate with Maira Kalman. I
    just think she is brilliant and wonderful. And now you have to ask
    me, do I have a dog?

  - cheryl strayed  
    Do you have a dog, since you read that?

  - judy blume  
    No.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Why did you choose that passage?

  - judy blume  
    I don’t have a dog. And I love that in this book, she tells us that
    she was terrified of dogs because her mother and grandmother, I
    think, said, be careful, they’ll lunge for your neck and bite your
    head off, something like that. And my mother was terrified of dogs,
    so I didn’t grow up with a dog. But then my son got a dog. And I
    fell in love with this dog. I called Lukie my granddog. And I
    learned what it is about loving a dog. It was just so unconditional
    and satisfying, and very, very sad when Lukie died. She was 16. And
    I always thought that Larry would get another dog, but he never has.
    And of course, I watch them here in Key West, and I just love
    watching them. But I don’t have my own dog.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, why don’t you get one, Judy?

  - judy blume  
    Because George says, you have me, Judy. If you don’t have me, you
    should definitely get a dog. But as long as you have me, you’re OK.
    You don’t need a dog.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I’ll just say — I don’t have a vote in this, so I can express my
    opinion. I have two dogs and a husband. And trust me, the things
    that the dogs give me are very different than the things my husband
    gives me.

  - judy blume  
    Oh, I know. I know. But I agree with him that we are probably so
    different that we should not try to have a dog together. And you
    know, this is not just, of course, about the love of a dog. This
    also could be the love for a friend, or the love for a family
    member. It just seems to me to be a lovely piece. I just like
    opening this book and reading.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Well, and to me, it seems to be about the pleasure we take in the
    small things. The way that we find beauty or wonder in every day.
    Are you finding wonder and beauty every day in the midst of these
    difficult times?

  - judy blume  
    I think it’s hard. I do love when we go out walking. I don’t know if
    you know this about Key West, but chickens roam freely in Key West,
    and they’re protected. And I don’t always love the chickens, but
    this time of year, with their little babies walking behind them,
    that’s wonder right there. You know, the world goes on. This
    terrible thing is happening, but the world goes on.

  - cheryl strayed  
    There will always be little yellow baby birds, no matter what.

  - \[laughter\]

  - judy blume  
    I guess so. I hope so.

  - cheryl strayed  
    I do too. So Judy, it’s been wonderful to speak to you, and thank
    you so much for sharing yourself with me.

  - judy blume  
    Thank you. OK. Stay well.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye bye, hon.

  - judy blume  
    Bye.

  - cheryl strayed  
    Bye.

  - \[music\]  
    I’m Cheryl Strayed. This is “Sugar Calling.” Next week, Alice
    Walker.

## ‘I’m scared one minute and then it’s like, oh, everything is gonna be OK. Let’s dance. That will help.’

*— Author Judy Blume*

Today, Cheryl calls Judy Blume, the beloved young-adult novelist, at her
home in the Florida Keys. Judy tells Cheryl what it’s like to run a book
store at 82 years old: “It’s my reward after 50 years of writing.”

Judy talks about journaling, and how it saved her through the hardest
times in her life. She passes on advice to teenagers living through the
pandemic: Acknowledge your feelings, and write them down. You don’t have
to discuss it with your parents, either.
