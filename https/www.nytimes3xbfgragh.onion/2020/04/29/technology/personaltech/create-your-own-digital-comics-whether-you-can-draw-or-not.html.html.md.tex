Even if you can't draw a stick person, you can still express yourself
and tell stories through the time-honored tradition of sequential art.

Got a tale to tell but don't want to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/30/technology/personaltech/national-novel-writing-month-apps-tools.html}{bang
it out} as a traditional book? Try doing it as a digital comic --- and
ignore anyone who thinks visual narratives are a lesser art form or
basic fodder for Hollywood action movies. The tradition of storytelling
through sequential art has a long and noble history, used in
\href{https://archeologie.culture.fr/lascaux/en}{ancient cave
paintings},
\href{https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/index.html}{Roman
carvings},
\href{https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/}{tapestries}
and
\href{https://blog.britishmuseum.org/hokusai-the-father-of-manga/}{woodblock
printing}.

Even if you can't draw or paint, you can still construct a comic. Some
educators have found the medium to be a good way to
\href{https://bookcreator.com/2015/11/how-can-we-use-comics-in-the-classroom/}{entice
children into creative writing}. Thanks to a variety of apps, you can
make your digital comics on a smartphone, a tablet, a computer or even a
plain old piece of paper. Here's a guide.

\hypertarget{study-the-craft}{%
\subsection{Study the Craft}\label{study-the-craft}}

Before you dive in, decide what type of comic you want to make: A single
scene like a cartoon from The New Yorker? A
\href{https://www.peanuts.com/}{``Peanuts''}-style comic strip
consisting of two or more panels? A comic book with a heroic protagonist
like the
\href{https://www.marvel.com/comics/discover/460/black-panther}{Black
Panther}? Or perhaps a
\href{https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/12/27/beginners-guide-manga}{manga}
adventure or a lengthy graphic memoir like Alison Bechdel's
``\href{https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Fun-Home/9780618871711/}{Fun
Home}''?

If you're not sure how to begin, the web is full of
\href{https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Comic}{free advice}, including a
short guide by
\href{https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-create-a-comic-book-step-by-step-guide-for-making-your-own-comics\#how-to-come-up-with-an-idea-for-a-comic-book-in-4-steps}{the
author Neil Gaiman}. If your local bookstore is closed or you can't
order online, digital versions of instructional books like
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Making-Comics-Lynda-Barry-ebook/dp/B086MD8HYT/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\&qid=\&sr=}{``Making
Comics,''} by Lynda Barry, and
\href{https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/222732/make-comics-like-the-pros-by-greg-pak-and-fred-van-lente/}{``Make
Comics Like the Pros,''} by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente, can be bought
and downloaded without leaving the house.

manuals available in print and e-book.Credit...Lynda Barry

Reading comics can be inspiring, too. The digital store
\href{https://www.comixology.com/}{Comixology} or a comic shop taking
online orders can help you generate your own ideas.

\hypertarget{cant-draw-no-problem}{%
\subsection{Can't Draw? No Problem}\label{cant-draw-no-problem}}

After you decide what type of comic you want to make, choose the right
software for your project. If you're not an artist and want something
easy to learn, consider an app like
\href{https://www.canva.com/create/comic-strips/}{Canva},
\href{https://www.pixton.com/}{Pixton} and
\href{https://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboard-creator}{Storyboard
That}. These programs let you drag and drop characters, backgrounds and
speech bubbles onto a digital canvas; all three are web based and work
on a computer or a mobile device. (Another option, the free
\href{https://www.makebeliefscomix.com/}{Make Beliefs Comix} site, even
encourages students to create their own visual pandemic diaries.)

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/04/30/technology/personaltech/29TECHTIP_02/29TECHTIP_02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Although you start with stock objects on the screen, you can customize
characters and their actions, then add your own dialogue. You need to
create a user account to store and save your creations. Beyond limited
versions and free trials, Canva, Pixton and Storyboard That each cost
\$10 to \$13 a month for full access to comics-building content.

For parents and educators looking to keep youngsters busy, the nonprofit
\href{https://www.commonsense.org/}{Common Sense} site has
\href{https://www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/classroom-friendly-websites-and-apps-for-making-comics}{a
guide to comics-making tools} that also reviews the privacy practices of
the apps.

\hypertarget{make-comics-with-photos}{%
\subsection{Make Comics With Photos}\label{make-comics-with-photos}}

If you can't draw but can take pictures, you can craft comics out of the
photos sitting on your smartphone. It's a great way to turn the family
pet into a superhero, relive a vacation or jazz up a presentation.

\href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comicbook/id436114747}{ComicBook}
for iOS and
\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roundwoodstudios.comicstripitpro\&hl=en}{Comic
Strip Pro} for Android (both \$3) are two of the many apps in this
category. Both work the same way: Start by selecting a frame or page
layout for your comic. Next, import images from your phone's camera roll
as the illustrations for the panels.

library of filters, stickers and word balloons that can be customized to
convert photos into comic panels.Credit...J.D. Biersdorfer

After you arrange the photos, apply filters to the images that make them
look like panels in a printed comic. The apps include elements like
customizable speech bubbles you can drag onto the images and digital
stickers with graphical type (BAM!, POW! and such) to add a few classic
comics accents to the page. When you're finished, just export or email
your comic to share it.

\hypertarget{draw-your-own-comics}{%
\subsection{Draw Your Own Comics}\label{draw-your-own-comics}}

When it comes to making your own comic, having artistic talent gives you
a much wider range of expression and apps designed specifically for
making comics from pencil sketches to distribution. The free
\href{https://medibangpaint.com/en/}{MediBang Paint}, a digital-painting
and comics-creation program that runs on computers and mobile devices,
is one app for artists.

Artists using iPads have a lot to work with in
\href{https://plasq.com/apps/comicdraw/ios/}{Comic Draw}, a
full-featured digital studio that includes drawing tools, page
templates, a script editor and perspective guides. The app is \$10, but
it offers a free 14-day trial.

General illustration and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/04/technology/personaltech/how-to-draw-with-apps.html}{drawing
apps} like \href{https://procreate.art/}{Procreate} can also make
artwork for comics. But for parents worried that their children are
staring at too many screens all day, there's a more analog approach.
Just search up a site (like
\href{https://www.printablepaper.net/category/comics}{Printable Paper})
offering comic-book templates to download and print so young creators
can make their worlds with pen and pencil. You can always
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/technology/personaltech/digitizing-important-documents.html}{scan
or photograph} the artwork later for digital saving and sharing.
