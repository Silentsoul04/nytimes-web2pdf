# 3 Baltic States Announced a ‘Travel Bubble.’ What Is It and Could It Work in the U.S.?

</div>

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania announced a plan to allow for internal
travel, and Australia and New Zealand are likely to follow suit. But in
other parts of the world, establishing such a bubble would be tricky.

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania plan to open their internal borders for
citizens to travel between the three countries beginning on May 15, a
decision that creates the first “travel bubble” among European Union
countries as coronavirus-related travel restrictions begin to ease.

The announcement, made by the prime ministers of the three Baltic
nations on Wednesday, follows a statement made in late April by the
prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand, who [agreed this week to
establish a similar
bubble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/trans-tasman-travel-bubble-to-allow-flights-as-soon-as-lockdowns-ease-morrison-and-ardern-agree)
when flights between the countries can be safely arranged. Both
Australia and New Zealand, compared to other nations, have made
significant progress in containing the coronavirus outbreak within their
borders.

People traveling to the Baltic corridor from other countries will
continue to be required to go into isolation for 14 days after entry.

“It’s a big step towards life as normal,” wrote Jüri Ratas, the prime
minister of Estonia, [in a Twitter
message](https://twitter.com/ratasjuri/status/1257960686489161733).

Regional bubbles — among a group of states, for example — could be a way
to get people traveling again and help revive businesses as the world
readjusts to life with the coronavirus. Earlier in the pandemic, the
governors of California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and Colorado said
that they will coordinate the reopening of their states to limit the
spread of Covid-19. A travel bubble among those states might make it
easier for residents to travel and work across their borders, though
spokesmen for the governors of California, Oregon and Washington said
that they have not yet discussed creating such a bubble.

## Are travel bubbles legal?

Travel bubbles imposed by nations — where strict immigration rules can
dictate who enters and exits — are one thing. But would they be legal
within the United States? Maybe not.

“If any states created a bubble to keep out residents of disfavored
states, the action would be open to challenge that the bubble violated
U.S. Constitutional principles of equal treatment,” said Cam Winton, a
lawyer with the firm Dorsey & Whitney, who has been advising people
dealing with state-imposed coronavirus rules. “Those principles are
enshrined in the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Equal Protection
Clause and the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states
from putting undue burdens on interstate commerce.”

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Under its police power, a state can deploy nondiscriminatory public
health measures like taking the temperature of everyone entering the
state or requiring them to go into quarantine, as long as it imposes
that rule on every person, regardless of where the person is from.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Winton added that neighboring states could enter into agreements for
coordination of checkpoints, sharing data and other anti-coronavirus
efforts, but those initiatives would all be subject to the constraints
on government power conferred by constitutional
rights.

In the United States, measures created by some municipalities in recent
months have created de facto bubbles, but the porousness of these varies
from place to place and would be difficult, if not impossible, to make
official without infringing upon the rights of states and citizens,
experts
said.

## The Key West example

In Florida, the Keys have become their own bubble. Since March 22,
Monroe County, which includes the islands, has had two checkpoints at
the top of the Florida Keys Overseas Highway — one at mile marker 112.5
on the 18-mile stretch of U.S. 1 and the other on County Road 905. Only
people who can prove that they live or own property or work in the Keys
have been allowed onto the chain of islands that is about 60 miles away
from Miami.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

When Key West, the seat of Monroe County, began reopening its beaches
and parks on Monday for locals, people from neighboring Miami-Dade
County tried to drive to the beach but were turned away at the
checkpoints.

“Historically we’ve had day trippers come then leave, but Miami-Dade
County is a hot spot with a lion’s share of cases, so what we’re trying
to do is only allow essential services into the Keys and say that the
beach is open only for locals to get out a few hours a day to get sun,”
said Teri Johnston, the mayor of Key West. “Our residents want to know
that we aren’t relaxing orders in a way that would bring visitors to our
island until it is safe for that.”

Officials in Key West have been in conversation with business owners,
realtors and the administrators of attractions like museums about a
phased reopening of the city, in which everything would reopen to locals
first, said Alyson Crean, a public information officer.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Everyone agrees that opening up to visitors is the last phase,” Ms.
Crean

## Where does one bubble end and the other begin?

For places without the natural geography to help create a bubble, things
get murkier. Under Colorado’s new “Safer at Home” policy, people have
been ordered by Gov. Jared Polis to limit recreational travel to no more
than 10 miles from their homes, and to try to keep essential travel
within their county, if possible. Theoretically, those orders would
create bubbles that would prevent visitors from traveling to the state’s
more isolated
areas.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

However, Estes Park, a tourist town in Larimer County that is the
gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and 30 miles from the nearest
city, recently began allowing its hotels and short-term rentals to
reopen with social distancing policies in place.

Kate Rusch, a spokeswoman for the Town of Estes Park, said that
essential travelers and people traveling within Larimer County might
need accommodations and that the town wanted to be ready for when travel
restrictions were loosened further.

But some saw the move as an open invitation to visit. Hattie Serrano, a
local resident, [wrote in a
Tweet](https://twitter.com/themadhattiee/status/1253779577400430594)
that hundreds of people had been visiting even during the
shelter-in-place order. “Telling people to stay home and then opening
hotels at the same time is contradictory to one another. If the hotels
are open they will come. They’ve come despite them being closed.
Reopening them is a terrible mistake.”

Others, like Stephen Rapp, objected to staying within the 10-mile
bubble. [He
tweeted](https://twitter.com/StephenRapp3/status/1253786973002702849)
that it would be “unconstitutional” to prevent him from staying in his
second home in Estes where he normally spends six months of the year and
pays taxes. He asked: “I’m an Estes Park property owner, so am I an
outsider or not a local?”

## Even islands can struggle with bubbles

In South Carolina, the city of Folly Beach, located on Folly Island,
just south of Charleston, found itself in conflict with the state’s
governor when it set up checkpoints on the road leading to the island
and banned short-term rentals in March. “By creating the checkpoint, we
had essentially created a bubble for our island,” said the town’s mayor,
Tim Goodwin.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But under an order from the state’s attorney general, officials were
forced to lift the restrictions. Mr. Goodwin said people immediately
began flooding in. “The day that we did lift the checkpoint we went from
an average of 2,000 cars to an average of 10,000 cars,” he said.

On Peaks Island, an island in Casco Bay, Maine, that is 15 minutes away
from downtown Portland and is only accessible by ferry, residents
[recently asked city
leaders](https://www.wmtw.com/article/islanders-ask-people-only-make-essential-trips-for-now/32010258)
to encourage people to only take essential ferry trips to the island out
of fear that the guests could increase the number of cases already
recorded. Some locals worry that people will flood back to the island
over Memorial Day weekend.

“It’s a very conflicted situation with community needing the business
that comes with visitors, but also needing to prioritize everyone’s
health,” said Randy Schaeffer, chair of the Peaks Island Council, which
is not a legislative body but an advisory group for the island. “People
might want something like a bubble, but we don’t have the legal power to
do that and it is highly unlikely that we would be able to keep people
from coming here.”

“We aren’t North Korea,” he added.
