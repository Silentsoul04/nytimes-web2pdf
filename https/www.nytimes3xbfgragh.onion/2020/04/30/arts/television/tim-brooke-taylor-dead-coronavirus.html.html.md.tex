79}\label{tim-brooke-taylor-a-mainstay-of-british-comedy-dies-at-79}}

The humor on the BBC sketch show ``The Goodies,'' of which he was a
creator and star, was visual, anarchic and very silly. He died of the
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Tim Brooke-Taylor, who helped define British comedy in the 1970s as a
star of the long-running television sketch show,
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7lbqiE3LWQ}{``The Goodies,''}
died on April 12. He was 79.

His death, from the coronavirus, was announced by the BBC, which did not
say where he died. He had been a regular on the BBC Radio 4 parody game
show, \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRFzVdvNQXo}{``I'm Sorry, I
Haven't a Clue,''} since 1972.

Mr. Brooke-Taylor got his start as a performer at Cambridge University
alongside the future ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' stars John Cleese
and Graham Chapman. And ``The Goodies,'' seen on the BBC from 1970 to
1980 and later briefly on ITV, shared an anarchic, anything-goes sense
of humor with ``Monty Python,'' which made its debut in 1969. But
whereas the Pythons mixed silliness with a certain degree of
sophistication, ``The Goodies'' --- to the delight of its audience,
which largely consisted of children --- was mostly just silly.

The sketches on ``The Goodies'' were tied together by the premise that
the members of the troupe traveled around on a bicycle built for three
doing good deeds and often confronting surreal menaces, among them a
giant cat terrorizing London. The Goodies even had hit records; one,
``The Funky Gibbon,'' reached the British Top 10 in 1975.

Timothy Julian Brooke-Taylor was born on July 17, 1940, in Buxton,
England. His father was a lawyer, and he studied law at Cambridge. But
Tim abandoned thoughts of following his father's career path after
joining the Footlights, the university's dramatic club, where his fellow
performers also included his future ``Goodies'' co-stars, Graeme Garden
and Bill Oddie.

``Cambridge Circus,'' the Footlights revue in which he appeared, had a
successful run on the West End in London and was briefly seen on
Broadway in 1964.

In his autobiography, ``So, Anyway \ldots{}'' (2014), Mr. Cleese
remembered Mr. Brooke-Taylor as the best performer in that show and
praised his ``talent for funny, precise physical comedy.''

In 1967, Mr. Brooke-Taylor, Mr. Cleese, Mr. Chapman and Marty Feldman
created the ITV sketch series
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6UrcD5MKs8}{``At Last the 1948
Show.''} (The title, Mr. Cleese explained, ``was intended as a joke
about the slowness of program planners making a decision.'') One of Mr.
Brooke-Taylor's most lasting contributions to comedy, both as a writer
and a performer, was a sketch first seen on that show, ``The Four
Yorkshiremen.''

In that sketch, later a highlight of Monty Python's live performances,
four wealthy and pompous men take turns trying to top one another with
increasingly absurd tales of how poor they were growing up. ``There were
over 150 of us living in a small shoe box in the middle of the road,''
Mr. Brooke-Taylor says as the absurdity accelerates, and he had to
``work 23 hours a day at mill for a penny every four years.''

After ``The Goodies'' ended its long run, Mr. Brooke-Taylor was seen on
several British sitcoms. He was also heard on ``I'm Sorry, I Haven't a
Clue,'' on which two teams of comedians were given ridiculous tasks to
perform, from its debut in 1972 until his death.

He is survived by his wife, Christine (Wheadon) Brooke-Taylor, and two
sons, Ben and Edward.
