She nurtured political aspirations while raising her 1-year-old
daughter. Then she tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The next
day she was dead.

ALBUQUERQUE --- Valentina Blackhorse, the winner of one pageant after
another in the Navajo Nation, was known for helping others. When the
coronavirus began
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html}{tearing
across} her reservation, she counseled family members to stay home, wash
their hands and wear masks.

Then the virus somehow made its way into her own home in Kayenta, a town
in the Navajo Nation near the sandstone buttes of Arizona's Monument
Valley. Her companion, Robby Jones, a detention officer with the Navajo
Department of Corrections, caught Covid-19, the disease caused by the
virus.

``She cared for him until she got sick herself,'' her sister Vanielle
said. ``She was always that way, looking after others.''

When Ms. Blackhorse came down with symptoms including shortness of
breath and back and knee pain, she went for a test. The results came
back on April 22 and showed she was positive. A day later, Ms.
Blackhorse died at Kayenta's health clinic, where Mr. Jones had taken
her after she had difficulty breathing, her sister said. She was 28.

Ms. Blackhorse, who worked as an assistant at the Dennehotso Chapter
House, an administrative office, was among the Navajo Nation's youngest
and most prominent pandemic victims, and her death stunned many among
her people. The reservation was already grappling with one of the
deadliest outbreaks in rural America, with 1,977 confirmed cases of
Covid-19 and 62 deaths from the infection as of Thursday, authorities
said.

Ms. Blackhorse was born on Sept. 2, 1991, in Tuba City, Ariz., to Danny
and Laverne Blackhorse. Her father was a coal miner, her mother a cook.

A former Miss Western Navajo, she had also previously held the titles
Miss Monument Valley High School and Miss Diné College. She won those
titles while starting a family and a career as a public servant, even as
she grappled with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that might
have heightened her risk of dying from Covid-19.

In addition to her parents, Mr. Jones and her sister Vanielle, she is
survived by her 1-year-old daughter, Poet Bessie Blackhorse, and another
sister, Victoria.

Vanielle Blackhorse said her sister had dreamed of entering politics one
day, aspiring to become a delegate to the Navajo Nation Council or even
president of the Navajo Nation, one of the largest tribal nations in the
United States.

``But she accomplished her big dream by becoming a mother,'' said Ms.
Blackhorse, whose own daughter is the same age as Poet Bessie. ``She
loved being a mom to her daughter. It came naturally to her.''
