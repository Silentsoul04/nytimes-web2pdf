How Billy Eichner, Lizzie Asher and Andrew Saffir are not partying.

\emph{With the New York party scene on hiatus, here is how some patrons
and society figures are spending their time and resources during the
coronavirus crisis.}

\hypertarget{billy-eichner}{%
\subsection{Billy Eichner}\label{billy-eichner}}

\textbf{Age}: 41

\textbf{Occupation:} comedian, actor, producer

\textbf{Favorite Charity}: \href{https://www.glaad.org}{Glaad}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?}

At his apartment in West Hollywood, Calif.

\textbf{Last month, you hosted a Glaad gala on Zoom that was
livestreamed on YouTube and Facebook. What brought you on board?}

When it was pointed out to me that L.G.B.T.Q. youth centers were
shutting down or being defunded during the Covid crisis, I jumped in. A
shutdown means that kids and teenagers are being forced to self-isolate
with their families in their home. A lot of those teenagers don't
necessarily feel safe in their home.

\textbf{Do you relate to that experience?}

I grew up in New York with very liberal, gay-friendly parents. I only
experienced homophobia for first time in my life in my 20s in Hollywood.
But so much of what's on television can give a false impression that
coming out of the closet is the easiest thing to do, that families will
greet you with open arms. That's a myth.

\textbf{The gala drew a high-profile crowd, supporters like Rosie
O'Donnell, Pete and Chasten Buttigieg, Billy Porter and Jonathan Van
Ness. Was it glamorous?}

To be honest, there is nothing very glamorous about Zoom. I do think
including entertainers at these events helps the message go down a
little easier.

\textbf{Did it do that for you?}

I got to chat with Dan Levy, Adam Lambert and my friend Matt Bomer. We'd
never gotten to talk before about what inspired him to come out. As an
actor, that's still a challenge.

\textbf{Have you found other positive distractions?}

Fun is relative these days. I was couple of weeks away from filming a
movie I co-wrote and am starring in, that Judd Apatow is producing. It's
a romantic comedy about two gay men. We were literally packing our bags
to start shooting. Now that's on hold. But I realized there are much
bigger problems than shooting a movie right now.

\hypertarget{lizzie-asher}{%
\subsection{Lizzie Asher}\label{lizzie-asher}}

\textbf{Age:} 37

\textbf{Occupation:} president, Macchu Pisco, a beverage company

\textbf{Favorite Charities:} \href{https://www.curacollective.org/}{Cura
Collective}, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital,
\href{https://www.savevenice.org}{Save Venice},
\href{https://wck.org/}{World Global Kitchen},
\href{http://citysquash.org/}{City Squash}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?} In a plant-friendly apartment in
Chelsea, Manhattan.

\textbf{Can you take us through your day?}

It's an indulgence to be able to set your own schedule, not having to
rush out first thing in the morning. I wake up to my little guy --- he
is 6 --- crawling into my bed for a snuggle. My husband works from home,
so afterward he settles in to work. I do two home schooling sessions
with my son every day.

\textbf{Have you found ways to vary that routine?}

We all have lunch together. Later, rain or shine, we do a family run
along the West Side Highway as a way for us to let out pent-up energy.
I'm growing herbs in wooden boxes at my kitchen window. Before we went
into self-isolation I had ordered seeds from Amazon and worms. I'm
composting at home. I make juice for the family from those herbs.

\textbf{What is your way of giving back?}

I'm on the patient advisory board at Columbia Presbyterian hospital,
where I was treated some years back for a pulmonary embolism that led to
a coma. As part of the Cura Collective, which I founded with friends, we
are donating beauty and grooming products to the I.C.U. units and
hospital staff. I put my little one in the back seat of the car, and we
make the deliveries.

\textbf{What things are you missing from pre-Covid days?}

It would be really overwhelming to be taking stock of all the things
we're missing. I try to enjoy things, no matter how small --- that's
something I learned coming out of my coma. At a time like this, having
your health is priceless.

\hypertarget{andrew-saffir}{%
\subsection{Andrew Saffir}\label{andrew-saffir}}

\textbf{Age: 53}

\textbf{Occupation:} founder of the Cinema Society, which holds
red-carpet movie screenings.

\textbf{Favorite Charity:} \href{https://www.cityharvest.org}{City
Harvest}

\textbf{Where are you hunkering down?}

East Hampton, New York.

\textbf{What is a typical day for you now?}

I'm keeping up with the newspaper and CNN online, and managing an
adapted work schedule. That means strategizing on film screenings in the
absence of theaters and with most release dates still unknown.

\textbf{How are you spending your downtime?}

Daniel {[}Benedict, his partner{]} and I rarely had a night in to watch
TV before. But we've now devoured ``Broadchurch,'' ``The Tunnel'' and,
because we need some levity, ``Schitt's Creek'' and ``Derry Girls.''

I'm making my way through
\href{https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies/}{A.F.I.'s 100
Greatest American Films of All Time} (ciao, Don Corleone!). I'm bingeing
on a British mystery series, and Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers for a
therapeutic laugh. Also, I grew up eating out most every night, so
eating at home nightly is \ldots{} different. Thomas Keller I am not.

\textbf{Which charities have you been supporting?}

I procured some of the celebrity lineup for the
\href{https://www.cityharvest.org/foodathon/}{City Harvest Foodathon}.
We asked people to do a video telling what they love about New York.
Everyone instantly said yes and sent the most touching stories. Some,
like Judith Light, who paid homage to those on the front lines, brought
tears to my eyes.

\textbf{What are you missing most}*?*

Daniel and I had tickets to three shows when everything closed,
including the first preview of ``Plaza Suite.'' We can't wait to cheer
on Sarah Jessica, Matthew and John Hickey, when that curtain finally
rises. And I'm craving dinner at a window table at the River Café, to
see the glittering skyline and the city pulsating across the water
again.
