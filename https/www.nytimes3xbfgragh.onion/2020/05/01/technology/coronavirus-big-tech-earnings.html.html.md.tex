When the most successful companies are anxious, you know we're in scary
times.

America's technology superpowers are a little nervous. That's sensible,
and also terrifying.

Financial reports filing in from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and
others show the big tech companies are holding up OK --- great, even.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-facebook-amazon-youtube.html}{As
expected}, so far the big and powerful are growing, hiring and spending
as many other businesses fight just to survive a pandemic-driven
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/business/economy/us-gdp.html}{economic
freeze}.

But even the tech titans have lots of shrugs and buts. They're confident
about the far-off future, yet cautious about what's on the horizon. No
one wants to be overly optimistic or overextended.

This might be posturing; it's tacky to gloat when many millions of
people have lost their jobs. But the worrying feels genuine. When the
most successful companies are anxious, you know we're in scary times.

As the big tech companies talked about dollars and cents this week,
pride was the prevailing mood. The bosses at Amazon, Microsoft, Google
and Facebook know we're
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/technology/coronavirus-quarantine-technology.html}{leaning
hard on their products and services}. They believe --- correctly ---
that they'll benefit if we permanently live, work and shop more online.

But the nerves were there, too. ``I remain very concerned that this
health emergency and therefore the economic fallout will last longer
than people are currently anticipating,'' Facebook's chief executive,
Mark Zuckerberg, said.

Both Zuckerberg and Google's executives said --- again correctly ---
that they're at the mercy of economic ups and downs. If people aren't
buying new cars, Ford isn't going to buy as many ads on Facebook, Google
or The New York Times.

It's sensible caution, but it's unusual for Zuckerberg to stress
Facebook's inherent fragility. He also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/technology/facebook-earnings-advertising-virus.html}{talked
more} than I've ever heard before about keeping his company's spending
in check so Facebook has a cushion for bad times.

Facebook and Google said that they weren't hiring as much as expected in
some areas and that they planned to spend less than they forecast on new
buildings and other big-ticket items. These companies are doing well,
and they're still doing the rich company's version of pinching pennies.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/technology/apple-sales-earnings-coronavirus.html}{Apple},
Amazon and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/technology/alphabet-google-earnings-coronavirus.html}{Google}
said they couldn't predict what their numbers would look like in the
next few months. Apple hadn't done that in more than a decade, Bloomberg
News
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/apple-squeezes-growth-out-of-pandemic-ravaged-quarter}{reported}.

Even though we're shopping a ton on Amazon, the company isn't cashing
in. Amazon is barely breaking even on our jars of peanut butter and
toilet paper. And the company is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/technology/amazon-stock-earnings-report.html}{spending
a fortune} to make sure
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/technology/coronavirus-amazon-shopping.html}{shoppers
get what they want} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/05/technology/coronavirus-amazon-workers.html}{employees
are safe} --- areas where the company has struggled.

The tech companies that now seem unassailable were tiny little things,
relatively speaking, the last time there was a recession. Facebook was a
toddler, and Amazon was still getting most of its money from books, CDs
and DVDs.

People have wondered how these 21st-century titans would fare in the
next recession. We're going to find out. It looks like they'll be just
fine, but even they're not so sure.

\subsection{The homework gap is stark}\label{the-homework-gap-is-stark}}

This pandemic is exposing the divide between the internet haves and
have-nots.

In a recent
\href{https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/04/30/53-of-americans-say-the-internet-has-been-essential-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/}{survey}
by the Pew Research Center, one in five American parents with kids now
home said it was somewhat or very likely that their children wouldn't be
able to complete their classwork online.

The reasons they cited included a lack of access to a computer or
internet connection at home. And about 30 percent of parents said it's
at least somewhat likely that their children would have to do
assignments on a cellphone.

The Pew survey backed what my Times colleagues have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/nyregion/new-york-homeless-students-coronavirus.html}{written}
about the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/us/coronavirus-schools-attendance-absent.html}{struggles
of families} in rural or low-income households as many school districts
moved to online instruction.

Among the parents in the Pew survey with lower incomes, about 40 percent
said their kids may have to use Wi-Fi in public places to do schoolwork,
because there wasn't reliable internet at home. The figure was just 6
percent among higher-income survey respondents.

  \textbf{There are so many bogus claims about artificial intelligence}:
  But the Times technology reporter
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/cade-metz}{Cade Metz}
  found a genuinely helpful outcome when London researchers used an
  artificial intelligence tool to
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/technology/coronavirus-treatment-benevolentai-baricitinib.html}{scour
  scientific literature for possible coronavirus treatments}. Two days
  later, it identified an arthritis medication with so much potential
  that it is being fast-tracked.
\item
  \textbf{Employers, WHAT are you doing?} Companies are buying software
  that
  \href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/30/work-from-home-surveillance}{catalogs
  everything employees do}, say, watch and listen to while working from
  home, The Washington Post reports. Software can flag, for example,
  when people are typing words like ``job'' and ``client,'' which might
  signal employees are looking for new jobs. Another option: trusting
  people to be adults.
\item
  \textbf{Is Silicon Valley the next Detroit?}
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/margaret-omara}{Margaret
  O'Mara}, a contributing Opinion writer at The Times, writes that after
  World War II, American car companies could no longer resist tighter
  safety and emissions rules and workers' demands for better pay. She
  believes today's tech superpowers
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-amazon-earnings.html}{may
  be similarly transformed} in coming years by more regulation and
  employee activism.
