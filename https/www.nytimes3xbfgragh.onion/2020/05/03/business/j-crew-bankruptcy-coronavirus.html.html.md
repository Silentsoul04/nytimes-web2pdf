# J. Crew Files for Bankruptcy in Virus’s First Big Retail Casualty

[J.
Crew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/coronavirus-retail-bankruptcies-private-equity.html),
the mass-market clothing company whose preppy-with-a-twist products were
worn by Michelle Obama and appeared at New York Fashion Week, filed for
bankruptcy protection on Monday. It is the first major retailer to fall
during the coronavirus pandemic, though other big industry names
including Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney are also struggling with the
toll of mass shutdowns.

J. Crew announced that its parent company, Chinos Holdings, had [filed
for Chapter 11
protection](https://jcrewgrouprestructuring.com/our-announcement/) in
federal bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Virginia. As part
of its financial reorganization plan, it will hand over control to top
creditors, including the hedge fund Anchorage Capital, by converting
$1.65 billion of its debt into equity. The company, which has secured a
$400 million debtor-in-possession loan, also plans to hold onto its
Madewell brand, which it had considered spinning off into a public
company.

J. Crew added that its online business would continue to operate
normally throughout its restructuring, and that it planned to reopen its
J. Crew and Madewell stores once lockdowns are lifted. Gift cards and
returns and exchanges would not be affected, it said [in a
message](https://jcrewgrouprestructuring.com/message-to-our-customers/)
to customers, adding that it planned to serve shoppers “for years to
come.”

“This agreement with our lenders represents a critical milestone in the
ongoing process to transform our business,” Jan Singer, J. Crew’s chief
executive, said in a statement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The company had been in negotiations with lenders on how to handle its
debt for weeks and made the decision after its board conferred Sunday
evening, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity because discussions were
confidential.

The pandemic has been disastrous for the already weakened retail
industry. In March, sales of clothing and accessories fell by [more than
half](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/business/economy/coronavirus-retail-sales.html?searchResultPosition=1).
The numbers for April are expected to be worse, because many stores were
open for at least some of March (e-commerce, a relatively small
contributor to total sales for most store chains, is not enough to make
up for the closures).

Retailers have furloughed employees, slashed executive salaries and
hoarded cash in a desperate attempt to survive until the shutdowns are
lifted. And there is widespread acknowledgment that J. Crew is unlikely
to be the only retailer to face the
brink.

J. Crew was carrying a [debt burden of $1.7
billion](https://investors.jcrew.com/static-files/7e60f08e-e8c7-454b-8b7c-d78ec412efcc)
based on [a leveraged
buyout](https://dealbook.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/03/01/j-crew-shareholders-approve-buyout/)
in 2011 by two private equity firms — TPG Capital and Leonard Green &
Partners — even before the coronavirus brought clothing sales to a
near-halt in its 181 stores, 140 Madewells and 170 outlets. It had also
struggled to adapt to changing consumer tastes.

But it seemed to be making strides in recent months toward a more viable
future. The company [named Ms.
Singer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/business/j-crew-jan-singer.html)
its new chief executive in January and was planning an [initial public
offering of
Madewell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/17/business/madewell-ipo-j-crew.html)
this spring in order to pay down some of the debt and rehabilitate the
J. Crew brand.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The coronavirus pandemic scuttled those plans and eventually toppled the
company.

J. Crew started life in 1947 as a family-run low-priced clothing line
for women called Popular Club Plan, and in 1983 it was renamed and
reinvented as a catalog company selling turtleneck tops and crew neck
sweaters in “Preppy Handbook” shades. It made the leap to household name
and 21st century fashion fairy tale in October 2008 when Mrs. Obama,
whose husband was then the Democratic candidate for president,
[appeared](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/11/17/business/media/17crew.html)
on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.” This was just days after it had
been revealed that Sarah Palin, the Republican candidate for vice
president, had been given a costly wardrobe makeover. “I want to ask you
about your wardrobe,” Mr. Leno said to Mrs. Obama. “I’m guessing about
60 grand? Sixty, 70 thousand for that outfit?”

“Actually, this is a J. Crew ensemble,” Mrs. Obama replied, referring to
her $148 yellow pencil skirt, $148 yellow and brown print tank top and
$118 matching yellow cardigan. “Ladies, we know J. Crew. You can get
some good stuff online\!”

It was a priceless marketing moment. After that, everyone knew J. Crew,
which seemed to embody the high/low mix-and-match trend of the moment.

The company was purchased by TPG in 1997 in a leveraged buyout from the
[founding
Cinader](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/17/obituaries/arthur-cinader-who-started-j-crew-avatar-of-preppy-style-dies-at-90.html)
family, and was taken public in 2003 — only to be reacquired for
approximately $3 billion by TPG and Leonard Green & Partners nearly a
decade ago.

Its creative director, Jenna Lyons, who first joined as part of the
design team in 1990, became a boldface name, known for her black-rimmed
glasses, gangly frame and love of sequins and camouflage. Newspaper
reports crowed about the comeback of the company’s chief executive,
Millard S. Drexler, who had previously led Gap Inc. for years. Mr.
Drexler, who goes by Mickey, became famous for riding his bicycle around
the office and checking in with store associates via speakerphone.

In 2011 J. Crew became the first mass-market accessible brand to breach
the high fashion parapet and present at New York Fashion Week.
[Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/article/and-at-long-last-its-showtime-jcrews-runway-debut-at-new-york-fashion-week)
crowned the brand “a significant voice in the conversation on American
style.” As the face of the brand, Ms. Lyons attended the Met Gala and,
in 2014, played a role on the HBO show “Girls.”

In 2017, however, after two years of falling sales, [Ms. Lyons left the
company](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/04/fashion/j-crew-jenna-lyons.html).
J. Crew, the criticism went, had gone *too* fashion, falling into the
trap of prizing quirk over quality and pricing itself out of
practicality. It had diminished its own brand with a [heavy
push](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sapna/introducing-jcrew-mercantile-the-factory-outlet-that-isnt)
into outlet merchandise. (There are now nearly as many full-price J.Crew
stores as factory stores.) And it had never focused enough on
e-commerce. Madewell, its younger, simpler — “more authentic” — sister
brand, acquired by Mr. Drexler in 2006, was the company’s new shining
star. Indeed, after Ms. Lyons left, Madewell’s designer, Somsack
Sikhounmuong, who had switched over to [J. Crew
in 2015](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/12/fashion/somsack-sikhounmuong-of-madewell-becomes-womens-wear-designer-at-j-crew.html),
took the top creative spot. Much was made of a return to core values.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was too little, too late. For a fashion brand to thrive it must be
either needed or wanted. J. Crew, sitting somewhere in the netherland of
style and price, was neither. A few months after Ms. Lyons’s departure,
[Mr. Drexler stepped
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/05/business/jcrew-mickey-drexler.html)
and Mr. Sikhounmuong left two months later, starting a round robin of
executives and designers. That served ultimately to confuse rather than
clarify the identity of the company and its strategy. Jan Singer,
formerly of Nike and Victoria’s Secret, [was
named](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/business/j-crew-jan-singer.html)
J. Crew’s newest leader in January.

Madewell, which filed for an I.P.O. in the fall, was expected to go
public this spring while J. Crew remained private, but those plans were
ultimately scrapped in March as the stock market spiraled, adding a new
wave of pressure and question marks to J. Crew’s future.

J. Crew clearly had plenty of problems even without its massive debt
load. Ongoing interest payments and looming maturities only added to the
company’s challenges, and in the eyes of some, left it ill-equipped to
adjust to a new shopping environment.

As the retail landscape has shifted, “these businesses have faced a huge
investment need,” said Raya Sokolyanska, a senior analyst at Moody’s.
“Having a burdened balance sheet certainly greatly diminishes their
chances of doing this successfully.”

That’s even more challenging for fashion retail, she said, which is
“notoriously fickle.”

Now the question is whether the upheaval of the retail industry — which
predates the pandemic, with the [collapse of Barneys New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/business/barneys-bankruptcy-authentic-brands.html)
late last year — will continue.

“The companies going into bankruptcy, for the most part, were companies
that were struggling before Covid — we have not seen true Covid-only
bankruptcies,” said James Van Horn, a partner at the law firm Barnes &
Thornburg and a specialist in retail bankruptcy.

However, he added, “depending on how the current situation continues,
that may change.”

For instance, Brooks Brothers, another quintessential American shopping
institution, is already facing questions about its future.

“In the ordinary course of business, Brooks Brothers consistently
explores various strategic options to position the company for growth
and success, in partnership with its financial advisers at P.J.
Solomon,” a spokesman said, in response to question about a potential
sale.
