Researchers at two Harvard-affiliated hospitals are adapting a proven
form of gene therapy to develop a [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html),
which they expect to test in people later this year, they announced on
Monday.

Their work employs a method already used in
[gene](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/health/coronavirus-mutation-transmission.html)
therapy for two inherited diseases, including a form of blindness: It
uses a harmless virus as a vector, or carrier, to bring DNA into the
patient’s cells. In this case, the
[DNA](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/coronavirus-neanderthals.html)
should instruct the cells to make a coronavirus protein that would
stimulate the immune system to fight off future infections.

So far, the team has studied its vaccine candidates only in mice. Tests
for safety and potency in monkeys should begin within a month or so at
another academic center, the researchers said. But two of seven
promising versions are already being manufactured for studies in humans.

The research is one of at least[90 vaccine projects speeding
ahead](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/us/politics/vaccines-coronavirus-research.html)
around the world in desperate efforts that hold the best and probably
only hope of stopping or at least slowing the pandemic.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are presenting a different angle from everybody else,” Dr. Luk H.
Vandenberghe, director of the Grousbeck Gene Therapy Center at
Massachusetts Eye and Ear, said in an interview.

Their angle has several advantages, he said. One is that the type of
vector, an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, is a harmless virus that is
already used in two approved forms of gene therapy and has been tested
in many patients and found to be safe.

Another plus is that the technique requires very small amounts of the
vector and DNA to produce immunity, so the yield of doses would be high,
Dr. Vandenberghe said. Small amounts are enough because the vector is
very good at getting into cells, which the DNA it carries transforms
into factories that crank out the protein needed to put the immune
system on alert against the coronavirus, he
added.

In addition, many drug and biotech companies, large and small, already
produce adeno-associated virus and could easily switch to producing the
form needed for the vaccine. New facilities would not have to be built
from scratch. That means production could quickly be scaled up to help
meet the huge and urgent global need for vaccine.

“We are leaning on an established industry,” Dr. Vandenberghe said. “AAV
as a class has had investments in the dozens of billions of dollars.
There’s capacity out there that can be leveraged if we are lucky and
successful.”

The approved gene therapies that use adeno-associated viruses are
Luxturna, for a form of hereditary blindness, and
[Zolgensma](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/24/health/zolgensma-gene-therapy-drug.html),
for a lethal nerve disease, spinal muscular atrophy. The price of
Luxturna is $425,000 per eye. It is made and sold in the United States
by Spark Therapeutics, and sold overseas by Novartis. Zolgensma, made by
Novartis, is given to young children as a one-time injection, at a price
of $2.1 million.

At this early stage, Dr. Vandenberghe estimates the manufacturing cost
per dose of vaccine to be from $2.50 to $250.

The research has the financial backing of donors, led by Wyc Grousbeck,
lead owner of the Boston Celtics, his wife, Emilia Fazzalari, the chief
executive of Cinco Spirits Group, and members of the Grousbeck family.

Several other vaccine projects involve viral vectors, but no others use
adeno-associated viruses.

Hundreds of AAVs infect humans and other mammals. Researchers in gene
therapy turned to them as a safer alternative after [a patient died in a
study
in 1999](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/the-death-of-jesse-gelsinger-20-years-later)
from a severe immune reaction to a different type of viral vector.

For gene therapy, scientists sought adeno-associated viruses that would
act as a sort of stealth carrier for DNA and not set off any
inflammatory or immune response. They also tweaked the viruses
genetically to prevent them from replicating inside human cells.

Working at the University of Pennsylvania about 15 years ago, Dr.
Vandenberghe created a hybrid AAV from two versions found in monkeys,
for possible use in gene therapy. It was no good: It provoked an immune
response.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

But that makes it a good candidate for a vaccine, because such a
reaction can help stoke the immune system to fight the coronavirus. Many
vaccines contain substances called adjuvants to help rev up the response
to the vaccine itself. For this vaccine, the hybrid AAV may act not as
only a vector, but also as an adjuvant.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Mason Freeman, director and founder of the translational research
center at the Massachusetts General Hospital, who is planning the human
tests of the vaccine, said the researchers were hoping for just enough
immune response to the AAV and not too much. But the hybrid vector has
never been used in humans before, so there is still much to learn.

Like other vaccine projects, this one is focusing on the so-called spike
on the coronavirus, which it uses to grab onto cells and invade them. In
theory, if the immune system can be trained to make antibodies to block
the spike, the virus will not be able to establish an infection.

The DNA being carried by the vector holds directions for making a
protein portion of the spike. Because it is not known which section of
the spike is likely to set off the best immune response, researchers
test DNA for different parts.

One potential problem that every vaccine project will be on the lookout
for is disease enhancement: the possibility that a vaccine, instead of
preventing infection, could actually make the disease worse. Dr.
Vandenberghe said his team was working with three other laboratories
that would conduct tests to address this question.

Disease enhancement has become a particular concern because all the
vaccine projects are trying to move so much faster than usual that there
is a fear the problem could go undetected, Dr. Freeman said. It is
challenging to design studies to find it, particularly with a new
disease that is not well understood.

The two scientists said the many research groups forging ahead with
vaccine projects were racing not against one another, but against the
coronavirus.

“We need multiple shots at goal,” Dr. Vandenberghe said. “The level of
unknowns of what we have to try to achieve here is too high, and the
level of urgency is equally high.”
