Mr. Liu helped expand the country's art beyond the traditionally
dominant disciplines.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Liu Shouxiang, a teacher and painter of watercolor in China who spent
decades championing the form, which is often overshadowed by oil
painting and traditional Chinese ink painting, died on Feb. 13 at
Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan. He was 61.

The \href{http://news.hifa.edu.cn/xxxw/xxxw/68034.htm}{Hubei Institute
of Fine Arts} in Wuhan, where Mr. Liu had taught for years before
retiring in 2018, announced the death. It said the cause was the new
coronavirus.

At China's top art schools, four disciplines traditionally dominate: oil
painting, Chinese painting, printmaking and sculpture. As in the West,
watercolor is more associated with hobbyist painters and scientific
illustrations than with high art.

Mr. Liu helped change that. After graduating in 1981 with a teaching
degree from the Hubei Art Academy, which later became the Hubei
Institute of Fine Arts, he stayed on to teach. In 1987, he helped set up
the \href{http://schx.hifa.edu.cn/xsky/xsjl/7694.htm}{watercolor major}
within the teachers' college. And in 2009, he helped found the
institute's stand-alone
\href{http://schx.hifa.edu.cn/yxgk/3650.htm}{watercolor department}, the
first among China's major art academies. He was the department's first
dean.

``Getting this discipline up and running was entirely the work of one
person,'' Wang Chenghao, a close friend and fellow watercolorist, said
in a phone interview. ``After that, his colleagues were all his own
former students and his students' students' students.''

Mr. Liu's own work eschewed the delicate, barely-there quality of
traditional watercolors. Borrowing techniques from oil painting, he
produced pictures rich with texture. He sometimes thickened them with
\href{https://v.qq.com/x/page/d0362bz7sf9.html}{layers of acrylic
paint}, giving them saturated depths of buried color.

\href{https://cn.canson.com/news/liu-shouxiang}{His work in recent
years} included still lifes as well as renderings of ancient cities in
the Apennines and rugged landscapes in China's Far West.

Mr. Liu was born on April 5, 1958, in Wuhan. His father was a doctor,
and his mother was a laborer.

His first solo exhibition took place last year at
\href{https://cn.canson.com/news/liu-shouxiang}{the Wuhan Art Museum}.
He had long resisted displaying his work, Mr. Wang said. He never felt
his pictures were good enough.

``They still had not met his own high requirements,'' Mr. Wang said.

He is survived by his wife, a brother, a sister, a daughter and a
granddaughter.

Wang Yiwei contributed research.
