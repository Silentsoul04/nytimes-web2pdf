\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Bana Abdalla Ali, who tirelessly championed basketball in Somalia and
promoted sports among youngsters in a nation beset by civil war, died on
April 28 in London. He was 54.

His death came after he had contracted the novel coronavirus, his family
said. Mr. Ali had been treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London for
almost a month.

Mr. Ali garnered prominence for being a vocal supporter of basketball in
Somalia, investing not only his free time
\href{https://twitter.com/JustAwHirsi/status/1255084776287068161}{but
also his own money} to ensure the country's players had their chance on
the international stage.

A basketball enthusiast and a well-known player in Mogadishu before
Somalia's civil war began, he at various points over the years served as
both the secretary general and head of marketing for Somalia's national
basketball team and was also a member of the East and Central Africa's
Inter City Basketball Committee.

Mr. Ali was also a member of the Africa department of the International
Basketball Federation, or FIBA Africa, which is part of the world
governing body, FIBA, for the sport. Just this year, FIBA Africa said
that Mr. Ali had for the first time
\href{http://www.fiba.basketball/news/somalia-basketball-legend-bana-ali-succumbs-to-covid-19}{helped
attain corporate sponsorship} for the Somali men's senior national team,
enabling it to travel to Kenya and participate in the FIBA AfroBasket
2021 pre-qualifiers.

The federation also said that Mr. Ali was finalizing a plan that would
ensure both women and men basketball players in Somalia took part in all
its continental activities including the under-18 qualifiers. Somalia's
civil war severely damaged sports infrastructure, and religious
extremists also banned women from participating in sports. But as the
country has moved toward peace in recent years,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/world/africa/somalia-somaliland-running-women.html}{many
sports}, including basketball,
\href{https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/11/the-fight-over-womens-basketball-in-somalia}{have
been revived} with teams of men and women
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10\&v=xLjCHjUQpvg\&feature=emb_logo}{practicing
and playing} in courts guarded by government forces.

Mr. Ali was born on Jan. 11, 1966, in Mogadishu and completed his
primary and high school education in the capital city. He moved to
Britain in 1990 and studied engineering at Middlesex University. For
years, he worked as a manager at Transport for London, the government
agency that oversees the day-to-day operations of London's transport
network.

He is survived by his wife, Muna Hared; a daughter, Aaliyah; and three
sons, Abdalla, Amir and Omar.
