Graduating seniors across the United States who are missing traditional
commencement events because of the coronavirus pandemic have had stars
step up to fill the void. Last month, [Oprah
Winfrey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/oprah-winfrey-2020-commencement-speech.html)
announced that she would address seniors; the very next day, LeBron
James said he was organizing a prime-time special for graduates. Now,
former President [Barack
Obama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/16/us/barack-obama-2020-commencement-graduation-speech.html)
has announced that he too will celebrate [graduating
seniors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/16/us/barack-obama-2020-commencement-graduation-speech.html)
in at least three events.

On May 16, Mr. Obama will participate in “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU
Edition,” an event for historically black colleges and universities, he
[announced on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1257687918388424707) on
Tuesday. Later that evening, he is scheduled to deliver the main address
at “Graduate Together: High School Class of 2020 Commencement,” a
virtual event [organized by Mr. James’s
foundation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/us/oprah-winfrey-graduation-commencement-speeches-virus.html).

The former president will give another address in a [YouTube event
titled “Dear Class
of 2020,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxpTjcouaeQ) along with
Michelle Obama, the K-pop group BTS, Lady Gaga, former Secretary of
Defense Robert M. Gates and others on June 6. Alicia Keys, Chloe x Halle
and Kelly Rowland will also make appearances.

“I’ve always loved joining commencements — the culmination of years of
hard work and sacrifice,” Mr. Obama said on Twitter. “Even if we can’t
get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to
celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with
you and your loved ones.”

“Whether you’re graduating from high school, college, or any other kind
of school — we want you, your family, and all of your loved ones to be a
part of this celebration,” Mrs. Obama [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1257693192645992450).

While it was not immediately clear how Mr. Obama ultimately got involved
in the graduation events, a social media campaign started by a high
school senior in Southern California has been trying for weeks to
recruit him to give a national commencement address.

“Like most high school/college seniors, I’m saddened by the loss of
milestone events, prom & graduation,” the student, Lincoln Debenham, 17,
of Eagle Rock High School, [said in an April 14
post](https://twitter.com/lincolnjackd/status/1250264222514069506) that
has been retweeted over 46,000 times. “In an unprecedented time, it
would give us great comfort to hear your voice. We ask you to consider
giving a national commencement speech to the class of 2020.”

“What inspired me to send my tweet was seeing President Obama’s
endorsement of Vice President Biden for president,” Mr. Debenham said on
Tuesday. “It reminded me all day what a great speaker he always was and
how his words shaped my generation in many ways. I figured, Who better
than him?”

Mr. Debenham said that while he hadn’t personally heard from Mr. Obama,
he was planning to potentially watch all three of his appearances.

“It’s wild\!” said Mr. Debenham, who plans to attend California State
University, Los Angeles, in the fall to study political science. “I did
expect him to do it regardless of whether I did that tweet or not. I’m
still extremely excited about it.”
