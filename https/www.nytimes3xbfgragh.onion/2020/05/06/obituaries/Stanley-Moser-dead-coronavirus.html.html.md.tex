\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Stanley Moser had a knack for selling Funk \& Wagnalls encyclopedias and
other affordable reference books to the American middle class. One of
his earliest great ideas was to price the first volume of a set at 9
cents. Supermarket shoppers snapped them up, and then were hooked on
buying the rest.

Mr. Moser spent three decades in the encyclopedia business, starting out
in accounting, rising to become an executive and owner, and exiting just
before the internet effectively marked an end to the era of the printed
encyclopedia.

He died on April 14 in Fort Lee, N.J. He was 88. His daughter, Elena
Moser, said the cause was complications related to Covid-19. Nine days
earlier, Mr. Moser's wife of 67 years, Marilyn, had died in the hospital
of complications of the virus.

Funk \& Wagnalls was a mass-market product, an affordable alternative to
the World Book or Encyclopaedia Britannica. In a world without Google or
Wikipedia, ownership of these comprehensive stores of facts and
information was a point of pride for many middle-class American
families.

Funk \& Wagnalls volumes were typically sold in supermarkets as part of
a ``book-a-week'' program. When Mr. Moser came up with the idea of
reducing the normal charge to just pennies for the first volume,
``People thought he was crazy for doing something like that,'' said
Harvey Strackman, a former partner of Mr. Moser's at Funk \& Wagnalls.
He added: ``He was an innovator.''

The entire 27-volume Funk \& Wagnalls set --- along with the free
two-volume dictionary, another sweetener dreamed up by Mr. Moser ---
cost a little more than \$100. By contrast, Encyclopaedia Britannica
cost well over \$1,000 in the mid-1980s.

Mr. Moser was born in the Bronx on Dec. 12, 1931. His father, Isidore,
was a postal worker. His mother Ceil (Kaufman) Moser, had done piece
work in a sewing pattern factory. He grew up in the University Heights
neighborhood, attending DeWitt Clinton High School, graduating from City
College and becoming a certified public accountant.

Besides Ms. Moser, he is survived by another daughter, Gail Wichler; a
son, Niles Moser; and eight grandchildren.

During the mid-1950s, Mr. Moser served in the U.S. Army and was
stationed in Japan. When he returned, he first worked at an accounting
firm before, in 1958, joining the Standard Reference Works Publishing
Company, then the publisher of Funk \& Wagnalls encyclopedias.

Through a chain of mergers, Funk \& Wagnalls became a unit of the
financial publisher Dun \& Bradstreet by the early 1970s. But the
inventory-heavy business proved a poor fit with the parent company, a
specialist in credit ratings guides and business directories.

In 1984, Mr. Moser joined with a group of executives to buy the Funk \&
Wagnalls unit for an undisclosed price. It was a leveraged buyout, a
transaction that involved significant amounts of debt to be repaid
slowly over time.

But a deal Mr. Moser helped secure with the Children's Television
Workshop to publish a 15-volume Sesame Street series of stories and
activities provided the cash to pay back the loans in a year, Ms. Moser
said.

As computer technology emerged, the partners decided it was time get
out. In 1988, they sold Funk \& Wagnalls to Field Publications, an
educational publisher. A price was not disclosed, but an analyst placed
it\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/05/27/business/the-media-business-field-publications-agrees-to-buy-funk-wagnalls.html}{between
\$70 million and \$100 million}.

``We saw the handwriting on the wall,'' Mr. Strackman said.
