One of the first biotech companies to begin human trials of an
experimental
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html}{vaccine
for the coronavirus} is now ready to move onto the next phase of
testing.

On Thursday,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html}{Moderna}
announced that the Food and Drug Administration had cleared its
application to proceed to a clinical trial involving about 600 people.

``The imminent Phase 2 study start is a crucial step forward,'' Stéphane
Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said in a statement.

The main goal of this set of tests is to find out if the vaccine is safe
and if positive results from the first few dozen volunteers in the first
phase can be replicated in a much larger group. If it is successful,
later studies, known as Phase 3 trials, will determine exactly how well
the vaccine works.

More than a dozen companies, including known vaccine producers like
Johnson \& Johnson, or Sanofi, are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/us/politics/vaccines-coronavirus-research.html}{involved
in a global race to develop a vaccine}to tamp down the highly infectious
coronavirus that has killed more than a quarter-million people around
the world.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/business/coronavirus-china-vaccine.html}{Four
Chinese companies have started testing} their potential vaccines on
humans, including CanSino Biologics, which announced the beginning of
Phase 2 trials in early April. A few others, such as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html}{Pfizer}
and its German partner, BioNTech, are enrolling volunteers for combined
Phase 1 and 2 trials.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases,
has suggested that it would still take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine to
be widely available to the public. There is no proven treatment, and
many researchers and corporations around the world are pursuing remedies
in addition to vaccines.

Moderna's vaccine candidate, called mRNA-1273, relies on genetic
material known as messenger RNA, which carries the recipe for making
proteins to tiny ribosome chefs inside cells. The vaccine is written
with a very specific recipe --- in this case for making the spike
protein of the coronavirus.

Because the virus typically uses this protein as a key to unlock and
take over lung cells, the vaccine could train a healthy immune system to
produce antibodies to fight off an infection before someone gets sick.

Moderna's vaccine is one of many using this unusual technology. Its
first tests in humans were
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html}{conducted
in 45 healthy adults in Seattle}, funded by the National Institutes of
Health. Since then, other companies, using different approaches, have
also joined the race to find a coronavirus vaccine.

    its recommendation of six feet}~on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The F.D.A. said its policy was not to comment on phases of any drug
trial, and Moderna did not release results from the first phase.

In its first-quarter update on Thursday, Moderna appeared to be speeding
up its timeline for a coronavirus vaccine, stating that the next phase
would begin ``shortly.'' The company is also gearing up for a Phase 3
trial in the summer, and hopes to have the final vaccine approved ``as
soon as 2021.''

Moderna's shares soared as much as 13 percent in early Thursday trading.
Excitement over a potential vaccine has led to an increase of more than
150 percent in the company's stock since the beginning of this year.

The biotech firm is also accelerating plans for manufacturing a vaccine
so it can start building a stockpile as soon as this July. Last week,
the firm announced a 10-year collaboration with the Swiss contract
drugmaker Lonza to manufacture
\href{https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/moderna-and-switzerlands-lonza-strike-a-deal-on-a-potential-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{up
to one billion doses per year} for worldwide distribution, if the
vaccine proves successful.
