The Food and Drug Administration prohibited 65 manufacturers from
selling masks for medical use. But the move came after tests last month
showed the masks didn’t meet standards.

For three weeks the Food and Drug Administration allowed the sale of
several types of N95-style face masks for American health care workers
despite evidence from other parts of the federal government that the
masks were not effective for blocking the coronavirus.

Millions of these masks, produced in China, have been bought by or
donated to American hospitals and distributed to others on the front
line of the Covid-19 outbreak. Starting in mid-April, tests conducted by
the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that some of
the products did not meet medical standards for
protection](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html)
against the coronavirus.

But it wasn’t until Thursday that the F.D.A. barred more than 65 of the
80 authorized manufacturers in China from exporting N95-style face masks
to the United States for medical use, citing poor quality.

“While the F.D.A. continues to take action to balance the urgent need of
supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing
everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive
adequate protection,” an F.D.A. spokeswoman said in a statement. She
added that the agency would collaborate with the C.D.C. to increase the
supply of masks and ensure their integrity.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She did not comment on the delay between the failed tests and the
F.D.A.’s action.

N95 masks, many of which are also produced in China, provide better
protection against coronavirus particles than cloth or surgical masks,
and are coveted by health care providers and emergency medical workers.
On April 3, drastic shortages of the N95 masks led the F.D.A. to allow
imports of similar masks, also from China. Millions of them have been
imported.

These masks,[known as KN95, were never tested by American
regulators](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/health/coronavirus-n95-kn95-masks.html),
but were required to be vetted by an accredited test laboratory, which
can be outside the United States, showing that they met the standards of
the C.D.C. Those standards call for filtering 95 percent of particles
that are 0.3 microns or larger, including the new coronavirus.

As an additional safeguard, the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. initiated their
own review to make sure the masks met these performance standards. On
Thursday, the F.D.A. said that too many of them failed to filter out a
sufficient percentage of particles.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

</div>

In tests of about 11 masks that the F.D.A. had authorized to be sold to
American hospitals, seven flunked. One mask removed as little as 24 to
35 percent of particles, according to a C.D.C. test on April 15. Others
just barely missed the cut, such as masks from DaddyBaby, a company in
Fuzhou, China, that typically makes diapers. Those masks removed between
91 percent and 93.5 percent of particles.

The health agencies also tested some KN95 masks that did not have agency
approval. One of these, the F.D.A. said, blocked roughly 1 percent of
the particles. While the C.D.C. tested only about 10 masks that had been
allowed, the F.D.A. removed all other masks from its list that hadn’t
yet been tested and gave their manufacturers 45 days to get tests in
order to be reinstated.

Many of the tests were conducted weeks ago, according to C.D.C.
documents, yet the F.D.A. didn’t remove the masks until Thursday. It was
unclear why there was such a delay. It was also unclear how many of the
faulty masks were sold to American health care workers, where they ended
up and whether the U.S. government was tracking that number. An F.D.A.
spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to questions on the
issue.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Hospitals and health care workers have been wary of KN95 masks, but
because of the shortage of official N95 masks, many have ended up with
them anyhow.

Last month, the New England Patriots football team used its plane to
transport roughly one million masks from China to Massachusetts, drawing
positive headlines [even from the New York
newspapers](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/04/05/pigs-take-flight-new-york-hearts-new-england-patriots/).
A week later, medical workers [began expressing
concerns](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/12/metro/medical-workers-share-concerns-about-masks-delivered-by-patriots-plane/)
that the masks that Massachusetts officials purchased were not the
top-of-the-line N95 respirators, but rather lower-grade KN95 masks that
were potentially not safe to use while caring for coronavirus patients.

“We are not using these on Covid 19 patient areas or in any areas,”
Michael Augustine, the supply chain director at Harrington Memorial
Hospital in Southbridge, Mass., said in an email at the time. “The
packaging on the masks state they are not to be used in medical and
surgical environments. These are essentially parked in storage and will
not be utilized.”

Jay Park, an emergency-medicine doctor in New York who has been vetting
mask suppliers for nonprofits, said that the F.D.A.’s reaction to the
test results showed the agency hadn’t properly screened the masks before
approving them for medical use. “They relied on the self-reported test
results from China,” he said. “Are you kidding me?”
