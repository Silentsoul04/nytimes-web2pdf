*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Both Alfredo and Susana Pabatao, who were married for 44 years, worked
on the front lines in the fight against the coronavirus — he as a
transport aide at a hospital in North Bergen, N.J., she as an assistant
nurse at a nearby nursing home.

On March 26, Mr. Pabatao died of the virus at the hospital where he
worked, Hackensack Meridian Health Palisades Medical Center. He was 68.

Four days later, Mrs. Pabatao, who was also infected with the virus,
died in the same hospital. She was 64.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sheryl Pabatao, one of their daughters, said her mother would probably
have died the day she learned of her husband’s fate had she not been put
on a breathing tube. Well before she took ill her mother had signed a
health directive saying that in the event of an emergency she did not
want to be resuscitated, her daughter said, but it was on file at a
different hospital. When hospital aides found her passed out on the
floor, doctors inserted the tube to keep her alive.

But Mrs. Pabatao resisted, trying so often to remove the tube that she
had to be sedated. “She said, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t do this
anymore,’” her daughter said.

Ms. Pabatao and her four siblings were then faced with an excruciating
choice — whether to honor their mother’s directive and ask the doctors
to remove the tube, or to keep her alive against her wishes. They
decided not to remove it.

“My dad had just passed away that morning,” Ms. Pabatao said. “We wanted
her to fight. But she wanted to be with him.”

[Dr. Dilip Jeste](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/dilip.jeste), a geriatric
psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego, said in an
interview that long-term partners dying within a short time of each
other is a long-observed phenomenon, but one that remains poorly
understood.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given that the coronavirus is so contagious, he said, it is not
surprising that more partners appear to be dying almost in tandem. But
he did not rule out that a psychological or emotional component could
play a role.

Ms. Pabatao saw that component at work, she said.

Her parents had been inseparable. Both were born and grew up in the same
neighborhood in [Quezon City](https://quezoncity.gov.ph/), in the
Philippines. Susana Galapate came from a modest background, the daughter
of a stable hand, while Alfredo was the son of a successful clothing
retailer.

They fell in love and, against his family’s wishes, married in 1976.
They had five children. In 2001, the couple and the three youngest
emigrated to the United States, settling in Palisades Park, N.J. They
became American citizens more than a decade ago.

After the illness struck in late March and her father died, Ms. Pabatao
said, she and her siblings came to understand how much her mother wanted
to be with her father.

“In the beginning, I was mad at my mom for wanting to leave us,” she
said. “I thought it wasn’t fair — how could she leave five of us to be
with one husband?”

Because of coronavirus restrictions in the hospital, each parent died
alone, on a separate floor, the children out of reach.

“As hurtful as this is, I see it as a great love story,” Ms. Pabatao
said. “They just couldn’t live without each
other.”
