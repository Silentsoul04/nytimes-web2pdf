Prison}\label{myles-coker-69-dies-freed-from-a-life-term-in-prison}}

A sentencing rule change, a spotless prison record and his standing as a
``true father'' to his sons led to his release after 23 years behind
bars for selling heroin.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

``Free'' was Myles Coker's favorite song. Recorded by Graffiti6, the
British indie-pop duo, it was released in 2010, three years before Mr.
Coker was. His sons played it for him in the car after they had picked
him up from prison. In the song, Graffiti6 sang:

\begin{quote}
\emph{I can't live without you, without you}\\
\emph{And it's hard to breathe when you're not near}\\
\emph{But I can't lie here beside you, beside you}\\
\emph{'Cause you steal my soul when you leave}\\
\emph{Set me free, babe}
\end{quote}

Mr. Coker spent just under 23 years as an inmate, and he would call his
boys once or twice a week during that time. When they were little,
living with their mother and sleeping on the floor of their
grandfather's apartment in Harlem, Mr. Coker would excuse his prolonged
absence by saying that he had taken time off from working for a
limousine service to travel to the Midwest to train Renaldo Snipes, the
heavyweight boxer who had been his sometime sparring partner.

Finally,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/01/29/nyregion/greed-just-took-me-recalls-a-father-who-led-a-secret-life-of-crime.html}{Mr.
Coker owned up} to having made a mistake, a big one, in his early 40s
--- one that upended his life and ravaged those of others. Driven by
greed and easy money, he had become a heroin dealer, reaping as much as
\$25,000 a month as an offshoot of a much larger organized crime drug
distribution network.

Mr. Coker had packaged and sold so much heroin that federal guidelines
at the time of his sentencing in 1994 required him to spend the rest of
his life in prison.

But it turned out that the government, too, had made a mistake of sorts.
Three weeks after Mr. Coker was sentenced, the federal guidelines were
relaxed. A year later, the rules were changed again so that the reduced
sentences could be applied retroactively.

Except nobody told Mr. Coker.

Myles Alan Coker Jr. was born on May 20, 1950, in Manhattan. His father
ran a dental laboratory. Mr. Coker was working for a financial planning
company when, in 1981, he married Deborah Connor, a literary agent who
became a school principal. They had two sons, and he doted on them. He
and his wife had separated before he was imprisoned.

The boys later went off to college --- Kelvin to Amherst, Clifton to the
University of Richmond --- and they came to understand that if their
father was ever to be released, he'd need their help.

They enlisted a lawyer, Harlan Protass, who petitioned Judge Loretta A.
Preska of the United States District Court in Manhattan to apply the
revised sentencing guidelines to Mr. Coker's case, arguing that under
those protocols he was entitled to his freedom.

Mr. Protass also presented the judge with Mr. Coker's exemplary prison
record and compelling testimonials from guards at the federal
penitentiary where he was being held, in Lewisburg, Pa.

Judge Preska was persuaded; prosecutors concurred. She released him in
2013, invoking what she described as Mr. Coker's ``extraordinary''
ability, even while imprisoned, to be ``a true father figure to his
wonderful sons'' and ``the truly astounding'' evidence of his
rehabilitation offered by his guards.

``Mr. Coker was truly deserving of release, particularly because of his
wonderful relationship with his family and his good works and spotless
disciplinary record over all those decades,'' Judge Preska said recently
by email. ``He was a remarkable gentleman.''

Kelvin, now a partner in the FFA Sports Management agency, and Clifton,
a commercial insurance broker, picked their father up at Lewisburg the
morning after the judge's decision. They played ``Free'' all the way
home.

Mr. Coker went to work for a friend's pest control company in Queens. He
died of the novel coronavirus on April 9 in a Manhattan hospital. He was
69.

``They lost their father for 23 years when they were 8 and 10,'' Mr.
Protass said in an interview. ``They got him back for six glorious
years, but now, as adults, they've lost him again. Unfortunately, this
time it's forever.''
