TOKYO --- Yukio Okamoto, a Japanese diplomat and adviser to prime
ministers who was one of the most effective advocates for Japan's
alliance with the United States and the country's increased role in
international politics, died on April 24. He was 74.

Mr. Okamoto, a native of Kanagawa Prefecture, died in a Tokyo hospital
of pneumonia brought on by the novel coronavirus, his office said on
Friday.

Urbane, with a precise command of English, Mr. Okamoto helped steer the
American-Japanese relationship through some of its most difficult times.
He was assigned to manage the partnership between the two countries in
the 1980s, when they were competing for the mantle of global economic
leadership while also banding together over their shared apprehension of
the Soviet Union's influence in Asia.

In 1991, Mr. Okamoto took the rare step of leaving his job at Japan's
foreign ministry to start his own consulting firm, going on to serve on
numerous corporate boards.

But the Japanese government would not let him go. Over the decades, the
country's prime ministers called on him to use his deep reservoir of
knowledge about the United States and close relationships with his
American counterparts to help navigate some of the most sensitive issues
affecting the countries' relationship, from the disposition of a U.S.
Marine base in Okinawa to the handling of the 70th anniversary of World
War II.

Even after his career as a diplomat officially ended, Mr. Okamoto
continued to serve as one of Japan's most capable champions. He
articulated the country's politics and policies through private
discussions and meetings, public lectures and countless appearances in
the media, including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1991/03/17/weekinreview/the-world-the-view-from-inside-a-strained-relationship.html}{in
the pages of The New York Times}.

At home, he was a well-known commentator and author, publishing regular
columns and writing and contributing to numerous books on politics. At
the time of his death, he was working on a book that he hoped would pass
on his knowledge of and enthusiasm for the U.S.-Japan alliance to the
next generation.

Along the way, the refined but approachable former diplomat won friends
and admirers from across the political spectrum.

``While Yukio stood out for his policy entrepreneurship, it was his
humanity that drew people from so many different fields into lifelong
friendships with him,'' Michael Green and Kurt Campbell, both of whom
worked with Mr. Okamoto in high-level American policy positions, wrote
\href{https://www.csis.org/analysis/remembering-yukio-okamoto}{in a
statement} on the website of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.

``Those working on U.S.-Japan relations today will want to remember and
take some inspiration from the fact that our alliance was ultimately
forged not by the impersonal forces of history, but by men and women
like Yukio Okamoto.''

Hisako Ueno and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.
