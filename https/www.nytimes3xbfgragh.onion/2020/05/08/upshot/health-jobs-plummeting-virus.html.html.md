For more than half a century, in good economic times and bad, health
care jobs in the United States just kept increasing. Economists and
health analysts thought of them as nearly recession-proof: a buffer
against the business cycle.

But like so many other patterns, the coronavirus pandemic has broken
this relationship. With the virus and its fallout deterring Americans
from using the health system, job losses started in March and
accelerated to 1.4 million last
month.

“This is a disruption unlike any we’ve seen in decades,” said Ani
Turner, the co-director of sustainable health spending strategies at the
Altarum Institute, which tracks trends in health care spending and
employment. Ms. Turner recently wrote an
[essay](https://altarum.org/news/health-care-sheds-43000-jobs-march-biggest-loss-least-three-decades)
titled “Health Sector Won’t Be the Backstop in This Downturn.”

A sudden drop in health spending and [employment amid a
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-health-care-workers-layoffs.html)
might seem like a paradox. But it reflects how the health industry tends
to make its money: Treating patients for a deadly illness is far less
profitable than offering them elective surgeries. When the federal
government
[asked](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-elective-surgery-recommendations.pdf)
hospitals to stop such procedures to free up capacity, that changed
their economics
profoundly.

And even if various governments across the nation hadn’t then ordered
such a pause, many patients would have probably avoided doctors’ offices
and hospitals anyway, to lessen the risk of contracting the coronavirus.
Independent medical practices have seen [huge
reductions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/health/coronavirus-primary-care-doctor.html)
in their business, as some patients connect with doctors virtually,
while many others patient visits have simply vanished.

In previous recessions, the health industry has not taken such a hit.
Because most Americans have health insurance, health services are more
insulated from the business cycle than other kinds of spending. The
biggest users of the system are older Americans. Besides being likelier
to have health problems, they also tend to have comprehensive insurance
coverage through Medicare and a stable source of income from Social
Security. The Medicaid program, which is structured to allow people to
enroll when their incomes fall, tends to offer access to health care for
the poor, even if their jobs disappear.

And, of course, many of the problems that send people to the doctor —
heart disease, appendicitis, cancer or the flu — do not go away during a
struggling economy. As a result, the doctors and nurses and medical
assistants and billing clerks who work in health care are usually
protected from an economic downturn.

But lately Medicare beneficiaries, the age group at highest risk of
serious disease or death from the coronavirus, have been particularly
spooked from seeking medical care. And emergency rooms have reported
[shocking
declines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html)
in visits for what doctors had always thought of as life-threatening
emergencies. A [recent
survey](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/accj/early/2020/04/07/j.jacc.2020.04.011.full.pdf)
of nine major U.S. hospitals showed visits for a common but serious kind
of heart attack have fallen by nearly 40 percent. Those declines were
seen even in places without major coronavirus outbreaks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The industry still seems somewhat protected: Health care jobs have
[fallen by
less](https://twitter.com/Altarum_SHSS/status/1258745215382413312) than
jobs in the rest of the economy. But in the Great Recession, as jobs of
nearly every kind plummeted, health jobs kept growing at a good clip. In
the eyes of many economists, it was health care that led the economic
recovery, by providing a powerful and reliable jobs engine. All those
new health workers helped strengthen their local economies.

And in many places hit hard by the recession, the local hospital became
a dominant employer, supporting entire communities. There were some
small reductions in the use of health services in the following years;
those led to [a
slowdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/08/28/upshot/medicare-not-such-a-budget-buster-anymore.html)
in what had been seen as the inexorable growth of health spending. Those
changes, which earned the nickname
“[slowth](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/blog/2014/03/health-care-slowth-continues)”
among health care analysts, were [unusual
enough](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/12/04/upshot/good-news-inside-the-health-spending-numbers.html)
to be [major
news](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/01/08/us/health-spending-growth-stays-low-for-third-straight-year.html).
Health care still grew, however, just more slowly. About 60 percent of
health care spending goes to labor, so all the growth, almost by
definition, meant new jobs.

That growth was seen as good news in the short term for the economy. But
health care’s ever-growing share of the national economy has [not always
been
seen](http://www.sangerkatz.com/uploads/1/5/0/0/15005400/cover_story-the_false_promise.pdf)
in a positive light. The rising costs of the Medicare and Medicaid
programs have meant that health care has come to represent a larger
share of the federal budget, limiting capacity for other government
investments. Strain under the growing costs has caused many employers to
switch from older forms of insurance, which were comprehensive, to plans
with high deductibles for workers, [shifting the financial
burden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/25/health/employer-health-insurance-cost.html)
onto individuals and families, and leaving them vulnerable to big bills.

This downturn is clearly different, and the enormous reductions in the
health work force mean the recovery may be different, too. Some of the
lost jobs in health care are likely to come back later. Cancer patients
who postponed chemotherapy, or people who canceled their hip
replacements, will eventually want that care. But other changes may be
permanent.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Over just a few weeks, there has been a shift to [telemedicine
visits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/11/health/telemedicine-coronavirus.html),
in which patients can talk with their doctors by video, telephone or
even email. Many health systems had long avoided setting up an
infrastructure for them. But the new virtual visits have many
advantages: Patients can avoid travel and waiting rooms; caregivers can
easily participate; and several doctors can talk to the same patient at
once. There are [no
clipboards](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/08/upshot/release-your-medical-records-first-you-must-collect-them.html)
full of personal information to fill out by hand, and no person needed
to retype the answers into a computer system before such visits.

Other changes are more invisible. Hospitals have been forced to find
small ways to digitize processes and share records that used to involve
labor and bureaucracy. Bob Kocher, a partner at the venture capital firm
Venrock, has been acting as an adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom of
California through the crisis. He said he had seen hospitals adapt
quickly to begin sharing their daily bed counts with one another and the
state, for example, a task that used to involve hours of phone calls and
faxes. Data about laboratory testing — how much is being done, how many
patients have been found to have coronavirus — has been similarly
digitized in real time.

Are those sorts of on-the-fly tweaks enough to have an appreciable
effect on long-term health care employment? Mr. Kocher thinks so,
describing the recent cuts in health care administration as a “silver
lining” of the crisis, while acknowledging the short-term pain of the
job losses.

“I will passionately say that’s a good thing, because health care costs
in America are high, and most of the health care cost in America is
labor,” he said.

Another possibility is that the financial shock hitting smaller and less
capitalized hospitals and physician practices could lead to a wave of
consolidation, as bigger competitors gobble them up for a discount.
Those kinds of mergers have typically led to rising health costs, since
bigger systems can demand higher prices from private health insurers.
That could make the legacy of this shock a more expensive health system
instead of a cheaper one.

“We have a great opportunity ahead of us, but I don’t see us making any
progress,” said Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, who once
was a [co-author of an
essay](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2678994)
describing health care as “recession-free,” and not in a good way. “I
think we’ll go back to business as usual.”

Either way, health care is unlikely be the economic stabilizer it has
been in the past. The loss of industry jobs on top of the major losses
in other sectors are likely to make the recession deeper, and the
recovery slower.
