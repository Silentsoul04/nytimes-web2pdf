<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Three children have died of a mysterious syndrome linked to the coronavirus.

Three young children have died in New York of a mysterious, toxic-shock
inflammation syndrome with links to the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo said on Saturday.

“The illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers,” Mr. Cuomo
said during his daily briefing in Manhattan. “This is new. This is
developing.”

As of Saturday, more than 73 children in New York have been sickened by
[the rare
illness,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/kawasaki-disease-coronavirus-children.html)
which has some similarities to [Kawasaki
disease](https://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/index.html) and was publicly
identified for the first time earlier this week.

Governor Cuomo said many of these children, some as young as toddlers,
did not show respiratory symptoms commonly associated with the
coronavirus when they were brought to area hospitals, but all of them
tested positive either for Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus, or for its antibodies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“So it is still very much a situation that is developing, but it is a
serious situation,” he added.

The state will be working with the New York Genome Center and
Rockefeller University to determine what is causing the illness, which
Governor Cuomo described on Saturday as “truly disturbing.”

When the coronavirus pandemic began ravaging the New York area two
months ago, the state found solace in the initial evidence that children
would be largely unaffected. That sense of relief was shattered this
week when a 5-year-old died in New York City of the newly discovered
disease, which doctors described as a “pediatric multisystem
inflammatory syndrome.” The inflammation of the blood vessels, Mr. Cuomo
said, causes “problems with their heart.”

Mr. Cuomo did not elaborate on the deaths of the two additional
children.

“We were laboring under the impression that young people were not
affected by Covid-19, and that was actually good news,” Mr. Cuomo said.
“We still have a lot to learn about this virus.”

Mr. Cuomo has asked parents to be vigilant in looking for symptoms such
as prolonged fever, severe abdominal pain, change in skin color, racing
heart and chest pain.

Before the announcement of the deaths attributed to the new illness,
fewer than four children under age 10 had died of the virus in New York,
according to the [most recent breakdown from the
state](https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Fatalities?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n).
Mr. Cuomo said the state was working with the Centers for Disease
Control to determine if the confounding illness had been affecting
children infected with the virus before this week.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is very possible that this has been going on for several weeks and
it hasn’t been diagnosed as related to Covid,” he said.

Mr. Cuomo also announced 226 more deaths due to the coronavirus, 10 more
than the number reported a day earlier.

“That number has been infuriatingly constant,” he said. “We would like
to see that number dropping at a faster rate that it is currently
dropping.”

Despite the setbacks, New York continued to make inroads in its fight
against the coronavirus, Mr. Cuomo
said.

New hospitalizations for Covid-19 patients remained relatively flat,
with 572 new patients being treated at city hospitals for the
coronavirus. On Friday, 604 people were hospitalized, and that number
hovered in the 600s this week.

## New cases and deaths continue to drop in New Jersey.

The number of new coronavirus cases and the number of people
hospitalized with the illness in New Jersey continued to drop, Gov.
Philip D. Murphy said Saturday.

Mr. Murphy reported 1,759 new cases, a drop of more than 200 from the
day before; that brought the total number of cases in the state to
137,085, as of Friday night, he said. He also announced 166 new deaths
in the state.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Our battle here is not a battle to just bring down numbers,” Mr. Murphy
said. “It’s a battle to save lives.”

The picture remained bleak at nursing homes. There have been more than
26,000 cases and 4,825 deaths, Mr. Murphy reported on Saturday,
accounting for more than half of the total number of deaths in the
state.

On Friday, the state reported the first death of a child under 18 years
old, but the governor said there was no evidence that the death of the
child was caused by the mysterious syndrome that has killed three
children in New York. Mr. Murphy said the child, who was 4, had an
underlying condition, but would not offer any more details because of
privacy concerns.

Mr. Murphy also announced there would be two “convalescent plasma”
collection sites set up in the northern part of the state. Convalescent
plasma is the term used for plasma that is removed from the blood of a
person who has recovered from a disease, then transfused into a patient
still battling it.

An American Red Cross collection site will open in Fairfield and another
at University Hospital in Newark on Monday, May 11.

To donate plasma, a person must have recovered from the coronavirus and
be symptom free, officials
said.

About an hour’s drive from New York City, the
[Dia:Beacon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/13/arts/design/dia-beacon.html)
art museum has been sitting empty for nearly two months. Mostly empty.

Landscapers have shown up to mulch the garden and a couple of staff
members have been fixing worn floorboards, all in preparation for some
elusive date when visitors will trickle back into the museum’s bright,
airy rooms.

This uncertain future became a bit more conceivable this week when Gov.
Andrew M. Cuomo [outlined his phased
plan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/nyregion/coronavirus-reopen-cuomo-ny.html)
for reopening during the pandemic. The plan is to allow upstate areas to
transition back to normal life before the downstate regions do, but only
after they reach certain public health benchmarks.

New York has classified arts institutions in the fourth and final phase
of businesses that will be allowed to reopen, after restaurants, hotels
and retail stores.

Still, the directors of community theaters, museums and art centers in
the [Mid-Hudson region](https://esd.ny.gov/regions/mid-hudson) and
beyond were relieved: As they had hoped, an institution like the
Herkimer County Historical Society, which typically hosts about five
visitors at a time in the summer, will be able to open up sooner than,
say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

But they realize it will mean working for several weeks to transform
their institutions so that visitors will feel safe.

“We’re going to try to create a contact-free experience from the moment
a visitor steps onto our property,” said Paul S. D’Ambrosio, the
president of the Fenimore Art Museum, a renovated 1930s Georgian Revival
mansion in Cooperstown, N.Y., which is among the regions that could open
soonest.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To put visitors at ease, Dia plans to institute a timed-ticket system to
limit the number of people in the building, and is installing hands-free
faucets in the restrooms. Upon the reopening, gallery attendants would
be tasked with regulating the number of people in each
room.

As New York’s stay-at-home order has all but decimated the city’s
economy over the last few weeks, millions of vulnerable residents have
turned to charity organizations for shelter, food and other necessities.
But a new report suggests the aid many New Yorkers have come to rely on
during the pandemic may not be sustainable for very
long.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

[The report, just released by the Center for an Urban Future, a research
institute](https://nycfuture.org/research/essential-yet-vulnerable),
concluded that many go-to charity organizations are facing a crippling
combination of increasing overhead costs and diminishing revenues.

The report warns that many human service nonprofits, like The Catholic
Charities of the Archdiocese of New York and Good Shepherd Services, may
find it difficult to keep their doors open if city and state governments
don’t commit to future funding. It cited multiple organizations that had
already predicted extra costs or revenue losses exceeding $1 million.

The message from city hall and Albany regarding funding has been
ominous. Mr. de Blasio recently announced that the city will need to
make more than “$2 billion in very tough budget cuts” to balance a city
budget battered by the health crisis. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has publicly
stated, “We can’t spend what we don’t have.”

“When all the dust settles, it’s the provider community that’s going to
be holding the bill for having fully accommodated all of the decisions
both the city and state have made,” Bill Baccaglini, president and CEO
of New York Foundling, a child welfare organization, said in the report.
“We’re hoping that everybody, at the end of the day, makes us whole.”

The organizations’ inability to hold spring and summer fund-raisers,
which bring in millions of dollars a year, is particularly compounding
to the problem, according to the
report.

With [cold and rainy weather expected in the Northeast over the next few
days](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/northeast-polar-vortex-snow.html),
New York City’s transit agency announced on Friday night that it would
provide stationary buses outside some end-of-the-line subway stations
this weekend as shelter for homeless people.

The M.T.A., which operates the city’s subway and bus system, [began
shutting down the subway system
overnight](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/nyregion/nyc-subway-close-coronavirus.html)
on Wednesday, forcing those who otherwise would have ridden throughout
the night to accept shelter offered by city employees or find their own.

The M.T.A. is providing 40 buses at 30 stations, and the vehicles will
be controlled by the Police Department after they are dropped off, the
transit agency said.

In a statement announcing the move, transit officials reiterated that
the M.T.A. is “not a social services agency” and stressed that the buses
were a short-term solution. They called on the city, which requested the
buses, “to step up and take responsibility for providing safe shelter
for those individuals experiencing
homelessness.”

To hop on the train, any train, earbuds intact, alone in the crowd on
the way somewhere else. To walk out of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
exhausted as if from a march. The sweet-potato fries and a beer at Tubby

remembers you take it black.

Sunday Mass and the bakery after. Seeing old friends in the synagogue.
Play dates. The High Line. Hugs.

[Ask New Yorkers what they miss most, nearly two months into

To hear their answers is to witness a perfect version of the city built
from the ground up, a place refracted through a lens of loss, where the
best parts are huge and the annoyances become all but invisible.

The cheap seats in the outfield, the shouting to be heard at happy hour.
Meeting cousins with a soccer ball in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The din of
the theater as you scan the Playbill before the lights go down.

“I miss my gym equipment,” said Barbara James of Brooklyn.

“The lamb over rice from the food cart by my office, at Seventh and
49th,” said Chris Meredith of East Harlem.

“Just everything,” sighed a police officer sitting behind the wheel of
his vehicle in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, last week. “I miss
everything.”

The coronavirus outbreak has brought much of life in New York to a halt
and there is no clear end in sight. But there are also moments that
offer a sliver of strength, hope, humor or some other type of relief: a
joke from a stranger on line at the supermarket; a favor from a friend
down the block; a great meal ordered from a restaurant we want to
survive; trivia night via Zoom with the bar down the street.
