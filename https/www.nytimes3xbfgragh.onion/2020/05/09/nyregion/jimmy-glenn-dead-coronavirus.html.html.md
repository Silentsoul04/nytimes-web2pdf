*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Jimmy Glenn, a former amateur boxer and trainer whose gym on 42nd Street
succumbed to Times Square’s redevelopment, but whose nearby bar has
resisted the area’s drastic changes for nearly a half-century, died on
Thursday in Manhattan. He was 89.

The cause was complications of the coronavirus, his son Adam Glenn said.

Mr. Glenn opened the bar Jimmy’s Corner, on West 44th Street between
Sixth and Seventh Avenues, in 1971, the year Joe Frazier defeated
Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden in the so-called Fight of the
Century. He made it a shrine to boxing, filling it with photos, posters
and other memorabilia.

If Mr. Glenn was not off training a fighter or working in a boxer’s
corner as a cutman, he was at the bar six nights a week. It was a small
and simple joint, serving drinks and snacks, and it reduced costs by not
serving meals.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Seven years after opening Jimmy’s Corner, he opened the Times Square
Boxing Club, over a bar in a small building on 42nd Street near
Broadway. It was the newest gym in the city, but it was never a
moneymaker; Mr. Glenn subsidized it with earnings from Jimmy’s Corner.

But for Mr. Glenn, a friendly man with a gentle voice, owning a gym was
a natural business. He loved training young fighters. One night he sat
at his bar and talked with The Daily News about the ambitious young
boxers he was mentoring. “Once you get boxing in your blood,” he
observed, “it don’t leave.”

He closed the gym 15 years later, but Jimmy’s Corner endured.

James Lee Glenn was born on Aug. 18, 1930, in Monticello, S.C. His
mother, Susie (Glenn) Robertson, was a domestic worker. When James was
about 7 his mother left him with his grandfather, a sharecropper, and
moved to Washington. He reunited with her a few years later in Harlem,
when she married Jonah Robertson, a custodian and pastor. Jimmy spent
most of World War II with his grandfather but returned to Harlem in
1944.

Mr. Glenn began boxing in New York at the Police Athletic League and
studied the splendid [Sugar Ray
Robinson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1989/04/13/obituaries/sugar-ray-robinson-boxing-s-best-is-dead.html)
when he worked out at a Harlem gym. In late 1946, when he was 16, he
went to the Garden to see Robinson beat Tommy Bell to win his first
championship belt.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Glenn’s boxing career was modest. As an amateur fighter, from the
mid-1940s until around 1950, he had 14 wins and two defeats as a
middleweight and welterweight. His most famous bout was a loss to Floyd
Patterson, the future heavyweight champion.

“He beat me,” [Mr. Glenn told Seconds
Out](https://www.secondsout.com/columns/thomas-hauser/happy-birthday-jimmy-glenn),
a boxing website, in 2005. “Knocked me down a few times, broke my tooth.
But I went the distance.”

Mr. Glenn volunteered to train amateurs at a church community center in
Harlem and stayed there for about 15 years while working odd jobs,
including as a truck driver and a house painter.

He developed a reputation as a skilled trainer and cutman for boxers
like [Patterson, Michael Spinks, Jameel McCline, Aaron Davis, Bobby
Cassidy and Terrence
Alli.](https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Jimmy_Glenn) Most recently he
managed Travis Peterkin, a light heavyweight. In the late 1980s he
trained Mark Gastineau, a former defensive end for the New York Jets, in
his brief career as a
boxer.

Adam Glenn said that his father’s perseverance — and a friendly landlord
— kept Jimmy’s Corner in business, attracting boxers, promoters and
fans, who would drink there and watch bouts on television surrounded by
pictures of Mr. Glenn with Muhammad Ali (a friend who occasionally
visited Mr. Glenn’s gym) and posters that promoted Joe Louis-Max
Schmeling and Ali-George Foreman bouts.

“He and my mom built a solid business that required 24-hour attention,”
Adam Glenn said. “He had to make rules to keep the pimps and mob out,
and that meant standing up every day and telling people, ‘This is my
place and nobody is going to mess with us.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The landlord, the Durst Organization, did not try to push the bar out
with exorbitant rent.

“They loved my dad,” Adam Glenn said.

In addition to him, Mr. Glenn is survived by another son, James Jr.;
five daughters, Denise Mercado, Cheryl Glenn-Mitchell, Delana Glenn,
Anita Costa and Tanya Glenn; and six siblings. His wife, Swietlana
Garbarska**,** known as Swannie Glenn, died in 2015. His previous
marriage, to Wynola Ann Flemming, ended in divorce.

In 2018, [The New Yorker visited Jimmy’s
Corner](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/21/the-underdog-story-of-times-squares-still-gritty-jimmys-corner)
and took note of Mr. Glenn’s silvery horseshoe mustache and
marble-handled walking cane; his cheap prices, like $3 draft beers and
$3.50 drinks from the rail; and his permanence in a changing
neighborhood.

“From a distance of half a century,” The New Yorker wrote, “the bar’s
survival, in the heart of Times Square, has the feel of an underdog
story. The decades-long makeover of the neighborhood, from a convivial
Gomorrah to an outpost of Disneyland, couldn’t dislodge the place.”

Jimmy’s Corner has been closed during the coronavirus pandemic. But Adam
Glenn vowed that it would
reopen.
