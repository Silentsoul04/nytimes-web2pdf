# The Class Divide: Remote Learning at 2 Schools, Private and Public

Some private schools provide online luxury learning during the pandemic.
As many public schools struggle to adjust, the nation’s educational gaps
widen.

For Rachel Warach’s class, the 133rd morning of first grade, numbered on
a poster board behind her, was similar to all of the previous mornings.

Her students from across Chicago spent 15 minutes working quietly on
math problems and writing in their journals. They split into small
reading groups, with Ms. Warach bouncing between them to offer feedback.
Later, there was an Earth Day discussion of “The Lorax” and a math
lesson on sorting everyday objects — rolls of tape, coins, pens —
according to shape.

There was a break for lunch and recess, followed by Hebrew class. All as
Oisabel sprawled on the floor, Shira snuggled against her mom, and a

This is first grade at a private school determined to make remote
education during the coronavirus as similar as possible to what it
looked like before the pandemic. Chicago Jewish Day School provides four
hours and 15 minutes of daily live instruction, including yoga, art and
music. Students even do messy baking projects over Zoom, with
[parents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/10/us/coronavirus-giving-birth-new-mothers.html)
as sous chefs.

It bears little resemblance to the more typical experience that Jacob
Rios is having in Philadelphia, where he attends first grade at a public
school, Spruance Elementary.

Jacob did not see his teacher via video screen until late April; the
district spent the first several weeks of the shutdown focused on
training staff members to use remote teaching tools, distributing
laptops to students and getting meals to low-income families, which make
up a majority of the district’s population.

Now Jacob’s teacher, Dolores Morris, meets with her students each
morning for an hour — Jacob’s only live video instruction, according to
his mother. About 11 of the 26 students in the class attend daily, Ms.
Morris said.

A close look at these two very different first-grade classes in two of
America’s largest cities shows how [the coronavirus

done nothing to level the playing field of American education, and
instead has widened the gaps that have always existed.

About 10 percent of American children attend private schools, not all of
which have been leaders in online education. And there are disparities
in the public system, too, where some schools have done much more than
others to get online instruction up and running effectively. But what
the pandemic has made clear is that remote education, especially of the
youngest students, requires a rare mix of enthusiastic school
leadership, teacher expertise and homes equipped with everything
children need to learn
effectively.

At Chicago Jewish Day School, students who need extra help are being
tutored in phonics via Zoom, or meeting remotely with a social worker.
The school has sent home books, dry-erase boards, markers and other
needed supplies. Parents have provided the rest: internet access, iPads,
and quiet study nooks in well-appointed homes filled with pianos, books
and tasteful wooden play kitchens.

The system has been up and running since mid-March.

Remote learning at the Chicago school is not perfect. There are spotty
Wi-Fi connections, stray emojis in the chat panel and children who
wander away from the screen. But there is little doubt that in a nation
of over 100,000 shuttered schools, these children continue to receive a
luxury good — one whose list price is $28,000 per year.

In Ms. Morris’s class in Philadelphia, Jacob is one of the more
fortunate students. His mother, Brenda Rios, sits by his side to help
him with assignments. She is off work from her usual part-time job
preparing meals at a preschool.

Because so many parents of the other students are essential workers —
prison guards, cleaners, nursing assistants — Ms. Morris knows they may
not be available to offer hands-on support. Still, she is trying to look
on the bright side.

“I’m thanking God that I can at least see their faces,” she said.

That is rare in the world of coronavirus-altered learning. The Center on
Reinventing Public Education, a think tank, examined the remote learning
policies of 100 public school districts and charter networks nationwide.
It found that just 22 of them are requiring real-time teaching — and
just 10 of those systems are teaching live in all grades, including
early elementary school.

The country’s three largest districts, in New York City, Los Angeles and
Chicago, are not requiring teachers to do any live video instruction,
though some individual schools are choosing to do so.

It is a different story in many private schools, both independent and
parochial. Although associations said they did not have any hard data on
the average number of hours that students in their networks were
receiving live instruction, examples from around the country typically
show a gap with public schools.

The reasons are clear: Private school students are more likely to live
in homes with good internet access, computers and physical space for
children to focus on academics. Parents are less likely to be working
outside the home and are more available to guide young children through
getting online and staying logged in — entering user names and
passwords, navigating between windows and programs.

And unlike their public-school counterparts, private schoolteachers are
generally not unionized, giving their employers more leverage in laying
out demands for remote work. Some public school unions [have
won](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/us/coronavirus-teachers-unions-school-home.html)
strict limits on video-teaching requirements, arguing that it can be
difficult for educators to teach live from home when many are also
taking care of their own children, whose schools and day cares are also
closed.

In Philadelphia, Ms. Morris, a 42-year veteran, is in her last semester
before retirement, and it looks nothing like the farewell she expected.
Nevertheless, she has thrown herself into learning the technology to
teach remotely. Often, she is texting and emailing with parents while
simultaneously interacting with her students via Google Classroom.

A recent Monday morning was devoted to a phonics lesson on the sound
“oy.” Ms. Morris used Google Classroom to display vocabulary words on
slides — “enjoy,” “soil,” “annoy” — and Jacob’s mother, Ms. Rios, helped
him complete an online activity identifying the various spellings of the
sound.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Rios, home alone with three sons, said she appreciated Ms. Morris’s
dedication to her students at a difficult time. Still, the transition
online had been rocky. At first, Ms. Rios was not sure how to operate
the district-provided Chromebook. Since then, much of the day’s activity
has revolved around worksheets and compliance checks, which can be
maddening to submit online.

For one art lesson, Jacob watched a video about Vincent van Gogh, then
had to fill out an “exit ticket,” writing what he had learned about the
painter. Like any first grader, Jacob needed help to craft complete
sentences on the computer. Then, after submitting his answer, Ms. Rios
was required to click to another screen to report that he had finished
the
activity.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Sometimes during live lessons, Ms. Rios can see via the video feed that
another child is confused — they have not opened the right window or
clicked on the right link — and does not have an adult nearby to help
them follow along.

“I was almost in tears today,” she said. “It’s excruciating to watch
that — a child who wants to learn and isn’t able to.”

Ms. Morris, too, is frustrated by the limitations of online learning,
especially by the fact that she cannot always see students’ reactions
while she is presenting material to them, to check that they understand.
She can tell that using the system is difficult for first graders,
because even some strong students are submitting blank assignments,
meaning they most likely did the work, but their answers did not get
recorded.

In Chicago, there are many reasons the Jewish Day School was able to
handle the transition to remote learning so well. The school closed for
students ahead of most others in Illinois. That allowed administrators
to spend several days, before the building shut down, training staff
members on how to use online tools.

The school’s curriculum is based around hands-on activities and
discussion, which means young children learning from home do not need to
be as adept at typing as in schools that assign more structured, written
worksheets.

And crucially, families in the school are generally stable economically
and available to closely supervise their children’s education.

[Given the
possibility](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html)
that schools will remain at least partly closed in the fall, Chicago
Jewish Day School is now marketing itself as a leader in remote
learning, with a [slick video aimed at
parents](https://vimeo.com/409618723?fbclid=IwAR3GArK9URuzo5b3YMRZtVaP6hRp0eektfrxCQV-_INSp0g8oQpStZHn7YU).
School leaders hope to increase enrollment at a time when requests for
financial aid may go up as donations decrease because of the economic
downturn. Already, 57 percent of families at the school receive some
assistance with tuition.

Parents in Ms. Warach’s class said they had been pleasantly surprised by
the effectiveness of online first grade.

Among them is Caroline Musin Berkowitz, a nonprofit manager, and her
husband, a legal analyst. They are both working from their apartment
while taking care of their two young children. Having 6-year-old Shira
engaged with school for most of the day, sitting across from her parents
at the dining room table with headphones on, provides some respite.

The family has no qualms about re-enrolling Shira in the fall, even
though they are not getting the exact experience they thought they were
paying for.

“We made a choice to go with private school over public school for so
many reasons,” Ms. Musin Berkowitz said, “and the idea of a global
pandemic and school moving to online was not one of them.”

Now, she added, “I can’t even describe how beneficial it’s been.”
