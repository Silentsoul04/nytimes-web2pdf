## “We should go ahead and call this a ‘shecession.’”

*— C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for
Women’s Policy Research*

The unemployment numbers released on Friday confirmed what we had all
anticipated: The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic
is staggering, or as one research analyst at Bank of America put it to
The Times, [“literally off the
charts.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/08/business/economy/april-jobs-report.html)

The scale of the crisis is unlike anything since the Great Depression.
And for the first time in decades, this crisis has a predominantly
nonwhite, female face.

“I think we should go ahead and call this a ‘shecession,’” said C.
Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s
Policy Research, in a nod to the 2008 recession that came to be known as
[the
“mancession”](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/07/its-not-just-a-recession-its-a-mancession/20991/)
because more men were affected.

Women accounted for 55 percent of the 20.5 million jobs lost in April,
according to [the Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm), raising
the unemployment rate for adult women to about 15 percent from 3.1
percent in February. In comparison, the unemployment rate for adult men
was 13
percent.

Women of color fared worse, with unemployment rates for black women at
16.4 percent and Hispanic women at 20.2 percent.

According to an [analysis by the National Women’s Law
Center](https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jobs-Day-April-Factsheet.pdf),
this is the first time since 1948 that the female unemployment rate has
reached double digits.

The April jobs represent an abrupt, disappointing reversal from a major
milestone in December, when women held [more payroll jobs than
men](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/21/upshot/womens-gains-in-the-work-force-conceal-a-problem.html)
for the first time in about a decade.

The biggest reason for these losses is that the industries hardest hit
by the pandemic — leisure, hospitality, education and even some parts of
health care — are “disproportionately nonwhite and female,” said Diane
Lim, senior adviser for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan
research initiative.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For years, those industries had been the fastest growing parts of the
American economy, Lim noted, driving the strong job numbers and growth.
At the same time, male-dominated industries, like manufacturing, were
shrinking.

As a result, women were doing better in the labor market before the
pandemic.

Women “were making some real gains,” Jasmine Tucker, a researcher at the
law center, said. “Now there’s this huge step back.” According to the
N.W.L.C. analysis, this crisis has in one month wiped out all of the job
gains that women had made in the past decade.

But female-dominated jobs, like hospitality or child care, tend to also
be underpaid and undervalued, which means that many of the newly
unemployed women now have less of a financial cushion to fall back on,
said Mason, of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. The problem is
compounded for [single
mothers](https://iwpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/QF-Breadwinner-Mothers-by-Race-FINAL.pdf);
a [third of single mothers were already living below the poverty
line](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/04/25/the-changing-profile-of-unmarried-parents/)
and, since February, a million of them have lost their
jobs.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Experts say it’s unlikely that those jobs will snap right back when
states reopen, because much of the recovery will depend on consumers who
are already skittish and financially struggling. With no vaccine or cure
yet, “we just don’t know how people are going to feel about going back
to their favorite restaurants,” Lim, the senior adviser, said. “How many
people are going to take cruises from now on? How many people are going
to jump on flights and take vacations?”

All of the uncertainty only reinforces the need for more support and
protections for women and families, Mason said, adding that she is
somewhat encouraged by the action in Congress so far.

“Just a couple months ago, the things that we all said were impossible,
we’re now doing, like basic income and paid sick leave,” she explained.
