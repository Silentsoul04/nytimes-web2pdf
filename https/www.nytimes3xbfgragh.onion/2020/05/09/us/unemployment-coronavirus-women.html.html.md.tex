A majority of the jobs lost in April were held by women, a sharp
reversal of gains in the labor market.

The unemployment numbers released on Friday confirmed what we had all
anticipated: The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic
is staggering, or as one research analyst at Bank of America put it to
The Times,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/08/business/economy/april-jobs-report.html}{``literally
off the charts.''}

The scale of the crisis is unlike anything since the Great Depression.
And for the first time in decades, this crisis has a predominantly
nonwhite, female face.

``I think we should go ahead and call this a `shecession,''' said C.
Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women's
Policy Research, in a nod to the 2008 recession that came to be known as
\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/07/its-not-just-a-recession-its-a-mancession/20991/}{the
``mancession''} because more men were affected.

Women accounted for 55 percent of the 20.5 million jobs lost in April,
according to \href{https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm}{the
Bureau of Labor Statistics}, raising the unemployment rate for adult
women to about 15 percent from 3.1 percent in February. In comparison,
the unemployment rate for adult men was 13 percent.

Women of color fared worse, with unemployment rates for black women at
16.4 percent and Hispanic women at 20.2 percent.

According to an
\href{https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jobs-Day-April-Factsheet.pdf}{analysis
by the National Women's Law Center}, this is the first time since 1948
that the female unemployment rate has reached double digits.

The April jobs represent an abrupt, disappointing reversal from a major
milestone in December, when women held
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/21/upshot/womens-gains-in-the-work-force-conceal-a-problem.html}{more
payroll jobs than men} for the first time in about a decade.

The biggest reason for these losses is that the industries hardest hit
by the pandemic --- leisure, hospitality, education and even some parts
of health care --- are ``disproportionately nonwhite and female,'' said
Diane Lim, senior adviser for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a
nonpartisan research initiative.

For years, those industries had been the fastest growing parts of the
American economy, Lim noted, driving the strong job numbers and growth.
At the same time, male-dominated industries, like manufacturing, were
shrinking.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/05/09/multimedia/09ihw-employment2/09ihw-employment2-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

As a result, women were doing better in the labor market before the
pandemic.

Women ``were making some real gains,'' Jasmine Tucker, a researcher at
the law center, said. ``Now there's this huge step back.'' According to
the N.W.L.C. analysis, this crisis has in one month wiped out all of the
job gains that women had made in the past decade.

But female-dominated jobs, like hospitality or child care, tend to also
be underpaid and undervalued, which means that many of the newly
unemployed women now have less of a financial cushion to fall back on,
said Mason, of the Institute for Women's Policy Research. The problem is
compounded for

mothers}; a
\href{https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/04/25/the-changing-profile-of-unmarried-parents/}{third
of single mothers were already living below the poverty line} and, since
February, a million of them have lost their jobs.

    its recommendation of six feet} on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    districts --- Los Angeles and San Diego --- said on July 13, that

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your
    community.

Experts say it's unlikely that those jobs will snap right back when
states reopen, because much of the recovery will depend on consumers who
are already skittish and financially struggling. With no vaccine or cure
yet, ``we just don't know how people are going to feel about going back
to their favorite restaurants,'' Lim, the senior adviser, said. ``How
many people are going to take cruises from now on? How many people are
going to jump on flights and take vacations?''

All of the uncertainty only reinforces the need for more support and
protections for women and families, Mason said, adding that she is
somewhat encouraged by the action in Congress so far.

``Just a couple months ago, the things that we all said were impossible,
we're now doing, like basic income and paid sick leave,'' she explained.
