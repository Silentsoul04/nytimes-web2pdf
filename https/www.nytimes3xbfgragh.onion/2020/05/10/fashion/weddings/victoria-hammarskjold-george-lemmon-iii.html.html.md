Victoria Frances Hammarskjold and George Blackmore Lemmon III were
married May 9. The couple self-united, as allowed by Pennsylvania law,
at their home in Devon, Pa.

The couple had intended to marry that same day at the clubhouse at
Windsor, a residential community in Vero Beach, Fla., where the bride’s
parents live, but changed their plans because of the coronavirus
pandemic. Instead, they will celebrate their first anniversary there in
2021.

Mrs. Lemmon, 26, is a project manager in Devon for the digital division
of Mercer, a human resources consultancy. She graduated from Princeton.

She is a daughter of Christine Riker Hammarskjold and Christian U.
Hammarskjold of Vero Beach. The bride’s father retired as the president
and chief executive of the United Safety and Survivability Corporation
Group, a manufacturer of seating for transit and rail, and also
fire-suppression equipment, in Exton, Pa. Her mother was a stay-at-home
parent, and is now a volunteer fund-raiser at the Humane Society of Vero
Beach and Indian River County, and is also a volunteer at the Homeless
Children’s Foundation of Indian River County, both in Vero Beach.

Mr. Lemmon, also 26, is the acquisition analyst at the Brynavon Group, a
family office that specializes in management buyouts in Villanova, Pa.,
and that was founded by his grandfather, George B. Lemmon. The groom
graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where he played varsity
squash for four years.

He is a son of Elise Harrison Lemmon and George B. Lemmon Jr. of
Villanova. The groom’s mother was an investment banking analyst at J.P.
Morgan, in New York, before becoming a stay-at-home parent. His father
is the president of the Brynavon Group.

The groom’s great-grandfather was Daniel Peterkin Jr., who was the
president of what was then called the Morton Salt Company, in Chicago.

The couple began dating while in high school, and didn’t again live in
the same ZIP code until 2018, when they moved in together in New York.
