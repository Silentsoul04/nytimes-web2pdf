We're only in the fifth month of 2020, but it has already been an
uncommonly painful one in the world of music --- the list of greats who
have died has been long and wide-ranging.

Two of these artists ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/arts/music/tony-allen-dead.html}{Tony
Allen}, who played with Fela Kuti in Africa 70, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/arts/music/florian-schneider-kraftwerk-dead.html}{Florian
Schneider}, one of the founders of Kraftwerk --- were working on
evolutions in rhythm in the same time frame but in vastly different
fashions. Allen, influenced by various regional African styles and
American jazz, among other things, gave Kuti's Afrobeat a complex
undertow, both steady and fanciful. Schneider, along with his co-founder
Ralf Hütter, helped turn Kraftwerk into a band that embodied the
possibilities of technology, and which set the table for electro, new
wave, techno and more.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about these twin pillars of
rhythm, and how they were responding to similar impulses --- thousands
of miles apart, and with radically different tools at their disposal.

Guests:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Jon Pareles, The New York Times's chief pop music critic
\item
  Joseph Patel, a former music journalist and the producer of the
  forthcoming documentaries ``Black Woodstock'' and ``Contact High: A
  Visual History of Hip-Hop''
\end{itemize}
