88}\label{edith-richemond-a-haitian-bootstrap-success-story-dies-at-88}}

With an 8th-grade education, she emigrated to Brooklyn, where she
invested her savings in real estate, rented out apartments and ran two
laundromats.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Edith Richemond's moniker in her Brooklyn neighborhood was ``Big,'' not
in the mocking way that portly people are sometimes called ``Tiny'' or
tall ones ``Shorty,'' but because of the disproportionately large heart
that was assumed to beat within her diminutive frame.

But the nickname alluded not just to her giving spirit. In her tightly
knit Haitian immigrant enclave in East Flatbush, she was known as much
for her gumption, having arrived in New York with little money or
education but with a drive to succeed.

And that she did, ending up investing in real estate and owning two
laundromats. To her niece Athalie LaPamuk, her aunt was ``Big'' because
she was also ``a big deal'' in her neighborhood.

Ms. Richemond died of complications of the novel coronavirus on April 25
at a Brooklyn nursing home, her niece said. She was 88.

``It's a cruel twist of fate that we can't have a proper funeral for her
right now,'' Ms. LaPamuk said, ``because I don't even think there's a
funeral home in Brooklyn large enough to fit the crowd of people that
would have attended.''

Ms. Richemond followed in the footsteps of countless entrepreneurial
immigrants lured to New York by the prospect of a better life for
herself and her children.

``What makes it so impressive is that with a primary school education
she was able to move to New York and buy buildings to rent apartments
and house her laundromats,'' Ms. LaPamuk said. ``She took a skill she
learned as a girl in Haiti --- washing clothes --- and made a living out
of it.''

Ms. Richemond was born Marie Edith Duverger on Feb. 6, 1932, in Marchand
Dessalines, the first capital of independent Haiti. Her father, Athanas
Delcham, was a judge who also served several terms as mayor. Her mother,
Adele Duverger, was a seamstress.

One of 10 siblings, Ms Richemond left school after the eighth grade to
care for her younger brothers and sisters and help support the family by
washing clothes.

She emigrated to New York in the 1960s, when she was in her 30s, and
married Jacques Richemond in 1969. He drove a school bus and helped out
in her laundromats; he died in 2015. In addition to her niece, her
survivors include her son, Jude Duverger; a brother, Arnoux Duverger;
and a sister, Adeline Duverger.

After arriving in New York, Ms. Richemond worked in a textile factory
and saved enough to begin investing in real estate, buying several
three-story buildings with retail space below and apartments above.

One laundromat she opened, on Rutland Road, had a kitchen in which she
would prepare Haitian meals every day and offer them to her neighbors
free of charge. What's more, Ms. LaPamuk said, ``she would do laundry
for single moms and other people down on their luck in the neighborhood
without charging them.''

The laundromat became a community hub, where Haitian expatriates would
gather to reminisce, debate politics and play cards or dominoes.

Ms. Richemond sold the properties after she had a stroke in 2013.

``She defined the concept of bootstrapping,'' Ms. LaPamuk said. ``She
was determined to become successful despite her limited education.''
