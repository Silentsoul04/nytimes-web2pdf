# Amid Covid-19, a Call for M.D.s to Mail the Abortion Pill

</div>

For decades, the consensus has been that F.D.A. regulations require that
the abortion pill be obtained in a clinic. But that’s changing.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last fall, months before America’s first outbreak of the coronavirus,
Francine Coeytaux and Elisa Wells, co-founders of the
[abortion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/us/abortion-supreme-court.html)
rights advocacy group Plan C, were reaching out to doctors with a
question they said was urgent:

“Would you be willing to mail the ‘abortion pills’ to women in their
homes?”

For millions of women across America, abortion access was [already
severely
limited](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/05/31/us/abortion-clinics-map.html)
— the result of [restrictive new
laws](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/29/us/louisiana-abortion-heartbeat-bill.html)
that have forced dozens of clinics to close their doors. Now, with the
spread of Covid-19, some states have classified abortions as
“nonessential,” putting access to the procedure [even further out of
reach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-texas-ohio-abortion.html).

But the pandemic has also shone a spotlight on what’s known as
“medication abortion,” or the use of pills to terminate an early
pregnancy. And Ms. Coeytaux and Ms. Wells say that has only broadened
support for their efforts to make the medicines available by mail.

The medicines are mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks the
effects of progesterone, a hormone without which the lining of the
uterus begins to break down, while misoprostol, to be taken 24 to 48
hours later, induces contractions of the uterus that expel its contents.
Both drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use up
to [10 weeks into
pregnancy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/31/health/abortion-pill-mifeprex-ru-486-fda.html).

With its approval in 2000, mifepristone promised to substantially expand
access to abortion care in the United States. (Misoprostol, which had
been developed as anti-ulcer therapy, was already [in
use](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/28/opinion/from-uruguay-a-model-for-making-abortion-safer.html).)
Suddenly, what had previously required a surgical procedure could be
done safely and effectively [anywhere a woman
chose](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2004/01/convincing-new-providers-offer-medical-abortion-what-will-it-take).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But approval came with stringent restrictions on mifepristone’s
distribution.

Regulated under what’s called a “risk evaluation and mitigation
strategy,” or R.E.M.S., mifepristone can be dispensed only in clinics,
medical offices and hospitals; only by, or under the supervision of, a
doctor certified to prescribe the drug; and only to patients who have
signed an F.D.A.-approved patient agreement.

Abortion rights advocates have long held that there is [no medical
justification](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb5vzd/fda-abortion-pill-regulations-controversy)
for applying that regulation to mifepristone, the safety of which has
been [well
established](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1612526), and
that the decision to do so was politically motivated. And for years,
[leading](https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/advocacy/prevention/women/LT-FDA-MifepristoneREMS-062019.pdf)
[medical
societies](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/policyfinder/detail/mifepristone?uri=%2FAMADoc%2FHOD.xml-H-100.948.xml)
and [reproductive](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1908305)
[health](https://emaaproject.org/) experts have petitioned the F.D.A. to
loosen the restrictions or lift them altogether.

Now, as stay-at-home orders further impede access to clinic-based
abortions, prominent voices — including those of [attorneys general
from 21
states](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/final_ag_letter_hhs_medication_abortion_2020.pdf),
a former [F.D.A.
official](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494914-the-uk-allows-home-use-of-the-abortion-pill-the-us-should-do-the-same),
and The Times [editorial
board](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/opinion/abortion-law-coronavirus.html)
— have joined calls for the F.D.A. to act.

But what if the consensus understanding of the regulation is wrong? What
if it doesn’t actually prohibit doctors from mailing mifepristone?

It’s a question at the heart of the debate around abortion access and
one that has not been considered by a court. And for that reason, Ms.
Wells and Ms. Coeytaux feel they are on firm legal ground in assembling
what they envision as a national network of new providers — those who,
like them, embrace a broader interpretation of the rules.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Most U.S. providers have taken the R.E.M.S. to mean that mifepristone
cannot be mailed,” Ms. Wells said. “We disagree. We think providers have
clear latitude to ‘dispense’ the drug from their offices and then ship
it to patients, and we’re hearing from more and more of our colleagues
who see it the same way.”

“I strongly believe that the R.E.M.S. does not limit the ability to send
mifepristone by mail,” said Dr. Mitchell Creinin, a veteran medical
researcher and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University
of California, Davis, who is not affiliated with Plan C.

“It says you have to dispense the drug to the patient in the clinic,”
Dr. Creinin added. “But the act of distribution — by mail, by overnight
delivery, whatever — is different than dispensing.”

In early March, Plan C called on doctors across the country to take the
first step for mailing mifepristone: registering with [Danco
Laboratories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2000/09/30/us/abortion-pill-distributor-energized-by-new-mission.html)
or [GenBioPro](https://genbiopro.com/prescribing/), the only
F.D.A.-approved manufacturers.

Already, Ms. Wells said, dozens of doctors have responded. “And we know
of several who have started shipping the pills or are planning to soon,”
she added.

A family physician, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of
harassment, said she had never provided abortion care when a friend
introduced her to Plan C in early April. After confirming that her
malpractice insurance covered abortion by medication and reviewing the
guidelines for managing patients, she enrolled in GenBioPro’s [provider
program](https://genbiopro.com/ordering/) and filled out a prescriber
agreement attesting to the R.E.M.S.

“It says all of the things you would want it to say, like that there has
to be a doctor-patient relationship, that you have to educate the
patient and obtain consent, and that you have to log and label the drug
correctly,” she said. “But how you deliver it to the patient — by hand?
By mail? By throwing it over a fence? It says nothing about that.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The paperwork took her less than a day, she said. “And I thought, oh my
God, why didn’t I do this a long time ago? Honestly, I’m a little
ashamed that I didn’t.”

When they started Plan C in 2016, Ms. Wells and Ms. Coeytaux — who in
the late 1990s were instrumental in making [emergency contraception
available over the
counter](https://www.whijournal.com/article/S1049-3867\(00\)00072-4/fulltext)
— set out to raise awareness about self-managed abortion through a
grass-roots approach. They held meetings [in their
homes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/27/opinion/spreading-plan-c-to-end-pregnancy.html?_r=0),
trained groups of millennial “ambassadors,” and put out [a report
card](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/10/22/plancreportcardnew.pdf)
ranking the various vendors offering pills online.

While Plan C was getting the word out, the nonprofit research group
[Gynuity Health Projects](https://gynuity.org/) was gathering evidence
for advocacy efforts aimed at removing the regulation. In 2016, the
group launched a direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion service as part
of a [study in four
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/11/health/abortion-study-mail.html),
with pills shipped to women in their homes.

Gynuity secured special permission from the F.D.A. under the Obama
administration to mail mifepristone and its program, called TelAbortion,
has been allowed to [continue ever
since](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/health/telabortion-abortion-telemedicine.html).
Over the past year, TelAbortion added eight new states and now operates
in a total of 13. But in terms of the number of patients served, the
program’s impact has been modest: It has shipped just 841 packages
containing abortion pills over a four-year period.

One reason is that the F.D.A. approved the study on the condition that
all patients arrange an in-person visit for an ultrasound to gauge their
gestational age. A routine ultrasound is [not considered
medically](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/requirements-ultrasound)
necessary for a first-trimester abortion; [research
shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21091926) that [most
women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152258) can accurately
recall their last menstrual period; and [new medical
protocols](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161512/#b0090)
are now changing the standard of care. But barring exceptions made for
the pandemic, the TelAbortion study can only serve patients who are able
to come in for a test.By comparison, the website [Aid
Access](https://aidaccess.org/), which does not require an ultrasound,
was serving almost 800 patients a month before the pandemic began.

Founded in 2018 by the Dutch physician and activist [Rebecca
Gomperts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2001/08/26/magazine/the-pro-choice-extremist.html),
Aid Access offers women in America who are less than nine weeks pregnant
the ability, for the first time, to obtain abortion pills by mail with a
prescription from a licensed physician. After writing the prescription,
Dr. Gomperts provides patients with instructions for how to request the
pills from an exporter in India.

Within its first year, Aid Access was contacted by more than 21,000
women in America, as requests for consultations flooded in from across
the country. The F.D.A. took notice. Last year, [the agency
accused](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/aidaccessorg-575658-03082019)
the organization of violating federal law and ordered it to stop
distributing the drugs in the United States. Dr. Gomperts responded by
[suing the
F.D.A.](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758871490/european-doctor-who-prescribes-abortion-pills-to-u-s-women-online-sues-fda),
claiming federal officials had seized medications prescribed to patients
through her website.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Amid the pandemic, demand for Dr. Gomperts’ services has surged. Since
late March, she says, “approximately 3,000 women living in the U.S. have
requested my help.” For a time, Dr. Gomperts had to suspend operations;
after India closed its airspace to international traffic, shipments from
the pharmacy she works with were halted. But with Plan C’s network, she
was able to find American providers registered with GenBioPro and ready
to mail.

“This is why I went to med school,” said a doctor in upstate New York
who is mailing the abortion drugs on behalf of Aid Access and also spoke
on condition of anonymity. “If there’s one thing I hope we can learn
from life under Covid, it’s to trust and empower women to take care of
themselves, and this is one way of doing that.”
