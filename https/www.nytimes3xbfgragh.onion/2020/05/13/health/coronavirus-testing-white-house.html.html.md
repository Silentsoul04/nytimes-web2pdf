A rapid coronavirus test used by the White House to screen its staff
could miss infections up to 48 percent of the time, according to a study
by researchers at N.Y.U. Langone Health.

[The
study](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biorxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.05.11.089896v1),
which has not yet been peer reviewed, evaluated the accuracy of the
test, Abbott ID Now, a machine about the size of a toaster oven that can
yield results in five to 13 minutes.

The product, which was given emergency authorization by the Food and
Drug Administration in late March, has been enthusiastically promoted by
President Trump — it was even used as a prop during at least one news
conference. Mr. Trump [has said the
tests](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rapid-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-provide-results-minutes/story?id=69875037)
are “highly
accurate.”

## The White House Uses This Device for Virus Testing. Some Results Might Be False.

Racing to contain an outbreak in the White House, the Trump
administration is testing staff members with a machine that can produce
fast results, but it was found in a new study to sometimes miss
infections.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

A White House spokesman did not immediately respond for comment.

There are [18,000 ID Now testing

in the United States, and the company says it has shipped 1.8 million of
the kits required for the machine to test for the virus. The so-called
point-of-care test is designed to be in doctor’s offices and clinics,
and it is being used in [drive-through testing

In a statement, the company defended its product, saying, “ID Now is an
important tool that delivers information where it’s needed most.” Abbott
said that its reported rate of false negatives — or missed infections —
was 0.02 percent and that the N.Y.U. study’s results were “not
consistent with other studies of the test.”

“It’s unclear if the samples were tested correctly in this study,” the
company said. “In communications with the users of the test, it is
performing as
expected.”

The authors of the N.Y.U. study said they evaluated the Abbott test
because they were considering using it to test emergency department
patients who were suspected of having the virus.

The test can use two kinds of swabs: a long, nasopharyngeal swab that is
inserted deep into the nose, where it meets the throat; and a shorter
nasal swab that can take samples from the nose or throat. A swab is then
taken to the testing unit for processing, [where it is swirled in
liquid](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2Finteractive%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Fus%2Fcoronavirus-testing-white-house.html),
which is then analyzed in the machine.

In April, [other hospitals and
researchers](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statnews.com%2F2020%2F04%2F16%2Frapid-coronavirus-test-commonly-used-in-u-s-may-miss-infections-in-some-situations%2F)
found that if swabs were stored in a liquid solution before being
inserted into the machine, the sample could become diluted, producing
negative results for those who were infected. Abbott later revised its
instructions to recommend placing a dry swab directly into the machine
after the sample was collected.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

The N.Y.U. researchers tested how the machine fared when the dry swabs
were used. They took two samples each from 101 emergency department
patients at N.Y.U. Langone Tisch Hospital who were suspected of having
Covid-19. One sample used the longer nasopharyngeal swab and was stored
in liquid. The second sample used dry nasal swabs. Each specimen was
tested on both the Abbott ID Now and another machine, the Cepheid
GeneXpert, which takes 45 minutes to yield a result and which has been
validated by N.Y.U. as acceptably
accurate.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

The researchers found that the Cepheid machine identified 31 of the 101
patients as positive for the virus. But even when the dry nasal swabs
were used, the Abbott ID Now identified only 16 people as positive. In
other words, 15 patients had the virus, but the Abbott ID Now test said
they were negative.

Using the dry nasal swab yielded less accurate results than when the
researchers used a nasopharyngeal swab that had been stored in liquid.
When those types of nasopharyngeal swabs were used, the Abbott missed
infections one-third of the time, the researchers said.

The White House did not respond to questions about which types of swabs
it uses.

The N.Y.U. researchers said that because the Abbott ID Now machine
missed so many infections — including in patients who had to be admitted
to the hospital — the technology is “unacceptable in our clinical
setting.”

The researchers said their study was limited by the small sample size,
as well as the one to two hours it took to transport the samples.
Although that was within the manufacturer’s recommendation of two hours,
the researchers noted that the test was intended to be used where the
patients were, not in a laboratory.
