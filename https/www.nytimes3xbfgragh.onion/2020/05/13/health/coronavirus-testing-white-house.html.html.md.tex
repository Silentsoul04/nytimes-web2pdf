A study found that the Abbott ID Now machine was less accurate when it
processed short, dry swabs.

A rapid coronavirus test used by the White House to screen its staff
could miss infections up to 48 percent of the time, according to a study
by researchers at N.Y.U. Langone Health.

\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.biorxiv.org\%2Fcontent\%2F10.1101\%2F2020.05.11.089896v1}{The
study}, which has not yet been peer reviewed, evaluated the accuracy of
the test, Abbott ID Now, a machine about the size of a toaster oven that
can yield results in five to 13 minutes.

The product, which was given emergency authorization by the Food and
Drug Administration in late March, has been enthusiastically promoted by
President Trump --- it was even used as a prop during at least one news
conference. Mr. Trump
\href{https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rapid-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-provide-results-minutes/story?id=69875037}{has

Racing to contain an outbreak in the White House, the Trump
administration is testing staff members with a machine that can produce
fast results, but it was found in a new study to sometimes miss
infections.

A White House spokesman did not immediately respond for comment.

There are
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.abbott.com\%2Fcorpnewsroom\%2Fproduct-and-innovation\%2Fan-update-on-abbotts-work-on-COVID-19-testing.html}{18,000
ID Now testing units} in the United States, and the company says it has
shipped 1.8 million of the kits required for the machine to test for the
virus. The so-called point-of-care test is designed to be in doctor's
offices and clinics, and it is being used in
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fcvshealth.com\%2Fcovid-19\%2Ftesting-information-locations}{drive-through
testing sites} around the country.

In a statement, the company defended its product, saying, ``ID Now is an
important tool that delivers information where it's needed most.''
Abbott said that its reported rate of false negatives --- or missed
infections --- was 0.02 percent and that the N.Y.U. study's results were
``not consistent with other studies of the test.''

``It's unclear if the samples were tested correctly in this study,'' the
company said. ``In communications with the users of the test, it is
performing as expected.''

The authors of the N.Y.U. study said they evaluated the Abbott test
because they were considering using it to test emergency department
patients who were suspected of having the virus.

The test can use two kinds of swabs: a long, nasopharyngeal swab that is
inserted deep into the nose, where it meets the throat; and a shorter
nasal swab that can take samples from the nose or throat. A swab is then
taken to the testing unit for processing,
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion\%2Finteractive\%2F2020\%2F05\%2F12\%2Fus\%2Fcoronavirus-testing-white-house.html}{where
it is swirled in liquid}, which is then analyzed in the machine.

In April,
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.statnews.com\%2F2020\%2F04\%2F16\%2Frapid-coronavirus-test-commonly-used-in-u-s-may-miss-infections-in-some-situations\%2F}{other
hospitals and researchers} found that if swabs were stored in a liquid
solution before being inserted into the machine, the sample could become
diluted, producing negative results for those who were infected. Abbott
later revised its instructions to recommend placing a dry swab directly
into the machine after the sample was collected.

The N.Y.U. researchers tested how the machine fared when the dry swabs
were used. They took two samples each from 101 emergency department
patients at N.Y.U. Langone Tisch Hospital who were suspected of having
Covid-19. One sample used the longer nasopharyngeal swab and was stored
in liquid. The second sample used dry nasal swabs. Each specimen was
tested on both the Abbott ID Now and another machine, the Cepheid
GeneXpert, which takes 45 minutes to yield a result and which has been
validated by N.Y.U. as acceptably accurate.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground

    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

The researchers found that the Cepheid machine identified 31 of the 101
patients as positive for the virus. But even when the dry nasal swabs
were used, the Abbott ID Now identified only 16 people as positive. In
other words, 15 patients had the virus, but the Abbott ID Now test said
they were negative.

Using the dry nasal swab yielded less accurate results than when the
researchers used a nasopharyngeal swab that had been stored in liquid.
When those types of nasopharyngeal swabs were used, the Abbott missed
infections one-third of the time, the researchers said.

The White House did not respond to questions about which types of swabs
it uses.

The N.Y.U. researchers said that because the Abbott ID Now machine
missed so many infections --- including in patients who had to be
admitted to the hospital --- the technology is ``unacceptable in our
clinical setting.''

The researchers said their study was limited by the small sample size,
as well as the one to two hours it took to transport the samples.
Although that was within the manufacturer's recommendation of two hours,
the researchers noted that the test was intended to be used where the
patients were, not in a laboratory.
