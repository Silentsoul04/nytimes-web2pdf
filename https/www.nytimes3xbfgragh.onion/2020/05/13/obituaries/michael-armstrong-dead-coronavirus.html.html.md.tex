\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Michael Armstrong, a longtime Democratic political reformer and the
onetime publisher of a well-loved Brooklyn newspaper, lost his wife,
Dnynia, to the novel coronavirus a month before he died from the same
disease. She was 80 and he was 79; they had been married 45 years.

Dnynia Armstrong had been fighting a kidney disorder that put her in the
Cobble Hill Health Center, a Brooklyn nursing home that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/nyregion/new-york-nursing-homes-coronavirus-deaths.html}{has
lost at least 55 residents to the virus}; the home was locked down
because of the outbreak.

Then the coronavirus struck her as well. She died on April 4.

Aram Bauman, a stepson, said that he had planned to take Mr. Armstrong
out for a picnic on April 16, the day of his mother's cremation, but
that when he got to the house Mr. Armstrong was incoherent and having
trouble breathing. Mr. Bauman called for an ambulance; Mr. Armstrong
died in the hospital on May 4.

Michael Allan Armstrong was born on Nov. 7, 1940, in Galion, Ohio, to
William and Mabel (Alder) Armstrong. He attended Pacific University in
Forest Grove, Ore.

In the mid-1960s he came to New York, where he worked at the public
relations firm Ruder Finn and bought a brownstone in Boerum Hill. His
involvement in politics began in 1970, when he managed
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1970/06/14/archives/students-work-for-rooney-rival-eikenberrys-stand-against-war-stirs.html}{the
congressional campaign of} Peter G. Eikenberry, a liberal candidate, in
an unsuccessful attempt to unseat an entrenched incumbent,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1975/10/28/archives/exrep-john-j-rooney-of-brooklyn-is-dead-at-71.html}{John
J. Rooney}.

Mr. Armstrong was best known for The Phoenix Newspaper, a community
publication run on a shoestring that he founded in 1972. It championed
the borough's brownstone revitalization movement and proved a training
ground for reporters and writers, including the author
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/05/26/magazine/how-jeannette-walls-spins-good-stories-out-of-bad-memories.html}{Jeannette
Walls}, who first showed up as an 18-year-old intern.

In her best-selling 2005 memoir, ``The Glass Castle,'' Ms. Walls
recalled: ``I'd never been happier in my life. I worked 90-hour weeks,
my telephone rang constantly, I was always hurrying off to interviews
and checking the 10-dollar Rolex I'd bought on the street to make sure I
wasn't running late, rushing back to file my copy, and staying up until
4 a.m. to set type when the typesetter quit. And I was bringing home
\$125 a week. If the check cleared.''

The checks often did not clear, recalled Irene Van Slyke, who worked at
the paper in the 1970s and '80s. But Mr. Armstrong ``could inspire
people,'' she said, ``even with the bounced checks.''

Both The Phoenix and its sister publication in Greenwich Village, The
Villager, won awards for their journalism. Mr. Armstrong sold both
papers in the early 1990s.

After leaving journalism, he returned to politics and government,
working for Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden and others. He
later ran a marketing consulting firm, Armstrong \& Associates.

In addition to Mr. Bauman, Mr. Armstrong's survivors include a
stepdaughter, Aisha Ricca; a daughter, Arija Noël, from a previous
marriage; a brother, Steve; and a sister, Jan Strickland.

Of her parents' relationship, Ms. Ricca said, ``His dedication was
unbelievable --- their love was insane.''

Even when his wife was in the locked-down nursing home, Mr. Armstrong
would wait outside the building on the three days a week she was taken
for dialysis treatments. When she was brought out to the medical
transport van, Ms. Ricca said, ``He would steal a kiss from his girl.''
When she finished the treatment, he would be there again with a
hamburger and a vanilla milkshake.

``She wasn't supposed to have it,'' Mr. Bauman said, ``but he wanted to
make her happy.''
