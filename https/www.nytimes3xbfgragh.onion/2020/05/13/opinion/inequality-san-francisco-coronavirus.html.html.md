One sun-drenched afternoon last month, I took a long solo bike ride
through the San Francisco Bay Area. I rode from my home to Mountain
View, near the once-desolate stretch of marsh that Google has leased
from NASA to build a monumental new campus. It looks like [a collection
of lunar bases made out of
origami](https://www.dezeen.com/2019/08/27/google-hq-big-heatherwick-the-111th/).

Construction has been paused under lockdown, and on the fetid plains
surrounding the million-square-foot project, birds sang and wildflowers
painted the horizon, and the trails that run beside the site were packed
to socially distant capacity with masked families on foot and wheel.

Bicycles and pets, not sirens and fridge-truck morgues, have become the
unlikely icons of the pandemic in the Bay Area. [Bike
shops](https://www.sfexaminer.com/the-city/san-francisco-bike-shops-are-booming-during-the-pandemic/)
and [animal
shelters](https://sfpublicpress.org/news/2020-04/want-to-foster-a-dog-get-on-the-waitlist-as-demand-soars-at-bay-area-shelters)
say they’ve been inundated with demand. With the streets free of cars
and full of people, the air clean, the cavernous office buildings empty
and their endless parking lots turned into carefree pedestrian plazas,
you’d be forgiven for mistaking some areas of Silicon Valley under
lockdown for outtakes from the “The Good Place.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On my way to the Google lunar landing base, I passed by Santiago Villa,
one of the area’s few remaining mobile-home parks. It was built in the
1960s as an affordable retirement community. In January, its residents,
who rent the space on which their mobile homes stand, petitioned the
City Council to [include trailer parks in Mountain View’s
rent-control](https://mv-voice.com/news/2020/01/30/city-council-agrees-in-theory-to-extend-rent-control-to-mountain-view-mobile-home-parks)
rules.

They’re worried that wealthy Googlers [looking for a kitschy
pied-à-terre](https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/18/16039104/google-santiago-villa-housing-4ac4b1ca49fe)near
the new campus will push them out. The anger has been rising. Last year,
the same City Council prohibited RVs and trailers — many of them used as
homes — from parking on the street; a petition to overturn the RV ban
[will be on the ballot in
November](https://www.mv-voice.com/news/2020/01/15/mountain-view-voters-to-decide-on-rv-parking-ban).

But as I rode past Santiago Villa, all that rancor felt like a remnant
of the Before Time. Everything was quiet — then, from one of the
trailers, a jolly trumpet began blowing loud and out of tune.

It was then that I first had the ghoulish idea: Could the coronavirus
have an upside, at least in this one place? What if the pandemic and its
aftermath lead Googlers and trailer park residents to find common cause?
What if, after the virus, the Bay Area’s wealthy gained a new
appreciation for those who live on its edges, and finally made room for
them in this digital
wonderland?

I have lived in the Bay Area for almost 20 years, and for most of that
time, I’ve felt this place creaking steadily into uninhabitability for
all but the wealthiest few. We have [one of the world’s highest
concentrations of
billionaires](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/billionaires-San-Francisco-world-report-wealth-x-13832316.php),
and yet we have not been able to marshal our immense wealth and
ingenuity against our most blatant and glaring challenges — including
the lack of affordable housing and entrenched homelessness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in this crisis, the Bay Area’s response was an unexpected success.
And that has given a lot of people, including me, new hope about what’s
possible. Yes, it sounds hokey, but this might be a time for hokeyness.

The first big moment came on March 16, when the six counties around the
San Francisco Bay ordered the first shelter-in-place rules in the United
States. Google, Apple, Facebook and other large employers fell right
into step; they ordered all of their employees to work from home,
setting the pace for most other local businesses to close up shop. And
the tech giants set an important example — they made a commitment to
keep paying their on-site service workers, even if they could no longer
come on-site to work.

San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose secured thousands of hotel rooms for
homeless people, away from the streets and the risk of the virus in
crowded shelters. Cities opened their streets to pedestrians and
bicycles and closed them to cars. Perhaps most important, officials in
the area were the picture of calm leadership.

When I despaired about our national failures, I found myself tuning into
hear the plain-spoken exhortations of San Francisco’s mayor, London
Breed. “This is going to take all of us,” Breed [told the city late in
March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkkcLEJ-nLY). “This is going to
take all of us coming together and sacrificing so that we get through
this.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And it worked. Thanks to some combination of early action, collective
adherence to public health guidelines, a concerted effort to help the
vulnerable, and [perhaps just blind
luck](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/difference-between-covid-19-cases-in-ca-vs-ny-is-likely-sheer-luck-experts/2269934/),
mass death missed the Bay. By the start of May, fewer than 30 people had
died of Covid-19 in San Francisco; in the greater Bay Area, deaths stand
around 350.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The toll is probably an undercount, and [blacks and
Latinos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-california-black-latinos.html)
are disproportionately represented in it. Still, compared to many
American metropolitan areas, this ranks as a near miracle. San
Francisco’s death rate of four per 100,000 residents is one-fourth the
rate in Los Angeles, a fraction of the national average, and nowhere
near New York’s.

In the absence of mass death, people around here have had time and
psychic space to imagine longer-term possibilities. If we could band
together so quickly to beat the virus, making so many big changes so
seamlessly, what else are we capable of doing?

I was not alone in my vague sense of optimism.

In an article that went viral among techies last month, the venture
capitalist Marc Andreessen characterized the pandemic as a [call to arms
to rebuild](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) American
institutions, including our cities. Like many of the Valley’s tech
princes, Andreessen has often been skeptical of government and its
champions, but now here he was, cheering them on: “Demonstrate that the
public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better
transportation, better cities, better housing,” he wrote. “Stop trying
to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public
sector fully to the future.”

I heard a similar urgency for grand reform from nearly every Bay Area
official, activist and resident I spoke to — even those who had clashed
with the tech industry or those whose fights earlier seemed unwinnable.

Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, opened up [74 miles of city
streets](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2020/04/slow-streets-oakland-car-free-roads-pedestrians-covid-19/609961/)
for pedestrians and moved hundreds of homeless people into hotels. She
saw the crisis as an opportunity to make permanent
improvements.

One example: Schaaf required that the hotels which the city paid to
house the homeless during the pandemic offer the city long-term leases.
“I do not want, at the end of the health emergency, to turn homeless
people back out onto the streets,” she said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In April, Ro Khanna, who represents parts of Silicon Valley in the
House, introduced legislation to provide greater pay, health care and
labor protections to workers deemed “essential” during the pandemic.
“When we talk about who are the ‘essential workers,’ very few people
are saying it’s lawyers or middle or senior management,” Khanna said.
“They’re saying, we want the person who’s delivering our groceries,
the person who’s keeping the internet open, the electricity flowing, or
the person who’s taking care of our kids.”

In a similar way, the crisis illustrated the importance of keeping
everyone healthy — even people who lack a place to live. “Housing is
health care,” explained Abigail Stewart-Kahn, director of the San
Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. “That’s
something, in my field, that people have been saying for a long time.”
Now, the connection was inescapable — people who lacked housing were
also outside of the health care system, and during a pandemic, their
presence on the streets created a risk for everyone else in the city.
“What this has shown us all is that everyone’s health is intertwined,”
she
said.

These were all officials and experts — people who might be biased toward
finding “silver linings” in any crisis. But was anything really changing
for homeless people around the Bay Area? I contacted several homeless
people who have been placed in hotels during the pandemic. They spoke
rapturously about their sudden fortune in an otherwise grim time.

“Oh my God — I can really breathe and be myself.” That was the reaction
from a 33-year-old woman who had been living in a hotel for weeks with
her 12-year-son. She asked me not to use her name. Before the virus,
they had spent years bouncing from couch to couch around the Bay. Under
lockdown, their lives were, in many ways, freer than before. For the
first time in years, she no longer felt that crushing dependence on
other people. “I can move as the adult I am, and no one dictates what I
do or how I move,” she told me.

The hotel room has two beds and a private bathroom. It was starting to
feel like a studio apartment — like a kind of home, she told me. “I only
wish we could have a deep fryer.” It is only guaranteed for three
months, but she has begun to see the possibility of a new life in the
uncertain distance: “I just know that I am on my way to my place.”

As the weeks of lockdown dragged on, San Francisco began to break my
heart again. While the number of coronavirus cases and deaths remained
low, the full gloom of the coming recession began to descend into
view, and with it, the same ageless, endless political squabbles. The
basic problem is that despite the region’s apparently limitless wealth,
there were not enough ready resources available to public officials to
reach everyone in need. And in the absence of more help from the state
and the federal government, or from the region’s billionaires, the Bay
Area’s needs simply outmatched its capacity to meet them.

Even after the huge effort to move people into hotels, there are still
thousands of homeless people on the Bay Area’s streets, and little
prospect that many will be housed anytime soon. My hopes for inspiring
leadership began to fall apart when a fight broke out recently between
San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors and the mayor over how many more
homeless people the city could house.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The board passed an ordinance to secure 7,000 hotel rooms for homeless
people who are now on the street, but the mayor refused to comply. She
said it was impossible; the city is straining against its limit already.
So far, San Francisco has placed 965 homeless people in hotel rooms, and
[has signed contracts for 2,731 rooms for homeless people and essential
workers.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/san-francisco-leaders-clash-over-hotel-rooms-for-homeless-population-11588696567)

This fight hinges on the usual things — money, willpower, staffing and
basic municipal capacity. But it also lays bare how ephemeral our
coronavirus-inspired unity may be. “To the extent we have restored faith
in what is possible, we have also underscored, sadly, our city’s
limitations,” Matt Haney, a member of the Board of Supervisors, told me.

When I asked the mayor about her dispute with the supervisors, she was
cordial but clearly annoyed. Annoyed that the supervisors hadn’t
considered the limits on the city’s capacity. Annoyed that she agreed
with them — more homeless people could be taken off the streets if only
she had the funds or the people to make it happen.

The federal government has promised to reimburse cities for part of the
cost of housing the homeless, but Breed says she is not sure whether
those funds will come through. “There’s a huge difference between what
we all want, which is to get every homeless person off the street, and
reality,” she said.

And instead of bringing the region’s wealthy and its needy together, she
suggested that the pandemic might pit the less needy against the more
needy. “I think many people are like, ‘Well, wait a minute — I lost my
job where I was making minimum wage. I can’t pay my rent. I can barely
eat. Where’s *my* help from the city?’” Breed said.

When I asked if the virus had created much political room for bold
action to address inequality, she said, “It’s going to make it even
harder.”

Is this really the best the city can do? The further we move from the
initial crisis, the crazier my bike-riding optimism now sounds. Rather
than fostering some new sense of civic unity, the virus is just as
likely to worsen inequality further.

Margot Kushel, a physician and scholar of homelessness at the University
of California, San Francisco, suggested that this was the “nightmare
scenario” for inequality in San Francisco: low-income jobs disappear, so
more people lose their homes, but because the tech industry keeps doing
well, home prices remain high, and housing slips further out of reach
for everyone else. “Those who are housed are fully aware that they’re
one thread away from losing that housing,” Kushel
said.

[San Francisco and other Bay Area cities have imposed temporary
moratoriums](https://www.kqed.org/news/11809099/a-guide-to-bay-area-eviction-moratoriums-during-the-coronavirus-crisis)
on evictions caused by virus-related economic disruptions. But those
will expire later in the year, at which time a wave of tenants may be
kicked out of their homes unless they can pay months of back rent. At
the same time, the virus has given more political ammo to those NIMBYs
who have long opposed urban density and blocked the construction of more
housing.

All is not lost. I do feel a renewed sense of pride and possibility
about the Bay Area — the way our leaders responded to the virus did
strengthen my faith in our local institutions, and we certainly seem
better equipped to address long-term challenges than I once thought we
were.

There might still be a window for substantive action: Our local
governments can use the new leverage to push for bold ideas — among
other policies, a plan for rent relief, rather than simply an eviction
moratorium, so that more people don’t lose their housing.

I’m also waiting on the city’s billionaires to open up new floodgates of
generosity, at least for mitigating the immediate pain of the crisis.
Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and Square, recently pledged
$1 billion to coronavirus relief; but of the [nearly 100
billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#2c1c274c251c)
reportedly living in the Bay Area, [only a
handful](https://sf.curbed.com/2020/4/30/21241539/sf-billionaires-donations-coronavirus-dorsey-benioff)
have donated to the city’s coronavirus relief fund. Mary Kate Bacalao,
the director of external affairs at Compass Family Services, a nonprofit
group that helps homeless families, told me that with a few big checks,
the Bay’s wealthiest could instantly make a difference.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But I wouldn’t be surprised if we — the people of the Bay Area, our
lawmakers, our billionaires and our ordinary, overburdened citizens —
end up squandering this moment. Rebuilding a fairer, more livable urban
environment will take years of difficult work. It will require
sacrifices from the wealthy. It will require a renewed federal interest
in addressing the problems of cities. It will require abandoning
pie-in-the-sky techno-optimism.

This isn’t a problem that will be solved by flying cars; it will be
solved by better zoning laws, fairer taxes and, when we can make it safe
again, more public transportation. We will have to commit ourselves to
these and other boring but permanent civic solutions.

I’m hopeful we’re up to the task. We cannot go back to the way things
were. But as the immediate danger of the pandemic recedes, it will be
all too easy for many of us to do exactly
that.
