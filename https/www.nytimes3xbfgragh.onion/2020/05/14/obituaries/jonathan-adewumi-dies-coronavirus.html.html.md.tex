\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Jonathan Adewumi grew up in New York, but he was African through and
through.

From creating a fashion company that dressed celebrities like Stevie
Wonder in clothing from Nigeria to creating a Nigerian film festival and
a Brooklyn restaurant that became a gathering place for the diaspora,
Mr. Adewumi was dedicated to bridging the cultural gap between Africans
and black Americans.

``He was often the first point of contact to many people who never had
an African friend and for Africans who didn't understand the struggles
of black Americans,'' said Adebayo Adewumi, a younger brother.

Mr. Adewumi died on April 17 at Bayonne Medical Center in New Jersey.
The cause was complications of the novel coronavirus, his brother said.
He was 57.

Mr. Adewumi was born in London on Sept. 12, 1962, to Jacob and Grace
(Ulowandi Oriaku) Adewumi, physicians from Nigeria who had traveled to
England to further their medical education.

When Mr. Adewumi was still a young boy, the family moved back to Nigeria
to open a maternity hospital in their hometown, Ile Oluji, about a
five-hour drive from Lagos. They moved to the Bronx when Mr. Adewumi was
10.

He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and went on to receive
a degree in computer science from Utica College in 1986. His
\href{https://www.utica.edu/campus-community/utica-stories/get-know-jonathan-adewumi-86-co-chair-metro-nyc-regional-alumni-network}{favorite
class} was African history. He liked playing handball and became
\href{https://uctangerine.com/2020/05/04/alumnus-jonathan-adewumi-86-dies-from-covid-19-he-was-bigger-than-life/}{president
of the black student union}and a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity. (He would later help start a chapter in Nigeria.)

\href{http://www.melanet.com/nff/aboutus.html}{Nigerian Fabrics and
Fashions} started almost as an accident. Mr. Adewumi's parents had moved
back to Nigeria and would send the children cloth and clothing. People
began asking about the colorful garments he and his sister wore. Mr.
Adewumi, a natural marketer and a gregarious businessman, saw a niche.

Although African clothing had become popular in America as part of
political movements in the 1960s, Mr. Adewumi's company was soon swept
up in an 1980s fashion trend that embraced the African aesthetic. He and
two of his four siblings began presenting their clothes for black
student union groups on college campuses and at bridal shows, and
garnered national exposure as part of a Miss Black America Pageant in
1989. Soon, Stevie Wonder became a customer, and sent his friend Aretha
Franklin to buy their clothing. The actor Wesley Snipes was also a fan.

After 9/11, when anti-Muslim sentiment rose along with an appetite for
American-made products, business dropped. After 20 years, the company
closed.

Mr. Adewumi headed back to Nigeria for a few years. When he returned, he
joined his brother at \href{https://amarachi325.com/}{Amarachi,} a
Nigerian restaurant in downtown Brooklyn that served American-style
chicken wings and steak and West African jollof with oxtails, all served
with an Afrobeat soundtrack. With his outsize personality, he quickly
turned it into a cultural center that attracted immigrants and a popular
spot for community events.

``Jonathan had a unique way of making everyone feel at home, like they
belong,'' Ugo Nwaokoro, a former deputy mayor of Newark, said.

Mr. Adewumi, who was divorced, is survived by a son, Jonathan Adewumi
Jr. of Union, N.J., and, in addition to Adebayo Adewumi, another
brother, Samuel Adewumi, with whom he lived in Brooklyn; and two
sisters, Joyce Adewumi of Harlem and Elizabeth Body-Lawson of White
Plains, N.Y. Another brother, Emmanuel Adewumi, died in 2000.
