The Amadeus, a string quartet of extraordinary longevity, set the gold
standard in chamber music for four decades after World War II. Their
style was a burnish on the Viennese tradition of smooth, lush string
playing; they shone above a foundation provided by the solid,
undemonstrative voice of their cellist, Martin Lovett.

Mr. Lovett, the quartet's last surviving member, died on April 29 in
London. He was 93.

The cause was complications of Covid-19, his daughter, Sonia Lovett,
said.

Mr. Lovett was the only British-born member of the ensemble. First

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/05/24/arts/music/24nissel.html}{Siegmund
Nissel} and violist
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1987/08/17/397487.html?pageNumber=24}{Peter
Schidlof} had fled Austria for England as Jewish émigrés after the
Anschluss in 1938.

``Over the years, the Amadeus has proved itself to be about the most
satisfying, deeply musical quartet we have,'' John Rockwell, a former
music critic of The New York Times \href{https://nyti.ms/2Ww3P4I}{wrote}
in 1978. ``They aren't the most infallibly sweet-toned quartet in the
world, nor the fiercest nor the most lyrical. But it is their avoidance
of extremes that makes them so satisfying.''

Martin Lovett was born on March 3, 1927, in Stoke Newington in north
London. His mother, Leah (Rothenberg) Lovett, had arrived in England
from Ukraine as a baby; his father, Sam, was a cellist with the Hallé
Orchestra in Manchester and the London Philharmonic. It took the young
Martin until he was 10 to convince his father to teach him the cello,
but he progressed rapidly, winning a scholarship at 15 to the Royal
College of Music, and playing in professional orchestras while still a
student.

At the Royal College, Mr. Lovett met
\href{https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/suzanne-rozsa-6nctx7ks0h3}{Suzanne
Rozsa}, a violinist and émigré who became his wife in 1950. Ms. Rozsa
shared a teacher, Max Rostal, with the three Viennese players, and after
she helped to introduce the four, they began to experiment in 1947 as
the Brainin Quartet. They made a sold-out debut at the Wigmore Hall in
London in 1948, adopting for that concert the name they would make
famous.

``I was trying my hand at playing quartets with formidable German
refugees who spouted Goethe at me,'' Mr. Lovett
\href{https://www.thejc.com/culture/music/interview-martin-lovett-1.23768}{said}
in an interview in 2011. ``A couple of years later I was in the Amadeus
Quartet.''

Appearances on the BBC and a German tour in 1950 led to a recording
contract that would eventually fill 70 CDs in a
\href{https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/catalogue/products/amadeus-quartet-complete-rec-7930}{box
set} released by Deutsche Grammophon in 2017.

The quartet excelled in the core Austro-Germanic repertoire of Haydn,
Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, and made only occasional forays
into the 20th century, for music by Bartok, Tippett and Britten.

``We are four very distinct individuals,'' Mr. Lovett
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1982/03/05/arts/amadeus-quartet-at-35-plays-beethoven-cycle.html}{said}
in 1982, when the quartet was about to play its second
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKY43du5xSo\&feature=youtu.be}{Beethoven}cycle
in New York. ``One or another of us may have a sympathy for certain
modern pieces, but, as a group, we have less affinity for contemporary
works than for the classics.''

After Mr. Schidlof's death in 1987 curtailed the work of the quartet,
Mr. Lovett performed only occasionally, and instead taught and judged
chamber music competitions. With Ms. Rosza, who died in 2005, he had two
children, Peter and Sonia; they survive him, as does his second wife,
the Dutch writer Dorinde van Oort, and five grandchildren.

``The quartet was the sum of different parts, and the chemistry worked
well, or we would not have played together for so long,'' Mr. Lovett
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/23/classicalmusicandopera}{wrote}
upon the death of Mr. Nissel in 2008. ``Eventually, we all thought
similarly about the music.''
