</div>

The police said officers shot and killed Breonna Taylor, 26, in a March
raid after her boyfriend shot an officer in the leg.

Two months after [Louisville police
officers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/us/brett-hankison-breonna-taylor-louisville.html)
fatally shot a woman as they raided her home, Gov. Andy Beshear of
Kentucky said on Wednesday that local, state and federal prosecutors
should review the police investigation into the shooting.

Officers killed the woman, [Breonna
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/breonna-taylor-law-passed.html),
26, just after midnight [on
March 13](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/03/13/louisville-police-officer-shot-suspect-killed-springfield-drive/5040349002/)
during a confrontation in which her boyfriend shot an officer in the
leg, the Louisville police said. But only recently has nationwide
attention been drawn to the case.

Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, filed a lawsuit in late April
against three officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department,
accusing them of wrongfully causing her daughter’s death.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among the lawyers representing Ms. Palmer is Benjamin Crump, who also
represents the family of [Ahmaud
Arbery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html),
whose [February shooting death in
Georgia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/us/ahmed-arbery-shooting-georgia.html)
led to [murder charges against two
men](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-arrest.html)
last week.

On Wednesday, Governor Beshear called reports about [Ms.
Taylor’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/us/breonna-taylor-black-lives-matter-women.html)
death “troubling” and said the public deserved to know everything about
the March raid. He asked the state attorney general, the local
prosecutor and the federal prosecutor assigned to the region to review
the results of the Louisville police’s initial investigation “to ensure
justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not
blind.”

The Louisville police, who declined to comment for this article, have
said little about the raid since a news conference on the day it
happened.

[The Louisville Courier-Journal reported this
week](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/05/12/breonna-taylor-louisville-emt-not-main-target-drug-investigation/3115928001/)
that the police had been targeting two men who they believed were
selling drugs out of a house more than 10 miles from Ms. Taylor’s
apartment. However, a judge had signed a warrant allowing officers to
search Ms. Taylor’s home — and to [enter without
warning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/18/us/forced-entry-warrant-drug-raid.html)
— in part because a detective said one of the men had used Ms. Taylor’s
apartment to receive a package.

In the lawsuit, Ms. Palmer’s lawyers say that the man had already been
apprehended before police officers entered Ms. Taylor’s home.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They executed this innocent woman because they botched the search
warrant execution,” Mr. Crump said in an interview. “They had the main
person that they were trying to get in their custody, so why use a
battering ram to bust her door down and then go in there and execute
her?”

Mr. Crump said that while there were many differences between the cases
of Mr. Arbery and Ms. Taylor, both of whom were black, they were
connected by the fact that neither case immediately attracted widespread
attention, despite the efforts of local activists and family members.

Ms. Palmer has said that her daughter, who worked as an emergency
medical technician at local hospitals, had planned to become a nurse and
buy a house, and that she had stayed out of trouble.

“I’m not sure that they understand what they took from my family,” Ms.
Palmer [told The
Courier-Journal](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/05/12/mother-breonna-taylor-louisville-emt-shot-police-speaks-out/3116777001/),
referring to the police.

At [a news
conference](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/41739947268/videos/206839417221050/)
hours after the raid, Chief Steve Conrad of the Louisville police said
the officers involved had not been wearing body cameras. Lt. Ted Eidem,
who leads the agency’s Public Integrity Unit, said the officers had
announced their presence and knocked on the door before forcing entry.

A police spokeswoman [told The
Courier-Journal](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/05/11/breonna-taylor-killing-family-hires-attorney-ahmaud-arbery-case/3108607001/)
this week that the investigation into the shooting was continuing and
that the police had disclosed everything they could at the original news
conference.

The police have said that they returned fire after Ms. Taylor’s
boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, shot an officer in the leg. He later
surrendered and has been charged with the attempted murder of a police
officer.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Walker’s lawyer, Rob Eggert, has said that Mr. Walker did not know
that the people entering the apartment were police officers, and that he
fired one shot.

Mr. Crump said that neighbors had not heard the police officers announce
themselves, and that Mr. Walker thought the officers — who he said were
in unmarked cars and plain clothes — were intruders. He said Mr. Walker
had called 911, believing that he and Ms. Taylor, who had been in bed
together, “were in significant, imminent danger.”

The lawyers for Ms. Taylor’s mother said that Mr. Walker was licensed to
have a gun and that the police officers had fired at least 20 shots into
the apartment and a neighboring home.

Although whether the Louisville police knocked before entering is
disputed, the use of “no-knock” warrants has [led to disastrous results
in the
past](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/18/us/forced-entry-warrant-drug-raid.html).
The Houston Police Department said last year that [it would largely end
the
practice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/19/us/no-knock-warrant-houston-police.html)
after two civilians were killed — and four police officers were injured
— in one such raid, which the police had justified based on an
officer’s lie about a supposed confidential informant.
