*The Mrs. Files looks at history through a contemporary lens to see what
the honorific “Mrs.” means to women and their identity.*

America had its first introduction to the artist and designer Ray Eames
in 1956, and it was brief. NBC’s “Home” show was featuring the debut of
the now-famous Eames lounge chair, and the host, Arlene Francis, opened
with Charles Eames — who was “almost a household word,” she told the
audience, thanks to a series of earlier chairs made from molded plastic
and plywood.

But the name, like the chair, wasn’t his alone. “Almost always when
there’s a successful man, there’s a very interesting and able woman
behind him,” Francis said, before calling “Mrs. Eames” to the stage to
say a few halting words.

Francis asked the couple to explain how the Eames design process worked.
“Ray, shall we let Charles do it, or do you want to help?” she asked,
barely pausing. “No? See, as I told you, she’s behind the man, but
terribly important.” In a clip [available on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_X6RsN-HFw), as Charles starts
talking and the broadcast cuts to a close-up of an undulating plywood
seat, you can see Ray’s feet in a corner of the screen, backing away and
then disappearing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s not exactly right to say that Ray was sidelined, let alone
invisible, in the intensely masculine world of midcentury design. The
steady stream of imagery of the couple — sometimes riding on a
motorcycle, sometimes frolicking in homemade animal masks, sometimes
posing in matched clothing — was as much a part of their work as their
chairs, their dozens of experimental movies, or their famous house on
the Pacific Ocean, whose light-filled space filled with exquisitely
curated assemblages of colorful objects has become a beau ideal of
humanized modernism.

But [since her death
in 1988](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/08/23/obituaries/ray-eames-72-a-founder-of-firm-that-designed-the-eames-chair.html),
Ray Eames has been moving back to the center of the picture. Or rather,
the world has been discovering that she was there all along — not just
as the beaming helpmeet with sparkling eyes and a Dorothy-from-Oz dress
sense, but as an artistic force in and of herself.

She was born Bernice Kaiser in 1911 in Sacramento, where her father for
a time ran a vaudeville theater. “Ray” was a childhood nickname, and it
stuck (though it would sometimes cause its own confusions: as recently
as 2006, an article in The New York Times Magazine credited the classic
film “Powers of Ten” to “the Eames brothers”).

She moved to New York City in the 1930s, where she studied with the
painter Hans Hofmann and was active with American Abstract Artists, an
activist group that picketed galleries that refused to show
nonrepresentational art. In 1940, she enrolled at the Cranbrook Academy
of Art outside Detroit, where she met Charles, at the time the head of
the department of industrial
design.

“We must see each other soon,” he wrote to her in March 1941. “This
business of becoming dream people in each other’s minds is no good.”
Soon after, Charles divorced his wife, and he and Ray married and moved
to California.

Articles and documentaries about the Eameses lean on Charles’s gnomic
statements of design philosophy: “The best for the most for the least.”
“Never delegate understanding.” “Never let the blood show.” And then
there was this one: “Whatever I can do, Ray can do better.”

It’s the kind of tribute that can come off as lip service. But in the
decades since their deaths, design critics have increasingly challenged
the gendered division of labor<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

“décor” for her — presumed in many accounts of their work, and of
modernism itself.

The birth of the famous molded Eames chairs might be traced to the
winning design Charles and Eero Saarinen submitted to a Museum of Modern
Art competition in 1940. But it wasn’t until later that Charles and Ray,
working in their first Los Angeles apartment on a cobbled-together
machine nicknamed [the
Kazam\!](https://www.eamesoffice.com/blog/the-kazam-machine/), began
figuring out how to make the compound curves of their now classic LCW
chair work for mass production, with Ray mostly working the machine
while Charles earned a paycheck as a set designer at MGM Studios.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And Ray wasn’t merely working out the kinks. The sculptural curves
themselves — and the rest of the sprawling Eames output that followed —
were influenced by Ray’s early immersion in abstract art, the design
historian Pat Kirkham wrote in her 1995 book “Charles and Ray Eames:
Designers of the Twentieth Century.”

“To the extent that the Eames style of the 1940s and 1950s was
‘progressive’ and ‘avant-garde,’” Kirkham wrote, “Ray was certainly as
responsible as Charles.”

This was a point frequently underlined by Charles, who spoke about the
design process in terms of “we,” “us” and “ours” — not that the world
seemed to really hear it. Until the 1970s, the titles of museum
exhibitions about their work tended to omit her name. In a 1973 profile
in The New York Times titled “Casual Giant of Design,” Charles Eames
describes their relationship as “an equal and total alliance.” But the
article is described in the paper’s index as being about Charles and his
“wife and
assistant.”

One 1969 television program described Ray as “sitting like a delicious
dumpling in a doll’s dress.” And Ray, at least in front of the cameras,
seemed willing to play the part of supportive, mostly silent wife.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It isn’t the same when I talk,” she [told an
interviewer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/07/24/the-eames-legend-of-spare-simplicity/dabc414e-583b-406d-8e45-a1fd3a9828d0/)
in 1977. “Charles has a way of putting things which people pay attention
to.”

A creative woman seemingly content to let her husband speak for her and
their work together may feel uneasy amid recent feminist reclamation
projects aimed at bringing other midcentury artistic women — like Ray’s
friend Lee Krasner, who was married to Jackson Pollock — out of their
husbands’ shadows (while sometimes also trying to topple the men from
the pedestal of male genius).

And Ray, who died 10 years to the day after her husband, left behind few
public statements about how she felt, say, in 1985 when she appeared at
the World Design Conference to accept his posthumous award as the
world’s most influential designer, for work they did together. If she
ever seethed at her husband’s higher profile or felt marginalized (as
some colleagues in the Eames studio have suggested), she did not show
it.

Kirkham, who interviewed her in the years before her death, says that
Ray wasn’t concerned with teasing out what part of the creativity
symbolized by the name “Eames” was hers.

“She got annoyed when people would say, ‘Ray designed those stools,’
because it meant she wasn’t involved in other stuff, when it was all
joint work,” she said in an interview. “She just kept coming back to
that. It was all joint work.”
