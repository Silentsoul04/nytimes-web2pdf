# J.C. Penney, 118-Year-Old Department Store, Files for Bankruptcy

The chain’s move came after J. Crew and the Neiman Marcus Group filed,
and represented the biggest casualty amid retail closures tied to the

J.C. Penney, with its budget-friendly clothing for families and reliable
home furnishings, was for years a cornerstone of American malls and an
undeniable success story. What started as a humble dry goods store in
Wyoming in 1902 was a century later a national chain with a household
name and more than 1,000 locations.

But on Friday, the company filed for bankruptcy protection after a
prolonged decline over the past 20 years, becoming the latest and
largest retailer to fall during the coronavirus pandemic, which has
devastated the industry. The chain has more than 800 stores and nearly
85,000 employees.

Its collapse follows other retail bankruptcies this month including [J.
Crew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/business/j-crew-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html),
the [Neiman Marcus
Group](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/business/neiman-marcus-bankruptcy.html)
and the designer men’s clothing brand John Varvatos. But J.C. Penney
represents the biggest casualty by far based on the number of locations,
with stores that are anchors at many of the nation’s malls.

J.C. Penney [said it filed
for](https://ir.jcpenney.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/613/jcpenney-to-reduce-debt-and-strengthen-financial-position)
Chapter 11 protection from its creditors in federal bankruptcy court for
the Southern District of Texas, adding that it had $500 million in cash
on hand and had received commitments for $900 million in financing to
use during the bankruptcy process. The company said it had struck a deal
with lenders that would reduce several billion dollars of its debt and
it would explore a sale. It also said it planned to close stores, but
specific locations and timing would be disclosed in coming weeks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jill Soltau, J.C. Penney’s chief executive, said that the retailer
expected to emerge from “Chapter 11 and this pandemic as a stronger
retailer.”

The filing was expected after J.C. Penney failed to make an interest
payment on its debt in April to “maximize financial flexibility,” and
then skipped another payment last week. The stock of the chain, based in
Plano, Texas, has been trading below $1 per share for most of this year.

Most department store chains have been in a long period of decline, and
the massive footprint of J.C. Penney at mid-tier malls has been
especially challenging.

But J.C. Penney’s demise was accelerated in the past decade by the
involvement of William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager, and Ron
Johnson, the former retail chief at Apple, who were behind one of the
[most disastrous retail
turnaround](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/04/09/business/ron-johnson-out-as-jc-penney-chief.html)
attempts in recent history.

Mr. Ackman, an activist investor and chief executive of Pershing Square
Capital Management, bought a major stake in J.C. Penney in 2010 and
subsequently joined its board, seeing an opportunity at the retailer,
which was losing ground to rivals like Kohl’s and Macy’s.

He
[recruited](https://dealbook.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/11/12/a-dose-of-realism-for-the-chief-of-j-c-penney/)
Mr. Johnson, who joined in late 2011 and planned [to
transform](https://dealbook.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/11/12/a-dose-of-realism-for-the-chief-of-j-c-penney/)
J.C. Penney’s stores into collections of boutiques with a “town square,"
banish nonstop promotions and strike up partnerships with higher-end
designers like Nanette Lepore.

But Mr. Johnson’s efforts alienated J.C. Penney’s core customers, led to
sales and traffic declines and created internal rifts. He was ousted
after 17 months in April 2013.[In one
year,](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sapna/how-an-overconfident-billionaire-brought-a-111-year-old-reta)
J.C. Penney had seen $4.3 billion, or 25 percent, of its annual sales
wiped out.

“It is not easy to get a customer back but it is easy to lose one,’’

“They made some strategic choices that in hindsight were not the best to
make.”

J.C. Penney has cycled through chief executives since then, but the
downward trend has persisted. Even with a 14-year partnership with
Sephora, the cosmetics chain with shops inside hundreds of J.C. Penney
locations, it has found it difficult to appeal to younger customers.

“They’re not luxury, they’re not as cheap as Walmart and T.J. Maxx, they
don’t have the niche stuff at specialty retailers,” said Barbara E.
Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton
School. “It’s stuck in the middle with no differentiation.”

The company had been making progress in recent months toward slimming
down its inventory and improving its merchandise presentation, Ms. Boni
said. But J.C. Penney was also struggling with a debt load more than
three times that of other large mall-based retailers, giving it less
financial flexibility to invest in online initiatives and other efforts
to win back customers.

Still, the company had managed to avoid bankruptcy longer
than<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>another similar mall-based
retailer, Sears, which [filed for Chapter 11
protection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/14/business/sears-bankruptcy-filing-chapter-11.html)
in October
2018.

Since its bankruptcy, Sears has been trying to survive with a smaller
footprint. But in February, the company that now owns Sears and Kmart,
Transformco, [closed an additional 96
stores](https://transformco.com/docs/110719-store-closing-list.pdf),
citing “increased competition and other factors.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When J.C. Penney closes stores, it could have major implications for the
mall landscape in the United States, which was already
[struggling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/05/business/department-stores-macys-sears.html)
with a widening chasm between the most popular and least-favored
shopping destinations. It could leave vast and unappealing empty spaces
at many malls. And it could also allow smaller retailers to leave, based
on agreements that are often contingent on the presence of anchors like
J.C. Penney.

“When a J.C. Penney or a Macy’s goes out, it’s like a snowball effect,”
Ms. Widlitz said.

Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm, said in a report
last month that it expected more than half of all mall-based department
stores to close by the end of 2021.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>It also said it expected J.C. Penney to eventually liquidate,
even if it emerged from bankruptcy in the short term, saying that “a
smaller store fleet is not going to solve J.C. Penney’s core issues.”

The company’s sales have steadily shrunk in recent years to $10.7
billion for the year that ended Feb. 1, when it posted a net loss of
$268 million from continuing operations.

“J.C. Penney was already experiencing market share declines before
Covid-19,” Ms. Boni said. “It would be difficult to turn around a
business in this environment.”
