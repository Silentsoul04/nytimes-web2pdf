# What We Know About Your Chances of Catching the Virus Outdoors

A stir-crazy nation wonders: Is it safe to stroll on the beach in a
deadly pandemic? How about a picnic in the park? Or coffee with a friend
at an outdoor table? The risk is in the details.

The warmer weather across the country calls to mind carefree summers —
picnics in the park, swimming at the beach, fireworks on the Fourth. But
nothing feels carefree now.

Even the simplest outdoor activities seem fraught with a thousand
questions and calculations about the coronavirus pandemic.

Is it safe to meet friends in the park, as long as they stay six feet
away, on the other side of a blanket? What about a burger and beer at an
outdoor restaurant? How risky is a trip to the beach or swimming pool
with the kids?

The good news: Interviews show a growing consensus among experts that,
if Americans are going to leave their homes, it’s safer to be outside
than in the office or the mall. With fresh air and more space between
people, the risk goes down.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But experts also expressed particular caution about outdoor dining,
using locker rooms at pools and crowds in places like beaches. While
going outside can help people cope with quarantine fatigue, there is a
risk they will lower their guard or meet people who are not being safe.

“I think going outside is important for health,” said Julia L. Marcus,
an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. “We
know that being outdoors is lower risk for coronavirus transmission than
being indoors. On a sunny, beautiful weekend, I think going outside is
indicated, but I also think there are things to do to reduce our risk.”

While many treasured outdoor rites of the season have been closed or
canceled, including Disney’s amusement parks, the Coachella festival in
California and [Free Shakespeare in the
Park](https://publictheater.org/programs/shakespeare-in-the-park/) in
New York, governors across the country have been opening golf courses,
[trails](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/appalachian-trail-coronavirus.html)and
beaches, hoping to restore some semblance of a normal summer for
restless Americans.

Some parks, including small urban ones like [Ellis

The different approaches have left many Americans bewildered about what
is safe behavior outside. Experts have a simple answer: Practice social
distancing and wear a mask when that is not possible.

Ideally, people should socialize only with people who live in their
homes, they say. If you decide to meet friends, you’re increasing your
risk, but you can take precautions. It’s important to keep gatherings
small. Don’t share food, utensils or beverages; keep your hands clean;
and keep at least six feet from people who don’t live in your
home.

“I think outdoors is so much better than indoors in almost all cases,”
said Linsey Marr, an engineering professor and aerosol scientist at
Virginia Tech. “There’s so much dilution that happens outdoors. As long
as you’re staying at least six feet apart, I think the risk is very
low.”

Pandemic life is safer outdoors, in part, because even a light wind will
quickly dilute the virus. If a person nearby is sick, the wind will
scatter the virus, potentially exposing nearby people but in far smaller
quantities, which are less likely to be harmful.

“The virus load is important,” said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at
Lehman College and the City University of New York’s Graduate Center. “A
single virus will not make anyone sick; it will be immediately destroyed
by the immune system. The belief is that one needs a few hundred to a
few thousand of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to overwhelm the immune response.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the risk of outdoor transmission is low, it can happen. In one
study of more than [7,300 cases in
China](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1.full.pdf),
just one was connected to outdoor transmission. In that case, a
27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with a traveler who had just
returned from Wuhan. Seven days later, he had his first symptoms of
Covid-19.

“The risk is lower outdoors, but it’s not zero,” said Shan Soe-Lin, a
lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “And I think
the risk is higher if you have two people who are stationary next to
each other for a long time, like on a beach blanket, rather than people
who are walking and passing each other.”

One [recent
study](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/health/coronavirus-infections.html)
found that just talking can launch thousands of droplets that can remain

those droplets is lower
outdoors.

For many Americans who have spent anxious months at home, wide-open
parks and trails feel like the safest options these days.

Kate Wathall, a Los Angeles television producer and reporter, went for
her first hike in weeks, one day after local trails reopened. She drove
an hour to Trail Canyon Falls in Tujunga, avoiding more popular trails
in the city.

“It was like being back to normal life,” she said. “Obviously, it’s not.

“People are spread out and there’s no way for someone to be right on top

condensed — too close for comfort.”

Experts agreed that the risk of swimming in pools, lakes or the ocean is
not from the water, but from exposure to people in and near the
water.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Although scientists don’t have data on the novel coronavirus
specifically, other coronaviruses are not stable in water and are very
sensitive to chlorine, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the
Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

“In my opinion, pool water, fresh water in a lake or river, or seawater
exposure would be extremely low transmission risk even without dilution
(which would reduce risk further),” Dr. Rasmussen said in an email.
“Probably the biggest risk for summer water recreation is crowds — a
crowded pool locker room, dock or beach, especially if coupled with
limited physical distancing or prolonged proximity to others. The most
concentrated sources of virus in such an environment will be the people
hanging out at the pool, not the pool itself.”

Experts say that a person walking, jogging or cycling too close for a
few seconds is not a big worry. But they recommend joggers wear a mask
or some other form of face covering if they’re going to come close to
other people. If someone sets up a picnic blanket within your six-foot
perimeter and plans to stay a while, that’s a bigger concern. Try to
avoid a confrontation. That only increases your risk of exposure. Such
conflicts could spike as more people head outside.

“If someone is too close to you and not wearing a mask and you don’t
feel safe, instead of yelling at them, just say, ‘I need some space,
please,’” Dr. Marcus said.

For families with small children, navigating the outdoors can produce a
special anxiety.

Ms. Gabriel said her brother, who is 6, had wanted to go to the
playground, but her mother wouldn’t allow it. She worries about the
virus lingering on slides and swings and about a mysterious
[inflammatory
syndrome](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-children-kawasaki-pmis.html)
linked to the virus that has been sickening and killing some children.

“It’s hard for a child to understand,” Ms. Gabriel said. “At least we
can stay six feet apart. You can’t tell a little kid
that.”

One challenge in dense cities is finding six feet to call your own on a
running path or in a bicycle lane. An open-air cafe may seem safe, until
people start walking by on the sidewalk without masks.

Some cities, including New York, Boston, Minneapolis and Oakland, have
[closed
streets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/us/coronavirus-street-closures.html)
to traffic, giving people room to spread out. Others have extended
sidewalks to make more space for pedestrians and outdoor seating.

Even outside, there is a risk of contracting the virus by touching a
contaminated surface — a restaurant menu, park bench or lawn chair — and
then touching your face. Studies have shown the [virus can last three
days on hard
surfaces](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces-aerosols.html)
like steel and plastic and about 24 hours on cardboard under laboratory
conditions. The virus is also more stable in heat and humidity than many
other viruses are.

According to Dr. Chudnovsky, a sunny day is better than a cloudy day,
because there’s more sunlight to kill the virus and more wind to dilute
it*.* If you want to take extreme precautions, position yourself upwind
from other people. “This may be especially important at the beach, where
people tend to spend a long time at one localized place,” he said.

Experts said that although outdoor restaurant patrons can’t wear masks
while eating, servers should. The main risk of exposure is if the guests
within a few feet at the table aren’t from your household. Sitting and
talking for extended periods of time as well as sharing food and common
serving utensils are also potential sources of exposure if one of the
guests is infected and doesn’t know
it.

Another worry: Because it can take two weeks for symptoms to appear
after a person is infected, there is no way to know if you’re going to
the beach or the park in the midst of an invisible local outbreak,
experts said. It’s yet another reason to take precautions.

“If we now go back to the old normal and don’t follow the social
distancing strategy anymore, it’s like a ticking time bomb,” said Peter
Jüni, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto and St. Michael’s
Hospital. “You never know where it blows up and when.”
