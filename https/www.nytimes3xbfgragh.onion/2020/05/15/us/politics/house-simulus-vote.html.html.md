WASHINGTON — A divided House narrowly passed a $3 trillion pandemic
relief package on Friday to send aid to struggling state and local
governments and another round of direct $1,200 payments to taxpayers,
advancing a proposal with no chance of becoming law over near-unanimous
Republican opposition.

Democratic leaders characterized the measure, which President Trump has
promised to veto, as their opening offer in future negotiations over the
next round of coronavirus aid, forging ahead in passing it even amid
rifts within their own ranks.

With nearly $1 trillion in aid to battered states, cities and Native
American tribes, and another round of bolstered jobless benefits and
direct government payments to Americans, the measure was an expansive
sequel to the [$2.2 trillion stimulus enacted in
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html),
reflecting Democrats’ desire to push for a quick and aggressive new
round of help.

Mr. Trump and Republicans have [vacillated about whether they would
commit to another phase of federal
assistance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-republicans-blowback-aid.html),
and have made it clear they are in no rush to provide it. On Friday, the
president sounded ambivalent about another round of coronavirus aid,
first saying that it “could” happen, but then declaring that “Phase 4 is
going to happen.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s always interesting to me to see how much patience some people have
with the pain and suffering of other people,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of
California said as she argued for the bill on the House floor. “This is
a very strategically planned piece of legislation that is tailored
strictly to meet the needs of the American people regarding the
coronavirus pandemic.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The bill passed on a tight margin, 208 to 199, as some moderate
Democrats from conservative-leaning districts rejected it as a costly
overreach that included provisions unrelated to the pandemic. In a
statement that blasted the bill as “bloated,” Representative Cindy Axne
of Iowa declared that she “could not in good conscience vote to accept
this Washington gamesmanship, or vote to approve unrelated wastes of
taxpayer
dollars.”

Even though the bill was more a messaging document than a viable piece
of legislation, its fate was in doubt in the final hours before its
passage. Republicans forced a vote to bar undocumented immigrants from
receiving $1,200 coronavirus aid payments, hoping to garner the support
of enough centrist Democrats to prevail.

If that happened, progressives were privately threatening to band
together with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to sink the
bill, according to people familiar with their conversations who detailed
them on the condition of anonymity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Pelosi furiously worked the House floor into the evening,
intercepting lawmakers as they came and went in efforts to discourage
them from backing the Republicans’ proposal. She prevailed and the
proposal fell short, although 13 Democrats joined Republicans in
supporting it.

Republicans, for their part, denounced the bill as partisan and
pointless.

“Not only is this bill premature, it was crafted behind closed doors and
without any Republican input at all,” said Representative Tom Cole of
Oklahoma, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

“Instead of going big,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy of
California, the minority leader, “you went crazy.”

Only one Republican, Representative Peter T. King of New York, joined
Democrats to support the bill, while 14 Democrats broke with their party
to oppose it.

The package contained a number of Democratic priorities, including $100
billion for rental assistance and $75 billion in mortgage relief. It
would allocate $3.6 billion to bolster election security, and would
provide a $25 billion bailout for the Postal Service, a lifeline that
the agency has said is critical to its survival, but that Mr. Trump
opposes.

It would also temporarily suspend a limit on the deduction of state and
local taxes from federal income taxes — which Democrats have repeatedly
pushed for — and would disproportionately benefit high-income taxpayers
in high-tax areas. It would substantially expand eligibility and
increase the value of some tax credits, like the earned-income tax
credit, that are targeted to the poorest
Americans.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Senate Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have
called for the chamber to wait to evaluate the implementation of the
nearly $2.8 trillion in legislation that Congress has already approved
and Mr. Trump has signed into law. But senators have quietly begun to
work on legislation that would toughen liability protections for
businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies and health care workers
against medical malpractice lawsuits, as well as ways to expand the
ability of states to spend the state and local aid already allocated.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In [a message to the
House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SAP_H.R.-6800.pdf)
on Thursday, White House officials called the legislation insupportable
and said it was “more concerned with delivering on longstanding partisan
and ideological wish lists than with enhancing the ability of our nation
to deal with the public health and economic challenges we face.”

Top Democrats had warned lawmakers that a vote against the legislation
would carry grave political repercussions.

“If you vote against this and all this funding for your state, then you
have to go home and defend it,” Ms. Pelosi told House Democrats in a
private call on Thursday evening, according to multiple people familiar
with her remarks, who described them on the condition of anonymity. “And
if you can defend that ‘no’ vote, then you’re a better politician than
me.”

But by Friday morning, multiple moderate Democrats had announced their
intention to do just that.

In an interview, Representative Kendra Horn, Democrat of Oklahoma, said
she supported parts of the package, but could not back it in its current
form.

“This is a vote saying we need to do the work to get this bill where it
needs to be,” she said.

The progressive flank of the caucus was also rankled by the bill,
contending it did not go far enough to support workers in need of health
care and regular paychecks. But the Congressional Progressive Caucus
ultimately stopped short of encouraging its members to vote against the
bill, even as one of its leaders, Representative Pramila Jayapal of
Washington, announced that she would vote no.

“This is a crisis. People are really trying to figure out what they want
to do, and I just want to respect that,” Ms. Jayapal said on Friday.
“But at the same time, there’s a lot of frustration, both with the
process and the content.”

“It’s hard to argue insufficiency in a small bill,” she added. “But this
is supposed to be our vision.”
