Opposition}\label{house-passes-3-trillion-aid-bill-over-republican-opposition}}

The bill faces a veto threat from President Trump, near-unanimous
opposition by Republicans and complaints from Democrats, but leaders
called it their opening offer in talks on the next round of pandemic
relief.

WASHINGTON --- A divided House narrowly passed a \$3 trillion pandemic
relief package on Friday to send aid to struggling state and local
governments and another round of direct \$1,200 payments to taxpayers,
advancing a proposal with no chance of becoming law over near-unanimous
Republican opposition.

Democratic leaders characterized the measure, which President Trump has
promised to veto, as their opening offer in future negotiations over the
next round of coronavirus aid, forging ahead in passing it even amid
rifts within their own ranks.

With nearly \$1 trillion in aid to battered states, cities and Native
American tribes, and another round of bolstered jobless benefits and
direct government payments to Americans, the measure was an expansive
sequel to the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html}{\$2.2
trillion stimulus enacted in March}, reflecting Democrats' desire to
push for a quick and aggressive new round of help.

Mr. Trump and Republicans have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-republicans-blowback-aid.html}{vacillated
about whether they would commit to another phase of federal assistance},
and have made it clear they are in no rush to provide it. On Friday, the
president sounded ambivalent about another round of coronavirus aid,
first saying that it ``could'' happen, but then declaring that ``Phase 4
is going to happen.''

``It's always interesting to me to see how much patience some people
have with the pain and suffering of other people,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi
of California said as she argued for the bill on the House floor. ``This
is a very strategically planned piece of legislation that is tailored
strictly to meet the needs of the American people regarding the
coronavirus pandemic.''

The bill passed on a tight margin, 208 to 199, as some moderate
Democrats from conservative-leaning districts rejected it as a costly
overreach that included provisions unrelated to the pandemic. In a
statement that blasted the bill as ``bloated,'' Representative Cindy
Axne of Iowa declared that she ``could not in good conscience vote to
accept this Washington gamesmanship, or vote to approve unrelated wastes
of taxpayer dollars.''

Even though the bill was more a messaging document than a viable piece
of legislation, its fate was in doubt in the final hours before its
passage. Republicans forced a vote to bar undocumented immigrants from
receiving \$1,200 coronavirus aid payments, hoping to garner the support
of enough centrist Democrats to prevail.

If that happened, progressives were privately threatening to band
together with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to sink the
bill, according to people familiar with their conversations who detailed
them on the condition of anonymity.

Ms. Pelosi furiously worked the House floor into the evening,
intercepting lawmakers as they came and went in efforts to discourage
them from backing the Republicans' proposal. She prevailed and the
proposal fell short, although 13 Democrats joined Republicans in
supporting it.

Republicans, for their part, denounced the bill as partisan and
pointless.

``Not only is this bill premature, it was crafted behind closed doors
and without any Republican input at all,'' said Representative Tom Cole
of Oklahoma, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

``Instead of going big,'' said Representative Kevin McCarthy of
California, the minority leader, ``you went crazy.''

Only one Republican, Representative Peter T. King of New York, joined
Democrats to support the bill, while 14 Democrats broke with their party
to oppose it.

The package contained a number of Democratic priorities, including \$100
billion for rental assistance and \$75 billion in mortgage relief. It
would allocate \$3.6 billion to bolster election security, and would
provide a \$25 billion bailout for the Postal Service, a lifeline that
the agency has said is critical to its survival, but that Mr. Trump
opposes.

It would also temporarily suspend a limit on the deduction of state and
local taxes from federal income taxes --- which Democrats have
repeatedly pushed for --- and would disproportionately benefit
high-income taxpayers in high-tax areas. It would substantially expand
eligibility and increase the value of some tax credits, like the
earned-income tax credit, that are targeted to the poorest Americans.

Senate Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have
called for the chamber to wait to evaluate the implementation of the
nearly \$2.8 trillion in legislation that Congress has already approved
and Mr. Trump has signed into law. But senators have quietly begun to
work on legislation that would toughen liability protections for
businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies and health care workers
against medical malpractice lawsuits, as well as ways to expand the
ability of states to spend the state and local aid already allocated.

In
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SAP_H.R.-6800.pdf}{a
message to the House} on Thursday, White House officials called the
legislation insupportable and said it was ``more concerned with
delivering on longstanding partisan and ideological wish lists than with
enhancing the ability of our nation to deal with the public health and
economic challenges we face.''

Top Democrats had warned lawmakers that a vote against the legislation
would carry grave political repercussions.

``If you vote against this and all this funding for your state, then you
have to go home and defend it,'' Ms. Pelosi told House Democrats in a
private call on Thursday evening, according to multiple people familiar
with her remarks, who described them on the condition of anonymity.
``And if you can defend that `no' vote, then you're a better politician
than me.''

But by Friday morning, multiple moderate Democrats had announced their
intention to do just that.

In an interview, Representative Kendra Horn, Democrat of Oklahoma, said
she supported parts of the package, but could not back it in its current
form.

``This is a vote saying we need to do the work to get this bill where it
needs to be,'' she said.

The progressive flank of the caucus was also rankled by the bill,
contending it did not go far enough to support workers in need of health
care and regular paychecks. But the Congressional Progressive Caucus
ultimately stopped short of encouraging its members to vote against the
bill, even as one of its leaders, Representative Pramila Jayapal of
Washington, announced that she would vote no.

``This is a crisis. People are really trying to figure out what they
want to do, and I just want to respect that,'' Ms. Jayapal said on
Friday. ``But at the same time, there's a lot of frustration, both with
the process and the content.''

``It's hard to argue insufficiency in a small bill,'' she added. ``But
this is supposed to be our vision.''

Catie Edmondson and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.
