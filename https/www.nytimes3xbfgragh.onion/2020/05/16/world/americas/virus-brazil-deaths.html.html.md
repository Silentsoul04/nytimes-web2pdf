# Brazil, Once a Leader, Struggles to Contain Virus Amid Political Turmoil

The nation’s pioneering responses to past health crises, including AIDS
and Zika, won global praise. But the government’s chaotic response to
the virus has undercut the country’s ability to cope.

*\[Read more on* [*Brazil’s Coronavirus cases and
deaths*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html)*.\]*

Thronged banks. Packed subway cars. Buses full of President [Jair
Bolsonaro’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-coronavirus-brazil.html)
fervent supporters, heading to rallies that call on
[Brazilians](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-coronavirus-brazil.html)
to brush aside stay-at-home orders from mayors and governors and instead
follow the president’s directive to get back to work.

Scenes like these are a reflection of Brazil’s contradictory and chaotic
response to the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-coronavirus-brazil.html)
pandemic, which was on glaring display on Friday when the health
minister resigned — just weeks after his predecessor was abruptly fired
following clashes with Mr. Bolsonaro.

The national confusion has helped fuel the spread of the disease and
contributed to making [Brazil an emerging center of the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/world/americas/brazil-coronavirus-statistics.html),
with a daily death rate second only to that of the United States.

Public health experts say the disorderly approach has further saturated
intensive care units and morgues and contributed to the deaths of scores
of medical professionals as Latin America’s largest economy plunges into
what may be its steepest recession in history.

The crisis facing the country stands in stark contrast to Brazil’s track
record for innovative and nimble responses to health care challenges
that made it a model in the developing world in decades past.

“Brazil’s could have been one of the best responses to this pandemic,”
said [Marcia Castro](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/marcia-castro/), a
professor at Harvard University who is from Brazil and specializes in
global health. “But right now everything is completely disorganized and
no one is working toward joint solutions. This has a cost, and the cost
is human lives.”

Brazil had months to study the errors and successes of the first
countries struck by the virus. Its robust public health care system
could have been deployed to conduct mass testing and trace the movements
of newly infected patients.

Its failure to act early and aggressively is at odds with the country’s
ingenious approaches to past medical crises, health experts said.

Brazil’s prior success resulted from investment in science and
empowerment of scientists, said Tania Lago, a professor of medicine at
Santa Casa University in São Paulo, who worked in the ministry of health
in the 1990s.

“Now there’s been a rupture in the nation with its scientific
community,” she said. “What saddens me is that we are and will
continue to lose lives that could be saved.”

As countries started taking drastic measures to curb the spread of the
virus in February and March, Mr. Bolsonaro played down the risks and
encouraged public gatherings. Now, he is urging Brazilians to return to
work even as the number of new cases and [deaths are

As of Saturday, Brazil had 233,142 diagnosed cases of coronavirus and
15,633 deaths. But the actual death toll is likely to be much higher,
according to death records compiled by Fiocruz, a government institute
that studies health care trends.

Between Jan. 1 and May 9, official government figures say 10,627 people
died in Brazil of Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus.

University of Washington, [the virus is on track to
kill](http://www.healthdata.org/brazil) more than 88,000 people in
Brazil by early August.

Brazil’s Federal Council of Nursing said insufficient protective
equipment and punishing workloads have exposed thousands of medical
professionals to the virus, leaving hospitals understaffed.

“Because salaries are low, most work in two places, some three,” said
Manoel Neri, the president of the council. “This is a longstanding
problem in Brazil.”

The council said [at least 116 nurses and medical technicians have
died](http://observatoriodaenfermagem.cofen.gov.br) from confirmed or
suspected coronavirus cases in recent weeks. Nearly 15,000 have
developed symptoms, but many have been unable to get

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The political turmoil that has whiplashed the health ministry over the
past few weeks has further hurt the country’s ability to prepare for the
pandemic.

The health minister, Nelson Teich, resigned on Friday, just days shy of
completing a month on the job.

Mr. Bolsonaro fired his predecessor, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after the
two clashed over the president’s disdain for quarantine measures.

In an interview, Mr. Mandetta said Brazil’s “erratic” response to the
pandemic left it ill-equipped to compete in a global scramble for
ventilators, tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.

“Our challenge is to expand health coverage while competing with the
absurd spending power of the United States and Europe,” he said.

Flávio Dino, the governor of Maranhão State, said the federal government
has been an obstacle as state officials have shopped for ventilators and
put up field hospitals. The state capital, São Luís, was the first in
the country to impose a strict lockdown this month, requiring everyone
other than essential workers to stay home.

“At the national level, there wasn’t a plan to prepare for this trying

“You don’t change the crew of an airplane
mid-flight.”

The impoverished State of Amazonas, in the north, has seen its hospitals
overloaded and its cemeteries resorting to mass graves in order to cope
with the deluge of bodies.

Arthur Virgílio Neto, the mayor of Manaus, the state capital, has cried
during televised interviews as he pleaded for federal assistance. Mr.
Bolsonaro, with his disregard for social distancing and other preventive
measures, has been part of the problem, Mr. Virgílio said.

“People never stopped roaming the streets; there has been flagrant
disregard for our decrees,” he said, blaming Mr. Bolsonaro. “He is
against social distancing, and that explains part of the disobedience.”

Facing mounting criticism, the Bolsonaro administration, which declined
to comment, launched a campaign this past week that highlighted the
president’s concern over the economy, which is projected to contract by
at least 5 percent this year.

“Those lockdowns, they’re not the path — they’re the path to failure,”
Mr. Bolsonaro said on Thursday, [addressing
supporters](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAKwEN7nRHV/) outside the
presidential palace. He added, disparagingly, “It will turn into a
country of misery, like a country in sub-Saharan Africa.”

Ms. Castro, the Harvard professor, said the government’s failure to
mount an effective response is likely to lead to a series of outbreaks
that will do more damage to the economy in the long run.
