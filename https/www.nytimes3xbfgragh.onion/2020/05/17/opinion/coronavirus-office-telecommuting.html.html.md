The office, for the foreseeable future, is dead. Google and Facebook are
telling employees they can work remotely
[until 2021](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/technology/coronavirus-work-from-home.html).
Twitter is allowing employees to work from home
“[forever](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbbrandon/2020/05/12/this-is-huge-twitter-ceo-says-employees-can-work-from-home-forever/).”
A number of big banks are contemplating never fully refilling their
office towers in Manhattan. Last week, my colleague Matthew Haag wrote a
[thoroughly depressing
story](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/nyregion/coronavirus-work-from-home.html)
in which the chief executive of Halstead Real Estate asked him point
blank: “Looking forward, are people going to want to crowd into
offices?”

Call me crazy, but I’m still thinking: *Yes*. Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but someday. The modern office may be the target of bleak
caricature — the lighting is bad, the meetings are long, the only
recourse to boredom is filching a colleague’s stapler and [embalming it
in lemon Jell-O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glFrp-CmNVA) (if you
work at Dunder Mifflin). But over the coming months, I suspect that
those of us who spent most of our careers in offices will grow to miss
them.

What will we miss about them, specifically? Camaraderie, for one thing.
Maybe it’s obvious that offices are social hubs — it’s certainly an idea
that TV sitcoms and dramas have long grasped — but the numbers are still
interesting. Two-thirds of all women who work outside the home, for
instance, say that “the social aspect” of their jobs is a “major reason”
for showing up each day, according to [a comprehensive survey by
Gallup](https://www.uvu.edu/uwlp/docs/gallupworkandlifewelllived-oct.pdf).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’ll admit I fall rather contentedly into this group. Until my mid-30s,
I was a serene creature of the cubicle. Not being religious, the office
was where I often found fellowship; not yet being married, it was where
I had a work spouse. For people in that liminal period of emergent
adulthood — when they’re still [schmoozers, rather than
machers](http://metta-spencer.blogspot.com/2006/01/old-schmoozers-and-machers.html),
to use the sociologist Robert Putnam’s memorable distinction — the
office can play a crucial and happy role.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And have I mentioned that offices are great places to find actual
spouses? A surprising number of marriages start in their fluorescent
halls. (Famous examples: Barack and Michelle, Bill and Melinda.) The
statistics on this phenomenon vary — I’ve seen studies [ranging
from 11](https://qz.com/1546677/around-40-of-us-couples-now-first-meet-online/)
to [31
percent](http://press.careerbuilder.com/2018-02-01-Office-Romance-Hits-10-Year-Low-According-to-CareerBuilders-Annual-Valentines-Day-Survey)
— but even the smallest number isn’t trivial, and the most outlandish
examples can make for delightful trivia. Southwest Airlines announced 21
years ago that more than 1,600 of its 26,900 employees were married to
each other. (Under the perhaps inevitable headline, “[Love is in the
air](https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-9a64e058fd5edca195eccf844b705447-Love-is-in-the-Air-at-Southwest-Airlines).”)

But the benefits to office life are more than just social. They are also
intellectual. Without offices, we miss out on the chance for
serendipitous encounters, and it’s precisely those moments of felicitous
engagement that spark the best ideas.

Years ago, the productivity philosopher and author Adam Grant [pointed
out to
me](https://www.thecut.com/2015/01/what-we-give-up-when-we-become-entrepreneurs.html)
that [the reason we have Post-it
Notes](https://www.cnn.com/2013/04/04/tech/post-it-note-history/index.html)
is because a chemist at 3M, Spencer Silver, spent years trying
fruitlessly to promote his low-tack adhesive in and around the office —
until a churchgoing colleague, Art Fry, finally saw one of his
presentations and realized the sticky stuff would be perfect for keeping
his bookmarks affixed to his hymnals. Propinquity made all the
difference.

Another way to think about this: Working from home rather than the
office is sort of like shopping on Amazon rather than in a proper
bookstore. In a bookstore, you never know what you might find. You can’t
even know what you don’t know until you wander down the wrong aisle and
stumble across it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But to me, the best arguments for the office have always been
psychological — and never have they felt more urgent than at this
moment. I’ll start with a subtle thing: Remote work leaves a terrible
feedback vacuum. Communication with colleagues is no longer casual but
effortful; no matter how hard you try, you’re going to have less contact
— particularly of the casual variety — and with fewer people.

And what do we humans do in the absence of interaction? We invent
stories about what that silence means. They are often negative ones.
It’s a formula for anxiety, misunderstanding, all-around messiness.

“You need time to develop informal patterns with colleagues, especially
if you don’t know them well,” Nancy Rothbard, a professor of management
at Wharton, told me. She added that power differences also complicate
things, and not in a way I found reassuring. [The
literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17100492) suggests that
if a boss delays in replying to an email, we underlings assume he or she
is off doing important things. But if *we’re* late in replying, the boss
assumes we’re indolent or don’t have much to say. Great.

More broadly speaking, even without an office, there will still be
office politics. They’re much easier to navigate if you can actually
*see* your colleagues — and therefore discern where the power resides,
how business gets done, and who the kind people are.

But perhaps the most profound effect of working in an office has to do
with our very sense of self. We live in an age where our identities
aren’t merely assigned to us; they are realized and achieved, and
places are powerful triggers of them. How much do I feel like a
columnist if I’m wearing a 21-year-old Austin Powers T-shirt (“It’s
Cannes, baby\!”) and picking at my kid’s leftovers as I type? I mean,
somewhat, sure. But I suspect I’d feel more like one if I got dolled up
and walked into the Times building each morning.

Rothbard, who’s made a study of the borders between our professional and
domestic selves, told me she sees this confusion all the time. There are
“integrators,” she said, who don’t mind the dissolution of those
borders, and “segmenters,” who don’t care for it. (“The pandemic,” she
said, “is a segmenter’s hell.”) It’s hardly uncommon to have multiple
identities across multiple contexts, each of them authentic. But remote
work makes it awfully hard for segmenters to give full expression to
their professional selves, and when they do, it often rattles those
around them. “Your kids may see you talking to your employees in a
different way and be like, ‘Who *is* this person?’” she told me.

But it’s young people, I’d argue, who’ll miss out most if the office
disappeared. Offices are often the very place where professional
identities are forged — an especially valuable thing in an age of
declining religious engagement and deferred marriage and childbearing.
Yes, perhaps that’s slightly ominous, just another depressing sign that
work has replaced religion as a source of meaning, as Derek Thompson
argued [so beautifully in The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/)
last year.

Unfortunately, technology has already collapsed the boundary between
work and home. The office, at least, was a solid membrane between the
two. And it may possibly be the last.
