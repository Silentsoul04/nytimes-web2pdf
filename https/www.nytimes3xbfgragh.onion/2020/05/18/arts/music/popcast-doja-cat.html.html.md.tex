Doja Cat's journey to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 --- for her hit
``Say So,'' bolstered by a remix featuring Nicki Minaj --- involved an
extremely nonlinear path.

She is signed to the imprint of one of the most powerful producers in
pop, Dr. Luke, but most of her fame has been online.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/24/arts/music/kesha-dr-luke.html}{Dr.
Luke was accused of sexual misconduct} by Kesha, yet Doja Cat's image
and presentation is rooted in empowerment. She has made SoundCloud R\&B,
lo-fi hip-hop and, now, centrist disco-pop. She has been chastised for
past misdeeds on the internet, yet continues to push the envelope of
online behavior.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about the many twists and turns
of Doja Cat's career, how her musical and extramusical lives have
intersected, and how the internet both remembers and forgets.
