# Cleon and Leon Boyd, Vermont Twins Tied to the Land, Die at 64

</div>

They boiled sap at the family farm, groomed the ski slopes and played
country music. The brothers died of the novel coronavirus, which also
sickened many in their extended family.

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Visitors to Vermont’s Green Mountains come for the ski slopes and
thick-wooded trails, the farmland, foliage and maple syrup.

They may never see the people who create that experience by mowing
grass, boiling sap into syrup and taming snow into skiable terrain.
People like Cleon and Leon Boyd, identical twins from Wilmington, Vt.

The rugged pair, distinguished by Leon’s foot-long white beard, were
keepers of the landscape but also of the people who lived there. When
not grooming the slopes of the Mount Snow ski resort by moonlight
(Cleon) or cleaning schools (Leon), they worked at [Boyd Family
Farm](http://boydfamilyfarm.com/), where they grew up and which is just
down the road from their homes.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Boyd brothers, 64, died six days apart in early April. Both men were
among about a dozen family members who fell sick in March with Covid-19,
relatives said, after good snow brought thousands of skiers to the area.

“To have them gone is losing part of our heritage,” Gretchen Havreluk, a
family friend, said. “They were always willing to help. They’d say, ‘Hi,
I haven’t seen you in a while. Tell me your story.’”

They often started the day together at a diner and ended it together
playing country music at a pub or with family. The self-taught musicians
and their salty banter were a staple at weddings and parties.

The Boyd brothers were working at Mount Snow when coronavirus fears shut
the mountain down. They then spent time at the farm’s sugar shack,
helping make syrup.

“They were not the kind to worry about a germ,” Janet Boyd, who is
married to the twins’ brother Bucky, said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Few in the area seemed to worry about the pandemic. Then, members of
three generations of Boyds, suffering exhaustion, aches and fever,
tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Cleon, who had [chronic
obstructive pulmonary
disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679),
and Leon, who had a heart condition, went to the hospital and soon
needed ventilators.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“My husband said, ‘This is a twin thing. It won’t end well,’” said Ms.
Boyd, who also fell sick with the virus.

Cleon died on April 3 at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in
Bennington and Leon on April 9 at [Cheshire Medical
Center](https://www.cheshire-med.com/) in Keene, N.H. Cleon, who was
divorced, had four children. Leon is survived by his wife Pamela and two
children. They are also survived by their mother and four siblings.

Two days after Cleon died, friends asked his family members to sit in
their cars along the roadside near their homes.

One by one, hundreds of fire trucks, excavators, cars with signs reading
“Boyd Tough,” trucks carrying musicians, even Cleon’s snow groomer,
passed, honking horns.

“The community was helpless and needed to do something,” Ms. Boyd said.
“It’s an illness that doesn’t let you say goodbye.”

A week later, on Easter Sunday, they did the same for
Leon.
