Nearly [7.7
million](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/6953-unemployment-under-30/8b646ef429cecb7d77a7/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
American workers younger than 30 are now unemployed and [three
million](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/6954-3-million-left-workforce/8b646ef429cecb7d77a7/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
dropped out of the labor force in the past month. Combined that’s nearly
one in three young workers, by far the[highest
rate](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/6955-highestunemplyment/d1c48c3099970861ff19/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
since the country started tracking unemployment by age in 1948.

Nearly [40 percent](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)
worked in the devastated retail and food service sectors. And as the
most recently hired, young workers are typically the first let go and
often the last rehired, especially those of color.

As our country’s leaders consider a range of solutions to address this
crisis, there’s one fix that will put millions of young Americans
directly to work: a 21st-century version of the Civilian Conservation
Corps.

In 1933, when President Franklin Roosevelt created the C.C.C., he was
facing, as we are today, the possibility of a lost generation of young
people. The conservation-minded president’s idea was to hire young
unemployed men for projects in forestry, soil conservation and
recreation. By 1942, the [3.4 million
participants](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv31307)
in “Roosevelt’s Tree Army” had planted more than three billion trees,
built hundreds of parks and wildlife refuges and completed thousands of
miles of trails and roads.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the corps was not perfect — only men were hired, work camps were
segregated, and some projects caused ecological damage — the C.C.C. was
the most expansive and successful youth employment program in American
history. It also played a crucial role in forging the Greatest
Generation, which defeated fascism and built the strongest economy in
the world. Today, there’s plenty to do for a revitalized conservation
corps that would put young Americans back to work.

We’ve amassed a staggering backlog of restoration needs for our nation’s
lands and waters, and face escalating vulnerabilities to fires, floods,
hurricanes and droughts. Our national parks, wildlife refuges and other
public lands have [$20 billion in deferred
maintenance](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43997.pdf) — and states have
tens of billions of dollars more. Eighty million acres of national
forests need rehabilitation. [Half a
million](https://www.abandonedmines.gov/extent_of_the_problem) abandoned
coal and hard-rock mines and
[thousands](http://iogcc.ok.gov/Websites/iogcc/images/Publications/2019%2012%2031%20Idle%20and%20Orphan%20oil%20and%20gas%20wells%20-%20state%20and%20provincial%20regulatory%20strategies%20\(2019\).pdf)
of orphaned oil and gas wells need reclamation. More than [12,000
species](https://www.nwf.org/-/media/Documents/PDFs/NWF-Reports/2018/Reversing-Americas-Wildlife-Crisis_2018.ashx)
of at-risk wildlife, fish and plants need conservation.

Smart investments in natural solutions could create millions of
immediate jobs for the demographic groups and regions acutely affected
by the downturn. One study found that restoration jobs support up to [33
jobs per $1 million of
investment](https://curs.unc.edu/files/2014/01/RestorationEconomy.pdf),
which can stimulate economic growth and employment in other industries.
Those that would stand to benefit include outdoor recreation,
agriculture, forestry and ranching, which have been hit hard by the
pandemic.

These projects would expand recreational opportunities, increase our
resilience to extreme weather and use nature by planting trees to
sequester the carbon dioxide emissions that are warming the planet.

We already have federal, state, local and tribal plans and projects that
have been vetted and are ready to go, and pending bipartisan
legislation, like the [Great America Outdoors
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3422) and
the [Recovering America’s Wildlife
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3742/),
which would provide financing for some of this work. We also have the
infrastructure of AmeriCorps’ [National Civilian Community
Corps](https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/americorps-programs/americorps-nccc)
and other programs that are part of the Corporation for National and
Community Service. They can be scaled up and modernized, as proposed by
Senators Chris Coons of Delaware and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, both
Democrats, and others.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To maximize these benefits, three lessons from the C.C.C. should guide
our recovery today.

First, all communities must benefit, including youth of color and
Indigenous young people. Second, states, local governments and tribes
must be full partners. Third, high-quality educational opportunities and
apprenticeships must be included to ensure that the program’s
participants are fully prepared for private-sector employment
opportunities.

How much would all this cost? That depends on the scope of our
ambitions. But clearly, there is plenty of work to be done and too many
young people without jobs or prospects who are available to do it.

We can prevent a youth unemployment crisis from hobbling the next
generation, strengthen local economies and bolster community resilience,
but we must act now to put millions of young people to work restoring
America’s natural treasures.
