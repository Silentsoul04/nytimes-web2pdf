Homeowners use up 10 times more pesticide per acre than farmers do. But
we can change what we do in our own yards.

NASHVILLE — One day last fall, deep in the middle of a devastating
drought, I was walking the dog when a van bearing the logo of a
mosquito-control company blew past me and parked in front of a
neighbor’s house. The whole vehicle stank of chemicals, even going 40
miles an hour.

The man who emerged from the truck donned a massive backpack carrying a
tank full of insecticide and proceeded to spray every bush and plant in
the yard. Then he got in his truck, drove two doors down, and sprayed
that yard, too, before continuing his route all around the block.

Here’s the most heartbreaking thing about the whole episode: He was
spraying for mosquitoes that didn’t even exist: [Last year’s extreme
drought](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/flash-drought-engulfs-us-southeast-september-2019)
ended mosquito-breeding season long before the first freeze.
Nevertheless, the mosquito vans arrived every three weeks, right on
schedule, drenching the yards with poison for no reason but the schedule
itself.

And spraying for mosquitoes isn’t the half of it, as any walk through
the lawn-care department of a big-box store will attest. People want the
outdoors to work like an extension of their homes — fashionable, tidy,
predictable. Above all, comfortable. So weedy yards filled with tiny
wildflowers get bulldozed end to end and replaced with sod cared for by
homeowners spraying from a bottle marked “backyard bug control” or by
lawn services that leave behind tiny signs warning, “Lawn care
application; keep off the grass.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If only songbirds could read.

Most people don’t seem to know that in this context “application” and
“control” are simply euphemisms for “poison.” A friend once mentioned
to me that she’d love to put up a nest box for bluebirds, and I offered
to help her choose a good box and a safe spot for it in her yard,
explaining that she would also need to tell her yard service to stop
spraying. “I had no idea those guys were spraying,” she said.

To enjoy a lush green lawn or to sit on your patio without being eaten
alive by mosquitoes doesn’t seem like too much to ask unless you
actually *know* that insecticides designed to kill mosquitoes will also
kill every other kind of insect: earthworms and caterpillars, spiders
and mites, honeybees and butterflies, native bees and lightning bugs.
Unless you actually *know* that herbicides also kill insects when they
ingest the poisoned plants.

The global insect die-off is so precipitous that, if the trend
continues, [there will be no insects left a hundred years from
now](https://www.plantbasednews.org/news/insects-facing-extinction-within-100-years).
That’s a problem for more than the bugs themselves: Insects are
responsible for pollinating roughly 75 percent of all flowering plants,
including [one-third of the human world’s food
supply](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/why-insect-populations-are-plummeting-and-why-it-matters/).

They form the basis of much of the animal world’s food supply, as well.
When we poison the bugs and the weeds, we are also [poisoning the
turtles](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAEKJq8BNPr/) and tree frogs, the
bats and screech owls, the songbirds and skinks.

“If insect species losses cannot be halted, this will have catastrophic
consequences for both the planet’s ecosystems and for the survival of
mankind,” Francisco Sánchez-Bayo of the University of Sydney, Australia,
[told The Guardian last
year](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Lawn chemicals are not, by themselves, the cause of [the insect
apocalypse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html),
of course. Heat waves can [render male insects
sterile](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/13/heatwaves-wipe-out-male-insect-fertility-beetles-study);
loss of habitat can cause precipitous population declines; agricultural
pesticides kill land insects and, by way of runoff into the nation’s
waterways, aquatic insects, as well.

As individuals, [we can help to slow such
trends](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/13/opinion/earth-environmentalism.html?searchResultPosition=1),
but we don’t have the power to reverse them. Changing the way we think
about our own yards is the only thing we have complete control over. And
since homeowners use [up 10 times more pesticide per
acre](https://www.fws.gov/dpps/visualmedia/printingandpublishing/publications/2003_HomeownersGuidetoProtectingFrogs.pdf)
than farmers do, changing the way we think about our yards can make a
huge difference to our fellow creatures.

It can make a huge difference to our own health, too: As the Garden Club
of America notes in its [Great Healthy Yard
Project](http://tghyp.com/468-revision-v1/), synthetic pesticides are
endocrine disrupters linked to an array of human health problems,
including autism, A.D.H.D., diabetes and cancer. So many people have
invested so completely in the chemical control of the outdoors that
every subdivision in this country might as well be declared a Superfund
site.

Changing our relationship to our yards is simple: Just don’t spray. Let
the tiny wildflowers take root within the grass. Use an oscillating fan
to keep the mosquitoes away. Tug the weeds out of the flower bed with
your own hands and feel [the benefit of a natural
antidepressant](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/66840#_blank)
at the same time. Trust the natural world to perform its own insect
control, and watch the songbirds and the tree frogs and the box turtles
and the friendly garter snakes return to their homes among us.

Because butterflies and bluebirds don’t respect property lines, our best
hope is to make this simple change a community effort. For 25 years, my
husband and I have been trying to create a wildlife sanctuary of this
half-acre lot, planting native flowers for the bees and the butterflies,
[leaving the garden
messy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/let-your-winter-garden-go-wild.html)
as a safe place for overwintering insects.

Despite our best efforts, our yard is being visibly changed anyway.
Fewer birds. Fewer insects. Fewer everything. Half an acre, it turns
out, is not enough to sustain wildlife unless the other half-acre lots
are nature-friendly, too.

It’s spring now, and nearly every day I get a flier in the mail
advertising a yard service or a mosquito-control company. I will never
poison this yard, but I save the fliers anyway, as a reminder of what
we’re up against. I keep them next to an eastern swallowtail butterfly
that my 91-year-old father-in-law found dead on the sidewalk. He saved
it for me because he knows how many flowers I’ve planted over the years
to feed the pollinators.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I keep that poor dead butterfly, even though it breaks my heart, because
I know what it cost my father-in-law to bring it to me. How he had to
lock the brakes on his walker, hold onto one of the handles and stoop on
arthritic knees to get to the ground. How gently he had to pick up the
butterfly to keep from crumbling its wings into powder. How carefully he
set it in the basket of the walker to protect it.

My father-in-law didn’t know that the time for protection had passed.
The butterfly he found is perfect, unbattered by age or struggle. It was
healthy and strong until someone sprayed for mosquitoes, or weeds, and
killed it, too.
