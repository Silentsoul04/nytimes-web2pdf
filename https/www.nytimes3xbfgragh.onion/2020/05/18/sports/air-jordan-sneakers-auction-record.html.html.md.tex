\$560,000}\label{michael-jordans-game-worn-sneakers-sell-for-560000}}

A pair of Air Jordan 1s from 1985, signed by the NBA legend, broke an
auction record on Sunday.

Being \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0AGiq9j_Ak}{like Mike}
comes with a high price tag these days.

A pair of Michael Jordan's game-worn, autographed sneakers from his
rookie season sold at
\href{https://www.sothebys.com/en/press/slam-dunk-sothebys-sets-new-world-auction-record-for-any-pair-of-sneakers?locale=en}{an
online Sotheby's auction} for \$560,000 on Sunday, breaking the previous
record for a sneaker, according to the auction house. Sotheby's is not
naming the buyer.

The red, white and black Nike Air Jordan 1s are the same color scheme as
the Chicago Bulls uniform and sport Jordan's autograph in black ink on
an upper red leather panel. The sneaker is part of a signature line that
Nike created for Jordan to persuade him to sign a sneaker deal with the
sportswear company, Sotheby's said.

The variations that differentiate this pair of sneakers from ones sold
to the public in 1985 include the red laces --- the others came with
only black and white laces --- a leaner and longer Nike check, and the
materials used to make the shoe.

The sale took place on the same day as ESPN aired the finale of
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/the-last-dance-jordan.html}{The
Last Dance},'' a 10-part documentary about Jordan's career.

The shoes were sold by Jordan Geller, a sneaker collector and the
founder of the \href{https://shoezeum.com/}{Shoezeum}, a sneaker museum.

``These are the most iconic and coveted sneakers of all time,'' Geller
said. ``Owning this pair has been a real pleasure and with all the
excitement surrounding Michael Jordan and `The Last Dance,' my wife and
I decided that it's time to let the shoes find a new home.''

Geller created the record that the sale of the Air Jordan 1s broke. In
2019, he sold the Nike Moon Shoe, the prototype to the first
waffle-soled shoe by Nike, at a Sotheby's auction for \$437,500.

This specific pair of Air Jordan 1s was the forerunner of the sneaker
that was eventually sold to the public.

``I think that this sneaker holds a particular importance to sneaker
heads,'' said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby's director of e-commerce
development and the organizer of the sale. ``The Air Jordan 1 helped
bring about the hype and importance that sneakers have in the world.''

The sneakers were the inaugural pair in Jordan's
\href{https://www.footlocker.com/history-of-air-jordan.html}{line with
Nike}. In 1985, the NBA informed Nike that Jordan's shoes violated the
league's uniform policy and banned them from its games. Nike in turn
created an ad campaign highlighting the ban.

\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEmAgKYV1uo}{In the ad}, a young
Jordan stares at the camera and bounces a basketball in place as the
camera pans down to his feet. Censorship bars are superimposed over the
sneakers and a voice says, ``On Sept. 15, Nike created a revolutionary
new basketball shoe. On Oct. 18, the NBA threw them out of the game.
Fortunately, the NBA can't stop you from wearing them.''

The sneaker went on to earn \$126 million in its first year, Jordan says
in the documentary.
