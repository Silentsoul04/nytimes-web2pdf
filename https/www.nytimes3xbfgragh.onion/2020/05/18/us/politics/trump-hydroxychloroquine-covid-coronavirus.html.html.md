WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Monday that he had been taking
[hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html),
an antimalarial drug the Food and Drug Administration warned could cause
serious heart problems for coronavirus patients. He said he was taking
the drug as a preventive measure and continued to test negative for the
coronavirus.

“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” Mr. Trump said, adding
that he had been taking the drug for about a week and a half, with the
approval of the White House physician. “I get a lot of tremendously
positive news on the hydroxy,” Mr. Trump continued, explaining that his
decision to try the drug was based on one of his favorite refrains:
“What do you have to lose?”

But Mr. Trump’s announcement surprised many of his aides and drew
immediate criticism from a range of medical experts, who warned not just
of the dangers it posed for the president’s health but also of the
example it set.

“My concern would be that the public not hear comments about the use of
hydroxychloroquine and believe that taking this drug to prevent Covid-19
infection is without hazards. In fact, there are serious hazards,” said
Dr. Steven E. Nissen, the chief academic officer of the Miller Family
Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Scott Solomon, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School,
said Mr. Trump’s decision to try the drug was up to him and his
physician. “But what is irresponsible is the example he is setting,” Dr.
Solomon said.

Mr. Trump publicly embraced hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer” in
the fight against the virus in March, and his endorsement, amplified by
Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, caused a run on the
drug, making it scarce for those who took it for lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis, for which it is regularly prescribed.

But on Monday night, Dr. Manny Alvarez, the senior managing editor for
Fox News’s health news, [said on
air](https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1262508060410613765) that
the president’s statement was “highly irresponsible” and asked what had
changed since studies showed the drug had no
benefits.

Mr. Trump first said he was considering taking the drug himself in
April. But in recent weeks he had notably stopped promoting it, as did
the Fox News hosts. But he then [suggested at a news
conference](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/us/politics/trump-disinfectant-coronavirus.html)
that injecting disinfectants into the human body could help combat the
virus, causing confused callers [to flood state health
hotlines](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F04%2F24%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
and the makers of Clorox and Lysol to plead with Americans not to inject
or ingest their products.

His announcement on Monday came less than a month after the F.D.A.
[issued a safety warning about the
drug](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share),
noting that it could cause dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm in
coronavirus patients and should not be used outside clinical trials or
in hospitals where patients were closely monitored for heart problems.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But by that time hydroxychloroquine had become a divisive issue within
the Trump administration. Dr. Rick Bright, who led the federal agency
involved in developing a
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html)
vaccine, said he was removed from his post after he pressed for rigorous
vetting of the drug.

Dr. Bright said he was pressured to direct money toward
hydroxychloroquine, one of several “potentially dangerous drugs promoted
by those with political connections.”

On Monday, the president not only promoted the drug but also said he was
taking it. And he made it clear that his decision was based on trusting
anecdotal evidence, and his own gut, over the warnings of the
government, or any data.

In that sense his position was consistent with his view of other expert
medical advice — he has also refused to follow the guidelines of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and wear a face mask. And
before becoming president he had [alleged that there was a
link](https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/26/trump-vaccinations-measles/)
between the number of vaccines children got in early infancy and the
development of autism.

“I take it because I think I hear very good things,” Mr. Trump said,
citing a letter he received from an unnamed doctor in Westchester, N.Y.,
promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine.

“I want the people of this nation to feel good. I don’t want them being
sick,” Mr. Trump said at the end of a round table with restaurant
executives at the White House. “And there is a very good chance that
this has an impact, especially early on.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump said he started taking the drug about 10 days ago, around the
same time [two White House aides tested positive for the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/10/us/politics/white-house-coronavirus-trump.html),
prompting the fears of the president and other top officials that the
virus would spread rapidly through the West
Wing.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

As for taking hydroxychloroquine, “I’m not going to get hurt by it,” Mr.
Trump said, adding that he was sharing the news to be transparent with
Americans and appearing to enjoy the shock value of his announcement.
“It has been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other
things.”

Later on Monday night, the White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley,
[released a
statement](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/6959-letter-from-white-house-physic/e3e29d81b7d6339b9f56/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
that linked Mr. Trump’s decision to take the drug to the “support staff”
who tested positive for the virus, an apparent reference to the
president’s personal valet. “After numerous discussions he and I had
regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we
concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative
risks,” Dr. Conley said. He also said the president “is in very good
health and has remained symptom free.”

Early studies of hydroxychloroquine in the laboratory suggesting that
the drug could block the coronavirus from attacking cells prompted
initial enthusiasm. But the studies of the drug in humans so far have
pointed to serious side effects.

“I think it’s a very bad idea to be taking hydroxychloroquine as a
preventive medication,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the
director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla,
Calif. “There are no data to support that, there’s no evidence and in
fact there is no compelling evidence to support its use at all at this
point.”

Dr. Topol said the risk of developing a potentially fatal arrhythmia
because of hydroxychloroquine could come without warning and did not
happen only in people with heart conditions. “We can’t predict that. In
fact, it can happen in people who are healthy,” he said. “It could
happen in anyone.”

Mr. Trump has never provided the public with a full picture of his
health. In 2018, the White House physician reported that Mr. Trump had
an LDL cholesterol level of 143, well above the desired level of 100 or
less. Some cardiologists who are not associated with the White House
said [his cholesterol levels raised heart
concerns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/17/us/politics/trump-physical-heart-health-cholesterol.html).

Mr. Trump made a trip in November to Walter Reed National Military
Medical Center that was not listed on his public schedule. He stayed for
about two hours for what White House officials said were routine tests,
but since the visit had not been revealed in advance and came only nine
months after [his last annual
physical](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2019%2F02%2F14%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-obese.html%3Faction%3Dclick%26module%3DRelatedLinks%26pgtype%3DArticle),
it touched off much discussion about whether the president had an
undisclosed health issue.

Mr. Trump, 73, is the oldest man ever sworn in for a first term as
president, and he is known for his love of fast food and takes pride in
not exercising. At his [checkup last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-obese.html)
he weighed 243 pounds, which is considered obese for a man of his
reported height of 6 feet 3 inches. He has been reported in the past to
be taking rosuvastatin, a lipid-lowering drug, to control his
cholesterol.

Neil Cavuto, a Fox News host, reacted to the president’s announcement
with a grim warning that once might have shocked his network’s viewers.
To anyone with pre-existing conditions, he said: “It will kill you. I
cannot stress enough. This will kill you.”

Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Katie Thomas from New York.
