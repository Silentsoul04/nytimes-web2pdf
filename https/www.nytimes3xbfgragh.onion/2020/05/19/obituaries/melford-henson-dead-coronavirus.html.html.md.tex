Mr. Henson fell ill from the coronavirus only months before he was to be
released from California's prison system.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Melford Henson was supposed to be released from the California
Institution for Men, a minimum-security prison in Chino, Calif., in
December.

He was living in a wing called Elm Hall, designed to hold about 150
people. But the size of the hall didn't allow for proper social
distancing, and he had previous health issues, including heart attacks
and hepatitis C, which put him at high risk if he contracted the
coronavirus.

In April, Mr. Henson told his family that he believed he had caught
Covid-19 from a fellow inmate who he learned had tested positive for the
virus. Mr. Henson had been helping him move around the facility by
pushing his wheelchair.

Mr. Henson died on May 6 of the disease at a hospital in Chino, his
wife, Tracy, said. His prison has the largest outbreak of the novel
coronavirus within the California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation. Jails and prisons nationwide have been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-prisons-jails.html}{particularly
hard hit} by the pandemic.

On the day Mr. Henson died, the prison's population was 3,354, and as of
Tuesday, 3,022 of them had been tested for the virus, according to the
California prisons website. There were
\href{https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/covid19/population-status-tracking/}{593
confirmed cases} at the prison, and the six California inmates who have
died had all been held there.

Melford Raymond Henson Jr. was born on Nov. 10, 1954, in Riverside,
Calif. His mother, Evelyn (Brooks) Henson, and his father raised him in
Rialto, Calif. After high school, he worked in construction before
becoming a foreman on projects building low-power Christian television
stations.

In March 2019, Mr. Henson was sentenced to 32 months in prison for
driving under the influence and sent to San Quentin State Prison before
being moved to the California Institution for Men. His family said he
had previous arrests and was driving without a license when he was
arrested.

Mr. Henson married Tracy Garmon in 2013. Along with his wife, he is
survived by two children from a previous marriage and two adopted
children.

Michael Bien, a lawyer whose firm has filed
\href{https://rbgg.com/wp-content/uploads/Emergency-Motion-Coleman-and-Plata-Three-Judge-Court-Dkt-No-6522-filed-2020-03-25.pdf}{an
emergency motion} to decrease the population in California's prisons,
said that the institution did not provide personal protective equipment,
such as masks, for inmates until April 30.

``A prison and a jail is much more like a nursing home or a cruise ship
than it is like anything else,'' Mr. Bien said. ``It's crowded, people
are vulnerable and it's very difficult to control the virus once it gets
going inside.''

Jeffrey Callison, a spokesman for the state prisons, said he could not
comment on specific cases but said the system had adopted measures to
protect inmates, including limiting nonessential trips between jails,
taking the temperature of people entering prisons, suspending visits,
providing facial barriers and hand sanitizer for those inside and
speeding up the release of 3,500 prisoners.
