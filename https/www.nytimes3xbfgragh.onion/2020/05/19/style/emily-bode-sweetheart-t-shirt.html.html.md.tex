The latest installment of our Designer D.I.Y. at Home series teaches you
how to whip up a present for the significant other you may not have seen
for a while.

The environmentalist precept of ``reduce, reuse, recycle'' is an
aesthetic touchstone for the designer Emily Bode, isolating since
mid-March in British Columbia. Since graduating from Parsons a few years
ago, she has established herself as a maverick presence on the men's
wear scene, her quirky designs attracting the attention of awards
committees as well as a passionate fan base.

The notion of repurposing whatever is at hand was thus no challenge for
Ms. Bode, who often makes clothes from vintage and scavenged materials
of all sorts, including French mattress ticking, quilts, embroidered
tablecloths and even old pennies.

For this project, she proposed making a ``sweetheart'' T-shirt as a
present for that significant other you may not have seen IRL for some
time.

``There's no experience in sewing necessary,'' Ms. Bode said. ``The more
homemade and messy, the better.''

STEP 1

\hypertarget{choose-your-thread}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Choose your
thread}}{Choose your thread}}\label{choose-your-thread}}

Choose thread colors that contrast with the T-shirt. ``This is a great
time to use all of the pre-threaded needles from those miniature hotel
mending kits,'' Ms. Bode said.

STEP 2

\hypertarget{sew-a-running-stitch}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Sew a running
stitch}}{Sew a running stitch}}\label{sew-a-running-stitch}}

Sew a simple loose running stitch along the edges of the cuffs, collar
and hem of the T-shirt. Repeat as many times as you like, using
different colors, and feel free to experiment with harder stitches like
a whipstitch or a zigzag, if you're undaunted by those. Stitch loosely
so the shirt can stretch over your head and body. Tie the thread ends to
your last stitch so the knot does not pull through the knit of the
shirt.

STEP 3

\hypertarget{outline-a-heart}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Outline a
heart}}{Outline a heart}}\label{outline-a-heart}}

Very lightly, with your pencil, outline a large heart on the front of
the T-shirt. ``I like to draw an arrow through the heart,'' she said.

Image

STEP 4

\hypertarget{trace-the-heart-with-thread}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Trace the heart with
thread}}{Trace the heart with thread}}\label{trace-the-heart-with-thread}}

Using the same running stitch, trace the heart with the needle and
thread.

Image

STEP 5

\hypertarget{add-chosen-name-or-initials}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Add chosen name or
initials}}{Add chosen name or initials}}\label{add-chosen-name-or-initials}}

Again, very lightly with a pencil, write your chosen initials or name
diagonally inside the heart. Stitch the initials as in Step 4.

Image

STEP 6

\hypertarget{wash-your-tee}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Wash your
tee}}{Wash your tee}}\label{wash-your-tee}}

Wash your T-shirt to erase pencil marks.
