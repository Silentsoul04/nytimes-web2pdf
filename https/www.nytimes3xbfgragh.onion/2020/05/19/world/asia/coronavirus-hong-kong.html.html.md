HONG KONG —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>Two blocks from my
apartment on the western edge of Hong Kong Island, a Starbucks has been
transformed into what looks like a construction zone, or maybe a strange
art installation.

An armchair near the window was cordoned off for a time with masking
tape, and more strips stretched over and around other chairs nearby,
taut like tightropes over their neighboring tabletops. Rectangles of
white cardboard are clipped to the sides of tables, which now look more
like office cubicles than places to gather with friends.

But if the customers are fazed by the oddness of their surroundings,
they don’t show it.

On a recent Tuesday night, a young couple huddled at one of the
tape-free tables, laughing at something on the girl’s phone. A man
hunched over his laptop, seemingly oblivious to the silos shielding him
from his fellow patrons.

There were temperature checks at every public building, and signs in
elevators telling you how often the buttons were sanitized. A pharmacy
chain handed out fistfuls of stickers with every purchase, featuring the
chain’s mascot — a winking orange cat — and a reminder: “Wash your
hands\! Rub your hands\! 20 seconds, Thx.”

Everywhere, there were reminders that these were not normal times.

Four months later, those signs are still around. But the city is humming
back to life — not really in spite of those omnipresent reminders so
much as alongside
them.

The attendance for morning tai chi in the park behind my apartment has
grown from a few elderly ladies in face masks to dozens. The crowds
strolling along Victoria Harbor have grown denser, children giggling
behind the plastic visors their parents force on them. Many cha chaan
tengs — the hole-in-the-wall Cantonese diners that serve up milk tea,
egg tarts and beef chow fun — still offer discounts for takeout, but the
tables inside are beginning to fill up,
too.

Most directly, this is a response to the good news of recent weeks.

Hong Kong has recorded just three locally transmitted cases in the last
30 days. Only four people are reported to have died of Covid-19 since
the outbreak began. The government has loosened social-distancing
restrictions, allowing civil servants to go back to work and restaurants
to return to full capacity, instead of half.

But that’s not the only reason the virus no longer seems to rule every
facet of life here. While fear and anxiety linger, Hong Kongers seem
particularly adept at living with those emotions — maybe not embracing
this strange new reality, but not recoiling from it either.

That unflappability has struck me sharply during my time here.

I moved to Hong Kong from New York City three months ago. Before
boarding the plane, I had never worn a face mask. Many of my
conversations with friends back home revolve around how long it will
take for things to go back to the way they were before. Like, *really*
like before — not just without stay-at-home orders and shuttered
businesses, but also without masks and the words “social
distancing.”

In Hong Kong, “real" life doesn’t seem so mutually exclusive with our

this before.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Before moving, I read up on Hong Kong’s last battle with an epidemic:
SARS. I knew it had been scarred by the disease, which barreled across
the city in 2003 and killed almost 300 people. But I didn’t realize how
deeply that experience had embedded itself in the city’s psyche until I
arrived.

Face masks are not uncommon even in outbreak-free times. And Hong
Kongers easily remember to press elevator buttons with their keys rather
than their fingertips because they have been doing so for years.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

They stayed home when they could, and donned masks when they couldn’t. I
met many new people in my first weeks in the city; none of them shook my
hand. The first time I rode the subway after arriving, I could see down
the entire length of the train, a forest of red subway poles with not a
single person in sight.

Paradoxically, this longstanding vigilance and self-restraint have
helped Hong Kong preserve some of itself, perhaps more successfully than
other cities that have tried to cling to their pre-virus selves.
Museums, schools and gyms closed here, but restaurants never had to, nor
did hair salons or retail
stores.

Still, in many ways it’s an illusion. In a city as dense as Hong Kong,
even life at half-volume looks vibrant.

It’s the balance sheets that reveal the truth.

Hong Kong is deep in recession, having just recorded its [biggest-ever
economic
contraction](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3082769/coronavirus-hong-kongs-economy-slumps-89-cent).
Restaurants may have stayed open, but
they’re[floundering](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3083160/coronavirus-earnings-hong-kongs-food-and-beverage).
One woman [I interviewed in
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/04/world/coronavirus-schools-closed.html)
had quit her job as a security guard to watch her children after schools
were closed; they still have not reopened.

And, like everyone else in the world, Hong Kongers are tired.

Sometimes social distancing gets lip service. At a noodle shop two weeks
ago, after the available tables filled up, a waitress deposited a
stranger at the table where I was already sitting with two friends.
“It’s OK, four people,” she said, referring to the government’s
four-person limit on public gatherings. (It has since been raised to
eight.)

And in Hong Kong, anyway, even the end of the outbreak may not bring
true normalcy. Already, the [pro-democracy
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/hong-kong-protests)
that roiled the city for most of last year have begun rekindling, as
people feel more comfortable gathering en masse. Many believe they will
soon come roaring back.

So I may not know what real normal life — like, *reall*y real — looks
like in Hong Kong for a while. But, increasingly, it feels as if that’s
not so important,
anyway.
