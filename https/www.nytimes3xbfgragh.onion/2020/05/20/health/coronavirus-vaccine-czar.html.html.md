# Trump’s Vaccine Chief Has Vast Ties to Drug Industry, Posing Possible Conflicts

Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive, is now overseeing the
U.S. initiative to develop coronavirus treatments and vaccines. His
financial interests and corporate roles have come under scrutiny.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The chief scientist brought on to lead the Trump administration’s
vaccine efforts has spent the last several days trying to disentangle
pieces of his stock portfolio and his intricate ties to big
pharmaceutical interests, as critics point to the potential for
significant conflicts of interest.

The scientist, Moncef Slaoui, is a venture capitalist and a former
longtime executive at GlaxoSmithKline. Most recently, he sat on the
board of Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology firm with a $30
billion valuation that is pursuing a coronavirus vaccine. He resigned
when President Trump named him last Thursday to the new post as chief
adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the federal drive for coronavirus
vaccines and treatments.

Just days into his job, the extent of Dr. Slaoui’s financial interests
in drug companies has begun to emerge: The value of his stock holdings
in Moderna jumped nearly $2.4 million, to $12.4 million when the company
released preliminary, partial data from an early phase of its candidate
vaccine trial that helped send the markets soaring on Monday.

Dr. Slaoui sold his shares on Tuesday, and the administration said he
would donate the increased value to cancer research.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the Moderna stock is just one piece of his pharmaceutical portfolio,
much of which is not public. And some ethics and financial securities
experts have voiced concerns about the arrangement Dr. Slaoui struck
with the administration.

In agreeing to accept the position, Dr. Slaoui did not come on board as
a government employee. Instead, he is on a contract, receiving $1 for
his service. That leaves him exempt from federal disclosure rules that
would require him to list his outside positions, stock holdings and
other potential conflicts. And the contract position is not subject to
the same conflict-of-interest laws and regulations that executive branch
employees must follow.

Dr. Slaoui, an expert in molecular biology and immunology, is not the
first Trump administration official with close relationships to drug and
health care companies. His immediate boss, Alex M. Azar II, the health
and human services secretary, is a former Eli Lilly executive. And the
former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott
Gottlieb, has moved in and out of government twice, and divested of his
interests immediately upon assuming the F.D.A. job in 2017.

Dr. Slaoui, 60, has spent his career developing vaccines and
biotechnology businesses, and he has the investments and board seats to
prove it. He still holds just under $10 million in GlaxoSmithKline stock
and remains a partner in Medicxi, a venture capital firm that
specializes in investing in biotech concerns, with several companies
engaged in the global race to develop treatments or vaccines to stanch
the coronavirus pandemic. GSK and Sanofi have become partners in
creating a vaccine candidate against the coronavirus.

The administration has reviewed Dr. Slaoui’s affiliations with several
companies and concluded in several instances that there were no
conflicts because his advisory roles were unrelated to coronavirus
research or treatments, and in some cases the corporations had no
products against the virus in production, according to a senior official
with the Department of Health and Human Services.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new group of which Dr. Slaoui is lead scientist will vet candidates
for vaccines and treatments, to decide whether they should receive
federal financial backing and additional
support.

## Different Approaches to a Coronavirus Vaccine

In an interview, Dr. Slaoui said he was determined to avoid conflicts
and would re-evaluate any remaining associations if his financial
interests stood to gain more from his new post overseeing the
government’s push to encourage speedy development of treatments or
vaccines.

He did not say how much his GSK shares were worth. When he left the
company in 2017, he held about 240,000 shares and share equivalents,
according to the drug company’s annual report and an analysis by the
executive compensation firm
Equilar.

He said he told administration officials that he did not want to sell
his company stock.

“I have worked for 29 years for GSK,” Dr. Slaoui said. “I have never
sold a single share of any company in my life. This is my retirement.
What I said regarding the GSK shares, I said I cannot take the job if I
have to sell them.”

Advanced Decision Vectors, which regularly
[contracts](https://advancedvllc.com/clients/)with the National
Institutes of Health and other federal agencies, will pay Dr. Slaoui’s
living expenses when he stays in Washington away from his home in the
Philadelphia area.

Without public disclosure, some ethics experts called his contract an
end-run around the rules.

“This is basically absurd,” said Virginia Canter, who is chief ethics
counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It
allows for no public scrutiny of his conflicts of interest.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Canter also said federal law barred government contractors from
supervising government employees.

But others noted the lengths to which Dr. Slaoui was already distancing
himself. Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford law professor and a former
commissioner on the Securities and Exchange Commission, said conflicts
of interest involving scientific experts were hardly rare.

“The challenge is to manage them appropriately, because if you try to
avoid them altogether you often won’t be able to get the best people for
the job,” Mr. Grundfest said.

“And obviously there will be appropriate recusals on a situational,
going-forward basis, as is common,” he added. “What more do you want the
guy to do?”

Dr. Slaoui has stepped away from other commitments: He resigned last
week from Lonza, which will manufacture Moderna’s vaccine if it goes
into production. And he said he left his position as an adviser to a
company that works with Chinese businesses to develop therapies against
the virus.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Slaoui also said that if the value of GlaxoSmithKline accrues higher
than that of the pharmaceutical sector of the S\&P 500 Index by the time
he leaves the job, and if GSK has received any investment from the
government for the Covid-19 program, he will donate the difference in
his stock value to the National Institutes of Health, for research.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Michael R. Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs at H.H.S.,
said that the agency’s ethics office had cleared Dr. Slaoui to hold onto
his GSK investment and that he had agreed not to trade other
coronavirus-related stocks. He added that Dr. Slaoui’s contract now
included an ethics addendum, but could not provide details.

Mr. Caputo said Dr. Slaoui’s role would be to recommend decisions that
would be considered by government officials, including the chief
operating officer Gen. Gustave Perna and others supervising the project.

Ms. Canter, a former ethics lawyer in the Obama and Clinton
administrations, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
agencies, pointed out that GSK’s vaccine candidate with Sanofi could
wind up competing with other manufacturers vying for government approval
and support.

“If he retains stock in companies that are investing in the development
of a vaccine, and he’s involved in overseeing this process to select the
safest vaccine to combat Covid-19, regardless of how wonderful a person
he is, we can’t be confident of the integrity of any process in which he
is involved,” Ms. Canter said.

In addition, his affiliation with Medicxi could complicate matters: [Two
of its investors](https://www.medicxi.com/sections/about) are GSK and a
division of Johnson & Johnson, which is also developing a potential
vaccine.

Moderna has already received nearly $500 million from the government to
help scale up production.

In stepping down from Moderna’s board, Dr. Slaoui also gave up the
potential for future stock gains. Equilar estimated that he stood to
forfeit 73,000 options to buy shares valued at $4.2
million.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In the past, he also worked for a company with extensive dealings in
China, which has become a target of the president’s criticism during the
pandemic. Mr. Trump and others have questioned whether China did enough
to contain the coronavirus and assist other countries in controlling its
spread.

The company, Brii Biosciences, where Dr. Slaoui was an adviser until
Friday, has ties to China’s top business leadership.

The company’s high-profile list of investors includes Boyu Capital, the
private equity firm where Jiang Zhicheng, the grandson of the former
Chinese president Jiang Zemin, was a partner until January of this year,
according to corporate filings. Sequoia Capital and Yunfeng Capital, the
private equity fund of Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba, are also
investors.

In April, Brii, which has offices in Durham, N.C., [announced a
partnership](https://www.briibio.com/news/45.html)and licensing deal
over its Covid antibody research with Tsinghua University and the 3rd
People’s Hospital of Shenzhen.

In a statement, Brii said Dr. Slaoui “received compensation consistent
with his service” and left with “a small amount of stock options.” The
company added that Dr. Slaoui was not involved in Brii’s coronavirus
work in China.

Dr. Slaoui said he would resign from the boards of Clasado and Artizan
Biosciences, both companies that work on treatments for intestinal
problems. He said he would remain on the board of SutroVax, which
recently raised $110 million from investors and is developing vaccines
for pneumonia. He will also continue on the boards of Divide & Conquer,
and Monopteros, which work on cancer treatments.

At his first appearance in the White House Rose Garden, Dr. Slaoui
divulged that he had “recently seen early data from a clinical trial
with a coronavirus vaccine, and these data made me feel even more
confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of
vaccine” — enough to inoculate much of the United States — “by the end
of 2020.”

While he did not mention Moderna specifically, the company did release
partial data the following Monday morning, saying that its vaccine
candidate appeared safe and had provoked an immune response in eight of
45 people.

Some researchers and ethicists criticized the company’s decision to
publicize only a piece of a study that had not been published in a
peer-reviewed journal. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, the agency led by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Moderna’s partner on
the vaccine, has not commented.

Moderna has yet to produce any successful vaccine and has a lot riding
on its Covid-19 project. Its technology, which uses genetic material
from the virus called mRNA, is relatively new and unproven. And many
vaccine candidates fail after showing preliminary promise, or cause
serious side effects in later human trials.

By late Monday, Moderna kicked off [a big stock offering
i](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200518005788/en/Moderna-Announces-Pricing-Public-Offering-Shares-Common)n
which it hopes to raise $1.34 billion with the sale of 17.6 million
shares. The company, which expected to close the offering on Thursday,
is looking to raise capital to help bankroll vaccine development.

The company went public in 2018 with a $600 million initial public
offering, the biggest to date for a biotech company. Its board includes
several members of venture capital firms — Flagship Pioneering and
General Catalyst. Flagship was one of the early backers of Moderna and
owns 17 percent of its stock. Another large shareholder is the pharma
company AstraZeneca. Until late last year, the big hedge fund Viking
Global was a sizable investor in Moderna, but it slashed its holdings at
the end of 2019, according to regulatory filings.

Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, owns 8.7 percent of
outstanding stock and last year received a compensation package worth
$8.9 million.

The company has approval to begin a second-phase trial involving 600
people, and said it was moving on an accelerated timetable to begin the
third phase in July with thousands of people.

Many public health experts continue to say it is unlikely that a vaccine
will be ready for mass production before next year.
