Restricted to our homes for months now, many of us have been putting up
with a persistent annoyance: a lousy internet connection.

When we are working, a video call with colleagues becomes pixelated,
with delayed audio. When we are relaxing, movies and video games take
ages to download. In the worst cases, the connection drops altogether.

As people have hunkered down to contain the spread of the coronavirus,
[average internet speeds all over the world have
slowed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/business/coronavirus-internet-traffic-speed.html).
Some broadband providers are feeling crushed by the heavy traffic. And
dated internet equipment can create a bottleneck for our speeds.

Even the most tech savvy are affected. Keerti Melkote, the founder of
Aruba Networks, a division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise that offers
Wi-Fi products for businesses, said that in recent weeks, his DSL
service from AT\&T had dropped periodically. He waited several days for
a technician to arrive and is now contemplating subscribing to Comcast
for a second internet connection.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I had three or four days of calls, and I had to go find a particular
spot in my house where I had better coverage,” Mr. Melkote said.

At the beginning of the pandemic, my internet also became unbearably
slow and suffered several outages. So I asked experts to explain what’s
causing our internet problems — and the different remedies.

## First, diagnose the problem.

What’s causing your slow speeds — your internet provider or your
equipment at home? Here’s a method to figuring that out.

  - Download an internet speed test app on your phone, like Speedtest by
    Ookla (free for
    [iPhones](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847)
    and [Android
    phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest&hl=en_US)).

  - Stand near your router and use the app to run a speed test.

  - Move to a room farther away from the router and run the speed test
    again.

  - Compare the results.

Less than 15 megabits a second is pretty slow. Speeds of about 25
megabits a second are sufficient for streaming high-definition video;
more than 40 megabits a second is ideal for streaming lots of video and
playing video games.

If the speed test results were fast near your Wi-Fi router but slow
farther away, the problem is probably your router, said Sanjay Noronha,
the product lead of Google’s Nest Wifi internet router. If speeds were
slow in both test locations, the issue is probably your internet
provider.

## If it’s your router, here’s what to do.

If you have pinpointed that the problem is your router, the bad news is
that you may have to buy new equipment. The good news is that there are
many approaches to improving your Wi-Fi connection.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Start by asking yourself these questions:

  - **How old is my router?** If it’s more than five years old, you
    should definitely replace it. In 2015, the [Federal Communications
    Commission removed
    restrictions](https://www.fcc.gov/document/5-ghz-u-nii-ro) that had
    limited the wireless transmission power of Wi-Fi routers, allowing
    new routers to be 20 times more powerful than they were before.
    Upgrading to a newer router will probably be one of your most
    life-changing tech purchases.

  - **Where is my router placed?** Ideally, your router should be in a
    central location in your home so that the signal covers as many
    rooms as possible. In addition, your router should be out in the
    open, like on top of a shelf, not hidden inside cabinets or under a
    desk, to beam a clear signal. You should also avoid placing the
    router near objects and materials that cause interference, like
    large fish tanks and metal.

  - **How big is my home?** If you have a home with multiple stories and
    lots of rooms, and your Wi-Fi is weak in some areas, the best
    solution is to buy a so-called mesh network system. It’s a system of
    multiple Wi-Fi access points, including a main router and satellite
    hubs, that lets you connect multiple wireless access points together
    to blanket your home with a strong internet connection.
    
    My favorite mesh systems are [Google
    Wifi](https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_wifi) and[Amazon’s
    Eero](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-eero-mesh-WiFi-system-3-pack-/dp/B07WMLPSRL),
    which start at $99 for a single router and can be bundled with
    additional access points. In general, [I recommend mesh
    systems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/26/technology/personaltech/mesh-network-vs-router.html)
    even for smaller homes, because they are fast and very easy to
    install.

  - **Are my other devices slowing down my connection?** Gadgets with
    slower internet technology can slow down speeds for all your other
    devices.
    
    For example, the iPhone 5 from 2012 uses an older-generation Wi-Fi
    standard. Newer iPhones, from 2014 and later, use a faster wireless
    standard.
    
    Let’s say you own a new iPhone and your teenager owns the iPhone 5.
    If your teenager begins downloading a video on the iPhone 5 and then
    you start downloading something on your iPhone, the older phone will
    take longer to finish before the signal frees up for your phone to
    download at maximum speed.
    
    As a remedy, many modern Wi-Fi routers offer settings that can give
    specific devices [a priority for faster
    speeds](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246483?hl=en).
    Consult your router’s instruction manual for the steps. In this
    hypothetical example, you would want to give your new iPhone top
    priority and move your teenager’s old iPhone to the bottom.

  - **Are my neighbors slowing down my connection?** In apartment
    buildings crowded with gadgets, the devices’ signals are fighting
    for room on the same radio channels. You can see what radio channels
    your neighbors’ devices are using with scanning apps like [WiFi
    Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=abdelrahman.wifianalyzerpro&hl=en_US).
    Then consult your router’s instruction manual for steps on picking a
    clearer radio channel.
    
    This step is tedious, and many modern routers automatically choose
    the clearest radio channel for you. In general, replacing an
    outdated router is the most practical solution.

## If it’s your service provider, there’s not much to do.

If you have determined that your internet provider’s service is the root
of the issue, your only option is to call your internet service provider
and ask for help.

When you call, ask a support agent these questions:

  - **Why are my speeds slow?** Occasionally a support agent can analyze
    your internet performance and make changes to speed up your
    connection. This rarely happens, and more often a technician will
    need to pay a visit.

  - **Does my modem need to be replaced?** The modem, which is the box
    that connects your home to the internet provider’s service, also can
    become outdated and occasionally needs to be replaced. If the
    support agent confirms the modem is old, you can schedule an
    appointment for a technician to install a new one.
    
    Or you can buy your own modem and call the internet provider to
    activate it. Wirecutter, our sister publication that tests products,
    recommends [modems from Motorola and
    Netgear](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cable-modem/), which
    cost about $80 to $90.

  - **Can I buy faster speeds?** Your provider may offer packages with
    more bandwidth meant for higher-quality video streaming and faster
    downloads. Ask about your options.

As a last resort, you can turn to backups. Many modern phones come with
a hot spot feature, which turns the device’s cellular connection into a
miniature Wi-Fi network. (Apple and Google list steps on their websites
on how to use the hot spot feature on
[iPhones](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023) and
[Androids](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9059108?hl=en).)

Whatever you do, be patient. In these trying times, everything takes
longer.

As for me, I confirmed my slow speeds were related to my internet
provider, Monkeybrains. I called to report the issue, and after more
than a month, a technician replaced the antenna on our roof. Now my
speeds are even faster than before the pandemic, so it was well worth
the wait.
