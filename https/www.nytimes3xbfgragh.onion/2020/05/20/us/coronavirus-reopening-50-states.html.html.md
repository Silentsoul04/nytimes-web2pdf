In Connecticut, flags that had been lowered during the somber peak of
[the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus)
were raised to full-staff on Wednesday to signal a return to business.

In Kentucky, gift shops creaked open their doors.

And across Alaska, restaurants, bars and gyms, which have been open to
small numbers of customers for weeks, were getting ready to rev back up
to full capacity. “It will all be open,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced,
“just like it was prior to the virus.”

The United States has crossed an uneasy threshold with all 50 states
beginning to
[reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/us/lake-of-the-ozarks-coronavirus.html)
in some way, two months after the coronavirus thrust the country into
lockdown. But there are vast variations in how states are deciding to
open up, with some forging far ahead of others.

The increasing moves to lift restrictions on businesses — or at least
open up outdoor spaces like beaches and state parks — reflect the
immense political and societal pressures weighing on the nation’s
governors, even as epidemiologists remain cautious and warn of a second
wave of cases.

With [millions of people out of
work](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html)
and many Americans entering their third month isolated at home, the push
to take action rivals what states faced at the beginning of the crisis,
when governors were urged to shut down.

“You have 50 different governors doing 50 different things,” said Andrew
Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of
California, Irvine. “There will be states that open too soon or states
that are too conservative. It is hard to thread the needle.”

But if reopening has become a buzz word among politicians — many states
have issued sweeping documents with color-coded plans to “rebound” and
“bounce back” — life remains far from normal in most places across
America. Even in Georgia, which opened many businesses last month ahead
of other states, restaurants are seeing only about 15 percent of normal
traffic, according to [data published by
OpenTable](https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry), a restaurant
reservation website.

The White House has said that states should have a “downward trajectory”
of cases over a 14-day period before reopening, but many states reopened
well short of meeting those benchmarks. **** Some epidemiologists see
warning signs of a rebound, especially in the South, and because it can
take as long as three weeks for a newly infected person to become sick
enough to go to the hospital, the impact of reopening is unlikely to be
detectable
immediately.

“We really are playing with fire here in a very broad sense," said
Charles Courtemanche, an economist at the University of Kentucky. In a
[recent
paper](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00608)
for the journal Health Affairs, he estimated that the number of
confirmed cases in the United States, which reached [a million at the
end of
April](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-updates.html#link-20ff56ca),
would have been closer to 35 million without the restaurant closures and
stay-at-home orders that began in mid-March. “Just because it hasn’t
been a catastrophe yet in your state, doesn’t mean it doesn’t have the
potential to be,” he said.

Ipakoi Grigoriadis was left to navigate the complexities while fielding
breakfast orders at her family’s diner, Pop’s Family Restaurant, in
Milford, Conn., which reopened to outdoor dining on Wednesday as
Connecticut lifted its stay-at-home order and allowed some businesses to
reopen.

“It is still a little scary considering we don’t exactly know what this
is,” said Ms. Grigoriadis, who said the restaurant was taking a number
of precautions. Employees were instructed to wear masks and gloves at
all times, she said, and patrons were expected to wear masks while at
the restaurant as well — “except when they are eating and drinking.”

Connecticut was among the last states to take the plunge toward
reopening, representing the more cautious approach that has defined much
of the Northeast. New York, which has seen by far the most cases and
deaths in the nation, is proceeding with a regional reopening that
excludes hard-hit New York City. In Washington, D.C., a stay-at-home
order is in effect until June and the surrounding region remains
closed.

Several states on the West Coast and certain Democratic-led states in
the Midwest have also moved slowly, taking a regional or step-by-step
approach.

By contrast, a number of states in the South opened earlier and more
fully. Businesses [have been open with social distancing
requirements](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/coronavirus-georgia-oklahoma-alaska-reopen.html)
for nearly a month in Georgia, where the [number of new
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/georgia-coronavirus-cases.html)
has remained more or less the same. Mississippi saw its largest
single-day increase in reported cases and deaths only after the state
began to reopen.

The variation illustrates the political and regional differences that
have come to define the state-by-state response to the coronavirus, as
governors navigate [a pandemic that comes with no political
playbook](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/us/coronavirus-states-reopen.html).

Texas, the nation’s second-largest state, with 29 million residents, had
among the shortest stay-at-home orders in the country when it reopened
many businesses on May 1, in a move that appealed to the state’s
pro-business spirit. But weeks later, officials reported the [highest
one-day total of new
cases](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/17/coronavirus-updates-texas/),
and some fear many businesses will still not survive.

Of the more than 50,000 restaurants in Texas, 12 percent have gone out
of business because of the pandemic, said Emily Williams Knight, chief
executive of the Texas Restaurant Association. She said she expected
that up to 30 percent would “not make it through the crisis.” The
state’s restaurant industry has already lost 700,000 jobs, she said,
and would most likely lose more.

“I think you see customers now having an emotional impact of driving up
and having a restaurant they’ve spent years at simply closed, with a
note saying, ‘Thank you for your patronage over the years,’” she
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with

While scores of restaurants flounder or even collapse, El Arroyo, a
popular Mexican restaurant at the western edge of downtown Austin, found
a ticket to survival with a savvy marketing move — the sale of to-go
margaritas. The restaurant has since begun serving customers on its
patio and will return to indoor dining when Texas allows restaurants to
expand to 50 percent capacity for indoor sales from 25 percent, starting
Friday.

“We’re full,” said Shane Thompson, the manager. “People are happy to be
out and about.”

In Louisville, Ky., a handful of customers browsed through the bourbon,
horse-themed jewelry and collectible items that stocked the Kentucky
Derby Museum gift shop on Wednesday, when the state lifted restrictions
on retail stores.

“We really didn’t know what to expect,” said Rachel Collier, a
spokeswoman for the museum, which remains closed even as the gift shop
opened back up. She said the museum’s revenue had declined by 95 percent
during the pandemic, which also forced the Kentucky Derby to be
postponed for the first time in 75 years.

Even without the boon of tourism, she said, a small but steady stream of
customers drifted through the gift shop on Wednesday, many eager to buy
cups engraved with this year’s canceled derby date. “We are pleasantly
surprised,” she said.

Researchers expect that reopening the United States could cause
thousands of additional deaths, while also saving several million jobs,
a balancing act that has swung more toward the economy in recent weeks.

A [forecast from the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget
Model](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/5/1/coronavirus-reopening-simulator)
estimated that the number of cumulative deaths from the virus in the
United States would rise to 157,000 from the current about 92,000 by the
end of July if states maintained restrictions. A partial or full
reopening could bring an additional 15,000 or 73,000 deaths,
respectively.

Researchers found that the biggest risk for negative health outcomes was
probably not state regulations, but people’s own behavior. If Americans
get out of the habit of social distancing — returning to their
pre-pandemic behavior by not wearing masks or staying six feet apart —
the forecast predicted that deaths could rise by as many as 135,000.

“Everyone wants us to talk about policy, but in fact personal behavior
still matters a lot here,” said Kent Smetters, the faculty director at
the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

Many are still hesitant. A [new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center
for Public Affairs
Research](https://apnews.com/3562b5a082a27221e532075de509a36c) found
that most Americans were somewhat concerned that lifting restrictions in
their area would lead to new infections, and at least half were very or
extremely concerned. About six in 10 people were in favor of people
remaining in their homes except for essential needs.

Mary Lou Giles, a 73-year-old resident of El Dorado County, Calif., said
that she and her husband planned to shelter in place for another several
weeks, though businesses in her remote mountain county between
Sacramento and Lake Tahoe were allowed to reopen sooner than in other
parts of the state.

“I sincerely hope there will not be a surge in Covid cases as a result
of what I believe is a premature rush to reopen,” she said. “But I’m not
willing to gamble.”
