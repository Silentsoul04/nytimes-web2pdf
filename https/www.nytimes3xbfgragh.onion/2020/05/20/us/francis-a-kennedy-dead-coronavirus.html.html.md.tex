After the violence in Korea, Mr. Kennedy sought to give something back
to the world with his inventions. He succumbed to the novel coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

From time to time over the decades, Francis A. Kennedy would rub a patch
of stubble on his face and then find a tiny wooden splinter in his palm.

On Sept. 25, 1951, Mr. Kennedy, a 27-year-old officer serving as a
forward artillery observer, was on patrol on the Korean Peninsula when
his unit was ambushed by Chinese soldiers. They quickly picked off three
of his men. Mr. Kennedy, his Rosary prayers mingling with the whine of
bullets, pulled all three to safety, but not before an enemy round
smashed into a tree nearby, embedding fragments of it into his face and
body.

For his heroism, Mr. Kennedy was awarded the Silver Star; for his
wounds, the first of two Purple Hearts. And for the rest of his life he
bore the splinters, which would rise, unpredictably, out of his skin
like memories.

He
\href{https://www.amigone.com/obituaries/obituary-listings?obId=13012751}{died
of the coronavirus on May 10} in a nursing home in Clarence, N.Y., in
Erie County, his family said. He was 95.

His children --- 10 boys and three girls raised in a house near Buffalo
with a single bathroom --- remembered him as a puckish storyteller and a
restlessly creative inventor huddled over his work at a tarp-draped pool
table in their garage. He came close to hitting it big in the 1970s,
when he invented an early form of caller-ID. He had more success a few
years later designing an energy-efficient concrete block. Early on, he
tended bar, worked in a steel mill and sold liquor wholesale to put food
on the table.

He adored John and Robert Kennedy, thought (though never proved) that he
and the more famous Kennedy family were relatives, and even bought Lady
Bird Johnson's former limousine as a gift to his wife, whose name was
Jacqueline Kennedy and, yes, known as Jackie.

Mr. Kennedy was born on June 21, 1924, in Pittston, Pa., to Francis P.
and Loretta Kennedy. Frank was 16 when he ran away from home in 1942 to
enlist during wartime but was sent back after his mother had demanded
it.

When he came of age, Mr. Kennedy joined an Army aerial branch and
excelled as a mechanic, though he never made it into combat. By the time
the Korean War broke out, he had re-enlisted and chose one of the most
dangerous combat assignments possible, finding the coordinates for enemy
targets from close range on the ground or in the air.

He also flew on 154 sorties, many as an air spotter, and was shot down
three times. Once, after crash-landing behind enemy lines, he leapt off
a 40-foot-high cliff to evade the enemy and made it back to camp, six
miles away, with a broken foot, his son Tim said.

Mr. Kennedy is also survived by 11 other children (one son died before
him, as did his wife), 38 grandchildren, 38 great-grandchildren and a
great-great-grandchild, his family said.

Mr. Kennedy was proud of his service, and of all the medals, but he felt
compelled to make up for his role in the war by leaving a positive mark
on the world through his inventions, his daughter in-law Lynn Kennedy
said.

His son Thom recalled: ``He believed he would never be able to get into
heaven because of all the deaths he caused by calling in artillery
strikes. I'd say, `Dad, think of how many lives you saved.' But to his
last days he carried that with him.''
