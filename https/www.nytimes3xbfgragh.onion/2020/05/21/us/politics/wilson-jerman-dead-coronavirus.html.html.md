*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Wilson Jerman started working in the White House as a cleaner in 1957,
under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. But it wasn’t until President John
F. Kennedy was in office that he got his first big promotion, to butler,
thanks to Mr. Kennedy’s wife, Jacqueline Kennedy.

“He had a very close relationship with Jackie O,” said Jamila Garrett,
Mr. Jerman’s granddaughter. “She trusted him with her children, and he
would ensure they had everything they needed in the White House.”

In 1966, when Mr. Jerman’s wife, Gladys, was dying of lupus, President
Lyndon B. Johnson flew his personal doctors to help treat her and sent
lobsters and filet mignon from the White House kitchen to the family’s
home in the Petworth section of Washington.

The cause was Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Ms.
Garrett said.

“Mr. Jerman was a lovely man,” former President George W. Bush and Laura
Bush said in a statement. “He was the first person we saw at the White
House when we left the residence in the morning, and the last person we
saw when we returned at night.”

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman was born on Jan. 21, 1929, in Seaboard, N.C., to
Theodore Roosevelt Jerman, a farmworker, and Alice Plum. As a child, he
had no shoes and walked six miles to school, Ms. Garrett said. At 12, he
dropped out of school to work on a farm.

Mr. Jerman moved to Washington in 1955 and catered parties in Georgetown
before being hired at the White House. He was intensely proud of his
job, his granddaughter said, and he went to work every day perfectly
groomed, with freshly polished shoes and suspenders.

“He never judged, he never complained, ever, because he went through so
many tribulations,” she said. “Anything you needed — he was that
person.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like many longtime White House staff members, Mr. Jerman scrupulously
guarded the privacy of first families.

“I’d say, ‘I work at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,’ and 99 percent of the
people don’t know where that is,” he said in an interview published in
the “[The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White
House](http://www.katebrower.com/the-residence/).”

Stephen W. Rochon was in charge of the White House residence from 2007
to 2011, when Mr. Jerman worked as an elevator operator for presidents
George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He called Mr. Jerman “the most
gentle-natured person that I knew.”

“He tried not to converse that much with the presidents unless they
asked him something,” Mr. Rochon said on Wednesday. “His job was to get
them up and down to the different floors. But they couldn’t resist
because he was so nice. They couldn’t resist engaging with him and
conversing with
him.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Mr. Jerman worked at the White House from 1957 to 1993, and then again
from 2003 to 2012, when he retired under Mr. Obama.

“With his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House a
home for decades of first families, including ours,” Michelle Obama, the
former first lady, said in a statement.

Mr. Jerman is survived by four children, Joyce Garrett, Angela Davis,
Linda Taylor and Christopher Jerman, as well as 12 grandchildren, Ms.
Garrett said. A fifth child, Dennis Jerman, died in 2011.

In her memoir, “Becoming,” Mrs. Obama featured a photo of Mr. Jerman,
wearing a white bow tie, in the White House elevator with her and her
husband.

“He was so proud to work for them and so happy to see a person of color
as president,” Ms. Garrett said. “He never ever thought that in his time
at the White House he would see something like that.”
