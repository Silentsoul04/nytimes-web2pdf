Wilson Jerman started working in the White House as a cleaner in 1957,
under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. But it wasn't until President John
F. Kennedy was in office that he got his first big promotion, to butler,
thanks to Mr. Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy.

``He had a very close relationship with Jackie O,'' said Jamila Garrett,
Mr. Jerman's granddaughter. ``She trusted him with her children, and he
would ensure they had everything they needed in the White House.''

In 1966, when Mr. Jerman's wife, Gladys, was dying of lupus, President
Lyndon B. Johnson flew his personal doctors to help treat her and sent
lobsters and filet mignon from the White House kitchen to the family's
home in the Petworth section of Washington.

Mr. Jerman, who served 11 presidents as a cleaner, butler and elevator
operator, died on Saturday at Sentara Northern Virginia Medical Center
in Woodbridge, Va. He was 91.

The cause was Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Ms.
Garrett said.

``Mr. Jerman was a lovely man,'' former President George W. Bush and
Laura Bush said in a statement. ``He was the first person we saw at the
White House when we left the residence in the morning, and the last
person we saw when we returned at night.''

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman was born on Jan. 21, 1929, in Seaboard, N.C., to
Theodore Roosevelt Jerman, a farmworker, and Alice Plum. As a child, he
had no shoes and walked six miles to school, Ms. Garrett said. At 12, he
dropped out of school to work on a farm.

Mr. Jerman moved to Washington in 1955 and catered parties in Georgetown
before being hired at the White House. He was intensely proud of his
job, his granddaughter said, and he went to work every day perfectly
groomed, with freshly polished shoes and suspenders.

``He never judged, he never complained, ever, because he went through so
many tribulations,'' she said. ``Anything you needed --- he was that
person.''

Like many longtime White House staff members, Mr. Jerman scrupulously
guarded the privacy of first families.

``I'd say, `I work at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,' and 99 percent of the
people don't know where that is,'' he said in an interview published in
the ``\href{http://www.katebrower.com/the-residence/}{The Residence:
Inside the Private World of the White House}.''

Stephen W. Rochon was in charge of the White House residence from 2007
to 2011, when Mr. Jerman worked as an elevator operator for presidents
George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He called Mr. Jerman ``the most
gentle-natured person that I knew.''

``He tried not to converse that much with the presidents unless they
asked him something,'' Mr. Rochon said on Wednesday. ``His job was to
get them up and down to the different floors. But they couldn't resist
because he was so nice. They couldn't resist engaging with him and
conversing with him.''

Mr. Jerman worked at the White House from 1957 to 1993, and then again
from 2003 to 2012, when he retired under Mr. Obama.

``With his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House
a home for decades of first families, including ours,'' Michelle Obama,
the former first lady, said in a statement.

Mr. Jerman is survived by four children, Joyce Garrett, Angela Davis,
Linda Taylor and Christopher Jerman, as well as 12 grandchildren, Ms.
Garrett said. A fifth child, Dennis Jerman, died in 2011.

In her memoir, ``Becoming,'' Mrs. Obama featured a photo of Mr. Jerman,
wearing a white bow tie, in the White House elevator with her and her
husband.

``He was so proud to work for them and so happy to see a person of color
as president,'' Ms. Garrett said. ``He never ever thought that in his
time at the White House he would see something like that.''
