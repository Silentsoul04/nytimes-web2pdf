# How to Improve and Protect Nursing Homes From Outbreaks

</div>

More than a third of America’s Covid-19 deaths can be traced back to
these facilities. Experts suggest several ways to make them safer.

The doctors, researchers and advocates who have been paying close
attention for years are appalled at the way the [coronavirus has
devastated the nation’s nursing
homes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/nyregion/nursing-homes-deaths-cuomo.html)
— but they’re not shocked.

“Every geriatrician knew what was coming,” said Dr. Mike Wasserman, a
geriatrician and president of the California Association of Long Term
Care Medicine.

Robyn Grant, the director of public policy and advocacy for the National
Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care: “The sheer numbers are
horrifying. The underlying factors that have contributed are no
surprise; they’ve been issues of concern for a long time.”

[A New York Times
analysis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-cases-nursing-homes-us.html)
as of May 21 showed that [more than 34,000
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-cases-nursing-homes-us.html)
— 37 percent of the nation’s fatalities from Covid-19 — occurred among
residents and staff in long-term care facilities. In 15 states,
long-term care accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 deaths.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Because states report cases in varying ways, and some report few numbers
at all, “all of this could be undercounted,” said David Grabowski, a
health care policy researcher at Harvard Medical School, noting that
testing remains inadequate.

Not until mid-April did the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services announce [a reporting
system](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-20-26-nh.pdf) to track
Covid-19 in nursing homes and funnel the data to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.

But because nursing home care receives scant public attention even in
better times, advocates like Ms. Grant see an opportunity, however
grimly won. “People have been horrified by what’s happening, and that’s
shining a light on the changes we need to see,” she said.

It’s not hard to understand why the virus has streaked through nursing
homes like “fire through dry grass,” as Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York
put it. Dr. Philip Sloane, in a recent editorial in The Journal of the
American Medical Directors Association, [compared them to cruise ships
and
prisons](https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610\(20\)30350-9/fulltext)
as incubators for disease.

“All three have large numbers of people in relatively small spaces, so
it’s hard to do isolation,” said Dr. Sloane, a geriatrician who
co-directs the Program on Aging, Disability and Long-Term Care at the
University of North Carolina. “They have congregant meals prepared in
central kitchens, staff that have a lot of personal contacts with
residents. They have activities that bring a lot of people together.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nursing home residents, of course, are frailer and sicker than cruisers
and inmates. “These nursing homes are yesterday’s hospitals,” minus the
on-site medical staff, Dr. Wasserman
said.

What needs to change?

Over the coming weeks, [experts on nursing
homes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.16477) say,
the top priority should be to greatly expand rapid testing and tracing
for residents and staff, as some states have begun to require, and to
acquire sufficient protective equipment.

“We’ve basically locked nursing homes down, yet Covid is still spreading
because we don’t know who has it and we don’t have the P.P.E. to protect
the staff,” Dr. Grabowski said.

For this pandemic and beyond, researchers and advocates suggest several
broad ideas for improvement.

### **Increase infection control**

Even before the coronavirus arrived in nursing homes, they had a poor
record of preventing contagion.

“Facilities know it’s a problem, yet it’s remained one of the top
violations in the country” in federally mandated inspections, Ms. Grant
said. “These problems are cited year after year.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2016, Medicare began requiring each facility to employ an “infection
preventionist” to oversee policies and train workers. But that is often
a part-time position. “The person in charge of infection control always
has another job,” Dr. Sloane said. “That person also doesn’t have much
clout.”

Last year, Medicare proposed relaxing that rule, so that the
preventionist no longer needed to be an employee, but must log
“sufficient hours,” which Ms. Grant called “part of the deregulatory
policy of this administration.” She thinks the pandemic has instead
spotlighted the need for mandatory, full-time infection preventionists.

### **Change designs**

American nursing homes have, on average, about 100 beds, in rooms
flanking long corridors, with staff moving from one to another.
Residents typically share a small room and bathroom — an arrangement
that many dislike, and one that provides excellent conditions for viral
transmission. Assisted living complexes appear to have fared somewhat
better during the pandemic, partly because individual apartments make
isolation easier.

“It’s time to really focus on private rooms in nursing homes,” said Karl
Pillemer, a gerontologist and researcher at Cornell University. In [the
Green House
model](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/22/health/green-houses-nursing-homes.html),
for example, a dozen residents live in private rooms with homelike
common spaces and assigned staff who know them well. This approach has
gained ground very slowly, with 268 homes, of more than 15,000 nursing
homes nationwide.

But the Green House Project reports that as of May 21, in 245 homes with
2,653 residents, only nine have had Covid-19 cases, resulting in six
deaths. With several small buildings on a campus instead of one large
one, administrators could also more easily quarantine infected
residents, Dr. Sloane pointed
out.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Although new nursing homes offer private rooms, very few are being
built. But renovation can create similar small households within older
nursing homes, said Martin Siefering, a principal architect who
co-directs the senior living practice at Perkins Eastman.

At the New Jewish Home’s campus in Mamaroneck, N.Y., for instance, the
firm converted 59 of 300 beds into five small house communities. It also
retrofitted nonprofit nursing homes in Tulsa, Okla., and Ocean City,
N.J., to create smaller households.

### **Raise workers’ pay**

A common way that the coronavirus enters nursing homes is through the
employees, inadvertently. “It’s staff bringing this in and spreading the
virus to residents,” Dr. Grabowski said.

He pointed out that the aides who provide hands-on care are poorly paid
(median hourly wage last year: $13.38, [according to
PHI](https://phinational.org/resource/u-s-nursing-assistants-employed-in-nursing-homes-key-facts-2019/)),
so “they’re often piecing together multiple part-time jobs,” possibly
spreading infections not only within but between facilities.

“Our hospital workers are held up as heroes, and they are,” Dr.
Grabowski said. “Nursing home workers are, too. And they’re making
minimum wage.”

Higher wages with hazard pay, health coverage and paid sick leave so
that workers can stay home when they are ill could reduce both rampant
staff turnover and viral transmission. A few long-term care
administrators are experimenting with having staff live on campus during
the crisis.

### **Reconsider visitor policies**

It made sense to bar outsiders during the height of the pandemic, when
knowledge of symptoms and transmissions was even more incomplete than
now. But for long-term residents, isolation carries its own perils.

“We already knew families were providing care, but the extent of it has
been eye-opening,” Ms. Grant said. “They tell us, ‘I help my mom eat.’
‘I’m the one that helps her get enough fluids.’”

Some geriatricians have called on nursing homes to designate a relative
or friend to undergo regular testing and learn the proper use of
protective equipment, then be allowed access. Medicare has just issued
general [guidance for
states](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nursing-home-reopening-recommendations-state-and-local-officials.pdf)
hoping to slowly reopen facilities.

“Older people’s voices are missing from this discussion,” Dr. Pillemer
said. “They may want to make the decision to see family members, at
their own risk.”

Making nursing homes better and safer serves not only a humanitarian
purpose, he added. Governors issued stay-at-home orders to prevent the
coronavirus from overwhelming health care systems, particularly
hospitals. Nursing home residents were, disproportionately, the patients
filling those intensive-care units.

“It’s not the nail salons — these deaths are in long-term care,” Dr.
Pillemer said. “Stopping the virus in long-term care, which is fully
possible, is the key to reopening the country.”
