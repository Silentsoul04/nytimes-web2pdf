A trial with 108 participants suggests the vaccine is safe and may be
moderately effective. But experts noted that the approach has failed in
the past.

A
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{vaccine}
developed in China appears to be safe and may protect people from the
new coronavirus, researchers reported on Friday.

The early-stage trial,
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s0140673620312083}{published
in the Lancet}, was conducted by researchers at several laboratories and
included 108 participants aged 18 to 60. Those who received a single
dose of the vaccine produced certain immune cells, called T cells,
within two weeks. Antibodies needed for immunity peaked at 28 days after
the inoculation.

``This is promising data, but it's early data,'' said Dr. Dan Barouch,
director of vaccine research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston, who was not involved in the work. ``Over all, I would say this
is good news.''

The trial is the first step in testing the vaccine and was intended
mainly to verify its safety. Proof of its effectiveness will require
trials in thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, more people.

A
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{vaccine
for the new coronavirus} is considered to be the best long-term solution
for allowing countries to reopen their economies and return to normalcy.
Multiple teams worldwide are racing to test various candidates.

Results of just one other human vaccine trial have been published in a
scientific journal. That vaccine has now
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/05/22/world/asia/22reuters-health-coronavirus-sinovac-biotech.html}{entered
mid-stage human trials}, the manufacturer, Sinovac Biotech Ltd., said on
Friday.

The vaccine reported today was made with a virus, called Ad5, modified
to carry genetic instructions into a human cell. The cell begins making
a coronavirus protein; the immune system learns to recognize the protein
and attack it, in theory preventing the coronavirus from ever gaining a
foothold.

\emph{{[}}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{\emph{Follow
our Live Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker}}\emph{.{]}}

But Ad5 is a cold virus that many people probably have already been
exposed to. About half of the participants in the trial had powerful
antibodies to Ad5 before they got the vaccine.

In these people, ``their immune systems will essentially rear up and
blunt the effect of the vaccine,'' said Dr. Kirsten Lyke, a
vaccinologist at the University of Maryland who is leading another
coronavirus vaccine trial.

The researchers in China did find that people who had Ad5 antibodies
were less likely to develop a strong immune response to the vaccine.

``That may limit the use of this vaccine,'' said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean
of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of
Medicine. ``If you're comparing vaccines, the adenovirus ones so far
seem to be on the lower end of the spectrum.''

Other teams have turned to adenoviruses to develop
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-moderna.html}{coronavirus
vaccines}, but they are using less common strains, or even animal
strains, to circumvent this problem. Dr. Barouch, who is working on an
Ad26 vaccine, said his team has data from Africa and Southeast Asia
showing that people generally do not have high levels of antibodies to
that strain.

Only a subset of people in the new trial produced neutralizing
antibodies to the coronavirus, the kinds of molecules needed for
immunity. Other vaccine candidates have reported better results in the
levels of neutralizing antibodies.

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according

People between 45 and 60 years of age also produced weaker immune
responses following vaccination than younger participants. Dr. Lyke said
the responses may turn out to be even weaker among people older than 60.

``That's a very important target population that they would have to
examine,'' she said. Dr. Lyke suggested that this vaccine might be best
suited to younger populations and children.

The results are based on data from a short period, and it is unclear how
long the vaccine's protection might last.

The researchers tested three doses and said the highest dose seemed to
be the most effective. This dose response is encouraging, experts said.
But people who got the highest dose also experienced the most side
effects.

About 80 percent of the participants reported at least one side effect,
all expected with a viral vaccine, experts said. Apart from pain at the
injection site, close to half of the participants reported fever,
fatigue and headaches, and about one in five had muscle pain.

Experts praised the researchers for publishing all of their data for
others to review, and said the results were promising over all.

``What we hope is that there will be not one vaccine but several
vaccines that will be approved,'' Dr. Barouch said. ``The world needs
multiple vaccines.''
