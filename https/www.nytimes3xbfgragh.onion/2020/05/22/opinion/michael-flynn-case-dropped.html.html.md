<div class="css-53u6y8">

Of all the low moments in the 2016 Republican presidential convention —
there were many — [Michael
Flynn’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/politics/flynn-russian-ambassador-transcripts.html)
speech ranks high.

“Damn right, exactly right,” the fired, retired three-star general said
in answer to audience chants of “lock her up.” “And you know why we’re
saying that? We’re saying that because if I, a guy who knows this
business, if I did a tenth, a tenth of what \[Hillary Clinton\] did, I
would be in jail today.”

This was said by a man who, as a former head of the Defense Intelligence
Agency and top foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump, [had already
taken $45,000 from the K.G.B.
regime](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russians-paid-mike-flynn-45k-moscow-speech-documents-show-n734506)
in Moscow and [would later take
$530,000](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/10/us/politics/michael-flynn-turkey.html?_r=0)
from the Islamist regime in Ankara as an unregistered foreign
agent.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>If Flynn had been
prosecuted, judged and sentenced according to his own moral arithmetic,
he’d be behind bars today.

Fortunately he isn’t, because sleazy behavior isn’t the same as criminal
conduct.

By now, every thoughtful observer should have learned two things from
the experience of the Trump administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The first is that few things in politics are as despicable as efforts to
use the power of the state to criminalize a political opponent. That’s
why Trump’s efforts to bully a foreign ally into digging up dirt on his
domestic opponent was so reprehensible. That’s why Trump deserved his
impeachment.

The second is that civil liberties matter, never more so than when a
government seeks to prosecute the people it dislikes by hiding
[exculpatory
evidence](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/494620-doj-gives-flynns-attorneys-documents-uncovered-in-review),
using deceptive methods, relying on outdated laws or threatening them
with financial or familial ruin.

Yet as Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake lays out in painstaking detail in
[an essay for Commentary
magazine,](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/eli-lake/michael-flynn-gets-railroaded-by-the-fbi/)
this is what happened to Flynn.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>This has been obscured by the fact he twice pleaded guilty to a
crime he likely did not commit, as part of an investigation into a
conspiracy that the Mueller investigation could not prove. It’s obscured
because some of the [sensational reporting about
him](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/31/michael-flynn-new-evidence-spy-chiefs-had-concerns-about-russian-ties)
that once appeared solid later turned out to be dubious.

And it’s obscured because the administration’s inveterate critics have a
hard time conceding that the theory in which they were politically and
emotionally invested — that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia
to steal the election — was built on a shaky foundation.

What, after all, is the supposed case against Flynn? There’s the claim
that he undermined American interests by urging the Russian ambassador
not to expel American diplomats in Russia. But that was a request in the
*service* of American interests, not against them. There’s the argument
that the call violated the 1799 Logan Act. But nobody has been convicted
under that act and calls between incoming administration officials and
foreign diplomats are hardly unprecedented.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There is his alleged lying to F.B.I. agents about his conversation with
the Russian ambassador. But the bureau’s record of the interview shows
the agents thought Flynn “did not give any indicators of deception,”
according to the Justice Department’s [motion to dismiss the
case](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/6936-michael-flynn-motion-to-dismiss/fa06f5e13a0ec71843b6/optimized/full.pdf).<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>There is the suggestion that Flynn exposed himself to Russian
blackmail by supposedly lying to Mike Pence about the call with the
ambassador. But as Lake astutely points out, “Perhaps it was Pence who
lied, because he was asked a question he found difficult to answer on
national television.”

Of course, there is Flynn’s guilty plea. But Flynn — like so many
defendants in the U.S. justice system— pleaded guilty to avoid having a
different charge, in his case the foreign-registration issue in the
Turkish matter, thrown at him and his son. What that has to do with an
investigation into Russian meddling in the American election is a
question to ponder.

Against all this, consider the behavior of the F.B.I. In December, the
Justice Department’s independent inspector general noted that the bureau
[repeatedly
misled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/12/09/us/politics/fbi-ig-report-document.html)
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court in its investigation of
Russian collusion.

As for Flynn, the F.B.I. discouraged him from having counsel present for
the interview. It did not alert him that he was a target of a secret
investigation. It withheld the transcript of his call, meaning that any
discrepancy between Flynn’s memory and the transcript could be termed a
lie rather than simple misremembering. It did not ask him direct
questions about his conversations with Pence, though the rationale for
the interview was to clear up supposed discrepancies between the record
of his call and Pence’s televised comments. It later withheld from his
counsel a key memo detailing the F.B.I.’s previous attempts to find
evidence that he was a Russian asset, which had come up empty-handed.

What this amounts to, Lake writes, is “not only an injustice against
Flynn but an assault on the peaceful transition of presidential power.
The F.B.I.’s job is not to entangle the new president’s
national-security adviser in a spurious investigation.”

Liberals used to have a healthy distrust of prosecutorial power, just as
they had a healthy belief in the presumption of innocence. In t[he Tara
Reade
story,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade.html)
they’ve been reminded of the political folly of abandoning the second
belief. It may not be long before they learn a similar lesson about the
folly of abandoning the first.
