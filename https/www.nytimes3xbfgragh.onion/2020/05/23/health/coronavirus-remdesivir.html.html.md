Nearly a month after federal scientists claimed that an experimental
[drug](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html)
had helped patients severely ill with the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/health/regeneron-monoclonal-antibodies.html),
the research has been published.

The drug, remdesivir, was quickly authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of coronavirus patients, and hospitals
rushed to obtain supplies.

But until now, researchers and physicians had not seen the actual data.
And remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, has a spotty history. It was
originally intended to treat hepatitis, but it failed to. It was tested
against Ebola, but results were lackluster.

So far, remdesivir has not been officially approved for any purpose. The
F.D.A.’s emergency use authorization was not a formal approval.

The long-awaited study, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, appeared on The New England Journal of Medicine
website on Friday evening. It confirms the essence of the government’s
assertions: Remdesivir [shortened recovery time from 15 days to 11 days
in hospitalized
patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764). The
study defined recovery as “either discharge from the hospital or
hospitalization.”

The trial was rigorous, randomly assigning 1,063 seriously ill patients
to receive either remdesivir or a placebo. Those who received the drug
not only recovered faster but also did not have serious adverse events
more often than those who were given the placebo.

It was an international trial, although most sites were in the United
States. Patients were assessed daily, and those administering the
evaluations did not know whether a patient had been given remdesivir or
the placebo.

A monitoring board reviewed the data at specified intervals and called
for a halt to the study when there was clear evidence that the drug was
effective.

On April 29, N.I.A.I.D. issued a news release stating as much. But
infectious disease doctors were frustrated, because they did not have
access to the findings, which might have affected how patients were
treated.

Publication of the paper has brought some relief. Doctors had been
wondering, for instance, whether they should give remdesivir to patients
with the most serious Covid-19 cases or to those who weren’t as sick,
especially if there were not enough to go around.

Dr. Andre Kalil of the University of Nebraska, a principal investigator
of the study, noted that not only do sicker patients fare as well on
remdesivir, but their average time to recovery is also slightly faster.

He added that Hispanics, black people and white patients all derived
equal benefit from the drug, as did men and women as well as adults in
every age
group.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The results were the same for patients regardless of whether they had
received the drug treatment before or after 10 days of symptoms, said
Dr. Helen Chu, of the University of Washington, who was also an
investigator of the study.

The study’s designers changed the outcome measures after the study had
began, but they did not have access to the current data. Some critics
questioned whether the change had altered the study’s conclusions, but a
subsequent analysis determined that it did not.

The disease had a more protracted course than the investigators had
realized, federal officials said, and the original endpoints — the
measures of success — were unworkable.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The best outcome would have been a decline in the death rate among
patients given remdesivir, but there were only hints that this had
occurred.

Despite generally positive results, the researchers caution that the
drug is far from ideal.

“Given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is clear that
treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient,”
they concluded.
