A clinical trial led to the authorization of the only drug shown to work
in Covid-19 patients. But until now, few experts had seen the numbers.

Nearly a month after federal scientists claimed that an experimental
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html}{drug}
had helped patients severely ill with the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/health/regeneron-monoclonal-antibodies.html}{coronavirus},
the research has been published.

The drug, remdesivir, was quickly authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of coronavirus patients, and hospitals
rushed to obtain supplies.

But until now, researchers and physicians had not seen the actual data.
And remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, has a spotty history. It was
originally intended to treat hepatitis, but it failed to. It was tested
against Ebola, but results were lackluster.

So far, remdesivir has not been officially approved for any purpose. The
F.D.A.'s emergency use authorization was not a formal approval.

The long-awaited study, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, appeared on The New England Journal of Medicine
website on Friday evening. It confirms the essence of the government's
assertions: Remdesivir
\href{https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764}{shortened
recovery time from 15 days to 11 days in hospitalized patients}. The
study defined recovery as ``either discharge from the hospital or
hospitalization.''

The trial was rigorous, randomly assigning 1,063 seriously ill patients
to receive either remdesivir or a placebo. Those who received the drug
not only recovered faster but also did not have serious adverse events
more often than those who were given the placebo.

It was an international trial, although most sites were in the United
States. Patients were assessed daily, and those administering the
evaluations did not know whether a patient had been given remdesivir or
the placebo.

A monitoring board reviewed the data at specified intervals and called
for a halt to the study when there was clear evidence that the drug was
effective.

On April 29, N.I.A.I.D. issued a news release stating as much. But
infectious disease doctors were frustrated, because they did not have
access to the findings, which might have affected how patients were
treated.

``For God's sake, this is a pandemic --- we need some data,'' said Dr.
Judith Feinberg, vice chair of research at West Virginia University
School of Medicine.

Publication of the paper has brought some relief. Doctors had been
wondering, for instance, whether they should give remdesivir to patients
with the most serious Covid-19 cases or to those who weren't as sick,
especially if there were not enough to go around.

Dr. Andre Kalil of the University of Nebraska, a principal investigator
of the study, noted that not only do sicker patients fare as well on
remdesivir, but their average time to recovery is also slightly faster.

He added that Hispanics, black people and white patients all derived
equal benefit from the drug, as did men and women as well as adults in
every age group.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground

    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    districts --- Los Angeles and San Diego --- said on July 13, that

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

The results were the same for patients regardless of whether they had
received the drug treatment before or after 10 days of symptoms, said
Dr. Helen Chu, of the University of Washington, who was also an
investigator of the study.

The study's designers changed the outcome measures after the study had
began, but they did not have access to the current data. Some critics
questioned whether the change had altered the study's conclusions, but a
subsequent analysis determined that it did not.

The disease had a more protracted course than the investigators had
realized, federal officials said, and the original endpoints --- the
measures of success --- were unworkable.

The best outcome would have been a decline in the death rate among
patients given remdesivir, but there were only hints that this had
occurred.

Despite generally positive results, the researchers caution that the
drug is far from ideal.

``Given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is clear that
treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient,''
they concluded.
