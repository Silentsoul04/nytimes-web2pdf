WASHINGTON — My corona dreams are so crazy and vibrant, with star turns
by politicians, celebrities, zombies and my late mother, that sometimes
as I wake, I groggily think the virus that devoured the globe has to be
a dystopian vision.

Then, still sliding into consciousness, I muse that Donald Trump
lumbering around the White House must have been a dream, too. How is it
possible that this man is actually president?

But the Trump carnival of dread, with its twin fixations on masks and
unmasking, is all too real.

On Thursday, as China played [King Kong with Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/world/asia/hong-kong-china-protest.html);
as unemployment [rose to 38.6

as broken dams [unleashed a

in Central Michigan; as the president continued to stubbornly and
recklessly claim he was taking hydroxychloroquine, [causing sales to
soar](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/hydroxychloroquine-sales-covid-19-trump-invs/index.html);
as the news sank in that if the U.S. had acted even a week sooner on
social distancing that 36,000 people [might still be
alive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-distancing-deaths.html);
as Senate Republicans finally cemented themselves to Trump and his crazy
schemes; as Trump stuck to his threat of [withholding federal
funds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-michigan-vote-by-mail.html)
to Michigan and Nevada if those states enabled voters to vote; as a

a backdoor deal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia and brazen grifting by the
Pompeos), the cliffhanger president made sure the focus was on just one
little thing: Would he or wouldn’t he wear a mask as he toured the Ford
plant in Ypsilanti?

After donning it for a few private moments with Ford executives, Trump
removed the mask for the public part of the tour, saying he “didn’t want
to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.”

While you know Barack Obama would have been all about the mask, showing
the nation the proper example, Trump is afraid his followers will think
he’s a wimp if he wears it, that he’s conceding the danger of a pandemic
many in MAGA-land think is exaggerated or some sort of hoax.

The mask should be a medical signal, not a political one. But Trump
rejects the mask because of a misbegotten image of masculinity and
power. In denying the mask, he denies reality, science and the fact that
the country is in a crouch. Trump has proved that people wearing a mask
can present more truth than people not wearing a mask.

His latest con, something that he stupidly refers to as “Obamagate,” a
scandal about unmasking, is also misbegotten. You can’t create a scandal
about Obama out of nothing just because you hate the fact that he went
by the book while you dwell in a murky world of transgressions, that he
glides while you lurch.

Even as Trump tries to paint Joe Biden as gaga, he is doing something
truly gaga: He is running the government that is responding to the worst
pandemic in a century at the same time he is the leader of the
resistance to his own government, urging people and states to open up
whenever they see fit, recommending Clorox injections, stifling Dr.
Fauci, refusing to wear the mask.

The fact is that Donald Trump has been wearing a mask for a long time,
like Eleanor Rigby “wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the
door.” He studied larger-than-life titans like George Steinbrenner and
Lee Iacocca and invented a swaggering character called Donald Trump with
a career marked by evasions, deceptions and disguises.

The young builder was intent, as T.S. Eliot wrote, to take the time “to
prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet.” Early on, Donald locked
in his costume for the masquerade, the look of a C.E.O. in the ’80s. His
body armor was a dark suit, white shirt and monochromatic silk tie. His
hair was a blond helmet, his war paint was orange.

“He is the most vaudevillian performance artist who ever inhabited the
White House,” says his biographer Tim O’Brien. “He has a consuming
desire to always be center stage, yet he never wants to reveal who he
really is. He masks his finances, his taxes, his friendships, his
ongoing family conflicts of interest, his ignorance and his
inadequacies. He’s constantly making up areas of expertise he doesn’t
have.

“He doesn’t read the Bible and he doesn’t live as a Christian and love
thy neighbor. But he is demanding that the churches be reopened because
his evangelical base will love that. Everything he’s doing right now is
to stave off a loss in November.”

Just as Obama [admitted at the end of his
presidency](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/)
that he had not always been “attentive enough” to the parts of the job
he did not care for, the theatrics, the “simplistic” displays of
feelings and emotions designed “to satisfy the cable news hype-fest,”
Trump’s presidency is the reductio ad absurdum of all that. It is all
theatrics, all performance, all form with no content. His script is the
only truth.

Those of us who have donned protective masks to fight the virus have
taken off our professional masks — makeup, fashion, artifice. Now we see
celebrities and journalists in their own habitats without hair and
makeup, and that has made them seem more fully human.

Humanity is showing through — everywhere except, ironically, with the
unmasked Trump.

As we saw with Joe Biden’s latest contretemps, [telling Charlamagne Tha
God](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/us/politics/joe-biden-black-breakfast-club.html),
“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then
you ain’t black,” Biden has his flaws. God love him.

But Trump without a mask is more of a masked person than Biden with a
mask.
