LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a torrent of calls on
Saturday to dismiss his most influential adviser, Dominic Cummings,
after reports that Mr. Cummings had visited relatives in northern
England while he was ill with the coronavirus — a violation of Britain’s
lockdown rules.

Mr. Johnson appeared determined to stand by Mr. Cummings, an enigmatic
figure who helped mastermind his election victory last year and the
Brexit campaign that resulted in Britain’s departure from the European
Union.

But the reports that Mr. Cummings had driven to his parents’ house in
Durham in April when the government was urging people to stay home —
particularly those with symptoms of the virus — set off a political
tempest, with critics accusing him of flouting the rules that apply to
everybody else.

“The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and
another rule for Dominic Cummings,” said a spokesman for the opposition
Labour Party, who added that he had “breached the lockdown rules.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Leaders of two other opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and
Scottish National Party, demanded that he resign or be fired.

Confronted by reporters outside his home on Saturday, Mr. Cummings said,
“I behaved reasonably and legally.” Asked whether his decision had been
“a good look,” he replied: “Who cares about good looks? It’s a
question of doing the right thing. It is not about what you guys think.”

The furious reactions to his trip attested to the polarizing role Mr.
Cummings has played in British politics since before the 2016 Brexit
referendum. He has accumulated a long list of enemies, including some in
the Conservative Party, like Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader,
whom he has ridiculed or sidelined.

But it also showed Mr. Johnson’s deep reliance on Mr. Cummings. The
prime minister dug in his heels on Saturday, releasing a statement,
through a spokesman, that defended Mr. Cummings and his wife for making
the 260-mile drive to Durham. It said they had been trying to line up
care for their young child after he contracted the virus and expected he
would fall ill.

help.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines,” the statement
said.

If so, however, Mr. Cummings seemed eager not to disclose the trip. His
wife, the journalist Mary Wakefield, wrote an account of her husband’s
illness [in The
Spectator](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/getting-coronavirus-does-not-bring-clarity)
that made no mention of their drive and suggested he had been bedridden
for 10 days at home with a “high fever and spasms that made the muscles
lump and twitch in his
legs.”

being shut in with Ms. Wakefield, who also had symptoms, for more than
two weeks, beginning at the end of March, when he contracted the virus
soon after Mr. Johnson.

Violations of the lockdown by prominent figures have become a recurring
theme in Britain, with the penalties falling harder on private citizens
and scientific experts than on government
officials.

Though an adviser and not an elected politician, Mr. Cummings has twice
been critical to Mr. Johnson’s political success. Not only is he [an
accomplished
campaigner](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/08/world/europe/dominic-cummings-brexit-boris-johnson.html),
the man behind the pro-Brexit slogan “take back control,” but he also
inspired Mr. Johnson’s agenda to spread prosperity to neglected areas of
the country, including the north.

His public profile rose when he was portrayed by the actor Benedict
Cumberbatch in a drama about the Brexit campaign, as a sort of tortured
genius determined to destroy the political elite. Since the election, he
has reveled in his image as an eccentric, disheveled iconoclast, intent
on reinventing government — Downing Street’s answer to Stephen K.
Bannon, President Trump’s former
strategist.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Mr. Cummings [put out a call for “weirdos and
misfits”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/world/europe/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-civil-service.html)
to join him in the government (one of those appointed [later
resigned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/17/world/europe/boris-johnson-andrew-sabisky-dominic-cummings.html)).
He mocked cabinet ministers, appearing to [suggest that children’s
cartoon characters might do a better
job](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10944057/dominic-cummings-cabinet-pj-masks/).
And he clashed with grandees of the Conservative Party, once describing
a former Brexit secretary, David Davis, as “thick as mince,” “lazy as a
toad” and “vain as
Narcissus.”

Cabinet ministers and other Conservative lawmakers showed support for
Mr. Cummings on Saturday, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab;
the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak; and the health secretary,
Matt Hancock.

“I know how ill coronavirus makes you,” [Mr. Hancock
tweeted.](https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1264162359733555202)
“It was entirely right for Dom Cummings to find childcare for his
toddler, when both he and his wife were getting ill.”

Others stayed silent, however, perhaps waiting to see whether Mr.
Cummings could ride out the storm.

At a news briefing on Saturday afternoon that was dominated by the
issue, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said Mr. Cummings had the
“full support” of the prime minister. But the Labour Party said that
Downing Street’s explanations “raised more questions than they answer”
and called for an inquiry into Mr. Cummings’s actions.

While the Labour Party demanded answers, it stopped short of demanding
his resignation. That appeared to reflect a tactical judgment by the
party leader, Keir Starmer, that the episode would do more damage to the
government, which is already on the defensive for its handling of the
virus, if it were dragged out over several days.

And criticism flowed not just from opposition politicians.

Julia Hartley-Brewer, a broadcaster and journalist who generally leans
to the right politically, described how she had been separated from her
77-year-old mother, who lives on her own and suffered a heart attack in
December.

“So excuse me if I am beyond bloody incandescent at what Dominic
Cummings did,” [she wrote in a tweet that used another
expletive.](https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/1263939337030438917)
