New Yorkers are entering the summer season with no access to the
traditional cooling infrastructure — the cold water found in playground
sprinklers, public pools, and beaches — which Mayor Bill de Blasio has
declared off-limits because of concerns about the coronavirus and the
budget. Millions of residents will find themselves on an unpleasant —
and potentially deadly — trip back in time to the turn of the 20th
century, when summers were always “too darn hot.”

New York bakes under the summer sun; the average high temperature in
July and August is [above 80
degrees](https://www.weather.gov/okx/CentralParkHistorical). By the late
19th century, Lower Manhattan created a microclimate effect wherein its
densest neighborhoods maintained its highest temperatures, what we call
today the urban heat island. Before the widespread adoption of air
conditioning in the mid-20th century, New Yorkers could do little to
regulate heat and humidity, and most could not afford to leave.

Water, whether from the city’s hydrants, at beaches, the East River (for
the hardy), public baths, or, by the 1930s, pools, was the only way to
beat the heat. The city’s response to heat tended to be reactive, rather
than systematic or proactive — hydrants opened during a period of
extreme weather. New Yorkers faced the challenges of summer heat daily,
at the private level, and suffered.

The painter George Bellows immortalized East River swimmers in his 1907
painting “[Forty-Two
Kids,](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.134485.html)”
capturing boys cavorting on a dilapidated wharf. Young swimmers — mostly
boys from sweltering slums — braving the fierce tidal currents of New
York Harbor were symbols of summer in the city in the early 20th
century.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But among those symbols were the environmental inequalities of summer
heat and the challenge of safely cooling off — and swimmers died by the
hundreds. By the early 1930s, official records chronicled more than 500
drowning deaths every year in city waters.

As one New York Times Times journalist
[observed](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1925/06/07/98830729.html?pageNumber=1)
during a June 1925 heat wave, “the only relief” in the city “was in
water, wherever it could be found.” In 1933, two policemen tried to
quell illegal hydrant use on the Upper East Side but [were rebuffed —
and
drenched](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1933/06/10/119445643.html?pageNumber=3)
— by children determined to play in the water. In the infamous heat wave
of 1896, the city commissioner of public works instructed employees to
open hydrants to lower the temperature of the pavement. In tenement
districts, where interior temperatures of stuffy, cramped apartments
reached an unbearable 120 degrees, desperate mothers held overheated
children in hydrant streams.

People bathing in water meant for street cleaning symbolized the
discomfort, health dangers, and inequalities of summer in the city.

The city [opened](https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/pools) its
first free seasonal bath on the East River in 1870, but industrial waste
and sewage [so
polluted](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t1jh43s08&view=1up&seq=8)
New York Harbor that by 1910 health officials suggested a ban on harbor
swimming. By 1929, five years before Robert Moses began his
pool-building spree as parks commissioner, there were but[five public
pools](https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/pools), and only one
outside Manhattan, in the city. Lacking options, New Yorkers sought
relief at regional beaches. In the 1920s, summer heat forced the
government to act. Gov. Al Smith announced the creation of the Long
Island State Park Commission beach plan during a heat wave in July 1925,
after crowds from the city overwhelmed Nassau County beaches and roads.
The disadvantages of New York’s muggy summer climate had brought into
stark relief the importance of large, accessible beaches.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Robert Moses, who had earlier overseen the creation of the massive Jones
Beach complex for Governor Smith, oversaw the creation of the city’s —
and the nation’s — largest public cooling infrastructure during the
Great Depression. Using Works Progress Administration funds — the
equivalent of stimulus funding — he built a network of palatial public
pools capable of holding thousands of bathers at a time. He also built
[658
playgrounds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1981/07/30/obituaries/robert-moses-master-builder-is-dead-at-92.html),
most with sprinklers and many with large wading pools; expanded and
improved the city’s beach system; and added the first official municipal
lifeguard corps. Within five years, drownings had been [cut by more
than 30
percent](https://nypost.com/2020/04/17/1940-city-parks-dept-report-links-decrease-in-drownings-with-opening-pools/),
and today there are generally fewer than 20 every year.

Cooling infrastructure remains essential. In early 2019, NASA scientists
announced that the last five years have been the five hottest recorded
globally. Excessive heat is a leading cause of weather-related deaths in
the United States. Climate change is making heat waves more frequent and
longer in duration. The urban heat island magnifies these environmental
challenges.

With access to the safe, regulated and guarded cooling infrastructure
completely shut off, it’s likely that New Yorkers, especially those
living in poverty without access to summer homes or trips to faraway
beaches, will turn again to the desperate measures of the 1920s —
opening hydrants and swimming at unguarded beaches and in dangerous
tidal rivers.

It’s also unfortunately likely that some will die from heat stroke or
drowning, and that many open fire hydrants will reduce water pressure,
threatening firefighters’ ability to put out fires.

So how to avoid the potential of a long, hot and deadly summer? It won’t
be easy, but public health [experts have
advised](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/496483-evidence-mounts-that-outside-is-safer-when-it-comes-to-covid-19)
that it is possible to open beaches and pools if precautions are taken.
The city should set up a multi-agency task force to make plans for
modified openings of pools and beaches, redeploying hundreds of parks
employees from shuttered indoor recreation centers to manage crowds and
social distancing. By definition, public pools are very large tanks of
heavily chlorinated water ([which the C.D.C. says kills the
virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/parks-rec/park-administrators.html)),
with existing secured entrances, and the ability to easily monitor and
reduce the number of users. Public changing rooms can be closed, and
outdoor showers installed to minimize the risk of virus transmission
outside of the pools.

The city can use the well-established practice of ticketed but free
major concerts in Central Park, where fans apply online via a lottery
system for free tickets, to allow people to reserve spots on carefully
managed beaches. Crowds at Orchard Beach in the Bronx can be reduced by
limiting capacity in the large parking lot.

The city can use newly created maps to prioritize neighborhoods [that
lack park
access](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=4d082c62efb44e56b105366fb92335b3&extent=-8287910.233%2C4941135.2385%2C-8185178.8669%2C4998463.0097%2C102100)
and need open streets created for recreation and bike commuting. Parks
that lack trees should be equipped with canopies to provide shade. And
if playgrounds and their sprinklers cannot be safely opened, the city
can revive another [artifact
from 1920,](http://nycma.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/RECORDSPHOTOUNITARC~9~9~29533~104331:mrc_160?qvq=q:croton%20surf&mi=0&trs=2)
very large showers mounted on light poles that can cool scores of
overheated New Yorkers at a time, perhaps on the mayor’s newly
instituted open streets.
