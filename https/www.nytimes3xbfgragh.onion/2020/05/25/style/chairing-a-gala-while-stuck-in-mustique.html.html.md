*With the New York gala scene on hiatus, here is how some patrons and
society figures are spending their time and resources during the
coronavirus crisis.*

## Adrienne Arsht

**Age:** 78

**Occupation:** lawyer, philanthropist, chairwoman emerita of TotalBank.

**Favorite charities:** [Arsht-Cannon
Fund](https://arshtcannonfund.org), [John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts,](https://www.kennedy-center.org/account/login/)the
[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, the Adrienne Arsht
Rockefeller Foundation Resilience
Center](https://www.onebillionresilient.org).

**Where are you sheltering?**

At my house in Washington, D.C.

**Has self-seclusion altered your routine?**

I’m up earlier. By 6:30 I’ve I picked up my newspaper. I read more or
less till 9. I’m still doing full hair and makeup every morning. I
believe you always dress as if you’re going to meet the queen of
England. That’s just you.

**Do you have a favorite at-home retreat?**

It’s my office. My desk is piled with the same papers as before the
pandemic. There is a basket where I keep my knitting and a ball of yarn.
I’m on my fourth afghan right now. I collect pillows. I have a new one
with a motto that reads: “You don’t have to be productive during a
pandemic.” Take that, Marie Kondo\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Which causes are urgent to you now?**

If you’re being abused, sheltering at home is like lighting a match to a
tinderbox. You have nowhere to go. I’m supporting the [D.C. Volunteer
Lawyer Project,](https://www.dcvlp.org)which represents women who are
victims of domestic violence.

**How do you keep up your spirits?**

I adore change. I say, just deal with it. I had a younger sister who
committed suicide at 29. I’ve wondered, what was it that made her feel
that death was easier to bear than life? My focus is on resilience, the
ability to survive, adapt and construct a new way of life. You could
almost say this pandemic is the equivalent of the meteor that crashed to
earth and destroyed the dinosaurs. We’ll see what comes out of the
rubble.

**How does your day go?**

I get up, exercise and make breakfast. I clean — that’s on me. Then I go
into my office to work. During the first several weeks of this
quarantine I found working difficult. It was really hard to focus. My
pace slowed significantly. I feel like now I’m moving into a better
pattern.

**Have your domestic habits changed?**

We used to order out a lot. Now I cook. We eat a lot of fish. I did a
delicious Thai soup last night. I’ve been thinking about growing my own
food and what that would look like. I hope this is the new normal for
us. We are healthier for it.

**What do you do with your downtime?**

Drawing and painting are a release. I run a couple of days a week along
the East River. On a good day the river is so beautiful, it’s almost
like not being in the city at all.

**Which causes are most vital to you now?**

I’m on the board of March of Dimes, focusing on issues of maternal
mortality in the United States, especially as they relate to black
women. Corona just makes these problems more apparent and dire.

**What can we learn from this crisis?**

I hope we come out with a better of understanding of what is an
essential worker. Who is the store clerk, the sanitation worker,
delivery person? Will you remember to thank the person who rings up your
groceries? Without these people, what would we do?

**Parting thoughts?**

Eat well. Exercise. Don’t drink too much. Give yourself a
break.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

**Where are you hunkering down?**

At our beach house in Mustique, in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

**What took you to Mustique?**

Tommy, my husband, has had a home here for almost 30 years. We left in
March for our son’s spring break. I packed for a two-week trip and we’ve
been here since. I’m looking out at the ocean as we speak. Our stay
wasn’t planned, but I’m grateful it worked out this way.

**How have you kept up your giving?**

We are co-chairs of the [B.C.R.F. Virtual Hot Pink
Evening](https://www.bcrf.org) in support of cancer research. It was a
Zoom situation, a new frontier for me. We expect to raise substantial
funds. \[The May 20 virtual gala brought in $5.2 million\]. I’m also on
the board of Glam4Good, founded by my friend Alice Stephenson. We
provide clothes for women in shelters.

**Are there positive aspects to life in seclusion?**

I’m loving that I’m able to spend time with two of my six children: my
stepdaughter Kathleen, who is 24, and my son Sebastian — he’s 10. Having
this time to engage with him, that’s been a blessing for sure. We’re
doing home schooling, Lego projects, swimming and playing silly games
like hide and seek.

**What are some other distractions?**

We spend a lot of time playing backgammon and chess. I’ve seen every
episode of “Ozark.” And I’m hiking around the island with Tommy every
morning. Those routines have been a necessity for everybody’s sanity.

**Have there been challenges?**

I’ve had my cries. They come from a pent-up frustration at feeling so
helpless. Ordinarily we have everything planned out months in advance:
school, travel, evenings out. Now there are so many unknowns. I don’t
know when I’m coming home.
