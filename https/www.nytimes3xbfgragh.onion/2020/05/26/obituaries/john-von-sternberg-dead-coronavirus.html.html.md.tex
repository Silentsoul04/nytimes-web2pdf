\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in

People who knew him agree that John von Sternberg would have been
surprised by the outpouring of affection directed toward him since his
death from Covid-19 on May 7 at 79.

He would have been baffled, they say, by how many cars, firetrucks and
motorcycles joined in a procession through his town, Mountain Lakes,
N.J., in his honor on May 14, a tribute that ended at the local fire
station, where he had been a volunteer for 60 years.

He would have been startled to hear himself
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/100001157507057/posts/2894874863894402/}{singled
out} by New Jersey's governor, Philip D. Murphy, during one of the
governor's news briefings, where Mr. Murphy has made a point of giving
biographical sketches of a sampling of New Jersey residents claimed by
the virus.

Bob Becker, who brought Mr. von Sternberg aboard as a partner when he
started out in the real estate business a half-century ago, called him
``a quiet kind of leader.''

``I'm not even sure he knew he was leading,'' Mr. Becker said in a phone
interview.

\href{https://obits.nj.com/obituaries/starledger/obituary.aspx?n=john-f-von-sternberg\&pid=196183514\&fhid=6054}{John
Francis von Sternberg Jr.} was born on April 3, 1941, to John and Jean
(Jackson) von Sternberg. The family moved to Mountain Lakes when he was
young. At 18 he gave the fire department a try, and liked it, thanks to
an indulgent chief.

``He'd say to me, `Oh, just take the firetrucks out and run them around
town, get used to driving them,''' Mr. von Sternberg recalled a few
years ago when he was a guest on
\href{https://mtnlakes.org/laker-profiles/john-von-sternberg/}{Laker
Profile Live!}, a local podcast. ``I'd think to myself, `This is pretty
neat for an 18-year-old.'''

He spent his career in real estate in Mountain Lakes, an affluent town
about 40 miles west of Manhattan. Mr. Becker said that for years Mr. von
Sternberg had a distinction at the office: avoiding sit-down lunches
with potential home buyers while out showing them houses.

``His whole thing was: `I'm here to show you as much as I can,''' Mr.
Becker said. ```Why waste an hour or an hour and a half?' He would have
these executives come in in their suits and he'd put them in the car and
take them up to the hot-dog stand.''

Governor Murphy, in his remarks, noted a certain synergy between Mr. von
Sternberg's day job and his volunteer work at the fire department.

``Between helping residents find their homes and then protecting them as
a firefighter,'' the governor said, ``he became nothing less than a
Mountain Lakes icon.''

Mr. von Sternberg died in a hospital in Denville, N.J., his
granddaughter Robyn Dickinson said. He is survived by his wife of 56
years, Joyce (Dodds) von Sternberg; a daughter, Carol Goldstein; two
sisters, Anne von Sternberg and Dorothy Ettus; a brother, Julius;
another granddaughter; and a great-grandson.

As for why there were motorcycles in the tribute procession, Mr. von
Sternberg was a member of two motorcycle clubs, the Knights of Fire and
Old Coots on Scoots.

The local Kiwanis Club in 1995 named Mr. von Sternberg its citizen of
the year in recognition of his volunteer work. In the podcast, Mr. von
Sternberg wanted people to know that being active in the community is
its own reward.

``This has brought more to my life than I'll ever give,'' he said.
