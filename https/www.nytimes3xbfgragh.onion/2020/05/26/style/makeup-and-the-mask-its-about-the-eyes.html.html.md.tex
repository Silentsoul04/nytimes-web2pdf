Some pros share their tips for doing your makeup while masking.

As a makeup artist, Keita Moore has become an observer of faces. Months
ago, in the early stages of the pandemic, he saw very little makeup when
he ran out on the occasional errand. Lately, though, he has noticed that
the faces are changing, slowly. Masks are plentiful, as are filled-in
brows and lashes coated in mascara.

**``**So many people are doing this,'' Mr. Moore said. ``It's fun to get
dressed and get cute, even if it's just to get groceries.''

Dismissing makeup as frivolity would be easier than ever now. Our
professional and social lives are scaled down, and we've withdrawn
inside. Collectively we've gone back to basics, and makeup is plainly
nonessential. But it is also a cultural artifact, reflecting the
aesthetics and ethos of the era. What will our faces show as we live
through months or years of the pandemic?

Nick Barose, a makeup artist, looked back and found makeup's future. At
the beginning of his lockdown in March, he organized his Brooklyn
apartment ``to make it more homey, since I'd actually be home,'' he
said.

That's when he discovered reference materials --- books, images,
magazine tear sheets --- he had used as he learned to do makeup. He was
drawn to avant-garde beauty editorials of the 1980s, with images of Old
Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe. The nostalgia boosted his mood.

``You can listen to '80s music, put on '80s makeup and fantasize about a
life that's not yours,'' Mr. Barose said.

Makeup, he predicts, will take two distinct courses as the pandemic
plays out. The first will be practical and edited, emphasizing long-wear
products and natural brows and lashes. But for some, makeup will be an
escape.

``Our reality is so uncertain that I can see people getting
experimental,'' he said. ``It's a scary time, so it's a time when you
want to dream more, too.''

\textbf{Make Foundation Transfer-Proof}

Because much of the face is covered, foundation should be used
sparingly, if at all. Instead, blend concealer under the eyes and on any
uneven spots above the nose. If you use foundation, a light application
on the exposed areas is all you need.

``Most women choose foundation for the look,'' said Keanda Snagg, a
makeup artist, meaning that they're going for color match and finish and
are usually not as concerned about performance. Now is the time to
consider a formula's staying power, too. Ms. Snagg suggests
\href{https://www.fentybeauty.com/pro-filtr-hydrating-longwear-foundation/FB30020.html}{Fenty
Pro Filt'r Hydrating Longwear Foundation}, \$35.

Mr. Moore swears by
\href{https://www.ppipremiereproducts.com/products/blue-marble-selr}{Premiere
Products Blue Marble Selr Spray,} \$14, a cult favorite setting spray,
to keep makeup in place. ``A lot of drag queens use it when they perform
onstage,'' he said. ``It makes your makeup absolutely transfer-proof.
You could lie down on a pillow and there'd be no foundation on it after
you got up.''

Erin Parsons, another makeup artist, predicts that foundation formulas
will evolve to focus on skin care. ``Masks will shift how we think about
foundation,'' Ms. Parsons said. ``When you take them off, your skin is
irritated and red. I keep thinking the next generation of foundation
will be soothing and protecting.''

\textbf{Emphasize Brows and Lashes}

The new basic face is filled-in brows and amplified lashes. ``If there's
one thing we should learn now, it's how to properly fill in your
brows,'' Mr. Moore said. Eyebrow pencils give users more control of
color density (and most people go too dark on brows), so he prefers them
to powders, which can be blotchy.

``People tend to fill in too much at the inner part of the brows,'' he
said. ``Focus on the tail because that's where most brows are sparse.
Brush your brows up and outward and fill in only where you need more
hair.''

Pick a pencil with an angled flat tip,
like\href{https://www.thelipbar.com/products/hi-brow}{the Lip Bar
Hi-Brow Gel + Pencil}, \$14. This shape helps you mimic the look and
direction of hair growth.

The \href{https://lashify.com/}{Lashify at-home lash extension kit},
\$145, creates a lash look that's a step up from a coat of mascara. The
system contains individual lashes, so your result is customizable. ``You
can just add a couple lashes to the outer end of your lashes for more
drama,'' Mr. Moore said.

\textbf{Introduce Color With Eyeliner}

As our time in masks wears on, makeup artists expect we'll transition to
eye makeup that's simple yet expressive. Eyeliner is the best tool for
these times because it's uncomplicated. A bright color is interesting
and fun without requiring the layering and dimension of eye shadow.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

``My favorite is winged eyeliner in any bright color --- pink, blue,
burgundy --- anything that's not black,'' Ms. Snagg said. She likes
\href{https://www.nyxcosmetics.com/eyes/eyeliner/epic-wear-liquid-liner/NYX_806.html}{NYX
Epic Wear Liquid Liner}, \$10, a waterproof formula. (``You could jump
in a pool and it wouldn't budge,'' she said.)

An eyeliner newbie can start with a simple line along the lashes and,
with practice, work up to a wing. Ms. Snagg's winged liner technique:
Draw a triangle at the outer corner of the eye. Then, using gentle
strokes, create a line that connects that triangle to the inner corner
of your eye.

\textbf{Embrace the Freedom of Masks}

During his lockdown, Mr. Barose made himself up in the style of
celebrities representing different eras, like Grace Jones, Donyale Luna
and Elizabeth Taylor. ``Because I'm being someone else, I feel more free
to do things I've never done,'' he said. ``A mask covering your face is
similar. It's a superhero effect because you're incognito.''

If you favor subdued or minimal makeup, this can be a time to explore,
to try new textures and materials. ``After a period of minimal makeup, I
could see a resurgence of the `Euphoria' makeup --- people trying things
that are a little weird because they're not as exposed,'' Ms. Parsons
said.

For example, earlier this year, she used a prosthetic adhesive to affix
tiny dried flowers she found on Amazon to the ends of lashes. ``People
have been asking me about it all the time,'' she said. ``It's so easy to
do. It's cute, and it makes you happy.''
