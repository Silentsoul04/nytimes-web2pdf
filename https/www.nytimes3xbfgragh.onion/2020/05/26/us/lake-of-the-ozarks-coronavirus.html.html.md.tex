``It's irresponsible and dangerous to engage in such high risk behavior
just to have some fun over the extended holiday weekend,'' said the
mayor of St. Louis.

After large crowds gathered at the Lake of the Ozarks over the Memorial
Day weekend in defiance of Missouri's
\href{https://governor.mo.gov/sites/gov/files/media/pdf/2020/04/Economic-Reopening-Phase-1.pdf}{social
distancing guidelines}, officials in two states urged those visitors to
quarantine for two weeks, or until they tested negative for the
coronavirus.

The visitors ``showed no efforts to follow social distancing
practices,'' the St. Louis County Department of Health said in a
\href{https://stlcorona.com/news/press-release-5252020/}{statement} on
Monday, issuing a travel advisory for people who had been to the popular
destination spot.

\href{https://twitter.com/scottpasmoretv/status/1264394565861232640}{Video
footage} from one gathering showed a large crowd of people, most of them
in bathing suits and without face masks, at a pool with music blaring
overhead and yachts docked at a marina behind them. The videos spread
widely on social media over the weekend.

The Lake of the Ozarks, a winding reservoir in the Ozark Mountains of
central Missouri, is a tourist destination popular with residents of St.
Louis, which is about 150 miles to the east. It draws visitors from
across state lines as well.

``It's irresponsible and dangerous to engage in such high risk behavior
just to have some fun over the extended holiday weekend,'' Lyda Krewson,
the mayor of St. Louis, said in a statement on Tuesday.

``Now, these folks will be going home to St. Louis and counties across
Missouri and the Midwest, raising concerns about the potential of more
positive cases, hospitalizations, and tragically, deaths,'' she said.
``It's just deeply disturbing and threatens the progress we've all made
together to flatten the curve.''

The Kansas department of health on Tuesday echoed that statement and
\href{https://khap2.kdhe.state.ks.us/NewsRelease/PDFs/5-26-20\%20Ozarks.pdf}{urged
state residents} who had been there and did not observe social
distancing practices to voluntarily self-quarantine for two weeks.

``The reckless behavior displayed during this weekend risks setting our
community back substantially for the progress we've already made in
slowing the spread of Covid-19,'' Dr. Lee A. Norman, the agency's
secretary, said in a statement. ``If you traveled to Lake of the Ozarks
over the weekend, we urge you to act responsibly and self-quarantine to
protect your neighbors, co-workers and family.''

On Tuesday, Gov. Mike Parson of Missouri
\href{https://twitter.com/GovParsonMO/status/1265373360424353795}{said
on Twitter} that ``there were some poor decisions that were made.''

``When social distancing is not followed, it is potentially dangerous
for EVERYONE,'' he said. ``That said, the Lake of the Ozarks is a small
sample of Missouri. While poor choices were made by some at the lake,
there were many other Missourians across the state who did make safe and
responsible choices over the holiday weekend.''

In a tweet on Monday, Ms. Krewson
\href{https://twitter.com/LydaKrewson/status/1265084581423853568}{noted}
that asymptomatic people can spread the virus and put others at risk,
adding that anyone who might have been exposed at the lake should
contact the city's department of health.

There have been at least 12,296 known cases of the coronavirus in
Missouri, according to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/missouri-coronavirus-cases.html}{a
New York Times database.} As of Tuesday morning, at least 694 people had
died.

Tony R. Helms, the sheriff of Camden County, which is one of several
counties the lake touches, said in a
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/CamdenCountyMOSheriff/photos/a.409568172612/10157535587077613/}{statement}
on Monday that ``there was a record weekend at the Lake of the Ozarks in
the middle of a unique situation.''

And while deputies were busy keeping order this weekend, ``social
distancing is not a crime and therefore the sheriff's office has no
authority to enforce actions in that regard,'' Mr. Helms said. ``We
expect residents and visitors to exhibit personal responsibility when at
the lake.''

States have taken
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/us/coronavirus-states-reopen.html}{different
approaches} to reopening, and Missouri was among the states pressing
ahead. Gov. Michael L. Parson, a Republican, allowed an array of
businesses to open their doors beginning on May 4.

Several bars and restaurants on the lake had promoted events ahead of
the holiday weekend.

One of them, Backwater Jack's Bar and Grill, planned a
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/events/1063342204023968}{``Zero
Ducks Given Pool Party''}on Saturday as a kickoff for summer. Ahead of
the event, the organizers said the event would operate at
\href{http://backwaterjackslo.blogspot.com/2020/05/dont-miss-zero-ducks-given-memorial-day.html\#comments}{reduced
capacity,} and provide temperature screenings and free hand sanitizer
bottles at its entrance.

    its recommendation of six feet} on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

An \href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CAig9WoJ48p/}{Instagram post with
the business tagged}showed throngs of people in its pool. ``Social
distancing at its finest,'' read the caption.

The business declined to comment on Tuesday. Several others that had
advertised open hours, events or parties for the Memorial Day weekend
did not respond to requests for comment.

The state is now in the first phase of a reopening plan, under which
residents are encouraged to stay six feet apart from one another and
avoid large gatherings where distancing is impossible.

In its statement on Monday, the St. Louis County Department of Health
said employers have asked county officials how they can reopen safely
``when social distancing practices are not being followed.''

``This reckless behavior endangers countless people and risks setting us
back substantially from the progress we have made in slowing the spread
of Covid-19,'' Dr. Sam Page, the St. Louis County executive, said in the
statement.

The advisory highlighted recommendations that businesses screen
employees for Covid-19 symptoms and consider asking them about their
recent travels and social distancing efforts.

Dr. Randall W. Williams, the director of the Missouri Department of
Health and Senior Services, also urged caution and
\href{https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/5e54a9ed-d816-466f-b19f-780edd138b23/statement-from-dr-randall-williams-director-of-missouri-department-of-health-and-senior-services}{reminded}
residents in a statement ``that Covid-19 is still here, and social
distancing needs to continue to prevent further spread of infections.''

Experts on the spread of the coronavirus say that if Americans are going
to leave their homes,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html}{it's
safer to be outside than in enclosed spaces}. With fresh air and more
space between people, the risk of transmission goes down.

But experts also expressed particular caution about outdoor dining, the
use of locker rooms at pools, and crowds in places like beaches.
