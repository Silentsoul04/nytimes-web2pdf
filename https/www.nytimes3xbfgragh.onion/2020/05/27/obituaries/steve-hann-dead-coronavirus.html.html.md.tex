at
67}\label{steve-hann-sidewalk-bookseller-with-a-brainy-following-dies-at-67}}

Mr. Hann, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus, drew customers
from Columbia University and a NASA office to his folding tables covered
with used books.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Even as scores of bookstores came and (mostly) went along the West Side
of Manhattan in recent decades, Steve Hann endured.

He could be found through the dead of winter and the muggy heat of
summer selling secondhand books on a sidewalk near Columbia University.

He drew a following from Columbia and
\href{https://www.giss.nasa.gov/about/}{NASA's nearby Goddard Institute
for Space Studies}, with his fold-up tables proffering a well-curated
array of mysteries, classics, art books and --- his specialty ---
science fiction.

Mr. Hann began selling books and CDs in stores in the Morningside
Heights section of Manhattan starting at least in the early 1980s,
before settling into his longtime spot on Broadway between 112th and
113th Streets.

To generations of Columbia students, he was part of the streetscape, as
much a sidewalk fixture as the parking meter he leaned upon while almost
invariably immersed in a sci-fi paperback.

But even when his head was in a galaxy far away, his tennis shoes were
planted on New York streets, where life, he would remark, could often be
stranger than anything dreamed up by Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov.

Mr. Hann
\href{https://www.westsiderag.com/2020/04/22/steven-hann-bookseller-and-poet-of-morningside-heights-dies}{died}
of heart problems, mostly likely connected to the coronavirus, on April
4 at a hospital in the Bronx. He was 67. He had tested positive shortly
before his death, his brother, Mark Hann, said.

Mr. Hann was a scruffy savant straight out of central casting: the
curmudgeonly New York City bookseller in frumpy clothes with shaggy gray
hair ringing his otherwise bald head.

He would haggle over prices, appraise a new batch of donated books and
debate with literature professors, all while defending his wares from
shoplifters and street toughs.

He was also a writer and poet who took inspiration from the stream of
pedestrians; he would often complain about students absorbed in their
smartphones rather than a good book.

Mr. Hann's book stand served as ``a giant feedback loop connecting
people to books, stories to people,'' said Veronica Liu, a founder of
Word Up Community Bookshop and a longtime friend. ``He was the ultimate
eavesdropper.''

Ms. Liu edited and published booklets of Mr. Hann's writing and poetry,
including the rant-filled ``Mr. Manners' Guide to Electronic
Etiquette.''

Steven Jeffrey Hann was born on Sept. 4, 1952, in the Bronx and became
infatuated with bookstores and the music scene in Greenwich Village. He
helped run Village Oldies, the music shop that became the punk rock
outpost Bleecker Bob's.

The poet
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/31/nyregion/how-eileen-myles-poet-spends-her-sundays.html}{Eileen
Myles} recalled being hired there by Mr. Hann.

``He loved music and bands and the whole indie tradition of art in
general,'' Ms. Myles said, adding that Mr. Hann ``knew everyone'' in the
music scene and ``always gave a hand out to anyone who had been in a
good band or wrote a good song.''

He began selling books after working briefly at Bergdorf Goodman as a
buyer for ladies dresses.

``It was weird,'' he
\href{https://www.columbiaspectator.com/2014/04/17/bookseller-outside-milano-talks-about-cu-attitude-useless-mohi-restaurants-and-reading/}{told}
the Columbia Spectator in 2014. ``I decided if I was going to work for
an idiot, I may as well work for an idiot I know: me!''

Despite struggling with his heart condition and colon cancer in recent
years, he continued to sell his books, even commuting from a nursing
home in the Bronx.

``It kept up his spirit to be out there,'' Ms. Liu said, ``the social
aspect and making the attempt to connect to people.''
