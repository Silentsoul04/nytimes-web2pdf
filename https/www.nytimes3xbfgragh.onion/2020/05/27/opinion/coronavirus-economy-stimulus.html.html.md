Like dutiful soldiers, President Trump’s top economic advisers have been
ardently echoing their [boss’s
optimism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/05/24/business/bc-us-election-2020-trump-2021-comeback.html)
about the likelihood of a quick economic snapback, while downplaying the
need for another rescue package.

Regrettably, that’s dead wrong on both counts, as even Mr. Trump’s pick
to head the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has [countered
repeatedly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/19/us/politics/mnuchin-powell-senate-hearing.html).

Forget a V-shaped recovery, or even a U. Think instead about a backward
check mark: an economy that begins to spring upward as Americans return
to work but loses momentum well before reaching past levels.

That’s why we urgently require more help from Washington, and
particularly, an effort to rebuild America, not just rescue America.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The prospect of large numbers of Americans returning to their workplaces
seems to recede like a mirage; a full reopening remains invisibly far in
the distance. Equally important, many
pre-[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/business/economy/coronavirus-stimulus-unemployment.html)
jobs won’t be around. They are gone, indefinitely if not for good.

Just a few examples:

Factories in states from Oregon to North Carolina are [closing
permanently](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-close-for-good-as-coronavirus-cuts-demand-11589122800).
Many shuttered restaurants will never reopen. A growing number of
bankruptcies, in industries ranging [from
retailing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/business/coronavirus-department-stores-neiman-marcus.html?searchResultPosition=3)
to
[entertainment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/owner-of-cmx-cinemas-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-11587942170),
will mean more jobs lost forever. And chief executives tell me regularly
that they are cutting capital expenditures, another drag on economic
recovery and employment.

The rescue packages to date have shoveled trillions of dollars into the
economy to, among other things, keep consumers and small businesses
afloat, provide much needed liquidity to lending markets and bail out
special pleaders like the airlines.

That will help, but more will be needed, particularly for state and
local governments and
[unemployed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/business/economy/coronavirus-stimulus-unemployment.html)
workers, as House Democrats tried to emphasize in the [bill
passed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/politics/house-simulus-vote.html)
12 days ago.

But now we also must focus urgently on longer-term initiatives that will
have deeper and more lasting positive effects on jobs and growth.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Infrastructure should top the list of priorities. During his campaign,
[President Trump promised
us](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-infrastructure.html)
a $1 trillion initiative but then never made a serious effort to achieve
passage in Congress.

Moving forward on modernizing the nation’s physical plant — from roads
to buildings — makes particular sense now and not just because of weak
economic conditions. At the moment, the government can borrow money for
30 years at record low rates of about 1.4 percent.

Meanwhile, China has just announced a five-year, $1.4 trillion
[infrastructure
plan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/china-has-a-new-1-4-trillion-plan-to-overtake-the-u-s-in-tech?sref=qN0DZypA)
heavily focused on technology in a bid to become the global leader in
this critical sector; why can’t we even get started on rebuilding
America?

In designing a good plan, Congress must first and foremost eschew the
logrolling/favor-trading/call-it-what-you-want process of allocating
funds that is too often a part of the congressional appropriations
process. Among the effective ways of accomplishing that would be to
create an “infrastructure bank” that would be staffed and overseen by
private-sector individuals chosen on a bipartisan basis. Its mandate
would be to fund the projects that would add the most to economic growth
and productivity.

That doesn’t mean the projects need to generate profits or even
revenues; improving roads, for example, increases the efficiency of our
economy and that in turn increases the attractiveness to companies of
locating new jobs here.

Accordingly, Congress would need to increase the bank’s funding from
time to time, which is fine with me.

We also face a human capital challenge. As recent [economic
reports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/05/08/business/bc-us-economy-jobs-report-inequality.html)
have made clear, Americans near the bottom of the income scale, who are
disproportionately members of minorities, are suffering most from the
downturn. And women have been losing their jobs faster than men.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Similarly, we’re learning that technology-enabled businesses (like Zoom)
are going to be winners from this pandemic.

We should also be funding retraining and relocation costs for workers
whose jobs have been lost to the pandemic. And with college applications
[already
falling](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fewer-students-apply-for-college-financial-aid-a-sign-coronavirus-may-disrupt-enrollment-11589284806),
we should be providing more financial support to jobless Americans who
have chosen to return to school to raise their skill set.

Some experts have suggested trying to restore a vibrant economy via more
robust intervention by government in the private sector. I’ve not been a
fan of industrial policy, and I’m still leery of Washington trying to
pick winners.

However, at this unique moment in our history, we should think big and
think creatively. To get us started and guide us, we should create a
blue-ribbon panel of individuals with strong economic credentials and
task them with developing good ideas for how government can support a
recovery in a post-Covid-19 world.

These priorities stand in stark contrast to the thin gruel from
Republicans. White House economic advisers have been teasing the idea of
still more tax cuts for business and the rich that wouldn’t help the
broader economy*.*

For their part, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin swiftly [pushed
back](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-14/mnuchin-seeks-to-assuage-investors-after-powell-s-gloomy-outlook?sref=qN0DZypA)
on Mr. Powell’s warning, then called for a 30-day pause on new efforts.
After [endorsing a
pause](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/mcconnell-unemployment-benefits-271661),
Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has begun [edging
toward](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2020/05/27/mcconnell-says-another-relief-package-is-coming-787905)
a modest package. That could not be more wrong. Drafting thoughtful
legislation takes time; we are already late in starting to rebuild
America
