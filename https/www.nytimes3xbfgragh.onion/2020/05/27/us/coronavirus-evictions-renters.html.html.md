# An ‘Avalanche of Evictions’ Could Be Bearing Down on America’s Renters

The economic downturn is shaping up to be particularly devastating for
renters, who are more likely to be lower-income and work hourly jobs cut
during the pandemic.

EUCLID, Ohio — The United States, already wrestling with an economic
collapse not seen in a generation, is facing a wave of
[evictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/evictions-moratorium-cares-act.html)
as government relief payments and legal protections run out for millions
of out-of-work Americans who have little financial cushion and few
choices when looking for new housing.

The hardest hit are tenants who had low incomes and little savings even
before the pandemic, and whose housing costs ate up more of their
paychecks. They were also more likely to work in industries where job
losses have been particularly severe.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Temporary government assistance has helped, as have government orders
that put evictions on hold in many cities. But evictions will soon be
allowed in about half of the states, according to Emily A. Benfer, a
housing expert and associate professor at Columbia Law School who is
tracking eviction policies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I think we will enter into a severe renter crisis and very quickly,”
Professor Benfer said. Without a new round of government intervention,
she added, “we will have an avalanche of evictions across the country.”

That means more and more families may soon experience the dreaded
eviction notice on the front door, the stomach-turning knock from
sheriff’s deputies, the possessions piled up on the sidewalk. They will
face displacement at a time when people are still being urged to [stay
at
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
to keep themselves and their communities safe, with the death toll from
the virus now [having passed 100,000 in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/us/coronavirus-live-updates.html?).

That fear of eviction has been eating away at Sandy Naffah ever since
she lost her income as the virus led to economic shutdowns. Ms. Naffah,
who had been juggling two part-time jobs — teaching elementary school
students how to read and working as a beauty consultant at a mall —
quickly fell behind on the $800 she pays in rent each month for a
one-bedroom apartment in Euclid, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She is now staring down a precarious future, desperately hoping that a
one-off federal stimulus check and unemployment benefits — both of which
she said she had yet to receive — will keep her afloat and stave off
eviction.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a ticking clock,” said Ms. Naffah, who is in her 50s. “I can’t
continue to go on this way, otherwise I will be out on the
street.”

In many places, the threat has already begun. The Texas Supreme Court
recently ruled that [evictions could

announced](https://twitter.com/OkCountySheriff/status/1262825685036535809?s=20)
that they planned to start enforcing eviction notices this week. And a
handful of states, like Ohio, had few statewide protections in place to
begin with, leaving residents particularly vulnerable as eviction cases
stacked up or ticked forward during the pandemic.

Christie Wilson, 37, was among them. After fleeing a dangerous
relationship, she said, she spent several months sleeping in her car
last year before a veterans program helped her pay for a two-bedroom
apartment in Decatur, Ga. She had recently become responsible for the
$1,143-a-month rent herself, she said, and had lined up a job at a
warehouse.

But after two days on the job, she said, she was laid off as the
coronavirus outbreak intensified in March.

A few weeks later, she found an eviction notice on her door. She now
fears losing her apartment, where, in the fragile stability of recent
months, she has enjoyed small luxuries, like listening to gospel music
on her patio in the mornings and spending Mother’s Day in her own home
with her teenage son.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The real estate company managing her apartment said that it had followed
protocol in filing for eviction, and that employees were working with
Ms. Wilson to waive fees and help connect her to nonprofit groups. If
she has to move out, she worries she would end up in a homeless shelter,
where preliminary testing has shown [high rates of
infection](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/05/15/boston-homeless-coronavirus-testing).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There would be no six-feet distance — we’d be sleeping on top of each
other,” said Ms. Wilson, who is racing to pay back more than $2,000 in
back rent before Georgia courts reopen next month.

Though about 90 percent of renters made full or partial rent payments by
late May, [down only 2
percent](https://www.nmhc.org/research-insight/nmhc-rent-payment-tracker/)
from last year, lawyers and landlords alike fear that the trend will not
last. [More than 38 million
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
have filed jobless claims since March, including a high proportion of
people living in households making less than $40,000 a year. In a
[survey released this month by the Census
Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/table?measures=HIR),
nearly a quarter of respondents said they missed their last rent or
mortgage payment or had little to no confidence that they would be able
to pay on time next month.

The devastation has drawn comparisons to the Great Recession, when
millions of people lost their homes during a foreclosure crisis. But
this time, renters are likely to be on the front lines.

“We sort of expect this to be more of a renter crisis than a
homeownership crisis,” said Elora Lee Raymond, an assistant professor at
the Georgia Institute of Technology who focuses on affordable housing
and real estate.

Even before the current joblessness crisis, eviction was troublingly
common in American life. Researchers estimate that about 3.7 million
eviction cases were filed in 2016, a year when the unemployment rate was
4.7
percent.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“Now we have 14.7 percent,” said Matthew Desmond, a sociologist at
Princeton and the author of the book “Evicted,” who is leading an effort
at the university’s Eviction Lab to track cases nationally. Without
intervention, he said, “I don’t see how we wouldn’t have a wave of
evictions.”

A [$3 trillion coronavirus relief
bill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/politics/house-simulus-vote.html)
backed by House Democrats includes a proposal to dedicate $100 billion
for rental assistance, a measure that could bring broad relief, but
Republicans have criticized the package as too costly, and it is
unlikely to pass in its current form.

And some argue that the federal government has already intervened
effectively, in the form of the stimulus checks and a [$600 weekly boost

Many low-wage workers are making more money on unemployment than they
were when they were working, said Ken Rosen, an economist at the
University of California, Berkeley. “It’s happening, not through the
housing system, but through the unemployment compensation system,” he
said.

But there is a looming question about what happens next. “People may be
paying their rents, but at what cost?” said Tara Raghuveer, the director
of KC Tenants, an advocacy group in Kansas City, Mo. “I know several
people who are taking out title loans. They are paying their rent on
their credit
card.”

Many landlords say they are working with their tenants, waiving late
fees and advocating that the government cover missed rent. “We are in
uncharted waters,” said Tom Bannon, chief executive of the California
Apartment Association, who added that most landlords were not eager to
evict residents when there was little guarantee of a replacement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Still, landlords have bills to pay, too. When tenants cannot pay their
rent, landlords with mortgages remain responsible to the banks, who
answer to investors. “I call it the responsibility chain,” Mr. Bannon
said. “There is this link, and if there is a break in the link, the
ripple effect is pretty significant.”

Among the first to face eviction have been those who were already
struggling before the pandemic.

Stephen Jenkins, 64, was let go from his assembly job in January, making
it difficult to pay his $900 monthly rent in Springfield, Ohio. By
March, he said, his savings had run out, and he asked his landlord if he
could pay late after his Social Security check came through.

His landlord, who declined to comment, filed for eviction.

In the weeks since, Mr. Jenkins said, his wife lost her hostess job at
Bob Evans when restaurants shut down. They have not been able to move
out as few realtors are showing homes because of the virus.

The stress is giving him health problems, and he is anxiously counting
down the days until his eviction hearing, now scheduled for Wednesday.

“I haven’t slept through a night since March,” he said. “I wake up at
three or four in the morning worried about what’s going to happen
tomorrow.”
