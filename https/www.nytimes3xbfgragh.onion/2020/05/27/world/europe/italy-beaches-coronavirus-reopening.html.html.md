GIUGLIANO IN CAMPANIA, Italy — The lifeguard turned his back to the
water and looked for danger on the sand.

All around him at the beach club west of Naples, children on their
stomachs dug moats while adults reclined on beach chairs, catching rays,
eating stuffed shells and reconnecting with friends on the first Sunday
back at the beach after a monthslong lockdown. Some maintained the new
social-distancing restrictions. Some did not.

“I look a little this way,” said the lifeguard, Salvatore Scardazone,
31, shifting from the sea to the land. “And I look a little this way.”

As the temperatures rise, sun-starved Europeans are desperate to get to
the beach and tourism-starved Mediterranean countries are desperate to
have them. In Greece, the government is trying to negotiate an “air
bridge” from Britain, with promises of 40 bathers per 1,000 square
meters and disinfected chairs. The Spanish are trying to convince
Germany to send tourists their way, while Baltic Sea resorts, which had
a far less severe epidemic than Spain, are trying to poach them.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But it is Italy, which endured one of Europe’s worst outbreaks, that is
most counting on the economically restorative powers of its beaches and
seas. Tourism accounts for 13 percent of Italy’s gross domestic product,
and 40 percent of that is from beach activity. Officials and beach club
owners have expressed hope that foreign tourists will spend time and
money in their country when the borders reopen in June. But in the
meantime, it is the Italians who must pick up the sunbathing slack.

On May 18, the national government, citing the dipping curve of
infections, allowed Italian regions to reopen beach clubs. Different
regions have reacted with varying degrees of caution. Tuscany allowed
them to reopen on May 18, Campania on May 23, Lazio on May 29, and
Sicily on June 6.

This week, the governor of the island of Sardinia, which had hardly any
cases, said visitors could come without quarantining, as long as they
carried a “health passport,” without detailing how such a document would
work.

But the national government has also said that any sharp rise in new
infections would prompt another lockdown, and the mayor of one small
town in the southern region of Puglia closed the beaches this week after
seeing an “invasion” of sunbathers, many, he said, “wearing their masks
as necklaces.”

Italians have been waiting to get back to the beach for months and have
obsessed over their summer prospects essentially since the lockdown
began in March. (“This summer, we will go to the beach,” the under
secretary for culture, Lorenza Bonaccorsi, assured a troubled country in
April.)

In the Italian news media, detailed graphics and videos have regularly
illustrated the possible restrictions and proposed bathing innovations.
There were the rows of plexiglass cubicles — resembling ice trays — each
holding an umbrella and recliners, or entry gates that sprayed
disinfectant on bathers like cars entering a carwash, or a village of
eco-friendly bamboo and fabric beach huts. (“We were in Mongolia for
many years,” the architect
explained.)

None caught on.

Salvatore Trinchillo, the third-generation owner of the Lido Varca d’Oro
club in Giugliano in Campania, said that the plexiglass cubes were only
ever promoted by “a guy who makes plexiglass” and would “turn sunbathers
into rotisserie chickens.”

Instead, Mr. Trinchillo, who is also the vice president of Italy’s union
of beach club presidents, opted for more traditional arrangements, with
more room between the umbrellas and lounge chairs. The people around the
pasta and coffee and cocktail bars wore masks and those who wanted to
eat in the outdoor restaurant next to the DJ booth had their foreheads
scanned with a thermometer.

(Jole Santelli, president of the neighboring region of Calabria, has
called such temperature taking “a joke” because, she reasoned, people’s
temperatures would go up in the heat.)

Campania’s measures were adopted at midnight last Friday, when Vincenzo
De Luca, the governor, perhaps best known during the coronavirus
outbreak for [threatening to take a
“blowtorch”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/world/europe/italy-mayors-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=10)
to illegal gatherings and for calling his citizens “doubly imbeciles”
for bothering to wear masks but then letting them hang around their
necks, decided that infections had gone down enough for beach clubs to
open. The region also allowed bathers to remove their masks on the
beach, as long as they observed social-distancing
measures.

“Get out of here, morons\!” Lina Devigo, 61, said jumping out of her
chair and lashing out at the horseback riders. “We’re all here with the
masks and the disinfectant and you morons come with these horses that
poop where the kids are playing.”

Ms. Devigo described herself as a year-round beach enthusiast. And she
said that after months of going stir crazy in her nearby home, the
opening of the beaches and the ability to stare out at the hazy island
of Ischia was “a mercy from God.”

“And we can see our friends,” said Rosaria Meola, 49, who reclined a few
feet away.

“We all got fat\!” Ms. Devigo added, referring to the “quarantine kilos”
she said she had put on.

Mr. Trinchillo agreed that “everyone is a little chubbier” and said
through a mask that he was delighted to finally see people back in the
beach chairs. To observe social-distancing measures, he had to reduce
his beach-chair capacity to 1,200 from 2,000. He also created broader
corridors for people to pass through and spaced his chairs out even more
than required by the
region.

Yet there remained a dense and vibrant forest of orange umbrellas. As he
took it in, Mr. Trinchillo said more exclusive and expensive beach clubs
in the region, such as on the Amalfi Coast or on the island of Capri,
spots known for their crystalline waters, coves and rocky cliffs, “were
now jealous of us” because they lacked the space for proper distancing
and could not open. “Life is bizarre,” he said.

Beach locales, like so much in Italy, can be status symbols. The
superwealthy tend to prefer luxury hotels or pristine coves reached by
sailboat or yacht. Certain segments of Rome’s upper class reconstitute
at beach clubs in Tuscany or walk though pine forests to isolate
themselves in secluded spots. Some prefer to be among other
people.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an

        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Last year, the populist leader [Matteo Salvini essentially moved his
campaign headquarters to
Papeete](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/08/world/europe/matteo-salvini-italy-beach.html?searchResultPosition=54),
a raucous beach club on the eastern coast where go-go dancers in bikinis
danced to the national anthem. (This year, Papeete’s owner said, the
guests would dance on their own beach chairs and, “Matteo will be the
happiest man on earth.”)

Less expensive beach clubs or stretches of free beaches tend to be more
tightly packed, with [migrants selling watermelon, sunglasses and
counterfeit
handbags](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/01/world/europe/italy-migrants-beaches.html?searchResultPosition=41)
winding through the towel-to-towel traffic.

“It was the beauty of our community,” Antonio Decaro, the mayor of the
southern city of Bari and the president of Italy’s association of
mayors, said of the boisterous beach scene. But he added that, until
there was a vaccine, people had to go to the beaches “some at a time,
few people, far
away.”

At the Lido Varca d’Oro, people didn’t seem so few or far away. A
toddler with goggles and a face mask the colors of the Italian flag
scampered into the sea, next to a circle of adults with their bare faces
pointed up at the sun.

Since Italy [eased its
lockdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/05/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-reopen.html)
this month, the country’s mayors have wrestled with crowds drawn to
newly reopened bars, but also to its boardwalks and beaches. To break up
the gatherings, officials have proposed a volunteer army of scolds,
possibly made up of the country’s unemployed welfare recipients. They
would not be imbued with any actual powers, but would get
official-looking jackets.

At the beach on Sunday, policing duties often fell to the club’s staff,
wearing orange shirts to match the orange umbrellas.

“I ask people if they are relatives or friends,” said one of the club
employees, Luca Telese, 19. He said that people were generally behaving
because “they’re scared.” Then he turned and excused himself. “See over
there? I have to go there and remind them that assemblies are banned.”

He walked toward the part of the beach where two cousins from Naples
were spending the afternoon sun bathing and taking tinfoil-wrapped cold
cuts out of strollers to feed their husbands and small children playing
in the sand.

“Feel this air, smell the sea,” Enza Ponticelli, 30, said. “It’s safer
out here.”

Her cousin, Valentina Rubino, 31, agreed,

“It’s freedom,” she
said.
