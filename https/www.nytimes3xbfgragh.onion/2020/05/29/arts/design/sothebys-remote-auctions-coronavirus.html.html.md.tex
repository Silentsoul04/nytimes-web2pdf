\section{Sotheby's to Hold `Live' Auctions in June,
Remotely}\label{sothebys-to-hold-live-auctions-in-june-remotely}}

The auctioneer will be in London; the telephone bids will be taken
around the world. Viewers will be watching everywhere but in the
showroom.

The Sotheby's auctioneer, Oliver Barker, will be live, by video, in
London, looking at screens showing his associates live in New York, Hong
Kong and elsewhere, who will be on the phone with live bidders all over
the world.

It's a far cry from the buzzing salesroom in Manhattan, where hundreds
of collectors, dealers, art advisers and spectators typically hobnob
over champagne before sitting side by side to raise their paddles in
nail-biting battles for great works of art.

But this digitally streamed live auction next month will allow Sotheby's
to proceed with its big-ticket biannual art sale that was supposed to
take place in May but was delayed by the coronavirus outbreak.

On Friday in a conference call, Sotheby's executives announced that the
first sale, of contemporary art, would be June 29 beginning at 6:30
p.m., immediately followed by its Impressionist and modern art evening
sale.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/05/29/arts/29virus-sothebys2/29SOTHEBYS-VIRTUAL-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The auctions will be livestreamed in high-definition, each lot
accompanied by an onscreen image. Bidders can participate by phone or
online. Mr. Barker will take bids from Sotheby's specialists on the
phone banks in New York, London and Hong Kong with the results broadcast
to screens in a control center studio setup.

``It's definitely a first,'' said Mr. Barker in the conference call.
``This will be the first time that I have taken to the rostrum in London
in order to conduct a New York sale.''

Works can be viewed virtually online and by appointment beginning June 8
at Sotheby's Manhattan galleries.

Their Hong Kong sales, which were postponed from April, will take place
as usual July 5-11, with the auctioneers live and bidders expected in
the salesroom, given that restrictions have been lifted. While protests
have resumed there, Patti Wong, the chairwoman of Sotheby's Asia, said
this ``hasn't deterred clients from bidding.''

At the top of the New York lineup on June 29 is Francis Bacon's 1981
three-part oil painting,
\href{https://www.sothebys.com/en/press/sothebys-to-offer-francis-bacons-large-format-triptych-inspired-by-the-oresteia-of-aeschylus-this-may-in-new-york}{``Triptych
Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus,''} which is estimated to sell for
at least \$60 million. The work has been guaranteed by Sotheby's,
meaning the auction house has already secured a bid. Still, given the
demand for Bacon, there is likely to be competition for the painting,
which would lift the price over the estimate.

Whether the excitement typically generated by such a bidding war can be
replicated remotely remains to be seen.

Mr. Barker bullishly predicted it will ``be a dynamic, truly global
experience that will usher in an exciting new era of marquee auctions at
Sotheby's in which the best of the established live auction format is
with married with the latest technology."

In doing so, Sotheby's is following the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/arts/design/christies-auction-coronavirus.html}{announcement
by its rival, Christie's}, which said on May 15 that it would be
offering a hybrid of online bidding, streaming and in-room bidding for
its sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. The auctions
will take place in consecutive sessions from across four Christie's
salesrooms --- Hong Kong, Paris, London and New York --- on July 10.

Phillips, the third major auction house, is set to announce its live
auctions (with bidders in the room where permitted), with contemporary
sales on July 2. Their auctions have been streamed live online for about
five years, according to a Phillips spokesperson.
