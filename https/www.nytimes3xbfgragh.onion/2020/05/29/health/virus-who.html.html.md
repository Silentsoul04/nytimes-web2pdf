After spending weeks accusing the [World Health
Organization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/politics/trump-hong-kong-china-WHO.html)
of helping the Chinese government cover up the early days of the
coronavirus epidemic in China, [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/politics/trump-hong-kong-china-WHO.html)
said on Friday that the United States would terminate its relationship
with the agency.

“The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the
Chinese government,” Mr. Trump said in a speech in the Rose Garden.
“Countless lives have been taken, and profound economic hardship has
been inflicted all around the globe.”

In his 10-minute address, Mr. Trump took no responsibility for the
deaths of 100,000 Americans from the virus, instead saying China had
“instigated a global pandemic.”

There is no evidence that the W.H.O. or the government in Beijing hid
the extent of the epidemic in China, and public health experts generally
view Mr. Trump’s charges as a way to deflect attention from his
administration’s own bungled attempts to respond to the virus’s spread
in the United States.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokeswoman for the W.H.O. in Geneva, where word of Mr. Trump’s
announcement first landed at 9 p.m., said the agency would not have a
response until Saturday.

In April, when he was asked about Mr. Trump’s accusation that the W.H.O.
was “China-centric,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s
director-general said: “It is wrong to be any ‘country-centric.’ I am
sure we are not China-centric. The truth is, if we are going to be
blamed, it is right to blame us for being U.S.-centric.”

Public health experts in the United States reacted to Mr. Trump’s
announcement with alarm.

“We helped create the W.H.O.,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has
worked with the organization since its creation in 1948.

“We’re part of it — it is part of the world,” Dr. Frieden said. “Turning
our back on the W.H.O. makes us and the world less safe.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Infectious Diseases Society of America “stands strongly against
President Trump’s decision,” said Dr. Thomas M. File, its president. “We
will not succeed against this pandemic, or any future outbreak, unless
we stand together, share information and coordinate actions.”

“The president can’t unilaterally withdraw us,” said Lawrence O. Gostin,
director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on
National & Global Health Law at The Georgetown University Law Center.

“It’s a nonstarter,” he added. “This is literally a whim of one man,
without any consultation with Congress, in the middle of the greatest
health emergency of our lifetime.”

The reaction among Democrats in Congress was swift and negative.

Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California and the chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and
Nonproliferation, called Mr. Trump’s announcement “shameful and
irresponsible.”

The W.H.O. “is not a perfect organization,” he said on Twitter, “but
leaving will make the United States and the world less safe. President
Trump is ceding American global leadership and handing it over on a
golden platter to China.”

Representative Nita Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of
the House Appropriations Committee, said: “The president wants to blame
everyone else — the W.H.O., Twitter, the media — when his own
shortcomings as a leader are contributing to harm and further dividing
us here at home and among global partners.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The administration’s response to the emergency has been fumbling and
inadequate, many public health experts say, especially when compared to
China’s.

The coronavirus has been the leading cause of death in the United States
since mid-April, killing roughly 100,000 citizens to date. By
comparison, only 4,600 Chinese citizens have died of the infection.

About 20,000 Americans are infected each day, while China virtually
ended its outbreak by April. On most days China records zero to five new
infections, usually in travelers from abroad.

The W.H.O. was founded in 1948 as part of the postwar creation of the
United Nations and is the world’s premier global health organization.
Mr. Trump supported and generously funded the organization as it fought
an Ebola outbreak in Africa for three years, but abruptly turned on the
W.H.O. a few weeks ago, when he began accusing the organization of doing
too little to warn the world of the spread of the coronavirus.

In fact, the agency issued its first [alarm on
Jan. 4](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1213523866703814656?s=20), just
five days after the local health department of Wuhan — at the time a
city few non-Chinese had even heard of — announced a cluster of 27 cases
of an unusual pneumonia at a local seafood market.

The W.H.O. followed up with [a detailed report the next
day](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/).
On Jan. 20 and 21, a W.H.O. field team visited China and [reported
that](https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020)
there could be human-to-human transmission of the new pneumonia-causing
virus.

Almost simultaneously, China’s leading epidemiologist, who had just
completed his own investigation on behalf of the Beijing government,
[confirmed during a Jan. 20
interview](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/human-human-transmission-coronavirus-reported-china/story?id=68403105)
on state television that transmission to doctors was occurring in Wuhan,
although he said on [a recent interview with
CNN](https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/05/19/chinas-dr-fauci-zhong-nanshan-coronavirus-intv-culver-pkg-2-intl-hnk-vpx.cnn)
that local officials had lied about it and even tried to mislead him.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Within three days, Beijing had shut off all travel out of Wuhan. Mr.
Trump did not [order any restrictions on travel from
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html)
until Jan. 31.

The United States has been by far the W.H.O.’s largest donor since its
inception. The budget for the W.H.O. [is about $6
billion](http://open.who.int/2018-19/budget-and-financing/gpw-overview),
which comes from member countries around the world. In 2019, the last
year for which figures were available, the United States contributed
about $553
million.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The American government and private donors, including the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Rotary
International, have wielded enormous influence on W.H.O. policies.

For example, although the war on smallpox that was begun in the 1960s
was at first largely a Soviet initiative, the W.H.O. chose American
doctors, including Dr. William Foege and Dr. Donald A. Henderson, to
lead the global campaign.

The agency also chose American-made vaccines over Soviet ones for the
war on polio.

For many years, the American government, working on behalf of the
Western pharmaceutical industry, pressured the W.H.O. not to publicly
fight for lower drug prices that might threaten the patent monopolies of
American companies.

That changed in the early 2000s, when many American companies began
sub-licensing their patents and technology to generics makers in India
and elsewhere.

No American has ever been director-general of the W.H.O., but that is
because of a decades-old understanding that the World Bank and the
United Nations Children’s Fund would always be run by Americans, while
the leadership of some other U.N. agencies, including the W.H.O., would
be taken in turn by other
nations.

The C.D.C. and many other branches of the American government have
worked with the W.H.O. for decades. Along with the C.D.C., doctors from
the American military and even the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division worked
in cooperation with the W.H.O. to fight the 2014 West African Ebola
epidemic — partly in an effort to keep it from reaching the United
States.

The W.H.O. provides essential diplomatic cover when American government
agencies work in foreign countries. All countries that belong to the
U.N. are also de facto members of the ruling body of the W.H.O.

Asked for comment Friday, a C.D.C. official said the agency did not know
what impact the announcement would have on its 72-year-old working
relationship with the W.H.O., and referred all further questions to the
White House.

As he began facing harsh questions about his handling of the disease
here, Mr. Trump swiftly diverted the blame to the W.H.O., threatening in
a letter earlier this month to pull funding if it did not “commit to
major substantive improvements in the next 30 days.”

In fact, under Dr. Tedros, the agency has been in the middle of major
reforms for several years, focusing more of its attention on pandemics
and less on the causes championed by wealthy donors, including tobacco,
lung cancer and obesity.

Last month at the World Health Assembly — the annual meeting of the
health ministers of all U.N. member nations that serves as the agency’s
governing board — other member states rebuffed Mr. Trump’s demands. They
voted instead to conduct an “impartial, independent” examination of the
W.H.O.’s pandemic response.

Mr. Trump’s Rose Garden address came as cities across the United States
were convulsing with protests over recent cases of police brutality
against black Americans.

He did not take questions after delivering his speech, even as assembled
reporters shouted for him to address protests in Minneapolis.
