Venice Ray was eager to return to work when Texas announced last week
that child care centers, like the one she was laid off from in March,
could immediately reopen. But re-enrolling her 4-year-old son? That gave
her pause.

As many restaurants, hair salons and shopping malls across the country
[welcome
back](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
customers, [some states are
allowing](http://www.hunt-institute.org/covid-19-resources/) day care
centers and preschools to reopen, acknowledging that child care plays a
foundational role in the American economy.

But for millions of working parents like Ms. Ray, the choice to send
their children back to a place known for spreading germs, even in more
normal times, is not an easy one. And in an industry operating on
razor-thin margins, the survival of many child care centers is in doubt.

[The

cost the industry [more than 355,000
jobs](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm) in March and
April, about a third of the pre-pandemic total. And a survey by an
industry group showed that many providers were so short of cash that
they [could go out of business
permanently](https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/globally-shared/downloads/PDFs/our-work/public-policy-advocacy/effects_of_coronavirus_on_child_care.final.pdf),
unable to pay rent, mortgage payments or other fixed costs.

Democrats in Congress are [introducing bills this week and
next](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/upshot/virus-childcare-bailout-democrats.html)
that would spend $50 billion to keep centers afloat and provide tuition
relief to families. The bills would also help put in place new safety
measures, which could be vital to ensuring that parents feel safe
re-enrolling their children.

In a majority of American families, both parents hold jobs, making child
care essential for a functioning economy. But the United States is rare
among industrialized nations in [not providing a universal
option](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/15/upshot/why-americans-resist-child-care.html),
leaving families with the burden of figuring it out themselves. Many
struggle even in the best of

Experts now worry that if licensed centers disappear during the
pandemic, more families will resort to ad hoc arrangements, such as
relying on relatives, friends or neighbors who lack experience, let
alone formal training in safety or education.

But for families balancing professional and economic pressures with
health concerns, the idea of re-enrolling in center-based care can be
profoundly anxiety-provoking, even with new sanitation and social
distancing practices required by federal and state guidelines.

That is the situation the Ray family found itself in. Ms. Ray is
confident that the new procedures will make it safe for her to return to
work when her employer, a day care and preschool associated with a
Longview, Texas, church, reopens on June 2.

But as a mother, she felt unsure about whether her son should go back,
too. In particular, she was concerned about her in-laws, who have been
babysitting her older children. What if the youngest, their 4-year-old
son, brought the virus home and passed it on to them?

“It’s a really tough one,” she said. After days of debate, she and her
husband decided that Ms. Ray would go back to work — the family needs
her $475-per-week salary, and she loves her job — but their son would go
to his grandparents for care.

A similar conversation took place in Alison Larkin’s home in Chicago.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, Ms. Larkin, a 35-year-old social work
consultant, had a dream situation for her toddler, Clementine: a coveted
spot in a respected day care just a few minutes away.

But now she and her husband, who have been trading child care shifts
while working from home, are preparing for their current arrangement to
last until there is a vaccine, even though Illinois is allowing [day
care centers to reopen this
week](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-child-care-facilities-reopen-daycare-20200522-tbsreoatqfeblldhkx7lmfe3km-story.html).

“My sense of things is that the virus is not going anywhere for quite
some time,” Ms. Larkin said. “This could be an indefinite state of
being.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“How can companies really expect their employees to return to work in a
normal fashion?” she asked. “What true flexibility and understanding
will companies give to employees who can’t send their kids back to day
care?”

So far, there have not been major coronavirus outbreaks reported in
child care centers in the United States, although one in Canada was the
site of an alarming [cluster of
cases](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/16-infected-north-of-montreal-in-quebec-s-first-covid-19-outbreak-in-a-daycare-1.4927853).

The industry typically serves more than [12 million children in the
United
States](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3957809/State%20Fact%20Sheets%202019/2019StateFactSheets-Overview.pdf)
under 6, the [majority of
whom](https://www.childtrends.org/most-child-care-providers-in-the-united-states-are-based-in-homes-not-centers)
attend day cares in private homes. Providers are licensed by state and
local governments, and must follow regulations for education, health and
safety. Generally, [experts
recommend](https://www.childcare.gov/index.php/consumer-education/ratios-and-group-sizes)
that one trained caretaker be responsible for no more than four infants,
six toddlers or 10 preschoolers.

Under normal circumstances, the physical space required for a center to
maintain social distancing depends heavily on the developmental stage of
the children being cared for. Infants are more interested in adults than
other babies, and are easier to space out than toddlers and
preschoolers, who are social and frenetic. The space required for
effective social distancing will vary greatly depending on the ages and
temperament of children in a center.

[Coronavirus
guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf)
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for child care
centers to disinfect surfaces and shared objects several times per day;
avoid toys, like stuffed animals, that cannot be easily washed; stagger
children’s arrival time to limit contact between parents; and to seat
and nap children at least six feet apart from one another. States are
issuing their own guidelines, which can differ significantly.

Tennille Smalls, who runs a [child care
center](https://www.instagram.com/gentlehandsacademydaycare/) out of her
home in New Haven, Conn., is among the providers trying to make the
necessary changes. Her business is surviving during the pandemic, but
only precariously. Enrollment has fallen to four children from nine;
their parents are essential health care workers.

Ms. Smalls received about $11,000 in federal relief loans, not nearly
enough to cover her lost revenue and the costs of moving the center to a
larger space over the summer, which is necessary for children and
employees to maintain social distancing guidelines.

She has already signed a lease and begun planning renovations, such as
installing toddler sinks and mounted dispensers for sanitizer, masks and
gloves. To make ends meet, she and her business partner have reduced
their own salaries.

“I’m nervous, but I’m not fearful,” Ms. Smalls said. She hopes her
spacious new location will reassure nervous parents.

“Families will be able to tour it and say, ‘This is somewhere that I’m
going to feel comfortable putting my most prized possession.’ ”
