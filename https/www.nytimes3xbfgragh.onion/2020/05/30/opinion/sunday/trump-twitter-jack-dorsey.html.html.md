WASHINGTON — C’mon, @Jack. You can do it.

[Throw on some Kendrick
Lamar](https://twitter.com/jack/status/630260438647898112?lang=en)and
get your head in the right space. Pour yourself a big old glass of [salt
juice](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-jack-dorsey-drinks-salt-juice-every-morning-2019-5).
Draw an ice bath and fire up the cryotherapy pod and [the infrared
sauna](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/02/fashion/jack-dorsey-influencer.html).
Then just pull the plug on him. You know you want to.

You could answer the existential question of whether
[@realDonaldTrump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/technology/trump-twitter-label-seattle.html)
even exists if he doesn’t exist on
[Twitter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/technology/trump-twitter-label-seattle.html).
*I tweet, therefore I am.* Dorsey meets Descartes.

All it would take is one sweet click to force the greatest troll in the
history of the internet to meet his maker. Maybe he just disappears in
an orange cloud of smoke, screaming, “I’m melllllllting.”

Do Trump — and the world — a favor and send him back into the void
whence he came. And then go have [some
fun](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1071575088695140353?s=20): Meditate
and fast for days on end\!

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Our country is going through biological, economic and societal
convulsions. We can’t trust the powerful forces in this nation to tell
us the truth or do the right thing. In fact, not only can we not trust
them. We have every reason to believe they’re gunning for us.

In Washington, the Trump administration’s deception about the virus was
lethal. On Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, the fat cats who carved up
the country, drained us dry and left us with no safety net
[profiteered](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/perspectives/inequality-coronavirus-billionaires/index.html)
off the virus. In Minneapolis, the barbaric death of George Floyd after
a police officer knelt on him for almost nine minutes showed yet again
that black Americans have everything to fear from some who are charged
with protecting them.

As if that weren’t enough, from the slough of our despond, we have to
watch Donald Trump duke it out with the lords of the cloud in a contest
to see who can destroy our democracy faster.

I wish I could go along with those who say this dark period of American
life will ultimately make us nicer and simpler and more contemplative.
How can that happen when the whole culture has been re-engineered to put
us at each other’s throats?

Trump constantly torques up the tribal friction and cruelty, even as
Twitter and Facebook refine their systems to ratchet up rage. It is
amazing that a septuagenarian became the greatest exploiter of social
media. Trump and Twitter were a match made in hell.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Wall Street Journal had a [chilling
report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499)
a few days ago that Facebook’s own research in 2018 revealed that “our
algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness. If left
unchecked,” Facebook would feed users “more and more divisive content in
an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.”

Mark Zuckerberg shelved the research.

Why not just let all the bots trying to undermine our elections and
spreading false information about the coronavirus and right-wing
conspiracy theories and smear campaigns run amok? Sure, we’re weakening
our society, but the weird, infantile maniacs running Silicon Valley
must be allowed to rake in more billions and finish their mission of
creating a giant cyberorganism of people, one huge and lucrative ball of
rage.

“The shareholders of Facebook decided, ‘If you can increase my stock
tenfold, we can put up with a lot of rage and hate,’” says Scott
Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School
of Business.

“These platforms have very dangerous profit motives. When you monetize
rage at such an exponential rate, it’s bad for the world. These guys
don’t look left or right; they just look down. They’re willing to
promote white nationalism if there’s money in it. The rise of social
media will be seen as directly correlating to the decline of Western
civilization.”

Dorsey, who has more leeway because his stock isn’t as valuable as
Facebook’s, made some mild moves against the president who has been
spewing lies and inciting violence on Twitter for years. He added
footnotes clarifying false Trump tweets about mail-in ballots and put a
warning label on the president’s tweet about the Minneapolis riots that
[echo the
language](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/05/29/us/ap-us-trump-minneapolis-death-quote-.html)
of a Miami police chief in 1967 and segregationist George Wallace: “When
the looting starts, the shooting starts.”

“Jack is really sincerely trying to find something to make it better,”
said one friend of the Twitter chief’s. “He’s like somebody trapped in a
maze, going down every hallway and turning every corner.”

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, went on Fox to report that he was happy
to continue enabling the Emperor of Chaos, noting that he did not think
Facebook should be “the arbiter of truth of everything that people say
online.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a sickening display that made even some loyal Facebook staffers
queasy. As [The Verge’s Casey Newton
reported](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21275044/facebook-trump-tweets-employee-reaction-criticism),
some employees objected to the company’s rationale in internal posts.

“I have to say I am finding the contortions we have to go through
incredibly hard to stomach,” one wrote. “All this points to a very high
risk of a violent escalation and civil unrest in November and if we fail
the test case here, history will not judge us kindly.”

Trump, furious that Dorsey would attempt to rein him in on the very
platform that catapulted him into the White House, immediately decided
to try to rein in Dorsey.

He [signed an executive
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-order-social-media.html)
that might strip liability protection from social media sites, which
would mean they would have to more assiduously police false and
defamatory posts. Now that social media sites are behemoths, Galloway
thinks that the removal of the Communications Decency Act makes a lot of
sense even if the president is trying to do it for the wrong reasons.

Trump does not seem to realize, however, that he’s removing his own
protection. He huffs and puffs about freedom of speech when he really
wants the freedom to be vile. “It’s the mother of all
cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face moves,” says Galloway.

The president wants to say things on Twitter that he will not be allowed
to say if he exerts this control over Twitter. In a sense, it’s Trump
versus his own brain. If Twitter can be sued for what people say on it,
how can Trump continue to torment? Wouldn’t thousands of his own tweets
have to be deleted?

“He’d be the equivalent of a slippery floor at a store that sells
equipment for hip replacements,” says Galloway, who also posits that, in
our hyper-politicized world, this will turn Twitter into a Democratic
site and Facebook into a Republican one.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nancy Pelosi, whose district encompasses Twitter, said that it did
little good for Dorsey to put up a few fact-checks while letting Trump’s
rants about murder and other “misrepresentations” stay up.

“Facebook, all of them, they are all about making money,” the speaker
said. “Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth
and the facts.” She crisply concluded that “all they want is to not pay
taxes; they got their tax break in 2017” and “they don’t want to be
regulated, so they pander to the White House.”

C’mon, Jack. Make @realDonaldTrump melt to help end our meltdown.
