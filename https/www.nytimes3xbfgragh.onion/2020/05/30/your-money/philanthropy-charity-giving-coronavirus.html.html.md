As unemployment claims pass [40
million](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html)
and the anxious people who file them [grow more
desperate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/business/economy/coronavirus-stimulus-unemployment.html),
an altruistic instinct has emerged among those who are more financially
secure.

But the sheer breadth of the pain is almost overwhelming, and the
appeals are everywhere. And the impulse is to help — now — when
confronted with a personal plea.

So what is the very best way for people with more money than they need
to quickly hand it over to those in need, so they can use it for food,
shelter and other necessities?

It isn’t easy to find a satisfying answer. Sites and services like
GoFundMe can connect donors with real people, but they may lack vetting
of recipients, their back stories or their plans. They also may not make
it possible to be identified or anonymous, depending on your preference
as a giver or a beneficiary. Donors with large amounts to give may want
to use tax deductions to increase what they can afford to donate, but
may not be able to get them through one-off cash transfers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The elusiveness of perfect solutions has inspired a variety of social
entrepreneurs to pursue various forms of direct giving. If you’ve sent
money via [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/about) to help a
teacher pay for a classroom project, you get the basic idea: Give a
little money, know exactly where it’s going, have some sense of who’s
getting it and have someone between you and the recipient to provide at
least some verification. The goal is to provide a charitable option that
lives somewhere between handing money over to a large, faceless
nonprofit group and just [Venmoing
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/business/coronavirus-bills-charity.html)
who say on Twitter that they need help.

Now that the pandemic has left millions more people with acute needs,
two existing organizations and one new entrant are offering some of the
most satisfying ways of providing few-strings-attached assistance.
[Modest Needs Foundation](https://www.modestneeds.org/) and
[GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), both nonprofit
organizations, are using years of experience to pay people’s bills or
hand them money to pay for things themselves. And the [1K
Project](https://www.1kproject.org/) is facilitating money transfers,
although without the tax deductions the other two can offer donors.

First, a few words for the wary. Cash transfers have been the subject of
a fair bit of study, particularly on transfers outside the United
States. [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/about), an extremely
particular, research-driven nonprofit group, evaluates how much good
other charitable organizations do. Its [extended
take](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers)
speaks to a few findings: Recipients tend not to spend more on
“temptation goods” like tobacco and alcohol but do increase what they
lay out for more and better food. Many people also invest in
infrastructure upgrades, like replacing thatch roofs with
iron.

GiveWell recommends [a
handful](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) of charities,
including GiveDirectly, which began its coronavirus efforts in March
with the same basic goals it set for its work outside of the United
States: Give $1,000 to poor people and let them decide what to do with
it.

GiveDirectly partnered with
[Propel](https://www.joinpropel.com/covid-19), a company that helps
recipients of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program once
known as food stamps) manage their benefits. They receive a message at
random offering the money, a bit like a lottery that they don’t have to
enter.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is not actually legal for a nonprofit group to help you transfer
money directly to specific individuals if you want the amount to be a
tax deductible donation, though GiveDirectly does [post
videos](https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/us/recipient-stories/)
from grateful recipients. [Michael
Faye](https://www.givedirectly.org/team/), a co-founder and the
president, who has a Ph.D in economics, said in an interview that the
organization wouldn’t want to allow that anyway — research indicates
that donors might choose people based on physical appearance rather than
pure need.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Donors can, however, direct their money to [specific hard-hit
cities](https://community.givedirectly.org/). So far, GiveDirectly has
sent $1,000 each to about 82,000 people. Its goal is to reach 100,000,
though it is likely to continue the efforts if donations keep coming in.

Modest Needs, a nonprofit organization, operates on a smaller scale,
with a slightly different model. Recipients need to find their way to
the group and apply for help paying particular bills. It requires
documentation of the need and pays bills directly, without giving money
to the applicant.

Keith Taylor, a former humanities professor, started the organization
with the intent to help people cover a out-of-the-blue emergency
expenses. In practice, he said, people often turn to Modest Needs after
they’ve paid for the emergency and can no longer cover food or shelter
or that month’s car payment.

Modest Needs posts [requests for
help](https://www.modestneeds.org/features/ledger/index.asp) on its
website, but by the time they are there, the organization has verified
that they are legitimate. All that’s left is for donors to give. In the
last two months, requests for help have more than quadrupled: 539 people
or families are currently waiting for $842,000 in donations.

More than half of the people who have received help in the past are now
among the group’s donors. Some of them give as little as $2 per month,
but those that do give regularly have often been doing it month-in,
month-out since they received their own
assistance.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The [1K Project](https://www.1kproject.org/) sprang from the minds of
two venture capitalists, [Minda
Brusse](https://www.firstrowpartners.vc/) and [Alex
Iskold](https://www.2048.vc/). In conversation and on their site, they
speak of quick-scaling, self-organizing systems, complex networks and a
sort of human blockchain.

In practice, they aim to find needy people through a rapidly expanding
network of [trusted referral
sources](https://airtable.com/shrbR4m4Gkbh3vadJ), vet them with the help
of volunteers and pair donors of $1,000 per month for three months with
recipients. (Neither reveal their full names to one another. Donors and
recipients at GiveDirectly and Modest Needs rarely if ever do, either.)

The 1K Project is not a nonprofit organization, so people who itemize
their deductions won’t get a tax break for helping a family through its
service. It uses private GoFundMe pages to transfer funds to recipients,
so 1K is never in possession of donor funds itself. (1K charges no user
fees of its own, though GoFundMe levies payment processing fees.
GiveDirectly and Modest Needs are also fee-free, though as with any
nonprofit group, a small portion of donations may help cover some
administrative expenses.)

So far, it’s helped about 250 recipients, mostly families with
dependents. Many referrals come from despondent small-business owners
trying to help their employees who have lost their jobs or had their
income severely cut back.

We should never stop reminding ourselves that these sorts of makeshift
stopgaps are often [not necessary
elsewhere](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/business/nordic-way-economic-rescue-virus.html)
at the scale they are in the United States, where people must [queue up
in
cars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/26/magazine/coronavirus-san-antonio-unemployment-jobs.html)
at food banks and ping websites hundreds of times or [find a fax
machine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-unemployment-benefits.html)
just to register for assistance.

My conversation with Ms. Brusse and Mr. Iskold felt marked by a sort of
low-grade hum of urgency with a side of frustration over the quantity
and speed of the available help in the United States. So I had to ask:
In addition to trying to help, are they also trying to make some kind of
a point about politics or nonprofit groups or the world as it is — or as
we might wish it to be?

They demurred. “We find ourselves in this unique moment in time where
help isn’t reaching people fast enough, and we want to be a bridge to
when other support and employment is available,” Ms. Brusse said.

“The truth about this,” Mr. Iskold added, “is that this whole thing is
just a massive heartbreak.”
