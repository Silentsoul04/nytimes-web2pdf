In the last two weeks, the pop stars Lana Del Rey and Doja Cat have both
found themselves in hot water on the internet over kerfuffles of their
own creation. This is what life online is often like for the famous and
demi-famous. Misstep, apologize, recalibrate, repeat.

But these two scenarios are unusual in that the pop star's explanations
were delivered with a stiffened spine, a bit of pushback against the
organized hive of social media condemnation.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about how pop stars are asked to
be avatars of moral perfection, and how they are increasingly shrugging
off that burden and embracing their complexity, critics be damned.
