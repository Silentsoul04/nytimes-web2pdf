*\[*[*Follow our live coronavirus pandemic

In the time since the world’s scientists and public health officials
first became widely aware of the new coronavirus in January, they’ve had
[six months to learn about
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html).

They’ve reached [many conclusions about the virus and the illness it
causes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html),
from the importance of wearing masks to contain it, to the unusual range
of symptoms it provokes.

But there are major gaps in scientific knowledge about the virus. In the
half year that journalists of the health and science desk of The Times
have been reporting on Sars-CoV-2, we have identified some of the
enduring uncertainties. How scientists resolve some of these mysteries
will shape our future with the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/health/coronavirus-lung-transplant.html).

One of the epidemic’s great unknowns is how many Americans have been
infected so far.

Only [about 1.9 million
Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html)
had tested positive as of May 28, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention — or perhaps only [about 1.7
million](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) according to the Johns
Hopkins Center for Health Security, which produces a frequently cited
map of world cases.

Statisticians believe the actual number of cases is higher, but it is
not clear by how much.

They have more confidence in the accuracy of data produced by[states
that do the most
testing](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). On that
score, New York is a leader; it has tested about 9.6 percent of its
population, which is almost double the national average. (Rhode Island
tested 13 percent of its people, beating New York, but its population is
small.)

New York has also done tens of thousands of antibody tests for
surveillance purposes. On May 22, [Gov. Andrew Cuomo
announced](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-results-states-antibody-testing-survey)
that, according to these tests, about a fifth of all New York City
residents have had the virus, as had about 27 percent of thousands of
black and Hispanic New Yorkers who were tested at their local churches.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If that same pattern were assumed to hold in other hard-hit big cities
like Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit and Miami, it is likely that
somewhere between 3 and 4 million urban Americans were infected.

Even if that figure was doubled or tripled — which is probably generous
— to account for Americans infected all around the country before the
lockdowns, that would still be only 9 to 12 million people.

That is in line with the low end of estimates made in mid-April, before
antibody testing began;[different modelers predicted then that between 3
and 10
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html)
of the country was infected.

In any case, since this is a country of 330 million, a mere 10 million
or even 20 million infected would be a drop in the bucket. As the
country comes out of lockdown, the vast majority of Americans remain
vulnerable to the
virus.

Nor will the country be able to spot all of those who get it. The
C.D.C.’s “best estimate,”[according to the pandemic
scenarios](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html)
it issued May 22, is that about 35 percent of those infected have no
symptoms.

Currently, about 21,000 Americans are getting infected each day. If a
third of them show no symptoms, almost 210,000 “silent spreaders” are
created each month.

It seems impossible to imagine that any contact-tracing program, no
matter how large, will be able to keep up with that.

Here’s what we can say for sure about the minimum number of viral
particles it takes to seed a coronavirus infection: The number is
somewhere between one and one million.

If you push scientists harder, they might offer a slightly smaller range
of a few hundred to a few thousand — and some might even bravely throw
out an estimate in the high hundreds, based on what they have learned
about the behavior of the coronavirus that caused the 2002-03 SARS
epidemic.

But the bottom line is that no one will know for sure until more
research is completed.

“It’s very unsatisfying to tell people, ‘Oh we don’t know,’” said Angela
Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. “People do
have a lot of questions about this.”

It’s difficult to say anything definitive about the coronavirus because
it behaves like an influenza virus in how easily it is transmitted, and
in that people can pass it on even when they don’t seem sick. But its
structure, origin in bats and overall symptoms are similar to those of
its cousin coronaviruses.

So scientists cannot say whether touching a surface with a smidgen of
virus or breathing air with a few droplets exhaled by a sick person will
make you ill. But it is safe to say exposure to more of the coronavirus
is more likely to cause infection, and also to lead to more severe
symptoms. That’s why it’s important to avoid crowded indoor spaces, wear
masks and wash your hands. Each of those steps can decrease your chances
of being exposed to large amounts of virus.

## Why some people get so much sicker than others.

Covid-19 is a mercurial disease. While some people experience only mild,
fleeting symptoms, others are knocked over with a severe flulike illness
that can last several weeks. A minority of patients develop
life-threatening complications. Death can ensue.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Why do some people sail through the illness, and others develop the
severe inflammation and lung damage that are hallmarks of the disease?
It is one of the great mysteries of Covid-19.

Experts say the patient’s immune response to the viral infection
determines the severity of the illness. [If the immune system goes into
overdrive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html),
it can trigger a cascade of harmful effects, injuring the lungs and
other organs.

Immune function declines with age, and [elderly people with Covid-19 are
among the most vulnerable to poor
outcomes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-elderly-protection.html),
as are those with chronic health conditions like high blood pressure,
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. [Obesity, which affects 4 in 10
American
adults](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-obesity-higher-risk.html),
also appears to exacerbate the illness.

[Men are at greater risk for critical illness and
death](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/health/coronavirus-new-york-men.html),
a sex disparity that may be explained by women’s more robust immune
systems, scientists say.

Generally speaking, patients get sicker faster if they are exposed to a
large dose of the virus when they are first infected, said Dr. William
Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.

Much scientific inquiry has focused on the role of a receptor called
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2, which is the entry way for
coronaviruses into the cells. The receptor is found on the outer
surfaces of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, intestines and other
organs, as well as in the back of the throat and high up in the nasal
passage.

When the pandemic started, there was concern that people taking blood
pressure medications like ACE inhibitors could be at greater risk from
the coronavirus, but so far studies have not found that to be the case,
and doctors are urging patients to continue their medications.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though the SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to the receptor in order to
penetrate cells, ACE2 also helps regulate blood pressure and
inflammation. Some scientists have suggested that children may be less
susceptible to infection with Covid-19 because they have fewer of these
receptors. ACE2 is also regulated differently in men and women,
according to scientists who study sex differences in medicine, and men
tend to develop hypertension, or high blood pressure, at younger ages
than women. But much is still unknown.

“ACE2 can play two very critical roles, getting the virus into the cell,
but also modulating some of the damage that takes place in the blood
vessels and the lungs,” said Dr. Ankit B. Patel, a nephrologist at
Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “So it’s a double-edged sword in
a sense, and that’s made the whole story all the more complicated.”

        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

One puzzle is what role children play in spreading the virus. They seem
[less likely to become seriously ill than
adults](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-children-us.html),
making up about [2 percent of confirmed American coronavirus
cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html).
There are [different
theories](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01354-0) about
whether that is because children are less likely to become infected to
begin with, or whether the virus infects them just as easily but mostly
causes few or no symptoms.

Either way, a growing body of evidence suggests that infected [children
can transmit the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/health/coronavirus-children-transmission-school.html),
possibly as easily as adults. And [one recent
study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/04/science.abb8001.full)
suggests that when children attend school, they come in contact with
three times as many people as average adults do, providing more
opportunities for children to become infected and infect others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although far fewer children than adults have experienced severe
symptoms, [some children have become devastatingly
ill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-children-icu.html)
and there have been at least 20 [deaths of children from Covid-19 in the
United
States](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku)
and elsewhere. Reports from hospitals suggest that the children most
vulnerable to the respiratory failure adults develop are those who
already have a serious medical condition. Some studies also suggest that
[infants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-children-us.html)
and
[preschoolers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-childen.html)
may be more vulnerable than older children.

But a small number of other children, including teenagers, who did not
have any symptoms when they were first infected, have developed [a
newly-identified inflammatory syndrome that can cause serious heart
problems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/health/coronavirus-multisystem-fnflammatory-syndrome-children-teenagers.html#commentsContainer).
The syndrome, which seems to occur weeks after infection and to result
from a revved-up immune response to the virus, has been reported in
Europe and throughout the United States and has caused several deaths.
Doctors are urgently trying to understand what causes the syndrome, why
it afflicts some children and not others, and how to best treat or
prevent it.

The notion of [a single patient
zero](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html)
is both theatrical and real: In any new epidemic, some unlucky soul
seeds the first infection, several links of which are fated to seed
chains of their own and spark a viral Big Bang.

By analyzing the genetic material of people who test positive,
scientists can trace the lineage of each virus back to a common
ancestor, and often to an individual carrier. The first confirmed
coronavirus case in the United States was a man who landed at
Seattle-Tacoma Airport on Jan. 15, from China. Other introductions came
in February, and scientists are now closing in on who, exactly, sparked
the outbreak in Washington State.

New York confirmed its first case on March 1, and by that time there
were already thousands of infected people walking around, for a week or
more. Scientists have found genetic signatures on the viruses studied so
far that link them to Europe, likely brought in by some of the millions
of people arriving in New York in February, and it is likely that there
were multiple introductions that spread widely: patients zero, plural.

The first infected arrivals in a community are not necessarily the ones
who light the fuse. [In a report published last
week](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109322v1.full.pdf),
genetic scientists argued that infected people were among both Americans
and Europeans in January, but that most of those viruses fizzled out.
And French doctors [recently reported that a respiratory
sample](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301643)
from a man hospitalized near Paris, in late December, tested positive.
That virus, too, likely died out. France’s outbreak did not start until
many weeks later.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The world’s patient zero, in China, began infecting others in the late
fall of last year, the evidence thus far suggests. [An analysis of the
first 41 confirmed
cases,](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30183-5/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR18JG3cpHvWPVa9ZOZ9ZZnUS1hVjQJ0A2KcTcRAp0z9I12TbIv8rUC4sv0)
all in people who had visited the same seafood market in Wuhan,
indicates that the first hospital admission was on Dec. 16, 2019. The
patient first noticed symptoms on Dec. 1, so the infection dates back
earlier. Several scientists have estimated that the first outbreak began
in late or mid-November, and [have inferred a probable common viral
ancestor](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176-genomes-6-mar-2020/356),
though additional virus samples could change the picture.

The level of detective work required to find the actual patient zero
might be steeper than it appears. [At least one genetic
scientist](https://news.tulane.edu/pr/study-coronavirus-pandemic-sparked-nature-not-bioengineering)
has argued that the virus could have first infected humans — likely from
a pangolin — well before last fall, in a form that did not cause
sickness. It then evolved its pathogenic features over time, while
circulating. If that’s the case, the question “Who came first?” may go
without a conclusive answer for some time, perhaps for good.

## How long you’ll be immune after infection.

Are people infected with the coronavirus protected from further
infection? And, if yes, for how long?

The answers to these questions have broad implications for reopening the
economy and allowing the public to live with less fear of infection in
the short term — and for the effectiveness of vaccines in the long term.

Scientists have made steady, if incremental, progress in getting to the
answers. When the body encounters any virus, it typically makes
antibodies, some of which are powerful enough to neutralize the pathogen
and prevent reinfection. It also produces large numbers of immune cells
that can kill the virus.

Most tests that look for antibodies to the coronavirus [have been
flawed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html).
But at least one team with a reliable test reported that most people,
including those who were only mildly ill, [make powerful
antibodies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html).
Data on immune cells has been slower to emerge, but a few studies
suggest a robust response from immune cells as well.

What remains unknown is how long this immunity will last. There have
been some reports of reinfection, but scientists have said that they are
a result either of faulty testing, or of viral remnants that circulate
long after the active infection has ended.

They are hopeful that based on other coronaviruses that cause the common
cold, SARS or MERS, immunity to the new coronavirus might last at least
a year, but it remains a mystery for now.
