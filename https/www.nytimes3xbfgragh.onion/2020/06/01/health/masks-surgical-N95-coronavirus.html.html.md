A new analysis of 172 studies, funded by the World Health Organization,
confirms what scientists have said for months:
[N95](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html)
and other respirator
[masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html)
[are far superior to surgical or cloth
masks](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736\(20\)31142-9) in protecting
essential medical workers against the coronavirus.

The results, published on Monday in The Lancet, make it clear that the
W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should
recommend that essential workers like nurses and emergency responders
wear [N95
masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html),
not just surgical masks, experts said.

“It’s been disappointing that both the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. have
suggested that surgical
[masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-face-masks-surveys.html)
are adequate, and they’re clearly not,” said David Michaels, a professor
at George Washington University who headed the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration under President Obama.

“Reliance on surgical masks has no doubt led to many workers being
infected,” he said.

N95 masks offered 96 percent protection, the analysis found, while the
figure for surgical masks was 67 percent. The findings are particularly
important as the United States moves to reopen the economy, Dr. Michaels
said.

Workers in health care settings are not the only ones at high risk of
coronavirus infection: employees in [meatpacking
plants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/business/coronavirus-meatpacking-plants-cases.html)
and some farms are all also at high risk of coronavirus infection and
could benefit from N95 masks, he said.

The W.H.O. has not endorsed universal wearing of masks, although most of
its member governments adopted the practice months ago. The
organization’s stance has frustrated many public health experts who
see masks as a simple, inexpensive and highly effective strategy to help
contain the pandemic, especially given that the virus can be transmitted
by people [who do not know they are
ill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html).

“When there is uncertainty and you don’t know everything about a
disease, you have to be precautionary, which means you have to assume
the worst and provide the best for health care workers,” said Dr. Raina
MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in
Sydney, Australia, who wrote a commentary accompanying the
paper.

“This kind of denial, what purpose is it serving — except to harm health
care workers?” she said.

Previous studies have shown that the universal wearing of [masks is
effective](https://reliefweb.int/report/china/reduction-secondary-transmission-sars-cov-2-households-face-mask-use-disinfection-and).
If anything, the new study does so based on poorer evidence, said Jeremy
Howard, a distinguished research scientist at the University of San
Francisco, and a co-founder of the global \#Masks4All movement.

“This is probably what the W.H.O. needs to change their guidance, even
though it shouldn’t be,” Mr. Howard said. “Such is life. It will save
lives, so that’s good.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new analysis also suggests that covering the eyes with [face
shields](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html),
goggles and glasses may provide additional safeguards for health care
workers and people in the community.

The report is among the first to lay out evidence specific to
coronaviruses, rather than extrapolating from data on other respiratory
viruses.

The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through droplets expelled
when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or even breathes.
Some infections may also be caused by people touching a contaminated
surface and then their mouth, nose or eyes.

Study after study has indicated that the virus can also spread via tiny
droplets less than 5 microns, called aerosols. (A micron equals one
millionth of a meter.)

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

But the W.H.O. has so far not acknowledged this risk and has not backed
the universal use of masks. “There’s this fear around saying airborne —
but that’s what it is,” Dr. MacIntyre said.

A recent review in the journal Science [took direct aim at the W.H.O.’s
reluctance](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/27/science.abc6197)
on this issue, saying the organization’s recommendations for physical
distancing and hand washing were based on studies “carried out in the
1930s.”

The C.D.C. did not recommend masks till April 3. Even now, its guidance
says surgical masks offer enough protection for health care workers
unless they are involved in [procedures that produce
aerosols](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C. initially recommended N95 masks for all health care
personnel. Dr. MacIntyre said the agency later downgraded its
recommendations because of a shortage of N95 masks and personal
protective equipment.

“Guidelines should be based on evidence, not on supplies,” she said.
“It’s like telling an army, ‘Oh sorry, we’ve run out of guns, just
take these bows and arrows and face the
enemy.’”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

She noted that N95 masks were inexpensive to produce and that other
countries, including Australia, had repurposed existing manufacturing
facilities to make the masks.

“We’re not talking about making a space shuttle,” she said. “We’re
talking about making a straightforward piece of equipment that’s quite
cheap to manufacture.”

A C.D.C. spokesman was unable to address the Lancet study but said the
agency is constantly evaluating new science and “adjusts its guidance
accordingly.”

No precaution is a guarantee against infection. But the new report
estimates how effective some of them seem to be.

Standing more than three feet away cuts the risk of transmission to 3
percent from 13 percent, the analysis found. Use of masks reduces the
odds of infection to 3 percent from 17 percent, and eye protection to 6
percent from 16 percent. The researchers emphasized that people should
also continue to wash their hands frequently.

The review also offers some practical information for disease models.
For example, it suggests that contact tracing for people who are
potentially exposed should include anyone who has been within six feet
of an infected person.

The analysis is based on observational studies conducted during the
coronavirus pandemic, as well as the SARS and MERS epidemics. It can
offer only moderate certainty — although the study “underplays the
results,” Dr. Michaels said.

The evidence is strong enough to warrant changes to recommendations for
essential health care workers and to plan for mass production of N95
masks, Dr. Michaels said.

“The Trump administration needs to be less worried about producing meat,
and more about producing N95s and other P.P.E. needed to save the lives
of essential workers,” he said.
