*This photo essay is part of* [*The Big
Ideas*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/the-big-ideas)*, a
special section of The Times’s philosophy series,* [*The
Stone*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/the-stone?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)*,
in which more than a dozen artists, writers and thinkers answer the
question, “Why does art matter?” The entire series can be found*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/the-big-ideas)*.*

Art matters because artists matter.

For years I used to get up early and walk to the corner store to grab my
weekend fix: a Sunday edition of The New York Times. (My Sundays today
still include The Times, albeit the one on my iPad.) It’s the best
newspaper in the nation, and I loved it even during those long stretches
when I don’t remember seeing a single story on black or brown artists
for weeks on end. There was nothing in the Arts section, nothing in
dance, nothing in film, nothing in the Book Review and, astonishingly,
very little in music. The lack of representation was stunning.

Then again, that absence wasn’t limited to The New York Times. It was
woven into our social fabric and existed across all our cultural
landscapes. The entire country, along with its cultural institutions,
was behind.

Dumbfounded, disappointed, angry and hurt, one day I sat down and cried.
I worked in the shadows, and had been waiting for the coming of a new
day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But then, coupled with our changing demographics, came a sudden shift:
Network television was freed up, its narratives ceded to those who
historically couldn’t afford cable — the black and the brown. Shows like
“Empire,” “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Scandal” emerged, and the
game began to change. These shows upended old notions of what was
important and what could be seen, positing something that was dynamic
and that grappled with the notion of representation in a new way. I was
thrilled.

As with much of my work, “Scenes & Takes” grew out of that crack in the
cultural armor. I thought it would be important for me to stand in front
of, and in, the sets of these shows, to think about what was shifting
within the worlds of contemporary expression and popular
culture.

SCENE 1 - TAKE 3

ROLLING …

THE PLOT: BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL, A YOUNG WOULD-BE STARLET IN HOLLYWOOD
SEEKING FAME AND FORTUNE. ALONG THE WAY, SHE ENCOUNTERS ERRONEOUS
ASSUMPTIONS, BAD LUCK AND DANGEROUS MEN.

SHE AND THE DIRECTOR HAD A “THING,” SHORT-LIVED, BUT SWEET. HE’D TAKEN
AN INTEREST AND INTRODUCED HER ABOUT TOWN. SQUEEZING HER THIGHS, KISSING
HER LIPS AND HAVING SEX WITH HER LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW, HE SAID,
“YOU HAVE THAT CERTAIN … JE NE SAIS QUOI. THIS IS A TOUGH TOWN, A
TOUGH BUSINESS, SO I CAN’T MAKE ANY PROMISES, BUT REMEMBER, THERE ARE NO
SMALL PARTS. TAKE WHAT YOU CAN GET AND BE GLAD.”

LAUGHING COYLY, SHE SAID, “WHO ARE YOU KIDDING? I WASN’T BORN YESTERDAY,
SILLY.”

EMBITTERED, THE FORMER FLAME STALKS THE WOMANIZER.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS

SCENE 5 - TAKE 9

ROLLING …

THE PLOT: A LARGE AUDIENCE GATHERS FOR A MOVIE, BUT FINDS ITSELF
UNSETTLED BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNKNOWN LEADING ACTRESS.

THERE IS COMFORT IN THE FAMILIAR; A MOTHER’S REASSURING SMILE, THE
SOOTHING VOICE OF A PILOT BEFORE TAKEOFF AND LANDING, THE CONFIDENT
VOICE OF A DOCTOR BEFORE DELIVERING A PAINFUL SHOT OR THE CODIFIED LOOK
OF A LEADING ACTRESS.

THE AUDIENCE TAKES IMMENSE COMFORT IN THE FAMILIAR. THE UNFAMILIAR HAS
LIMITED APPEAL; IT UNDERMINES EXPECTATIONS. THUS, THE DREAM IS BROKEN,
THE ILLUSION SHATTERED.

RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON AND WITH A KNACK FOR TURNING A PHRASE INTO

COOKIE’S CLIPS, AND THE NETWORKS ARE FINALLY ON NOTICE.
