A virus, at heart, is information, a packet of data that benefits from
being shared.

The information at stake is genetic: instructions to make more
[virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/coronavirus-underlying-conditions.html).
Unlike a truly living organism, a
[virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/coronavirus-underlying-conditions.html)
cannot replicate on its own; it cannot move, grow, persist or
perpetuate. It needs a host. The viral code breaks into a living cell,
hijacks the genetic machinery and instructs it to produce new code — new
virus.

President Trump has characterized the response to the pandemic as a
“medical war,” and described the virus behind it as, by turns,
“genius,” a “hidden enemy” and “a monster.” It would be more accurate
to say that we find ourselves at odds with a microscopic photocopy
machine. Not even that: an assembly manual for a photocopier, model
SARS-CoV-2.

For at least six months now, the virus has replicated among us. The toll
has been devastating. Officially, more than six million people worldwide
have been infected so far, and 370,000 have died. (The actual numbers
are certainly higher.) The United States, which has seen the largest
share of cases and casualties, recently surpassed 100,000 deaths,
one-fourth the number of all Americans who died in World War II.
Businesses are shuttered — in 10 weeks, some 40 million Americans have
lost their jobs — and [food banks are
overrun](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-food-banks.html).
The virus has fueled widespread frustration and exposed our deepest
faults: of color, class and privilege, between the deliverers and the
delivered to.

Still, summer — summer\! — has all but arrived. We step out to look,
breathe, vent. The pause is illusory. Cases are falling in New York, the
epicenter in the United States, but [firmly
rising](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-markets&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu#states)
in Wisconsin, Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, North and South Carolina, and
other states. China, where the pandemic originated, and South Korea saw
recent resurgences. Health officials fear another major wave of
infections in the fall, and [a possible wave train
beyond](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-pandemic-curve-scenarios.html).

“We are really early in this disease,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of
the Harvard Global Health Institute, [told The Times
recently](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/world/asia/coronavirus-spread-where-why.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20200504&instance_id=18202&nl=the-morning&regi_id=102543212&segment_id=26556&te=1&user_id=11229ce0c34ff5caaf09af6410292613).
“If this were a baseball game, it would be the second inning.”

There may be [trillions of species of
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/science/viruses-coranavirus-biology.html)
in the world. They infect bacteria, mostly, but also abalone,
[bats](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html),
beans, beetles, blackberries, cassavas, cats, dogs, hermit crabs,
mosquitoes, potatoes, pangolins, ticks and the Tasmanian devil. They
give birds cancer and turn bananas black. Of the trillions, a few
hundred thousand kinds of viruses are known, and fewer than 7,000 have
names. Only about 250, including SARS-CoV-2, have the mechanics to
infect us.

In our information age, we have grown familiar with computer viruses and
with memes going viral; now here is the real thing to remind us what the
metaphor means. A mere wisp of data has grounded more than half of the
world’s commercial airplanes, sharply reduced global carbon emissions
and doubled the stock price of Zoom. It has infiltrated our language —
“social distancing,” “immunocompromised shoppers” — and our
[dreams](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/style/why-weird-dreams-coronavirus.html).
It has postponed sports, political conventions, and the premieres of the
next Spider-Man, Black Widow, Wonder Woman and James Bond films. Because
of the virus, the U.S. Supreme Court renders rulings by telephone, and
[wild
boars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/arts/coronavirus-nature-genre.html)
roam the empty streets of Barcelona.

It also has prompted a collaborative response unlike any our species has
seen. Teams of scientists, [working across national
boundaries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/world/europe/coronavirus-science-research-cooperation.html),
are racing to understand the virus’s weaknesses, develop treatments and
vaccine candidates, and to accurately forecast its next moves. Medical
workers are risking their lives to tend to the sick. Those of us at home
do what we can: share instructions for how to make a surgical mask from
a pillowcase; sing and cheer from windows and doorsteps; send
condolences; offer hope.

“We’re mounting a reaction against the virus that is truly
unprecedented,” said Dr. Melanie Ott, director of the Gladstone
Institute of Virology in San Francisco.

So far the match is deadlocked. We gather, analyze, disseminate, probe:
What is this thing? What must be done? When can life return to normal?
And we hide, while the latest iteration of an ancient biochemical cipher
ticks on, advancing itself at our expense.

## A fearsome envelope

Who knows when viruses first came about. Perhaps, as one theory holds,
they began as free-living microbes that, through natural selection, were
stripped down and became parasites. Maybe they began as genetic cogs
within microbes, then gained the ability to venture out and invade other
cells. Or maybe viruses came first, shuttling and replicating in the
primordial protein soup, gaining shades of complexity — enzymes, outer
membranes — that gave rise to cells and, eventually, us. They are sacks
of code — double- or single-stranded, DNA or RNA — and sometimes called
capsid-encoding organisms, or C.E.O.s

As viruses go, SARS-CoV-2 is big — its genome is more than twice the
size of that of the average flu virus and about one-half larger than
Ebola’s. But it is still tiny: 10,000 times smaller than a millimeter,
barely one-thousandth the width of a human hair, smaller even than the
wavelength of light from a germicidal lamp. If a person were the size of
Earth, the virus would be the size of a person. Picture a human lung
cell as a cramped office just big enough for a desk, a chair and a copy
machine. SARS-CoV-2 is an oily envelope stuck to the door.

It was [formally
identified](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html)
on Jan. 7 by scientists in China. For weeks beforehand, a mysterious
respiratory ailment had been circulating in the city of Wuhan. Health
officials were worried that it might be a reappearance of severe acute
respiratory syndrome, or SARS, an alarming viral illness that emerged
abruptly in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800
in the next several months, then was quarantined into oblivion.

The scientists had gathered fluid samples from three patients and, with
nucleic-acid extractors and other tools, compared the genome of the
pathogen with that of known ones. A transmission electron microscope
[revealed the
culprit](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017):
spherical, with “quite distinctive spikes” reminiscent of a crown or the
corona of the sun. It was a coronavirus, and a novel
one.

Once upon a time, our pathogens were crudely named: Spanish flu, Asian
flu, yellow fever, Black Death. Now we have H1N1, MERS (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome), H.I.V. — strings of letters as streamlined as the
viruses themselves, codes for codes. The new coronavirus was temporarily
named
[2019-nCoV](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200130-sitrep-10-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=d0b2e480_2).
On Feb. 11, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
officially renamed it SARS-CoV-2, to indicate that it was very closely
related to the SARS virus, another
coronavirus.

Before the emergence of the original SARS, the study of coronaviruses
was a professional backwater. “There has been such a deluge of attention
on we coronavirologists,” said Susan R. Weiss, a virologist at the
University of Pennsylvania. “It is quite in contrast to previously being
mostly ignored.”

There are hundreds of kinds of coronaviruses. Two of them, SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, can be deadly; four cause one-third of common colds. Many
infect animals with which humans associate, including camels, cats,
chickens, and bats. All are RNA viruses. Our coronavirus, like the
others, is a string of roughly 30,000 biochemical building blocks called
nucleotides enclosed in a membrane of both protein and lipid.

“I’ve always been impressed by coronaviruses,” said Anthony Fehr, a
virologist at Kansas University. “They are extremely complex in the way
that they get around and start to take over a cell. They make more genes
and more proteins than most other RNA viruses, which gives them more
options to shut down the host cell.”

The core code of SARS-CoV-2 contains genes for [as many as 29
proteins](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html?searchResultPosition=1):
the instructions to replicate the code. One protein, S, provides the
spikes on the surface of the virus and unlocks the door to the target
cell. The others, on entry, separate and attend to their tasks: turning
off the cell’s alarm system; commandeering the copier to make new viral
proteins; folding viral envelopes, and helping new viruses bubble out of
the cell by the thousands.

“I usually picture it as an entity that comes into the cell and then it
falls apart,” Dr. Ott said. “It has to fall apart to build some
mini-factories in the cell to reproduce itself, and has to come together
as an entity at the end to infect other cells.”

For medical researchers, these proteins are key to understanding why the
virus is so successful, and how it might be neutralized. For instance,
to break into a cell, the S protein binds to a receptor called
angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2, like a hand on a doorknob. The
S protein on this coronavirus is nearly identical in structure to the
one in the first SARS — “SARS Classic” — but some data suggests that it
binds to the target enzyme far more strongly. Some researchers think
this may partly explain why the new virus infects humans so efficiently.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Every pathogen evolves along a path between impact and stealth. Too mild
and the illness does not spread from person to person; too visible and
the carrier, unwell and aware, stays home or is avoided — and the
illness does not spread. “SARS infected 8,000 people, and was contained
quickly, in part because it didn’t spread before symptoms appeared,” Dr.
Weiss noted.

By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have achieved an admirable balance.
“No aspect of the virus is extraordinary,” said Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a
computational geneticist at the Broad Institute who helped sequence the
Ebola virus in 2014. “It’s the combination of things that makes it
extraordinary.”

SARS Classic settled quickly into human lung cells, causing a person to
cough but also announcing its presence. In contrast, its successor tends
to colonize first the nose and throat, sometimes causing few initial
symptoms. Some cells there are thought to be rich in the surface enzyme
ACE2 — the doorknob that SARS-CoV-2 turns so readily. The virus
replicates quietly, and quietly spreads: One study found that a person
carrying SARS-CoV-2 is most contagious two to three days before they are
aware that they might be ill.

From there, the virus can move into the lungs. The delicate alveoli,
which gather oxygen essential to the body, become inflamed and struggle
to do their job. The texture of the lungs turns from airy froth to gummy
marshmallow. The patient may develop pneumonia; some, drowning
internally and desperate for oxygen, go into acute respiratory distress
and require a ventilator.

The virus can settle in still further: damaging the muscular walls of
the heart; attacking the lining of the blood vessels and generating
clots; inducing strokes, seizures and inflammation of the brain; and
damaging the kidneys. Often the greatest damage is inflicted not by the
virus but by the body’s attempt to fight it off with a dangerous
“cytokine storm”[of immune system
molecules](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html).

The result is an illness with a perplexing array of faces. A dry cough
and a low fever at the outset, sometimes. Shortness of breath or
difficulty breathing, sometimes. Maybe you lose your sense of smell or
taste. Maybe your toes become [red and
inflamed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html),
as if you had frostbite. For some patients it feels like [a heart
attack](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-updates-COVID-19-Bay-Area-deaths-cases-15225947.phphttps://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-updates-COVID-19-Bay-Area-deaths-cases-15225947.php),
or it causes delusion or disorientation.

Often it feels like nothing at all; according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, [35
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.htmlhttps://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html)
of people who contract the virus experience few to no symptoms, although
they can continue to spread it. “The virus acts like no pathogen
humanity has ever seen,” the journal Science [recently
noted](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/how-does-coronavirus-kill-clinicians-trace-ferocious-rampage-through-body-brain-toes).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More to the point, the pathogen has gone largely unseen. “It has these
perfect properties to spread throughout the entire human population,”
Dr. Fehr said. “If we didn’t know what a virus was” — and didn’t take
proper precautions — “this virus would infect virtually every human on
the planet. It still might do that.”

## Data vs. data

On Jan. 10, the Wuhan health commission in China reported that in the
previous weeks, 41 people had contracted the illness caused by the
coronavirus, and that one had died — the first known casualty at the
time.

That same day, Chinese scientists publicly released the complete genome
of the virus. The blueprint, which could be simulated and synthesized in
the lab, was almost as good as a physical sample, and easier for
researchers worldwide to obtain. Analyses appeared in journals and on
preprint servers like bioRxiv, on sites like
[nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org/) and
[virological.org](http://virological.org/): clues to the virus’s origin,
its errors and its weaknesses. From then on, the new coronavirus began
to replicate not only physically in human cells but also figuratively,
and likely to its own detriment, in the human mind.

Dr. Ott entered medicine in the 1980s, when AIDS was still new and
terrifyingly unknown. “Compare that time to today, there are a lot of
similarities,” she said. “A new virus, a rush to understand, a rush to a
cure or a vaccine. What’s fundamentally different now is that we have
generated this community of collaboration and data-sharing. It’s really
mind-blowing.”

Three hours after the virus’s code was published, Inovio
Pharmaceuticals, based in San Diego, [began
work](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/new-tech-could-make-corona)
on a vaccine against it — one of more than 100 such efforts now underway
around the world. Dr. Sabeti’s lab quickly got to work developing
diagnostic tests. Dr. Ott and Dr. Weiss soon managed to obtain samples
of live virus, which allowed them to “actually look at what’s going on”
when it infects cells in the lab, Dr. Ott said.

“The cell is mounting a profound battle to prevent the virus from
entering or, on entering, to alarm everyone around it so it can’t
spread,” she said. “The virus’s intent is to overcome this initial surge
of defense, to set up shop long enough to reproduce itself and to
spread.”

With so many proteins in its tool kit, the virus has many ways to
counter our immune system; these also offer targets for [potential
vaccines and
drugs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html).
Researchers are working every angle. Most vaccine efforts are focused on
disrupting the spike proteins, which allow entry into the cell. The drug
remdesivir targets the virus’s replication machinery. Dr. Fehr studies
how the virus disables our immune system.

“I use the analogy of Star Wars,” he said. “The virus is the Dark Side.
We have a cellular defense system of hundreds of antiviral proteins” —
Jedi knights — “to defend ourselves. Our lab is studying one specific
Jedi that uses one particular weapon, and how the virus fights back.”

These battles, fought on the field of biochemistry, strain the alphabet
to describe. The Jedi in this analogy are particular enzymes
(poly-ADP-ribose polymerases, or PARPS, if you must know) that are
produced in infected cells and wield a molecule that attaches to certain
invading proteins — “we don’t know what these are yet,” Dr. Fehr said —
and disrupts them. In response, the virus has an enzyme of its own that
sweeps away our Jedi like dust from a sandcrawler.

Carolyn Machamer, a cell biologist at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine, is studying the later stages of the process, to learn how the
virus manages to navigate and assemble itself within a host cell and
depart it. Among the [research
topics](https://cellbio.jhmi.edu/people/faculty/carolyn-machamer-phd)
listed on her university webpage are coronaviruses but also
“intracellular protein trafficking” and “exocytosis of large
cargo.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

On entering the cell, components of the virus set up shop in a
subregion, or organelle, called the Golgi complex, which resembles a
stack of pancakes and serves as the cell’s mail-sorting center. Dr.
Machamer has been working to understand how the virus commandeers the
unit to route all the newly replicated viral bits, scattered throughout
the cell, for final assembly.

The subject was “poorly studied,” she conceded. Most drug research has
focused on the early stages, like blocking infection at the very outset
or disrupting replication inside the cell. “Like I said, it hasn’t
gotten a whole lot of attention,” she said. “But I think it will now,
because I think we have some really interesting targets that could
possibly yield new types of drugs.”

The line of inquiry dates back to her postdoctoral days. She was
studying the Golgi complex — “the organelle is really bizarre” — even
then. “It’s following what you’re interested in, that’s what basic
science is about. It’s, like, you don’t actually set out to cure the
world or anything, but you follow your nose.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For all the attention the virus has received, it is still new to science
and rich in unknowns. “I’m still very focused on the question, How does
the virus get into the body?” Dr. Ott said. “Which cells does it infect
in the upper airway? How does it get into the lower airway, and from
there to other organs? It’s absolutely not clear what the path is, or
what the vulnerable path types are.

And most pressing: Why are so many of us asymptomatic? “How does the
virus manage to do this without leaving traces in some people, but in
others there’s a giant reaction?” she said. “That’s the biggest question
currently, and the most urgent.”

## Mistakes are made

Even a photocopier is imperfect, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. When
the virus commandeers a host cell to copy itself, invariably mistakes
are made, an incorrect nucleotide swapped for the right one, for
instance. In theory, such mutations, or an accumulation of them, could
make a virus more infectious or deadly, or less so, but in the vast
majority of cases, they do not affect a virus’s performance.

What’s important to note is that the process is random and incessant.
Humans describe the contest between host and virus as a war, but the
virus is not at war. Our enemy has no agency; it does not develop
“strategies” for escaping our medicines or the activity of our immune
systems.

Unlike some viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a proofreading protein — NSP14 —
that clips out mistakes. Even still, errors slip through. The virus
acquires [two mutations a
month](https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/), on average,
which is [less than half the error rate of the
flu](https://jvi.asm.org/content/84/19/9733) — and increases the
possibility that a vaccine or drug treatment, once developed, will not
be quickly outdated. “So far it’s been relatively faithful,” Dr. Ott
said. “That’s good for us.”

By March, [at least 1,388](http://www.graphen.ai/covid.html) variants of
the coronavirus had been detected around the world, all functionally
identical as far as scientists could tell. Arrayed as an ancestral tree,
these lineages reveal where and when the virus spread. For instance, the
first confirmed case of Covid-19 in New York was announced on March 1,
but an analysis of samples [revealed
that](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.htmlhttps://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html)
the virus had begun to circulate in the region weeks earlier. Unlike
early cases on the West Coast, which were seeded by people arriving from
China, these cases were seeded [from
Europe](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-04-17?n=5),
and in turn [seeded cases throughout much of the
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html).

The roots can be traced back still further. The first known patient was
hospitalized in Wuhan on Dec. 16, 2019, and first felt ill on Dec. 1;
the first infection would have occurred still earlier. Sometime before
that the virus, or its progenitor, was in a bat — the genome is 96
percent similar to a bat virus. How long ago it made that jump, and
acquired the mutations necessary to do so, is unclear. In any case, and
contrary to [certain conspiracy
theories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html),
SARS-CoV-2 was not engineered in a
laboratory.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Those scenarios are so unlikely as to be impossible,” said Dr. Robert
Garry, a microbiologist at Tulane University and an expert on emerging
diseases. In March, a team of researchers including Dr. Garry published
[a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/S41591-020-0820-9) in Nature
Medicine comparing the genome and protein structures of the novel virus
to those of other coronaviruses. The novel distinctions were “most
likely the result of natural selection,” they concluded. “Our analyses
clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a
purposefully manipulated virus.”

In our species, the virus has found prime habitat. It seems to do most
of its replicating in the upper respiratory tract, Dr. Garry noted:
“That makes it easier to spread with your voice, so there may be more
opportunities for it to spread casually, and perhaps earlier in the
course of the disease.”

And there we have it: an organism, or whatever the right word is,
ideally adapted to human conversation, the louder the better. Our
communication is its transmission. Consider where so many outbreaks have
begun: funerals, parties, call centers, sports arenas, meatpacking
plants, dorm rooms, cruise ships, prisons. In February, a [medical
conference in
Boston](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/12/us/coronavirus-biogen-boston-superspreader.html)
led to more than 70 cases in two weeks. In Arkansas, several cases were
linked to “a high school swim party that I’m sure everybody thought was
harmless,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. After a choir rehearsal in Mount
Vernon, Wash., 28 members of the choir fell ill. Not even song is safe
anymore.

The virus has no trouble finding us. But we are still struggling to find
it; a recent model by epidemiologists at Columbia University estimated
that for every documented infection in the United States, 12 more go
undetected. Who has it, or had it, and who does not? A firm grasp of the
virus’s whereabouts — using diagnostic tests, antibody tests and contact
tracing — is essential to our bid to return normal life. But humanity’s
immune response has been uneven.

In late May, in an open letter, a group of former White House science
advisers warned that, to prepare for an anticipated resurgence of the
pandemic later this year, the federal government needed to begin
preparing immediately to avoid the “extraordinary shortage of supplies”
that occurred this spring.

“The virus is here, it’s everywhere,” Dr. Rick Bright, the former
director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority,
[told the U.S.
Senate](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-rick-bright-testimony-transcript-vaccine-expert-whistleblower-ousted-by-trump-testifies)
in mid-May. “We need to unleash the voices of the scientists in our
public health system in the United States, so they can be heard.” Right
now, he added, “There is no master coordinated plan on how to respond to
this outbreak.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

SARS-CoV-2 virus has no plan. It doesn’t need one; absent a vaccine, the
virus is here to stay. “This is a pretty efficient pathogen,” Dr. Garry
said. “It’s very good at what it does.”

## The next wave

“The virus spreads because of an intrinsic, latent quality in the
culture,” the media theorist Douglas Rushkoff, who two decades ago
coined the phrase “going viral,” [wrote
recently](https://rushkoff.com/digital-trends-trump-media-virus/). “Both
biological and media viruses say less about themselves than they do
about their hosts.”

To know SARS-CoV-2 is to know ourselves in reflection. It is mechanical,
unreflecting, consistently on-message — the purest near-living
expression of data management to be found on Earth. It is, and does, and
is more. There is no “I” in a virus.

We are exactly its opposite: human, and everything that implies. Masters
of information, suckers for misinformation; slaves to emotion, ego and
wishful thinking. But also: inquiring, willful, optimistic. In our best
moments, we strive to learn, and to advance more than our individual
selves.

“The best thing to come out of this pandemic is that everyone has become
a virologist in some way,” Dr. Ott said. She has a regular trivia night
with her family in Germany, over Zoom. Lately, the topic has centered on
viruses, and she has been impressed by how much they know. “There’s so
much more knowledge around,” she said. “A lot of wrong info around,
also. But people have become so literate, because we all want it to go
away.”

Dr. Sabeti agreed, up to a point. She expressed a deep curiosity about
viruses — they are “formidable opponents to understand” — but said that,
this time around, she found herself less interested in the purely
intellectual pursuit.

“For me right now, the place that I’m in, I really just most want to
stop this virus,” she said. “It’s so frustrating and disappointing, to
say the least, to be in this position in which we have stopped the
world, in which we’ve created social distancing, in which we have
created mass amounts of human devastation and collateral damage because
we just weren’t prepared.

“I don’t care to understand it,” she said. “For me, it’s. … I get up in
the morning and my motivation is just: Stop this thing, and figure out
how to never have this happen again.”
