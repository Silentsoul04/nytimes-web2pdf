Dish towels have never seemed so important or ubiquitous as they have
during these weeks of lockdown. But they are even more multipurpose than
you might expect, or so say Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte. The
sisters are known for their imagination and ability to find beauty in
unexpected places.

``We are all stuck at home, but even if you are just hauling laundry
from one room to another, it makes you feel better to be able to put
stuff away in something that cheers you up,'' Laura Mulleavy said. ``We
have so many dish towels around and are always in need of reusable totes
that we can also use as storage.''

So they decided to make one out of a dish towel and some costume
jewelry. Here's how you can, too.

Image

\textbf{Your tool kit:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  One cotton or linen dish towel, approximately 20 by 27 inches. Ideally
  striped (it will make the project easier), but any pattern will do.
\item
  Two costume jewelry necklaces, like the plastic beaded kind that are
  handed out at Mardi Gras, or one chain-link plastic necklace.
\item
  One thick ribbon
\item
  Sewing machine with cotton-poly thread or, if you are sewing by hand,
  a tapestry needle and embroidery thread.
\item
  Straightedge ruler
\item
  Scissors
\end{itemize}

Image

STEP 1

Fold your chosen dish towel in half so that the inside is on the
outside.

Image

STEP 2

Create a bottom. At the fold, measure two inches on each side,
vertically. Mark and draw a line from one dot to the other. Then flatten
the lower part of the folded towel so that it makes a T-shape
perpendicular to the body, four inches across. This will become the
``bottom'' of the tote.

Image

STEP 3

Sew each side of the flattened part together with a straight stitch half
an inch from each edge so that the sides of the T are closed. This will
form a V-shaped notch at the bottom of the towel. If looked at from the
side, it will resemble a Y.

Image

STEP 4

Sew each side together with a straight stitch, vertically from the
bottom of the V to the upper end of the folded towel. Invert the bag and
press the bottom open to make a floor.

Image

STEP 5

Make the sides. Measure a quarter of an inch from each side seam and
straight stitch vertically from the top around the bottom and up the
other side to create a soft rectangular side that will turn the sac into
a box shape.

Image

STEP 6

Fold each necklace in half.

Image

STEP 7

Cut a ribbon in four pieces, each piece four inches long. Loop each
ribbon through each of the four ends in the two lengths of necklace,
bringing the ends of the ribbon together.

Image

STEP 8

Measure to the center of the upper, open rim of the bag. Then measure
three and a half inches from there in either direction and mark those
spots. That is where the loops, or the two ends of the handles, will go.

Image

STEP 9

Secure the loops to the bag at two stitch points, the upper one
one-eighth of an inch from the top edge of the bag, the lower one
one-eighth of an inch from the bottom of the loop ribbon.

Image

STEP 10

Put bag over your arm and go!
