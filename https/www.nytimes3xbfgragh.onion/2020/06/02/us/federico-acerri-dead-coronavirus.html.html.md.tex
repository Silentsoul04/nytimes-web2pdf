\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Before there was Google there was Federico Acerri. As an information
specialist in the Michigan school system, where he worked for decades,
he took on every imaginable query from staff members and students,
culling dictionaries, microfilm and databases to find an answer. He was
also a prolific artist, drawing under the name Mad Monk.

Mr. Acerri died of complications of the new coronavirus on April 12 at
the Ascension St. John Hospital in Detroit, his sister, Mary Ann
Tschiggfrey, said. He was 81.

Federico Urbano Acerri, who was known as Fred, was born on July 20,
1938, in Detroit. His father, Raniero, an Italian immigrant, worked for
the city electric utility; his mother, Stella (Bonacci) Acerri, was a
homemaker. He graduated from Nativity High School, where he was a star
lineman on the football team.

After graduating from Wayne State University in Detroit the late 1950s,
Mr. Acerri served in the Air Force and was stationed on the island of
Guam, where his duties included unloading containers of Agent Orange.

``I remember the F.B.I. coming to talk to my parents,'' Ms. Tschiggfrey
said. ``Fred typed up a lot of secret things back then.''

After obtaining a master's degree in library sciences from Wayne State,
Mr. Acerri began a career in research, at both the university and for
the Wayne County Intermediate School District. He was surrounded by
books and documents in all forms, which he used to track down
information that others had failed to find.

``People would call with all kinds of crazy questions, like, `How long
does it take baby chicks to hatch?''' Ms. Tschiggfrey said. ``He was
known as the answer man.''

When he retired in 2003 and moved to an assisted living facility several
years ago, she added, there were 10,000 books to be dealt with.

When he wasn't the answer man, Mr. Acerri was Mad Monk. He made hundreds
of rustic line drawings that were displayed at Wayne State, in small
galleries near Detroit and at Maxwell Studios in Baltimore. His
photograph of Andy Warhol from the 1960s at a bookstore in Detroit is in
the permanent collection of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.

``I think it was an evolutionary process that just grew a little at a
time,'' said a cousin, Doug Nemanic. Mr. Acerri gravitated toward
cartoons and superheroes and figures from the Old West, sketching
wherever he went, including in prayer books and on restaurant table
cloths. ``He felt the Mad Monk was able to say things that he
couldn't,'' Mr. Nemanic said.

At the end, the nurses at the hospital held the phone to Mr. Acerri as
Ms. Tschiggfrey read a list of names of friends and acquaintances. ``I
wanted to make sure he knew we all loved him,'' she said.
