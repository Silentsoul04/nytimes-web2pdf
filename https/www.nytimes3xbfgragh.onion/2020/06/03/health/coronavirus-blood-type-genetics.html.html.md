Why do some people infected with the coronavirus suffer only mild
symptoms, while others become deathly ill?

Geneticists have been [scouring our DNA for
clues](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/coronavirus-neanderthals.html).
Now, a study by European scientists is the first to document a strong
statistical link between [genetic variations and
Covid-19](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20114991v1),
the illness caused by the coronavirus.

Variations at two spots in the human genome are associated with an
increased risk of respiratory failure in patients with
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/coronavirus-underlying-conditions.html),
the researchers found. One of these spots includes the gene that
determines blood types.

Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the
likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a
ventilator, according to the new study.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The study was equally striking for the genes that failed to turn up. The
coronavirus attaches to a protein called ACE2 on the surface of human
cells in order to enter them, for example. But genetic variants in ACE2
did not appear to make a difference in the risk of severe Covid-19.

The findings suggest that relatively unexplored factors may be playing a
large role in who develops life-threatening Covid-19. “There are new
kids on the block now,” said Andre Franke, a molecular geneticist at the
University of Kiel in Germany and a co-author of the new study, which is
currently going through peer review.

Scientists have already determined that factors like age and underlying
disease put people at extra risk of developing a severe case of
Covid-19. But geneticists are hoping that a DNA test might help identify
patients who will need aggressive
treatment.

Figuring out the reason that certain genes may raise the odds of severe
disease could also lead to new targets for drug designers.

As the pandemic gained momentum in February, Dr. Franke and his
colleagues set up a collaboration with doctors in Spain and Italy who
were struggling with a rising wave of Covid-19.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The doctors took blood samples from 1,610 patients who needed an oxygen
supply or had to go on a ventilator. Dr. Franke and his colleagues
extracted DNA from the samples and scanned it using a rapid technique
called genotyping.

The researchers did not sequence all three billion genetic letters in
the genome of each patient. Instead, they looked at nine million
letters. Then the researchers carried out the same genetic survey on
2,205 blood donors with no evidence of Covid-19.

The scientists were looking for spots in the genome, called loci, where
an unusually high number of the severely ill patients shared the same
variants, compared with those who were not ill.

Two loci turned up. In one of these sites is the gene that determines
our blood type. That gene directs production of a protein that places
molecules on the surface of blood cells.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

It’s not the first time Type A blood has turned up as a possible risk.
Chinese scientists who examined patient blood types also found that
those with Type A were more likely to develop a serious case of
Covid-19.

No one knows why. While Dr. Franke was comforted by the support from the
Chinese study, he could only speculate how blood types might affect the
disease. “That is haunting me, quite honestly,” he said.

He also noted that the locus where the blood-type gene is situated also
contains a stretch of DNA that acts as an on-off switch for a gene
producing a protein that triggers strong immune responses.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The coronavirus triggers an overreaction of the immune system in some
people, leading to massive inflammation and lung damage — the so-called
cytokine storm. It is theoretically possible that genetic variations
influence that
response.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

A second locus, on Chromosome 3, shows an even stronger link to
Covid-19, Dr. Franke and his colleagues found. But that spot is home to
six genes, and it is not yet possible to say which of them influences
the course of Covid-19.

One of those gene candidates encodes a protein known to interact with
ACE2, the cellular receptor needed by the coronavirus to enter host
cells. But another gene nearby encodes a potent immune-signaling
molecule. It is possible that this immune gene also triggers an
overreaction that leads to respiratory failure.

Dr. Franke and his colleagues are part of an international effort called
the [Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://www.covid19hg.org/).

A thousand researchers in 46 countries are collecting DNA samples from
people with the disease. They are now beginning to post data on the
initiative’s website.

Andrea Ganna, a genetic epidemiologist at the University of Helsinki,
said that initiative’s collected data were beginning to point to a
single spot on Chromosome 3 as a potentially important player.

It’s not common for genetic variants to emerge out of studies of so few
people, said Jonathan Sebat, a geneticist at the University of
California, San Diego, who was not involved in the new study.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We were all hoping optimistically this was one of those situations,”
Dr. Sebat said.

Previous attempts to find any genetic loci that varied significantly
between sick people and healthy ones have failed. Dr. Sebat speculated
that the new study succeeded because the researchers focused only on
people who had respiratory failure and were clearly vulnerable to
serious forms of Covid-19.

“They had the ideal cohort,” he said.

New studies, such as the one Dr. Sebat is running in California, will
allow scientists to see if the two loci really do matter as much as they
seem to now.

The geneticists may be able to zero in on exactly which gene in each
locus affects the disease, he said. And researchers will most likely
find many other genes with subtler influences on the course of Covid-19.
