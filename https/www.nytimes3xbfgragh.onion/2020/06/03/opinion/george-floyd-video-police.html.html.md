<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A chilling word keeps coming to mind this week, like a scratched-up
record stuck on a lazy loop in my tweet-addled brain. *Impunity*.

If you can bear it, watch one of the videos of [George
Floyd’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/us/politics/george-floyd-witness-maurice-lester-hall.html)
death last week at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department. Focus
on the eyes of Derek Chauvin, the officer who has been charged with
murder and manslaughter for pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for a
torturous eight minutes and 46 seconds.

At several points, Chauvin makes smirking eye contact with the camera.
He even halfheartedly reaches for what looks like pepper spray when the
phone-wielding bystanders get a bit rowdy in their insistence that Floyd
is dying before their eyes. But the presence of the bystanders doesn’t
stop him; it’s almost as if Chauvin knows nothing can touch him.
*Impunity* is the only word I can think of for it.

Keep a close eye, too, on Tou Thao, Chauvin’s partner, who engages with
the crowd in the manner of a security guard at an amusement park. As
Chauvin pins Floyd down, Thao is almost polite in his colloquy with the
people recording the scene. It’s as if he knows he’s going to be all
over social media later, so he’s going to play it cool.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’ve watched the Floyd videos at least a dozen times, and every time,
it’s Thao’s composure that stiffens the hairs on the back of my neck.
Thao comes off as completely unashamed of the misconduct he
[witnesses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/us/politics/george-floyd-witness-maurice-lester-hall.html)
and, with his silence, encourages, in full public view.

Cameras were supposed to eliminate this sort of horror. Here, they
hardly make it better.

Ever since [the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles
in 1991](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1991/03/07/us/tape-of-beating-by-police-revives-charges-of-racism.html),
America has been flooded with videos — captured by bystanders and by law
enforcement officers on dashboard and body cams — that have highlighted
the routine abuse and killing of unarmed black people at the hands of
the police.

As these cameras have become ubiquitous, we have gotten a better picture
of the scale of the horror. At times, as in [the death of Eric Garner on
Staten Island
in 2014](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video),
bystanders have managed to capture the precise moment at which police
misconduct becomes fatal.

Yet in the Garner video, the police try to push the camera away. The
cops seemed at least embarrassed by it.

What’s particularly nauseating about the Floyd videos is that the
officers know they’re being watched, yet they are not deterred and don’t
even seem bothered by the cameras. A similar shamelessness was on
display in the innumerable
[clips](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/31/21276044/police-violence-protest-george-floyd)
showing police officers brazenly assaulting protesters and journalists
during protests this weekend.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As I scrolled through [endless collections of
these](https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/1267290935198486529?s=20)
online, I found it hard to escape the conclusion that America’s police
forces are not just unfairly brutal — they also do not seem to care
anymore about being caught on tape.

While videos have catalyzed protest movements like Black Lives Matter,
documenting police misconduct in America has had little effect in
reducing it.

Not long ago, many reformers saw video as a key way to improve policing.
In 2014, after the killing of Michael Brown by the police in Ferguson,
Mo., the Obama administration allocated funds to help police departments
purchase tens of thousands of body cameras. Even some civil liberties
groups [endorsed the
idea](https://www.aclu.org/other/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all?redirect=technology-and-liberty/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all#control%22%3E%20position%20paper%20%3C/a%3Esupporting%20the%20use%20of%20bodycams%20by%20police.).

The theory was simple: If there were bad cops on the force, body cams
would root them out and make it easier to prosecute them.

But it hasn’t worked out that way. One major study of body cameras in
American policing, which [followed more than 2,000 officers in
Washington,
D.C.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1), [found
that the cameras did little to alter police
behavior](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/20/upshot/a-big-test-of-police-body-cameras-defies-expectations.html).
Officers equipped with cameras used force and faced complaints from
civilians at rates similar to those for officers who didn’t have
cameras.

What’s more, in [several high-profile
cases](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/21/15983842/police-body-cameras-failures),
jurors were reluctant to convict, even with eyewitness and body-cam
videos capturing wrongdoing. In 2015, Michael Slager, a police officer
in North Charleston, S.C., who had been caught on video shooting a black
man named Walter Scott multiple times in the back, was charged with
murder. The trial ended in a hung jury when a [lone juror declared
himself unable to
convict](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/jury-says-it-s-deadlocked-trial-officer-who-shot-walter-n691291).
(Slager later pleaded guilty to the federal crime of violating Scott’s
civil rights and was sentenced in 2017 to [20 years in
prison](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentence-walter-scott.html).)

One problem is that video is often open to interpretation — where
critics of the police see clear brutality, jurors who are inclined to
give police officers the benefit of the doubt may
[excuse](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html)
as sins actions in the heat of the moment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are also a hodgepodge of policies governing body cameras.
[Different states have different
rules](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/police-body-worn-camera-policies)
about when officers are supposed to turn them on and [who gets access to
the video when there are questions about officers’
conduct](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/release-of-police-body-cam-video-policies-varies-between-agencies/103-530783929).
In some cases, officers equipped with body cameras have conveniently
[neglected to turn them
on](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15985442/minneapolis-police-shooting-justine-damond-video).
On Monday, the mayor of Louisville, Ky., [fired the city’s police
chief](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-conrad-louisville-police-chief-fired-protest-shooting-death/)
after discovering that two officers involved in the fatal shooting of a
black business owner had not turned on their body cameras.

What happens when, time and again, law enforcement officers are recorded
brutalizing citizens but left unpunished? I worry that police violence
will become even more normalized, turning into a crude spectacle that
loses even the ability to shock. How else to explain the orgy of
violence on display this weekend? A small selection:

“The whole world is watching” is what American pundits might say to
China’s leaders when they round up Uighurs to send to re-education
camps, or to Vladimir Putin of Russia when he [banishes
dissidents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/24/world/europe/navalny-russia-putin.html)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The phrase applies to our country, too. The whole world is watching and
has been for decades. Yet little changes, because merely watching is not
nearly enough.
