Have you noticed how almost every other word out of Donald Trump’s mouth
lately seems to be some variation on “dominate?”

“If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time,” he told America’s
governors. “They’re going to run all over you. You’ll look like a bunch
of jerks.”

This, of course, was in that [telephone rant about
protesters](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/wh-governors-call-protests/index.html).
There is something about crowds of people willing to take to the streets
to denounce racism that seems to make the president feel, um, unmanly.

“I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he told the country during
his visit to the space launch.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Minneapolis authorities, he contended, were “weak and pathetic” until
events spiraled out of control and the National Guard moved in.
(“Domination … it’s a beautiful thing to watch.”)

Tweeting on the same subject, Trump reported: “Great job done by all.
Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great. (thank
you President Trump\!)”

Which pretty much sums up his week. And, I guess, his id.

The president’s most famous response to the protests was that assault on
demonstrators outside the White House, in which federal [troops cleared
the
area](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-st-johns-church-bible.html)
so that Trump could accomplish his important mission of standing in
front of a church and holding up a Bible. Critics felt that in the
pictures Trump looked as if he had never touched a Bible before in his
life. True cynics felt that it looked as if he had never touched a book,
period.

Anyhow, everything has been going great, by Trump’s interpretation. “And
we had no problem at all last night,” [he told Fox
Radio](https://radio.foxnews.com/2020/06/03/president-trump-on-the-brian-kilmeade-show/)
on Wednesday. “We had substantial dominant force and it — we have to
have a dominant force. Maybe it doesn’t sound good to say it but you
have to have a dominant force.”

Dependency on the d-word seems to be catching.

“We need to dominate the battlespace,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper told
the governors during that same rather lively presidential phone call.
Despite their mutual affection for the concept of domination, Esper has
been drifting away from the administration line. Lately he’s been trying
to reassure the nation that the president isn’t going to take it upon
himself to [send federal troops into cities
uninvited](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/03/insurrection-act-trump-history/),
even as Trump himself seems to feel it’s a pretty cool idea.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Esper has been serving as defense secretary for almost a year, which
makes him, in Trump terms, a long-running cabinet veteran. Given the way
the president treasures cabinet members who aren’t afraid to speak their
mind, insiders expressed confidence that he might well remain in the
administration for quite a few more … hours.

“As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper,” said the
White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, on Wednesday.

It’s certainly been a tough time for the cabineteers. Attorney General
William P. Barr is [getting the
blame](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barr-personally-ordered-removal-of-protesters-near-white-house-leading-to-use-of-force-against-largely-peaceful-crowd/2020/06/02/0ca2417c-a4d5-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html)
for all the messiest aspects of that Trump trip to the church. And
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been [fighting off
investigations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/us/politics/pompeo-inspector-general-steve-linick.html)
into whether he gets government employees to run his personal errands.

We are only bringing that last matter up because it provides a chance to
revisit [Trump’s defense of
Pompeo](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/498403-trump-on-pompeo-id-rather-have-him-working-than-doing-dishes-because)
— that it’s better to have him use federal funds to buy a home helper
than forcing him to “wash dishes because maybe his wife isn’t there.”
After all, if Pompeo wasn’t in the kitchen he might otherwise be “on the
phone with some world leader.”

Yeah, and one thing we do not have to worry about is Donald Trump doing
housework when Melania and all the help are out of town. What could be
more un-dominant?

The president’s super-favorite word came up in [his speech to the
nation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-39/)
this week, when he urged deployment of the national guard “in sufficient
numbers that we dominate the streets.” In passing, he also assured
Americans that they had no need to worry about “your Second Amendment
rights.” Have you noticed how often Trump throws the right to bear arms
into these conversations? It’s as if he’s worried that any time he tells
the country things are OK, he has to reassure them that won’t mean less
armaments.

Just recently, while he was unveiling a program to help support
agriculture during the coronavirus crisis, Trump assured visiting
Virginia farmers: “We’re going after Virginia with your crazy governor.
They want to take your Second Amendment away. You know that, right?
You’ll have nobody guarding your potatoes.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Signing a proclamation in honor of National Nurses Day, he bragged to
his guests about “saving your Second Amendment, which is under siege, by
the way.”

And on it goes. Trump has also fit the Second Amendment into Coronavirus
Task Force news conferences, a signing ceremony for a bill on veterans’
education, the celebration of a new trade agreement with Mexico and
Canada, and of course, the rallies back in the happy days when rallies
were his way of life.

Now, some people believe that when men go overboard with weaponry issues
it may be linked to insecurity about their sexuality. Certainly isn’t
always true, but here you’ve got a guy who talks compulsively both about
the Second Amendment and his need to dominate.

This could be a great protest theme. Fill the street with banners
saying, “Mr. President, we’re not really questioning your masculinity.”
Very positive message that’ll drive him completely nuts.
