WASHINGTON — Americans returning from China landed at U.S. airports by
the thousands in early February, potential carriers of a deadly
[virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/coronavirus-underlying-conditions.html)
who had been diverted to a handful of cities for screening by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Their arrival prompted a frantic scramble by local and state officials
to press the travelers to self-quarantine, and to monitor whether anyone
fell ill. It was one of the earliest tests of whether the public health
system in the United States could contain the contagion.

But the effort was frustrated **** as the C.D.C.’s decades-old
notification system delivered information collected at the airports that
was riddled with duplicative records, bad phone numbers and incomplete
addresses. For weeks, officials tried to track passengers using lists
sent by the C.D.C., scouring information about each flight in separate
spreadsheets.

“It was insane,” said Dr. Sharon Balter, a director at the Los Angeles
County Department of Public Health. When the system went offline in
mid-February, briefly halting the flow of passenger data, local
officials listened in disbelief on a conference call as the C.D.C.
responded to the possibility that infected travelers might slip away.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The flawed effort was an early revelation for some health departments,
whose confidence in the C.D.C. was shaken as it confronted the most
urgent public health emergency in its 74-year history — a pathogen that
has penetrated much of the nation, killing more than 100,000 people.

The C.D.C., long considered the world’s premier health agency, made
early testing mistakes that contributed to a cascade of problems that
persist today as the country tries to reopen. It failed to provide
timely counts of infections and deaths, hindered by aging technology and
a fractured public health reporting system. And it hesitated in
absorbing the lessons of other countries, including the perils of silent
carriers spreading the infection.

The agency struggled to calibrate its own imperative to be cautious and
the need to move fast as the coronavirus ravaged the country, according
to a review of thousands of emails and interviews with more than 100
state and federal officials, public health experts, C.D.C. employees and
medical workers. In communicating to the public, its leadership was
barely visible, its stream of guidance was often slow and its messages
were sometimes confusing, **** sowing mistrust.

“They let us down,” said Dr. Stephane Otmezguine, an anesthesiologist

Whitley, the top health official in Nevada, wrote to the C.D.C. director

Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois lashed out at the agency over testing,
saying that the government’s response would “go down in history as a
profound failure.”

“The C.D.C. is no longer the reliable go-to place,” said Dr. Ashish Jha,
the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.

Even as the virus tested the C.D.C.’s capacity to respond, the agency
and its director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, faced unprecedented challenges
from President Trump, who repeatedly wished away the pandemic. His
efforts to seize the spotlight from the public health agency reflected
the broader patterns of his erratic presidency: public condemnations on
Twitter, a tendency to dismiss findings from scientists, inconsistent
policy or decision-making and a suspicion that the “deep state” inside
the government is working to force him out of office.

Mr. Trump and his top aides have grown increasingly bitter about
perceived leaks from the C.D.C. they say were designed to embarrass the
president and to build support for decisions that ignore broader
concerns about the country’s vast social and economic dislocation. At
the same time, some at the C.D.C. have bristled at what they see as
pressure to bend evidence-based recommendations to help Mr. Trump’s
political standing.

Located in Atlanta, the C.D.C. is encharged with protecting the nation
against public health threats — from anthrax to obesity — and serving as
the unassailable source of information about fighting them. Given its
record and resources, the agency might have become the undisputed leader
in the global fight against the virus.

Instead, the C.D.C. made missteps that undermined America’s response.

“Here is an agency that has been waiting its entire existence for this
moment,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former associate commissioner at the
Food and Drug Administration who for years worked closely with the
C.D.C. “And then they flub it. It is very sad. That is what they were
set up to do.”

The agency’s allies say it is just one part of a vast network of state
and local health departments, hospitals, government agencies and
suppliers that were collectively unprepared for the speed, scope and
ferocity of the pandemic. They also point out that lawmakers have long
failed to adequately prioritize funding for the kind of crisis the
country now faces.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Amy Ray, an infectious disease specialist in Cleveland, said the
C.D.C. did not “get enough credit,” adding, “They are learning at the
same time the world is learning, by watching how this disease
manifests.”

The agency, which declined repeated requests for interviews with its top
officials, said in a statement: “C.D.C. is at the table as part of the
larger U.S. government response, providing the best, most current data
and scientific understanding we have.”

“It’s important to remember that this is a global emergency — and it’s
impacting the entire U.S.,” the agency said. “That means it requires an
all-of-government
response.”

## ‘Not Our Culture to Intervene’

In early March, Dr. Redfield [led Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html)
on a V.I.P. tour of the high-tech labs at the C.D.C.’s Atlanta
headquarters, standing off to the side as the president spoke.

Wearing a red “Keep America Great” cap, Mr. Trump [falsely
asserted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-tour-centers-disease-control-prevention-atlanta-ga/)
that “anybody that wants a test can get a test,” claimed he had a
“natural ability” for science and noted that he might hold campaign
rallies even as the virus spread.

“Thank you for your decisive leadership in helping us, you know, put
public health first,” Dr. Redfield told the president as they posed for
the cameras.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The moment underscored the challenge for the director and his agency. To
combat the virus, he would have to **** manage the mercurial demands of
the president who appointed him and the expectations of the career
scientists he leads.

The sensibilities could not be more different. At one point that month,
administration officials asked the agency to provide feedback on
possible logos — including “Make America Healthy Again” — for cloth face
masks they [hoped to
distribute](https://www.axios.com/hanes-face-masks-white-house-a09a360f-4d52-4c08-baee-4a85e1f6562f.html)
to millions of Americans. The plan fell through, but not before C.D.C.
leaders agreed to the request, according to one person familiar with the
discussions.

White House aides saw Dr. Redfield, 68, as an ally, but as the
coronavirus crisis intensified, his meandering manner in television
appearances and congressional hearings irritated a president drawn to
big personalities and assertive defenders of his administration.

[A former military
virologist](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-redfield/index.html)
who specialized in H.I.V., Dr. Redfield was Mr. Trump’s second choice
after his first C.D.C. director
[resigned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/31/health/cdc-brenda-fitzgerald-resigns.html).
He had no experience leading a government agency — though he had been
considered for jobs in previous Republican administrations — and often
told associates that he was happiest [treating
patients](http://www.ihv.org/media/SOM/Microsites/IHV/documents/Discovery-Newsletter/Discovery_Winter_2010.pdf)
in Africa or Haiti.

Dr. Robert C. Gallo, who founded the [Institute of Human
Virology](http://www.ihv.org/about/About-Dr-Robert-C-Gallo/) at the
University of Maryland School of Medicine with Dr. Redfield in 1996,
said he had warned him against taking the C.D.C. post, describing it as
“massive public health, lots of politics, lots of
pressure.”

The agency, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services
with 11,000 employees, cannot make policy, but it guides federal and
state public health systems and advises government leaders.

The C.D.C.’s most fabled experts are the disease detectives of its
[Epidemic Intelligence Service](https://www.cdc.gov/eis/index.html),
rapid responders who investigate outbreaks. But more broadly, according
to current and former employees and others who worked closely with the
agency, the C.D.C. is risk-averse, perfectionist and ill suited to
improvising in a quickly evolving crisis — particularly one that shuts
down the country and paralyzes the economy.

“It’s not our culture to intervene,” said Dr. George Schmid, who worked
at the agency off and on for nearly four decades. He described it as
increasingly bureaucratic, weighed down by “indescribable, burdensome
hierarchy.”

The exacting culture shaped its scientists’ ambitions; it also locked
some into a fixed way of thinking, former officials said. And it helped
produce the C.D.C.’s most consequential failure in the crisis: its
inability early on to provide state laboratories around the country with
an effective diagnostic test.

The C.D.C. quickly developed a successful test in January designed to be
highly precise, but it was more complicated to use and turned out to be
no better than versions produced overseas. And in manufacturing test
kits to send to the states, the C.D.C. [contaminated many of
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html)
through sloppy lab practices. That, along with the [administration’s
failure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html)
to quickly ramp up commercial and academic labs, delayed the rollout of
tests and limited their availability for months.

In late January, the agency sent epidemiologists to Seattle to help
local health officials learn whether what was then the country’s first
known patient — a [35-year-old
man](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191) who had
visited Wuhan, China — had infected
others.

[After an initial round of
tests](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933936-2020-01-23-SEA-TAC-CASE-Emails-from-the-Start-of.html),
the agency imposed restrictive testing standards. When doctors in
Washington State and elsewhere forwarded the names of about 650 people
in January who might have been infected — they had contact with a
confirmed patient, had been admitted to a hospital or had other risk
factors — the C.D.C. agreed to test only 256. That group consisted **
primarily of people traveling from Wuhan and their contacts.

In part because of capacity issues, the agency typically did not
recommend testing people without symptoms — even though Chinese doctors
were reporting that people could spread the virus without ever feeling
ill. Dr. Redfield mentioned the possibility of asymptomatic spread in a
CNN interview in February, but the C.D.C. did not emphasize such
transmission until late March.

In mid-February, C.D.C. officials announced plans for a national
surveillance effort — by testing samples from people with flulike
symptoms — to determine whether the virus was spreading undetected. The
effort was to begin in Seattle, New York and three other cities, but
after disagreements over how to proceed, it did not
[start](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933935-CDC-and-State-Health-Officials-Debate-Start-up.html).

Later that month, public health officials across the country were
increasingly concerned about visitors streaming into the United States
from South Korea, Japan, Italy and other European countries engulfed by
the virus.

On phone calls with the C.D.C., worried state officials kept asking:
“Are there plans to expand the travel monitoring?” The response,
according to a participant from New York, was always the same: “We’re
still actively considering that.”

Mr. Trump announced a European travel ban on March 11, a few days after
meeting with Dr. Redfield and others. But it was too late. **** Genomic
tracing [would later
show](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html)
that European travelers had brought the virus into New York as early as
mid-February; it multiplied there and elsewhere in the country. In
Seattle, a strain from China had struck nursing homes in late February.

“[If we were able to test
early](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933935-CDC-and-State-Health-Officials-Debate-Start-up.html#document/p31/a565892),
we would have recognized earlier” the scale of the outbreak, said Dr.
Jeffrey Duchin, the chief health officer in King County, Wash. “We would
have been able to put prevention measures in place earlier and had fewer
cases.”

Part of the C.D.C.’s start-up troubles, current and former employees
said, was that the group in charge of the response initially — [the
Division of Viral Diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/dvd.html) — is
smaller and has far less staff focused on contagious respiratory
diseases than the C.D.C.’s [Influenza
Division](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/flu.html), which eventually took a
more leading role. “They were very quickly overwhelmed by what they had
to do,” said Dr. Pierre Rollin, a virologist who left last year.

Now, [more than 3,000 C.D.C.
employees](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933940-CDC-STAFFING-INFO.html)
are aiding the coronavirus response, analyzing data, performing lab work
and deploying to cities where local health departments need help. ****
While other federal agencies are also involved — including the F.D.A.,
which has speeded the use of antibody tests; the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which has worked to get ventilators and other
supplies; and the National Institutes of Health, which has studied
vaccines and possible treatments — the C.D.C. is the reigning expert.

Even before the current crisis, Dr. Redfield had kept a low profile.
Some days he could be spotted in a corner of the cafeteria, sipping
coffee alone.

Although he is on the White House coronavirus task force, Dr. Redfield
found himself eclipsed by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s most famous
infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah Birx, an AIDS expert and
former C.D.C. physician.

Meanwhile, his bonds with some of his own staff have frayed. One
associate recounted him saying that the agency’s scientists had a
“myopic” view of their roles, and characterized his relationship with
his top deputy, Dr. Anne Schuchat, a career C.D.C. scientist deeply
respected in the agency, as growing strained.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He has not been in Atlanta recently, shuttling instead between his home
in Baltimore and the West Wing. One person familiar with his thinking
described Dr. Redfield as feeling “a little bit on an island.”

The C.D.C. still has many defenders who say it has done the best it
could battling a stealthy, previously unknown virus. “When they do
release something, it does what C.D.C. ought to do — retain the voice of
credibility,” said Dr. James A. Town, medical director of the intensive
care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. “Even if it’s coming
at a slower pace, which can be frustrating, I think they’re pretty
thoughtful and trying to make even-keeled investigations.”

Dr. Redfield declined to comment for this article. But in a recent
interview with The Hill, he said, “I would say C.D.C. has never been
stronger.”

In a briefing last week, he acknowledged that the nation must work to
improve its systems to track disease outbreaks, though he disputed that
the agency was somehow unable to detect when the coronavirus started to
spread in the United States. “We were never really blind to the
introduction of this virus,” he
said.

## The Data Pipeline

Inside Building 21, the C.D.C.’s gleaming 12-story headquarters, nothing
has been more critical than getting fast, accurate information on how
the virus is spreading, who is getting sick, how best to treat them and
how quickly the country can reopen.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

But that has proved difficult for the agency’s antiquated data systems,
many of which rely on information assembled by or shared with local
health officials through phone calls, faxes and thousands of
spreadsheets attached to emails. The data is not integrated,
comprehensive or robust enough, with some exceptions, to depend on in
real time.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C. could not produce accurate counts of how many people were
being tested, compile complete demographic information on confirmed
cases or even keep timely tallies of deaths.

The result is an agency that had blind spots at just the wrong moment,
limited in its ability to gather and process information about the
pathogen or share it with those who needed it most: front-line medical
workers, government health officials and policymakers.

“That specific, granular data has huge implications,” said Julie
Fischer, a professor of microbiology at Georgetown University who
studies community preparedness for emerging diseases. “We lost precious
time in decision-making and putting public health resources to use.”

When C.D.C. officials urged states to track travelers from China in
February for possible infection, the agency turned to a computer network
called Epi-X. It sent emails to state officials, [one at a
time](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933966-2020-02-Nevada-EpiX-Flight-Arrival-Emails-From-a.html),
for each arriving flight so they could download a list of targeted
passengers.

In California, state health officers received as many as 146
notification emails a day, forcing them to spend time forwarding them to
the appropriate local health departments. In some cases, the
information, collected for the C.D.C. by the Department of Homeland
Security, listed incorrect dates or times; in other cases, passenger
data was sent to the wrong state or came more than a week after the
travelers had entered the United States.

“We got crappy data,” said Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy health
secretary. “We would call them up and people would say, ‘Well, I was in
China, but that was three years ago.’”

On Feb. 11, Mr. Whitley, Nevada’s top health official, complained to Dr.
Redfield [in a
letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933944-2020-02-11-NEVADA-LETTER-to-CDC-DIRECTOR.html)
about “the breakdown” in “communication the states have received from
the C.D.C.” The agency had said three travelers from China could “go
along with their normal day-to-day business” — advice that conflicted
with the C.D.C.’s message to monitor such passengers and make sure they
were in self-quarantine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One week later, the C.D.C.’s Epi-X system stopped sending notices
entirely, even though flights kept coming. The agency had temporarily
shut the system down to “[improve data
quality,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933945-2020-02-28-CDC-to-States-Re-REVISIONS-to-EPI-X.html)”
it told state officials in an email.

The travel-monitoring program screened at least 268,000 passengers
through mid-April. A [C.D.C.
report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e4.htm) cited 14
Covid cases that were traced back to those passengers, but lapses and
errors in the data made that tally far from conclusive. The agency went
on to say that the program did not stop the disease from being
introduced to California, where incomplete information, high travel
volume and the possibility of asymptomatic spread made it ineffective.

Once coronavirus cases started developing in earnest in the United
States in March, federal and state officials began demanding information
to make key decisions. Among them: where to move ventilators from the
national stockpile and where to build temporary hospitals.

State and local officials were quickly overwhelmed trying to document
hospitals’ needs. Staff at the Los Angeles County Public Health
Department, for example, called each of the 94 county hospitals in the
early weeks of the outbreak, asking nurses how many coronavirus patients
were in intensive care units and how many were on ventilators.

The C.D.C. tried to repurpose one of its data systems to collect the
information directly from hospitals, but it had significant gaps.
Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services in April also
enlisted a private contractor, [TeleTracking
Technologies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/us/politics/teletracking-technologies-coronavirus-senators.html),
only to have hospitals struggle to log on to the system.

Hospital executives resorted **** to finding aid themselves. Scott
Malaney, head of Blanchard Valley Health System in Ohio, got a phone
call from an official at a Michigan health care system that was running
short on beds and equipment. It was asking neighboring facilities to
share supplies or take in overflow patients if necessary.

“She said they were looking up the phone book up and down Highway 75 to
see if there were other places that could help,” Mr. Malaney recalled.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The disconnects in the public health record-keeping system delayed
sharing critical data that could help patients, said Dr. Thomas
Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Hospitals look to the C.D.C. for that information. “Is it higher risk to
be a healthy person at age 75 with coronavirus or a diabetic with the
disease at age 45?” Dr. Inglesby said. “We should have the data to know
the answer to this question quickly, and we should be using it to make
better
decisions.”

As the number of suspected cases — and deaths — mounted, the C.D.C.
struggled to record them accurately. The agency rushed to [hire extra
workers](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933941-2020-02-13-CDC-Hiring-Staff-to-Go-Through-Filings.html)
to process incoming emails from hospitals. Still, many officials turned
to Johns Hopkins University, which became the primary source for
[up-to-date counts](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map). Even the White
House cited its numbers instead of the C.D.C.’s lagging tallies.

Some staff members were mortified when [a Seattle
teenager](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/qa-avi-schiffmann-the-washington-state-teen-behind-a-coronavirus-website-with-millions-of-views/)
managed to compile coronavirus data faster than the agency itself,
creating a website that attracted millions of daily visitors. “If a high
schooler can do it, someone at C.D.C. should be able to do it,” said one
longtime employee.

For years, federal and state governments have not invested enough money
to insure that the nation’s public health system would have critical
data needed to respond in a pandemic. Since 2010, for example, grants to
help hospitals and states prepare for emergencies have declined.

In 2019, more than 100 public health groups [pressed congressional
leaders](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933952-2019-03-25-1-Billion-Over-10-Years-Needed-for.html)
to allocate $1 billion over a decade to upgrade the infrastructure. The
C.D.C. received $50 million toward the effort this year. Then, as
coronavirus cases and deaths mounted in March, the federal government
committed to $500 million under the emergency CARES Act.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The crisis has highlighted the need to continue efforts to modernize
the public health data systems that C.D.C. and states rely on,” Dr.
Redfield told a Senate committee on May 12. “Timely and accurate data
are essential as C.D.C. and the nation work to understand the impact of
Covid-19 on all
Americans.”

Data is one of the essential tools of public health; Mr. Trump, though,
often appears to see it as a weapon against him. He has suggested that
[testing is
“overrated”](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/14/trump-coronavirus-testing-high-case-numbers-259524)
and that it makes the United States look bad by increasing the number of
confirmed cases. **** He has seized on lower-end projections of the
virus’s toll, only to see them eclipsed as the cases and deaths rose.

Recently, the C.D.C. drew criticism after [media reports
disclosed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/us/politics/coronavirus-tests-cdc.html)
that in tracking how many Americans had been tested, the agency had
breached standard practice by combining data from antibody tests, which
can indicate past infections, with diagnostic tests. The agency said it
was caused by confusion in overworked state and local health officials
reporting results, but the mistake muddied the picture of the pandemic.

“The scientists at the C.D.C. are still great,” Dr. Jha said. “It’s very
puzzling to all of us why C.D.C. performance has been so poor.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury

Reporters soon were peppering the White House with questions about
whether it was overruling the C.D.C. Some of Mr. Trump’s aides shrugged
it off as a miscommunication. But others viewed it as the C.D.C.
insisting it knew best.

The episode underscored the strained relationship **** between the
health agency and the White House. Veteran officials at the C.D.C. were
not unfamiliar with the ways of Washington. But they had never dealt
with a president like Mr. Trump or a White House like his.

Already under siege for problems with the agency’s diagnostic test,
C.D.C. officials watched with growing alarm as Mr. Trump, facing
criticism for his administration’s response, repeatedly undermined the
agency.

Though the task force was occasionally ahead of the C.D.C. in its
cautions to the public, Mr. Trump and his aides often expressed
extraordinary skepticism about the coronavirus and the steps required to
combat it. He said the virus would disappear “[like a
miracle](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-african-american-leaders/)”
even as C.D.C. scientists described it as a real threat. When the C.D.C.
urged Americans to wear masks, he said, “[I don’t see it for
myself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/us/politics/melania-trump-coronavirus.html).”

And when Dr. Redfield [told The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/21/coronavirus-secondwave-cdcdirector/)that
a second wave of the virus could be “even more difficult” than the
first, Mr. Trump insisted that he publicly claim to have been misquoted
during a White House briefing. Dr. Redfield, with the president standing
next to him, scowling, said he had been misunderstood.

At one point, Mr. Trump even [complained about the
agency](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238410044263333894)
to his 80 million Twitter followers, saying, “For decades the
[@CDCgov](https://twitter.com/CDCgov) looked at, and studied, its
testing system, but did nothing about it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There comes a time,” said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, who served as C.D.C.
director in the Clinton and Bush administrations, “when it makes it very
hard to operate effectively, when things are being suggested, requested,
ordered that you think are contrary to the containment of the pandemic.”

The president and his aides viewed the civil servants at the C.D.C. —
many of whom had worked under presidents from both parties — as disloyal
liberals eager to wound Mr. Trump politically by leaking to the press.
In private, some senior administration officials began referring to
agency scientists as members of the “deep state,” according to several
people who participated in the conversations but requested anonymity to
discuss the meetings.

As the crisis deepened, tensions between Washington and Atlanta
increased.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In late February, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who oversees the C.D.C.’s
respiratory diseases center and had been leading the agency’s emergency
response, was sidelined after she issued a [stark
public](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html)
warning that the virus would disrupt American lives. The comments sent
stocks tumbling and infuriated Mr. Trump, who had not been told in
advance. Public health officials, inside and outside the agency, saw her
forced retreat as an effort to silence the truth.

Often, the clashes have centered on the economic consequences of
shutdowns, which have forced 40 million people into unemployment,
companies into bankruptcy and fueled resentment across the country.

In early April, [the C.D.C.
posted](https://web.archive.org/web/20200409221838/https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/index.html)
an extension of its “no sail” order for cruise ships, forbidding them
from operating through August and warning that the ban could become
indefinite. The White House had supported the original order, but
privately objected to an indefinite ban, fearing lasting harm to an
industry that employs tens of thousands of people.

The posting quickly came down, replaced by an order ending the ban in
July. “Those things aren’t helpful,” Dr. Redfield would tell his
colleagues when disputes between the C.D.C. and the task force erupted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The White House was soon put on the defensive when [USA
Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/04/13/coronavirus-cruise-ships-saw-red-flags-amid-chaotic-federal-response/2937001001/)
cited internal emails about the pressure. “Sorry to do this, but the
Office of the Vice President has instructed us to pull the No Sail Order
Extension from the website immediately,” the paper quoted a C.D.C.
official as writing to agency
colleagues.

To the president’s aides, one of the most frustrating moments came on
May 1, when Dr. Schuchat published one of the agency’s regular reports
on morbidity and mortality without giving the White House any notice,
according to two of Mr. Trump’s advisers.

Written in dry, scientific language, the report offered [a blunt
assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6918e2.htm?s_cid=mm6918e2_w)
of the virus’s spread, showing how travel from Europe and mass
gatherings had accelerated it. Dr. Schuchat went further when
interviewed for an [Associated
Press](https://apnews.com/a758f05f337736e93dd0c280deff9b10) article —
“Health Official Says U.S. Missed Some Chances to Slow Virus” — ****
saying that “taking action earlier could have delayed further
amplification.”

As the president pushed governors to
“[liberate](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130)”
their states from virus lockdowns, top C.D.C. officials in April
delivered a draft of new guidance full of caveats about lifting the
restrictions. In it, the agency urged schools, churches, child care
centers, day camps, restaurants and bars to take numerous precautions
and move slowly.

Trump aides were furious when they saw the draft. To them, it was more
evidence that the C.D.C. refused to consider political, economic and
social effects in weighing how and when to reopen the country. The
agency’s recommendations for houses of worship particularly annoyed some
aides, who resisted the advice that churches stop giving communion.

When the White House sat on the draft guidance for weeks, a copy was
leaked.

While the C.D.C. delayed posting the draft guidance that would allow
churches to reopen, Mr. Trump all but ordered it to do so. During a
visit to Michigan on May 21, the president — who the next day would
explain, “In America, we need more prayer, not less” — made it clear the
C.D.C. no longer had any choice.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I said, ‘You better put it out,’” Mr. Trump [told
reporters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/05/21/health/ap-us-med-virus-outbreak-churches-reopening.html).
“And they’re doing it.”

A suggestion in the guidance that houses of worship “consider
suspending” the use of choirs and congregant singing because it “may
contribute to transmission” was removed. Two federal officials said it
had not been cleared by the White House.

Lawrence Gostin, the director of a legal center at the World Health
Organization, and a former C.D.C. official, chided the White House for
exerting undue pressure on the C.D.C. throughout the crisis.

“Public health is politics. But this is different,” he said. “It’s
criticizing its public health agencies in public. It’s rejecting
guidelines it puts out. It tells them you can’t even put guidelines
out.”

“I would expect the C.D.C. to coordinate with the White House,” he
added. “But this is not team work. This is not coordination. This is
confrontation.”

## Where’s the Guidance?

As the battle against the coronavirus stretches into summer and the
United States lurches toward restarting its economy, the mayor of Miami
Beach wants to know what to do if Covid-19 cases explode after the
city’s famous beaches open again.

Doctors and nurses remain desperate for updates on how to protect
themselves. School superintendents and college presidents need to decide
how to hold classes in the fall. And employers want advice about
[whether to test all of their
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/business/employers-coronavirus-testing.html)
before returning to business as usual.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C. is where they expect to get answers. As the national
clearinghouse for critical public health information, it has dual
missions: to provide medical guidance to health workers while offering
easy-to-understand information for political leaders, business
executives and the general public.

But many say the agency has struggled at times to provide clear and
timely guidance.

At Margaret Mary Community Hospital in rural Batesville, Ind., doctors
and nurses got sick after following C.D.C. guidance in mid-March that
masks were necessary only when treating patients with respiratory
symptoms or fever. The first patients who tested positive for Covid-19
there instead showed up with headaches, fatigue, nausea and diarrhea.

“This virus made it halfway around the world without us having a
heads-up to our providers that this is how the disease can present,”
said Tim Putnam, the hospital’s chief executive. “Over two months after
the disease surfaced, I would have expected better.”

Front-line doctors and nurses have long relied on the agency for advice
on clinical best practices, and many said in interviews that they were
satisfied with the C.D.C.’s advisories, especially given the novelty of
the coronavirus.

The agency has issued [114 advisory
documents](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/guidance-list.html?Sort=Date%3A%3Adesc)
for disaster and homeless shelters, retirement communities, taxis,
pediatric clinics and other venues. “We have issued countless guidance
and recommendations based on the best available science and data,” an
agency press officer said. Its experts have also held about a dozen
[calls for
clinicians](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2020/index.asp) about
caring for Covid patients, and other calls for medical groups.

But in interviews with medical practitioners across the country, many
said they now look elsewhere for detailed recommendations about how to
safely care for infected patients, posing questions about the new virus
on mailing lists or scouring online research articles.

In a crisis, one of the C.D.C.’s main roles is to explain its guidance
and reasoning, provide a rationale for when its thinking changes and
acknowledge what it does not know. The agency’s routine in past
emergencies was to hold press briefings almost daily; Dr. Thomas
Frieden, Dr. Redfield’s predecessor, was highly visible during the Ebola
and Zika crises. But in this case, medical workers and the public were
left to make sense of often-opaque postings on the C.D.C.’s website
after ​its leadership stopped holding regular briefings on March 9.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Right now, they only have the PDFs that are out there, without any kind
of a conversation,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns
Hopkins. “That is a real shortcoming.”

Medical specialty and public health organizations have sometimes taken
it on themselves to identify and highlight updates for their members.

“It would be awesome if C.D.C. could actually announce significant
changes rather than bury it on their website and assume it is done,” Jim
Collins, Michigan’s director of communicable diseases, complained to his
colleagues in an email on Jan.
31.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C., some medical workers complain, has provided limited guidance
on how children transmit the virus, when to ventilate patients and how
to prioritize use of isolation rooms. And it took until April 27 for the
agency to expand its list of possible symptoms to include more than a
dozen signs of illness that some medical specialty societies had
reported weeks earlier.

To many anxious doctors and nurses, some of the C.D.C.’s clinical
guidance often seemed driven by the nationwide shortages of personal
protective equipment, not the best interests of health care workers.

Initially, the C.D.C. recommended that all doctors and nurses coming in
contact with coronavirus patients wear N95 respirators, which filter out
95 percent of all airborne particles. [But on
March 10](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/10/face-mask-shortage-prompts-cdc-loosen-coronavirus-guidance/),
with supplies dwindling, the C.D.C. announced that less protective
surgical masks were “an acceptable alternative” except during procedures
that might aerosolize the virus. [Days
later](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-21/coronavirus-mask-bandanna-covid-19-bandanna),
the agency
[said](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html)
health workers could even wear “homemade masks (e.g., bandanna, scarf)
for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mistrust crept in,” said Lori Freeman, chief executive of the National
Association of County and City Health Officials. “‘Are we really being
protected?’”

The relaxed guidance on protective equipment matched advice from the
World Health Organization on surgical masks. But the C.D.C. did not
highlight that fact in its update and gave no public explanation other
than acknowledging the worsening shortages. An analysis published this
week suggests that N95 and other respirator masks are superior to
surgical or cloth masks in [protecting medical
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/health/masks-surgical-N95-coronavirus.html)
against the virus.

Leaders of schools, businesses and other organizations also said they
were confused by the C.D.C.’s advice, which sometimes conflicted with
that of the White House coronavirus task force.

In one such instance on March 16, the White House urged limiting
gatherings to no more than 10 people and “schooling from home whenever
possible” for at least the next 15 days. But days earlier, the C.D.C.
had
[recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-schools.html)that
schools close only if someone in the building tested positive or there
was evidence of “substantial community transmission.”

On March 17, nearly 2,500 superintendents from around the country were
hoping to get some clarity during an [online
seminar](https://www.aasa.org/content.aspx?id=44539) with the C.D.C. Why
was the C.D.C. recommending most schools could remain open?

But just 40 minutes before the seminar was to start, the C.D.C.
[canceled
it](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933965-2020-03-17-Superintendents-Briefing.html)
without explanation and never rescheduled. The agency [later told
reporters](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/817606520/coronavirus-closes-schools-its-unclear-when-students-will-return)
it had decided “to fully adapt to the new guidance from White House”
before addressing the superintendents.

In Miami Beach, densely packed with tourists, older residents and
service workers, Mayor Dan Gelber dreads the prospect of new outbreaks.
While he appreciated the reopening guidance that the C.D.C. published
recently, Mr. Gelber, a Democrat, said he wished the agency would also
lay out specific steps to follow if cases surge
again.
